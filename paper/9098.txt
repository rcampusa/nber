Socioeconomic Status and Health: Why is the Relationship Stronger for Older Children?

NBER Working Paper No. 9098
August 2002
JEL No. I1


                                                ABSTRACT

        Case, Lubotsky, and Paxson (2001) show that the well-known relationship between socio-
economic status (SES) and health exists in childhood and grows more pronounced with age. However,
in cross-sectional data it is difficult to distinguish between two possible explanations. The first is that low-
SES children are less able to respond to a given health shock. The second is that low SES children
experience more shocks. We show, using panel data on Canadian children that: 1) the gradient we
estimate in the cross section is very similar to that estimated previously using U.S. children; 2) both high
and low-SES children recover from past health shocks to about the same degree; and 3) that the
relationship between SES and health grows stronger over time mainly because low-SES children receive
more negative health shocks. In addition, we examine the effect of health shocks on math and reading
scores. We find that health shocks affect test scores and future health in very similar ways. Our results
suggest that public policy aimed at reducing SES-related health differentials in children should focus on
reducing the incidence of health shocks as well as on reducing disparities in access to palliative care.

        The relationship between socioeconomic status and health is one of the most robust and

well documented findings in social science.     However, the reasons for the relationship are less

clear since plausible causal mechanisms run in both directions. Case, Lubotsky, and Paxson

(2001) look at children in order to find the “origins of the gradient”, since the health of children

may be assumed to have relatively little impact on their own socioeconomic status.        They show

that the well-known cross-sectional relationship between SES and health exists in childhood and

is more pronounced among older than among younger children. Since poor health in childhood is

likely to affect adult well-being directly through its effects on health, and indirectly through its

effects on other forms of human capital accumulation, it is important to try to address the causes

of SES-related gradients in health status among children.

        However, in a cross-section it is not possible to distinguish between two different possible

mechanisms underlying a steepening gradient. On the one hand, it is possible that low-SES

children are less able to respond to a given health shock, so that the negative effects of health

shocks persist and accumulate over time. This model would imply that low-SES children are in

need of better medical care so that they can respond to health shocks in the same way as higher-

SES children. On the other hand, it is possible that low-SES children respond to health shocks in

a way that is similar to high-SES children, but are just subject to more shocks. This model

implies that SES-related gradients can be reduced by addressing the reasons why low-SES

children are more likely to be subject to health shocks. This distinction is important for policy

because it implies that it may be productive to spend social resources on measures designed to

reduce the arrival rate of health shocks as well as continuing to improve children’s access to

palliative medical care.


                                                   1
       We examine these hypotheses using a panel of data on Canadian children from the

National Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY). We confirm that the gradient steepens in

cross-section, and show that this result is robust to controls for cohort effects. However, we find

little evidence that the long-term effects of health shocks on future health are different for high-

SES and low-SES children, even though in the short run, low-SES children suffer greater health

losses than high-SES children after the arrival of a health shock. Hence, we infer that the cross-

sectional relationship between health, income (or maternal education), and age arises primarily

because low income children are more likely to be subject to health shocks

       In addition to the negative effects of poor child health on health in later life, it is possible

that poor health disadvantages children by affecting their cognitive and/or academic functioning.

We examine this hypothesis directly by utilizing information about the mathematics and reading

test scores of children in our sample. These estimates indicate that poor health in childhood has

negative effects on children’s test scores and positive effects on the probability that they have

repeated grades even some years later. However, although we find some evidence that higher

maternal education reduces the immediate negative effect of health shocks, we find little evidence

that the long-term effects of poor health or health shocks differs by SES.

       The rest of the paper proceeds as follows: Section 1 provides some background regarding

the relationship between SES and health. Sections 2 and 3 provide an overview of the data and

methods. Results appear in Section 4, and Section 5 offers some concluding remarks.




                                                   2
1. Background Regarding the Relationship Between SES and Health

       There is a vast literature documenting the relationship between socio-economic status and

health (see Marmot and Wilkinson, 1999 for a review).       However, it has been difficult to

determine whether the relationship exists primarily because health affects socioeconomic status,

whether socioeconomic status has a direct impact on health, or whether both are affected by some

third factor (such as rate of time preferences, c.f. Fuchs (1982)). Deaton and Paxson (1999a,b)

emphasize the difficulty of inferring a causal relationship from aggregate cross-country or cross-

state data, as has been done in many previous studies. Smith (1998) proposes that it may be

difficult to find a single correct answer to this question of causality since SES may affect health in

childhood, while the direction of causality may run the other way among adults. Deaton and

Paxson (1999b) present some evidence regarding the SES-health relationship among U.S.

adolescents, while Power and Matthew (1997) and Ford et al. (1994) have investigated health-

SES gradients among adolescents in the United Kingdom and in Scotland, respectively. All but

Ford et al. find the expected positive relationship.

       However, other than Case, Lubotsky and Paxson (CLP), we know of no other study that

examines the way that the relationship between SES and health changes with age among children.

In a related study, Currie and Hyson (1999) ask whether the long run impact of low birthweight

differs with socioeconomic status in a cohort of British children born in 1958. They found that

while low birthweight had a persistent negative impact on a range of outcomes, there was little

evidence that its effects varied with socioeconomic status, though low-SES children were more

likely to suffer from low birthweight to begin with.

       This latter finding is consistent with a great deal of evidence that low-SES children are


                                                  3
more likely to suffer negative health shocks than high-SES children. For example, Newacheck et

al. (1994) show that poor children are more likely than better-off children to suffer from a wide

array of chronic conditions, while the Institute of Medicine (1999) reports that low-SES children

are more likely to suffer from virtually all types of accidental injuries than higher-SES children,

accidents being the leading cause of morbidity and death among children.

       There is also a good deal of evidence that ill health in childhood affects adult health and

SES through multiple pathways. For example David Barker and his collaborators (c.f. Eriksson et

al. 2001; Forsen et al, 1999) emphasize the link between nutrition in the prenatal period and early

childhood and adult heart disease. Marmot and Wadsworth (1997) review the literature linking

these and many other child health outcomes to health in adulthood.

       Beyond the direct connection between poor health in childhood and health in adulthood,

poor health in childhood could affect adult well-being through its impact on educational

attainment. Grossman (1997) provides a summary of this literature, and concludes that school

missed because of ill health accounts for some but not all of the effect. Currie (2000) provides a

review of literature linking anthropometric measures of child health to cognitive deficits. Given

this literature, it is plausible that educational attainment may also be limited in some cases by the

direct effects of poor health on cognitive functioning.

       The extent to which the existence of public health insurance mitigates the effects of SES

on health is an unresolved issue. The famous Black report in Great Britain concluded that the

relationship between SES and health became more pronounced following the introduction of

National Health Insurance, but it is possible that the differential would have widened even further

in the absence of National Health. Similarly, previous research using Canadian data indicates that


                                                  4
there is a significant relationship between health and household income even though Canadians

have universal health insurance (c.f. Curtis et al., 2001).

       Currie (1995) shows that recent expansions of U.S. public health insurance programs to

previously ineligible children narrowed socio-economic gaps in the utilization of medical care and

health among children, although significant SES-related gaps remain even among children with

common insurance status. Hence, the available evidence indicates that while public health

insurance narrows SES-related gaps in health status, it does not eliminate them. It is, therefore, of

interest to examine the way that the gradient varies with child age in this sample of Canadian

children.



2. Data

       We use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY). The

NLSCY is a Canadian national longitudinal data set which surveyed children ages 0-11 and their

families beginning in 1994. 1 Follow up surveys were conducted in 1996 and 1998. The initial

sample consisted of 22,831 children in 1994. We restrict our sample to those children who were

surveyed in each of the three survey years (14,169 children).

       The NLSCY collects detailed information on the health and demographics of the child.

While the older children are asked a small number of questions, the majority of the survey,

including the questions used in our analysis, is answered by the person most knowledgeable about

the child (the PMK). Demographic, labor force, income, and health information are also collected



       1
            The survey included siblings, though we have not used this feature of the data in our
analyses.

                                                   5
for the PMK and the spouse of the PMK. In most cases (92%) the PMK is also the child’s

mother. However, the PMK need not be the mother and need not be the same person in each

survey. Because of this potential complication, we determine the education level of the mother

using information about the PMK and the spouse of the PMK in all three survey years. We

measure mother’s education as follows: when the child’s mother is also the PMK or the child’s

mother is the spouse of the PMK we use this information to calculate the mother’s education.

When no biological mother is present in the family in any of the three survey years we use the next

closest female parent figure as the basis for calculating the mother’s education. We then include

dummy variables for the female parent figure being other than the biological mother, and/or for

the PMK being other than the biological mother in all our analyses.

       We use total household income as our measure of income. In cases where the household

income is not reported, the NLSCY imputes household income from individual income sources

or, in a small number of cases, from other demographic information. We therefore have a

measure of household income for every child in our sample. We include a dummy variable for the

imputation of household income in all our analyses. We also re-estimated all our analyses omitting

individuals for whom income had been imputed in order to be sure that there was nothing peculiar

about the income imputation process. Our analyses are robust to these checks.

       The NLSCY contains a rich set of health related questions. The primary measure is the

PMK-reported health status of the child. The PMK is asked to rate the health of the child on a

scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being poor and 5 being excellent. We define poor health as the bottom

three measures on this scale. We also use information on the child’s chronic conditions (these

include allergies, asthma, heart disease, bronchitis, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, kidney troubles,


                                                  6
mental troubles, learning disabilities, psychological disabilities, and a category for other chronic

conditions), information on whether the child was hospitalized in the past year, and whether the

child is limited in the types of activity he or she can do. Since asthma is by far the most common

chronic condition, we examine the incidence of asthma separately in some of our analyses.

       It is likely that all self-reported measures of health status suffer from some biases (c.f.

Baker, Stabile, and Deri, 2001), and some of these biases may vary with socio-economic status.

For example, mothers who are in poor health themselves may be more likely to report that their

child is in ill health. Or, children of higher SES may be more likely to be diagnosed given that

they have chronic conditions. Similarly, mothers may vary in their assessment of whether a child

has activity limitations or is need of doctor visits or even hospitalization. We take an agnostic

view about which measures of child health are “best” and examine the full range of available

measures. We also verify that the self-reported measures of health have content by showing that

they are related to objectively measured test scores.

       The NLSCY collects information on both math and reading test scores. Math and reading

tests were administered in schools to children in grades two through ten. Of the 9,542 children

eligible to receive the tests, 86 percent of parents consented to have the school board administer

the tests and 97 percent of school boards consented to conduct the tests. However, due to

administrative problems, only 65 percent of the administered tests were returned to Statistics

Canada in 1998. Therefore, of the original 9,542 children eligible to take the test, we have test

scores for only 5,153 children.2   Statistics Canada has conducted an analysis of the nonresponse,


       2
         The response rate for the 1996 was significantly higher (closer to 75 percent). Using the
1996 test scores rather than the 1998 test scores yields results that are qualitatively similar to
those reported below.

                                                  7
and finds that there is very little difference between responders and nonresponders along

observable dimensions (such as gender, type of school, whether the children had ever repeated a

grade, or the importance that the PMK attaches to education).

       The math test was a shortened version of the Canadian Achievement Test Center’s

Mathematical Operations test, second edition. It measures the student’s ability to do addition,

subtraction, multiplication and division on whole numbers, decimals, fractions, negatives, and

exponents. Problem solving using percentages and the order of operations was also measured.

A separate version of the test was constructed for each grade level (except for 9 and 10 which

received the same test). The 1998 test included 20 questions at each level (except for level 9-10

which had 15 questions) plus 5 questions selected from the test of the next higher level. The

reading comprehension test is also from the Canadian Achievement Test, second edition. Each

test consists of questions about two passages, which are designed to test the student’s ability to

recall information, identify the main idea, and analyze the passage.

       In order to avoid problems with test “ceilings”, children were given a short assessment at

home before they took the school tests. Children who scored perfectly on the home test, were

given the test of the next highest grade level. The scores were then scaled using national norms

from the Canadian Test Center. These procedures result in a distribution of test scores which is

quite bell-shaped. In our empirical analysis, we analyze the probability that a child scored in the

bottom quintile of this standardized test score distribution. This cutoff was chosen to allow us to

focus on children who were low scoring.

       Table 1a shows means for the main variables used in our analysis across the three survey

years. The average age of the children in the sample was 4.9 years in 1994. Household income, in


                                                  8
1998 dollars (Canadian), averaged $50,000. Twelve percent of children were reported to be in

poor health. Nineteen percent of the children reported suffering from asthma, and 26 percent

reported having some chronic conditions. The incidence of poor health and activity limitations

remain fairly constant across the survey years, while the incidence of asthma drops slightly as the

children age (consistent with the literature on the incidence of asthma)3 and the use of medical

services falls. However, the likelihood that the child has any chronic condition increases with age,

as one might expect if chronic conditions represent cumulative, permanent health shocks.

       Table 1b shows the incidence of chronic conditions across different reported health states.

Among those in poor health in 1998, 43 percent had at least one chronic condition in 1994 and 42

percent developed a new chronic condition between 1994 and 1998. Among those not in poor

health, only 24 percent reported a chronic condition in 1994 and 18 percent developed a new

condition by 1998. The pattern is similar among children with asthma in 1998, and among children

with activity limitations. Overall, 26 percent of children reported having a chronic condition in

1994 and 21 percent of children developed a new chronic condition between 1994 and 1998.



3. Methods

       The health status of children is assumed to evolve over time as follows. Children are born

with an initial health stock, H0. Children receive shocks to their health in the form of chronic

conditions, diseases requiring hospitalization, or other shocks. SES contributes to the ability of a

family to both detect and treat a chronic condition in the short run. In the longer-run, the effects



       3
           In many cases, asthma symptoms decrease at puberty as airways become larger and more
mature.

                                                  9
of the bad health shock dissipate (with treatment) and the health of a child can be partially

restored. We assume that while children can come close to returning to health stock H0, they do

not completely return to their original level. This conceptual model is consistent with models

which treat health as a depreciating stock (c.f. Grossman, 2000), which must remain above a

minimum level for survival, and which can be augmented by investment on the part of the

individual (or family).

        In this simple model, two things differentiate the health of low-SES children from the

health of high-SES children. First, low-SES children may not deal with bad health shocks as

effectively as high-SES children in the short-run. This may be due to information problems, or to

resource constraints which cause delays in treatment or less effective treatment. Second, low-

SES children may receive more health shocks than high SES children. This may be due to

differences in lifestyle and/or environmental factors such as poor housing quality, lack of

preventative care, inadequate nutrition, etc. Therefore, the health status of low-SES children

remains lower than the health status of higher-SES children although low-SES children would

eventually catch up to high-SES children if both types received only a single bad health shock.

Figure 1 shows the stylized time-pattern of the health stock for low and high-SES children.

        The following predictions emerge from this highly simplified model. First, there will be a

positive relationship between SES and health. Second, with the arrival of any bad health shock,

high-SES children and their families respond more quickly, and hence begin to recover more

quickly, mitigating the effect of the bad health shock. Third, the relationship between SES and

health will grow stronger as children age. This is primarily due to the higher arrival rate of chronic

conditions for low-SES children. Fourth, bad health shocks in the past may affect health today if


                                                 10
children do not fully recover from a negative shock. Fifth, the effects of past negative health

shocks will not necessarily be mitigated by SES, since after a certain amount of time, low-SES

children respond and begin to restore their health in the same way as high-SES children do.

        In order to test the implications of our model, we begin by graphing the relationship

between health measures, age, and SES.            To obtain these figures, we pool data from the three

waves of the survey. Figures 2a-2e show the distribution of our various health measures by age

and whether income is above or below the Canadian low income cutoff4. The incidence of poor

health is higher at every age for those children below the low-income cutoff, as shown in Figure

2a. Although we do not show the incidence of poor health by maternal education, the patterns

are similar in that children with more highly educated mothers have a lower incidence of poor

health at all ages. While there is a good deal of variation in the incidence of poor health among

low-income children, it does appear that the gap between low and high income children widens

with age, consistent with the hypothesis of a steepening gradient. It also appears that this is due

primarily to increases in poor health among low-income children, since there is little evidence of

an increase in poor health by age among higher income children.

        The number of chronic conditions is shown by age and high or low-income in Figure 2b.

Consistent with the model above, the number of chronic conditions reported rises over time for

both high and low-income children. Among children aged 0 to 10, low-income children always

have a higher number of chronic conditions, on average, than higher-income children. The

incidence of asthma is higher for low income children though it declines over time.



        4
          The low income cut-off is calculated by Statistics Canada and is based on income, location of residence,
and family composition.

                                                        11
Hospitalizations are also consistently higher for low-income children, and again decline over time.

Similarly, activity limitations are higher for low-income children, and while the pattern is not as

clear as it is for poor self-reported health, the relationship does appear to steepen slightly with

age. In summary, these graphs are consistent with the model presented above in that they show

both a steepening gradient and a higher incidence of bad health shocks for lower-income children.

       In order to investigate these relationships in a multivariate context, we first estimate

models pooling the three waves of data. Estimates obtained from these regression models will

be qualitatively similar to those obtained using cross-sectional data, since we make no attempt to

use the panel nature of the data in these initial estimations (though we do correct the standard

errors for clustering due to repeated observations on the same child). These regressions take the

following form:

(1) healthi = α + β inc * agei + γ ln(inc) i + π edui + agei + t t + δ X i + birthi + ε i ,


where health is a measure of child health, inc*age is the interaction between the log of family

income and age. Ln(inc) is log family income, edu is a set of dummies for mother’s education (less

than high school, high school, some college, college), age is a complete set of age dummies, t is a

set of time dummies, and birth is a set of birth year cohort dummies. In alternative specifications,

we interact maternal education, rather than income, with child age.

       We focus on family income and maternal education as two key indicators of SES, while

the age and cohort dummies are intended to capture both changes in child behavior with age, and

factors such as changes in the availability of treatments that might affect different cohorts. The

vector X includes the log of family size, a dummy variable for the sex of the child, a dummy

variable for having a PMK that is not the biological mother, a dummy variable for having a female

                                                  12
PMK, a dummy variable for having two parents, a dummy variable for having imputed family

income and the mother’s age at birth. These variables are intended to capture other

characteristics of the family which could affect child health. The subscript i denotes the individual

child.

         Previous work suggests that estimation of (1) should yield evidence of a health-SES

gradient that increases with child age. That is, the coefficients on income, maternal education,

and the interaction terms should all be positive (in the case where the dependent variable is poor

health, these coefficients will be negative). We estimate this model using several different

measures of child health, allowing us to observe the age pattern of child health status for various

conditions.

         We next exploit the panel nature of the data by estimating models of the following form:

   health98 = α + β shock 94 + χ shock 98
            i                   i          i
2)
   + δ ln(inc) + φ inc * shock + γ edu + age + λ X + ε
              i               i       i      i    i    i



where health98 is a measure of child health in 1998, shock denotes a health shock in the indicated

year and the other variables are defined as above. This specification allows us to test directly for

differential effects of current and past health shocks by SES. By distinguishing between past

shocks and more recent ones, we can also ask whether any differential effects of health shocks by

SES persist over time, or, whether given enough time, high-SES and low-SES children respond

similarly to health shocks.

         We modify equation (2) above to examine the effects of poor health on test scores.



                                                 13
In these models, our dependent variable is an indicator variable equal to one if the child has a low

test score (defined as a score in the lowest quintile) and zero otherwise. Using a zero/one

indicator makes it easier to compare results estimated using these measures to those obtained

using dichotomous measures of health status We regress this measure of low test scores on a

dummy variable for being in poor health, our controls for SES, and interactions between the two.

We also include other controls as outlined above.



4. Results

a) Effects of Health Shocks on Health Status

       Estimates of equation (1) are presented in Table 2. The first panel shows models which

include interactions between income and child age, while the second panel shows models that

include interactions between maternal education and child age.     Models are estimated using three

different health measures: whether the child was in poor health, whether the child was hospitalized

in the past year, and whether the child had a chronic condition.

        The first 2 columns of Table 2 indicate that family income is negatively and significantly

correlated with being in poor health, as is maternal education (measured using a dummy variable

equal to one if the mother has more than high school). The interaction between log income and

age is also negative and significant, confirming Case, Lubotsky, and Paxson’s result that the

gradient steepens over time for a parent-reported poor health measure in children.

       Column 2 includes controls for cohort of birth. These dummy variables do not enter

significantly into the model and have no effect on the other coefficients of interest, suggesting that

there is no strong trend in poor health across cohorts. Interacting age with mother’s education


                                                 14
instead of log family income also produced a negative coefficient but this coefficient is smaller

and is no longer significant at traditional levels. These results are reported in the lower panel of

columns 1 and 2.

       The third through sixth columns of Table 2 report estimates of similar specifications using

whether or not the child has had any hospitalizations and whether the child has any chronic

conditions (including asthma) as the dependent variable. Once again we find that children of low

income are more likely to be hospitalized or to suffer from chronic conditions than higher income

children. This is consistent with the hypothesis that low-income children receive a greater number

of health shocks. However, using these alternative measures of health we do not find that the

relationship between income and health becomes more pronounced as the children age. In fact,

the interaction between income and age is significantly positive in the model of hospitalizations.

Again, we report these results using both income and mother’s education as measures of SES.

The results are similar, though weaker, when we use maternal education rather than income as the

measure of SES.

       The estimates in columns (1) and (2) are not directly comparable to those in CLP, since

CLP report ordered probits in which the health status variable varies from 1 (excellent) to 5

(poor), and they estimate separate models for different age groups. We have replicated this

approach in Appendix Table 1. This table shows that the protective effect of income rises with

child age in this sample of Canadian children in a very similar way to that shown in CLP.       For

example, in CLP’s first specification (without maternal education) the key coefficient on log

income falls by .140 as they move from 0 to 3 year olds to 13 to 15 year olds. In the comparable

model estimated using our data set, the same coefficient falls by .121. Once education is included


                                                  15
in the model, our gradient actually steepens somewhat more rapidly than that estimated by CLP.

Thus, the fact that Canadian children have universal health insurance appears to have little effect

on the steepening of the SES-health gradient.

        Estimates of equation (2) are presented in Table 3. These models exploit the panel nature

of the data by examining the temporal effects of health shocks. The first column of Table 3

reports estimates using poor health in 1998 as the dependent variable and examining the effect of

past health shocks by including a dummy variable for whether the child had a chronic condition in

1994.   The coefficient on this variable is positive and statistically significant. It is also quite

large, suggesting that having a chronic condition in 1994 increases the probability that a child is

reported to be in poor health in 1998 by 11 percentage points. Log family income is negative and

significant suggesting that higher income lowers the probability of reporting poor health, even

conditional on having a long-standing chronic condition. Since we observe three measures of

household income for each child, we take the log of average household income over the three

years as a proxy for permanent income. We have also estimated the model using one or more

years of income data as individual controls and the results are robust to the measure of income

used. Mother’s education is also negative and significant.

        The second column of Table 3 includes a dummy variable for whether a child developed a

new chronic condition between 1994 and 1998 (this amounts to developing a new condition in

1996 or 1998 but our results are robust to restricting this to a new condition in 1998). The

coefficient on a new chronic condition is positive and significant, and much larger than the

coefficient for having a condition in 1994, suggesting that the immediate effects of a newly

developed chronic condition are larger than the effects of past health shocks. Both family income


                                                   16
and mother’s education are negative and significant, as expected.

       The model shown in column (3) includes an interaction term between the chronic

condition in 1994 and family income, so that we can see if the effects of a past health shock differ

with income.    This interaction is not statistically significant suggesting that SES does not affect

the extent to which a past health shock affects the child’s health today. On the other hand, the

model shown in column (4) includes an interaction between having a new chronic condition and

income. This interaction is significant and negative, indicating that the negative effects of new

chronic conditions are mitigated by income.

       Finally, column (5) includes measures for chronic conditions in 1994 and developing a

new chronic condition between 1994 and 1998, as well as the interaction between income and

having a new chronic condition. These estimates suggest that a new chronic condition has a

much greater effect on health than an old one, and that income mitigates the effect of the new

condition, but not the effects of old conditions.

       The bottom panel of Table 3 repeats these analyses using mother’s education as the

measure of SES.    The results are qualitatively similar, although the difference between the effect

of new and old chronic conditions on current health status is not as large.

       The estimates in Table 3 suggest that low-SES individuals are less able to deal with newly

arrived health shocks, but that the long-term effects of these shocks do not differ by SES. Both

rich and poor children appear to suffer long-term negative consequences from chronic conditions.

       In order to explore the robustness of this pattern to alternative measures of health, we

estimate similar models using both narrower and broader measures of health shocks. Specifically,

we first focus on a diagnosis of asthma as a narrower and more specific measure of a health


                                                    17
shock. Asthma is the leading chronic disease of children in industrialized countries. Asthma is

also the biggest cause of hospitalisation and health related absenteeism among children (Millar and

Hill, 1998). Left untreated, the long-term costs and consequences of asthma are severe (Ungar

and Coyte, 2001). As a broader measure of a health shock, we combine chronic conditions and

hospitalizations. This broader measure allows for the fact that children may suffer long-term

consequences from acute conditions, such as illness or accidents, as well as from chronic

conditions.

       Estimates using an indicator equal to one if the child had asthma are presented in Table 4.

The model shown in column (1) indicates that having been diagnosed with asthma by 1994 has a

significant negative effect on reported health status in 1998. Similarly, column (2) shows that

developing asthma between 1994 and 1998 worsens reported health. Column (3) confirms that

there is no relationship between income and the effect of a health shock in 1994, whereas, column

(4) shows that income does help to protect against the effects of a more recent diagnosis. Finally,

column (5) confirms that this pattern of results for recent health shocks holds up when asthma in

1994 is included in the model. We repeated the analysis including interactions between mother’s

education and the asthma indicators rather than the interactions with income, and got very similar

estimates.

       Table 5 presents estimates which use both whether a child had a chronic condition and

whether a child was hospitalized in the past year as a measure of a health shock. The qualitative

pattern of estimates is virtually identical to that shown in Table 3 and Table 4. While negative

health shocks in 1994 affect the probability of being in poor health in 1998, there is no differential

effect by SES. Further, current health shocks have a much larger effect on poor health than past


                                                  18
shocks, and higher-SES families are better able to cope with shocks in the short term.

       We also estimated similar models for the incidence of very low birthweight, defined as

birthweight less than 1500 grams. Only .8% of our sample children were very low birthweight.

We found that while very low birthweight increased the probability that a child was in poor health

in 1998 significantly (by six percent), the main effect of very low birthweight became statistically

insignificant (though larger) when we included an interaction between very low birthweight and

log income or maternal education. Hence, we are unable to say definitively whether the effect of

very low birthweight is mitigated by SES.     If we include our measure of new chronic conditions

(developed between 1994 and 1998), we find once again that the effect of very low birthweight

remains statistically significant, and that SES mitigates the effects of these new conditions.

       In summary, the evidence is strikingly consistent with the predictions of our model. Low-

SES children are more likely to suffer health shocks than high-SES children. In the short-term,

they suffer more from these shocks than higher-SES children. However, over the longer-term,

both high-SES and low-SES children recover to the same extent from a given shock. Thus, the

worsening gradient observed in the cross-section is likely due to the higher arrival rate of shocks,

rather than to a lower recovery rate for SES children.



b) Effects of Health on Test Scores

       We now turn to investigate the effects of health shocks and poor health on child test

scores. Table 6 shows the effect of chronic conditions in 1994 and new chronic conditions in

1998 on the probability that a child is in the bottom quintile of the test score distribution in 1998.

The first two panels show estimates using math scores, while the second two show estimates


                                                  19
using reading scores. These estimates show that a child who was reported to have a chronic

condition in 1994 is 2 (.7) percentage points more likely to be in the bottom quartile of the math

(reading) test score distribution in 1998. Being diagnosed with a new chronic condition between

1994 and 1998 reduces math and reading scores by a much larger 3.7 and 3.1 percentage points

respectively.

        Higher income reduces the probability that a child has a low score, but interactions with

income are not statistically significant in the models for math scores. Models estimated using

maternal education as the measure of SES and including interactions with maternal education

show a pattern similar to that in Tables 3, 4, and 5 in that there is no significant interaction

between maternal education and having had a chronic condition in 1994, but there is a significant

negative interaction between having a new chronic condition and maternal education. Thus, it

appears that higher maternal education helps children to deal with new chronic conditions, but

that there is no interaction between SES and older chronic conditions, at least in terms of effects

on math scores.

        The story is different for reading scores, in that there is no evidence that chronic

conditions in 1994 affect reading scores in 1998. However, new chronic conditions have a

negative effect on scores, which is mitigated by both income and maternal education. In

summary, these estimates suggest that while new chronic conditions have a negative effect on test

scores, which is mitigated by socio-economic status, there is no relationship between SES and the

effects of older chronic conditions.

        Table 7 presents similar estimates using poor health, rather than chronic conditions, as the

measure of health shocks. These estimates are qualitatively similar to those in Table 6, with the


                                                  20
exception that poor health in 1994 is more strongly correlated with low test scores than chronic

conditions in 1994. Once again, we find that both high and low-SES children suffer similar long-

term consequences of health shocks in 1994, although SES protects against the effects of more

recent shocks.

       The estimates in Tables 6 and 7 also provide some support for the use of PMK-reported

measures of poor health and chronic conditions, since they show that these measures are

correlated with objectively measured test scores.



5. Discussion and Conclusions

       Case, Lubotsky, and Paxson study U.S. children, while we study a panel of Canadian

children. Given the fact that Canadian children have universal health insurance, it is interesting to

speculate on the extent to which our results might apply to American children. It is unfortunately

not possible to do a similar investigation using a panel of U.S. children. As Case, Lubotsky, and

Paxson note, the sample sizes available in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youths Child-

Mother file are too small to support this type of analysis in part because the relevant questions

were not asked to all children.5 However, the fact that our estimates of the steepening gradient in

the cross section are very similar to those obtained by CLP using U.S. data from other sources

suggests that our findings may apply to U.S. children.



       5
         Questions about chronic conditions were only asked to children who answered
affirmatively to several questions about activity limitations. It appears that high SES children
were more likely to make it through these screens, and hence to be asked about chronic
conditions. The question about general health status was asked only to children six and older,
limiting our ability to analyze it in this panel context. In contrast, in the NLSCY, all children
were asked about chronic conditions and health status.

                                                 21
       The main implication of our findings is that the health of low SES children worsens with

age, not so much because they lack the resources to respond to health shocks (though we do find

evidence that they respond more slowly) but because they are subject to more shocks. This

implies that policies that focus only on reducing gaps in access to palliative care, such as

expansions of public health insurance, are unlikely to fully close the SES-related gap in health.

Rather, it is important to understand and address the reasons for a higher arrival rate of health

shocks among low-SES children.

       In addition to distinguishing between the possible SES-related differences in responses to

shocks and SES-differentials in the arrival rate of shocks, we build on CLP by examining the

effect of health shocks on cognitive test scores. Our results suggest that health shocks have

effects on children’s cognitive functioning which parallel the negative effects that they have on

future health. Thus, we demonstrate two ways that health shocks in childhood are likely to affect

future SES, through their direct effects on future health, and by lowering academic performance.

Notes: Standard errors are in parentheses. Dependent variable is whether the child is in the lowest quintile of
the test score distribution in 1998. Other variables included in the regressions are: log of family size, dummy
variables for single age, sex, a dummy indicating that the PMK is not the biological mother, a dummy indicating
that the PMK is female, a dummy indicating that the child belongs to a two parent household, mother’s age at
the birth of the child and an indicator for the method of imputation for income used. * denotes the coefficient is
significant at the 10% level. ** denotes the coefficient is significant at the 5% level.
