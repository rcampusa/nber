                                           ABSTRACT

We examine entry across 113 national markets in 16 different industries using a comprehensive data

set of French manufacturing firms. The data are unique in indicating how much each firm exports

to each destination. Looking across all manufacturers: (1) Firms differ substantially in export

participation, with most selling only at home; (2) The number of firms selling to multiple markets

falls off with the number of destinations with an elasticity of n2.5; (3) Decomposing French exports
to each destination into the size of the market and French share, variation in market share translates

nearly completely into firm entry while about 60 percent of the variation in market size is reflected

in firm entry. Looking within each of 16 industries we find little variation in these patterns. We

propose that any successful model of trade and market structure must confront these facts.

   We examine the entry behavior of producers in diﬀerent industries in diﬀerent export

markets using a comprehensive data set of French firms. These data reveal enormous het-

erogeneity, primarily within industries, in the nature of market penetration. Nonetheless,

some striking regularities appear both across and within industries.

   The French data add a new dimension to an emerging empirical literature examining

international trade at the level of individual producers. James Tybout (2003) provides a

survey. This work has shown that: (i) exporters are in the minority; (ii) they tend to

be more productive and larger; (iii) yet they usually export only a small fraction of their

output.

   The findings that most firms do not export while those that do sell most of what they

make at home suggest substantial barriers to exporting. Theories of producer export behav-

ior have suggested either standard “iceberg” costs, e.g., Andrew Bernard et al. (2003), or

fixed costs, e.g., Mark Roberts and Tybout (1997) and Marc Melitz (2003), as explanations.

   Up to now our knowledge of the export behavior of individual producers has been

limited to knowing whether or not they export and how much they sell abroad if they do.

Without data on where producers sell it’s hard to untangle the nature of trade costs or

whether they apply simply to exporting at all or to entering individual foreign markets.

   The French data, in indicating where French firms export, are particularly enlightening

on these issues. They suggest a world in which national markets are highly fragmented,

and in which both fixed and unit costs of export play a role in separating them. Rather

than pursuing a particular explanation of firm export penetration, our purpose here is to

establish some key features of the data that any successful model of trade and market

structure must confront.


                                            1
1     The French Data

Pierre Biscourp and Kramarz (2002) describe how the French firm-level data are constructed

by merging customs and tax administration data sets. French customs record exports of

French firms to each of over 200 destinations. Our analysis here is based on data for 1986.

Table 1 presents our industry classification and compares features of the French firm data

with U.S. plant-level data taken from Bernard and J. Bradford Jensen (1995). Since the

U.S. data exclude the smallest plants, while the French data are virtually exhaustive, there

are more French producers, especially in light industries such as food and tobacco products.

But there are strong underlying similarities between the two countries not only in overall

export participation but also in the pattern across industries.



2     Dissection 1: Markets per Firm

Having seen the similarity between the French and U.S. data in terms of overall export

activity, we now look at the dimension unique to the French data: where individual firms

sell. Table 2 presents for each of our 16 industries the fraction of exporting firms shipping

to exactly 1 destination, to 10 or more, and to 50 or more. In each case, we report the

fraction of total exports that such firms represent. To summarize, across industries, the

modal exporter ships to only one foreign destination (most often Belgium), whereas exports

by the small fraction of firms that ship widely constitute a substantial share of total exports.

    Looking at all of manufacturing (excluding petroleum refining), Figure 1A plots the

frequency with which firms serve diﬀerent numbers of markets, including France itself (so

that nonexporters appear as having one market). The frequency with which more markets

are served declines smoothly and monotonically to the point where at most a single firm

                                               2
serves a very large number. Overall, the elasticity of the number of firms with respect to

the number of markets is roughly -2.5.

    The qualitative pattern is very much replicated industry by industry, although there are

distinct diﬀerences in the extent to which the frequency declines with number of markets.

Figures 1B reports patterns for four industries that reflect the gamut: food and tobacco,

lumber and furniture, chemicals, and electronic and electrical equipment. (To make the

plots more comparable across industries, frequency here is in terms of the fraction of firms

in the industry rather than firm count, with the fractions grouped by intervals of 10 markets

for market numbers exceeding 40.) Across all 16 industries, the decline is most precipitous

in light industries such as lumber and furniture, paper, and textiles and apparel and least

so in heavy industries such as chemicals and in high-tech industries such as machinery and

computer equipment. (Appendix Figure A1 displays results for all 16 industries.)



3     Dissection 2: Firms per Market

Having looked at the number of destinations across firms, we now examine the number

of firms across destinations. In order to match the French firm data to a measure of a

destination’s market size, we aggregate to 113 countries, including France. Our measure

of market n’s size is its absorption, Xn , defined as gross production plus imports minus

exports (in US$billions).1

    A standard approach to modeling bilateral trade volumes is the gravity equation, which

relates exports from i to n, Xni , to the market sizes of n and i and measures of the

geographic barriers between them, such as distance dni , e.g.:

                Xi Xn
      Xni = κ
                 dni

                                             3
(where κ is a constant reflecting units of measurement). In our situation the source is

always France (so i = F ), while we can summarize the role of geographic barriers with

France’s market share, λnF , giving us the identity:


     XnF ≡ λnF Xn .


   With our firm data we obtain an additional identity relating XnF to firm behavior:


     XnF ≡ NnF xnF


where NnF is the number of French firms selling in destination n, and xnF average sales

per firm there.2

   Figure 2 depicts a striking relationship among three elements of these two decomposi-

tions. On the horizontal axis is the market size measure Xn . On the vertical axis is the

number of French exporters divided by French market share (NnF /λnF ).3 When normalized

by French market share, the number of French firms selling increases systematically with

market size, but with an elasticity less than one.

   Another way to present this relationship is in terms of a regression of ln NnF on ln λnF

and ln Xn , yielding the coeﬃcients (with robust standard errors):

      ln NnF = 9.088 + .875 ln λnF + .617 ln Xn .
               (.150)  (.030)        (.021)

The R2 is .903.4 The implication is that, given market size, a higher French market share

in a destination typically reflects 88 percent more firms selling there and 12 percent more

sales per firm. Given market share, sales to a larger market reflect 62 percent more firms

and 38 percent more sales per firm.

   To what extent does this pattern of entry diﬀer for individual industries? We pursued

this question in a number of directions, all of which gave the same answer: not much. For

                                             4
                                                                         s
example, we decomposed France’s exports to destination n in industry s, XnF into: (i)

French market share λnF , (ii) absorption Xn , (both at the level of total manufacturing)
                                                              s     s
and (iii) the “industry bias” of French exports to market n, BnF = XnF /XnF , as well as
                                                                    s
into the number of French firms in industry s selling in market n, NnF , and their average

sales there, xsnF yielding:

              s     s     s
      λnF Xn BnF ≡ XnF ≡ NnF xsnF .

                                                s                              s
Extending our procedure above, we regressed ln NnF on ln λnF , ln Xn , and ln BnF for each

industry. While the diﬀerences in coeﬃcients are statistically significant, the magnitudes

of the diﬀerences are small with no clear economic significance. Hence we report a pooled

regression (with robust standard errors in parentheses, allowing for clustering by industry):5

           s                                                s
       ln NnF = 7.442 + .826 ln λnF + .585 ln Xn + .418 ln BnF .
                (.258)  (.023)        (.019)       (.051)

The R2 is .837. Adding industry indicators has virtually no eﬀect on these coeﬃcients and

raises the R2 to only .894. More importantly, to show that industry is not the essential

element explaining entry, the R2 of the regression with only industry indicators is .150,

whereas a regression that only includes country indicators has an R2 of .744. Our account

of entry, which includes only three variables, is therefore both powerful and parsimonious.6



4     Conclusion

We have reviewed initial evidence on the nature of market penetration by individual firms

in diﬀerent industries across national markets. At the level of overall manufacturing, several

features stand out: (1) There is enormous heterogeneity across firms in the extent of their

export participation, with most selling only at home. (2) The number of firms selling

                                              5
to multiple markets falls oﬀ with the number of destinations with an elasticity of -2.5.

(3) Variation in French exports across destinations represents diﬀerences in the number of

French firms selling there much more than the amount that each one sells. (4) Decomposing

French exports to each destination into the size of the market and French share, we find

that the variation in market share translates nearly completely into firm entry, while about

60 percent of the variation in market size is reflected in firm entry.

   Qualitatively, these features are very much replicated within two-digit industries, sug-

gesting that diﬀerences across industries have surprisingly little to do with them. Across

industries, larger markets are served by more firms. Presumably, consumers benefit from

more variety or more competition. A policy implication is that a potentially important

welfare gain from market integration is the entry of firms.

   Eaton et al. (2003) develop a Ricardian model with imperfect competition, transport

costs, and destination-specific fixed costs of market entry to explain these qualitative fea-

tures of the data. They pursue a structural estimation of the model at the level of overall

manufacturing, finding that it can pick up aggregate patterns quite well. Our examination

of the industry-level data suggests that the qualitative implications of the model survive

looking within industries, in particular, the enormous heterogeneity across individual firms

and the fragmentation of the world market.

Notes
   1
       The data for constructing absorption cover manufacturing (excluding petroleum refining) in 113 desti-

nation countries as of 1986. Total exports and imports are from Robert Feenstra (2000). Gross production

is from UNIDO (2001), available for 86 countries. For the remainder, we use value added in manufacturing

from the World Bank (2001). We divide these value added numbers by 0.418, the average ratio of World

Bank value added in manufacturing to UNIDO gross production in manufacturing across 59 countries for

which both are available. Appendix Table A1 reports the list of 113 destination countries, along with

each destination’s total manufacturing absorption, French market share, number of French exporters, and

average sales per French firm.

   2
       For a foreign destination n, XnF is the sum across firms of exports there. When n is France it is the

sum across firms of domestic sales. All measures are translated into US$billions.

   3
       If French firms sell on average the same amount as other firms to destination n, then NnF /λnF indicates

the total number of firms selling there.

   4
       Of course, because of the identity connecting the variables, a regression of ln xnF on ln λnF and ln Xn

yields coeﬃcients of exactly 1 minus the ones reported above.

   5                                                                                s       s
       With 16 sectors and 113 destinations we have 1808 observations. For 38 both XnF and NnF are zero.

We dropped these observations.

   6
       Appendix Figure A2 displays a relationship that is essentially the industry analog of Figure 2. The

horizontal axis is absorption at the industry level while the vertical axis is the number of French firms

exporting to a destination in a given industry divided by overall French market share in that destination.

Because of the need to construct absorption by industry we had to drop the 27 countries for which UNIDO

gross production data was not available. In addition 270 industy-country pairs had to be dropped due to

incomplete coverage in the UNIDO data. Note that in Figure A2 each industry displays much the same

pattern as for the aggregate, albeit noisier.
