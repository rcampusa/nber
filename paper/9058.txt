Using Discontinuous Eligibility Rules to Identify the Effects
of the Federal Medicaid Expansions on Low Income Children

                                               ABSTRACT

        This paper exploits the discrete nature of the eligibility criteria for two major federal expansions
of Medicaid to measure the effects on Medicaid coverage, overall health insurance coverage, and the
probability of visiting a doctor. The “100 percent” expansion, effective in 1991, extended Medicaid
eligibility to children born after September 30, 1983 in families below the poverty line. We estimate that
this law led to about a 10 percentage point rise in Medicaid coverage for children born just after the cutoff
date, and a similar or slightly smaller rise in overall health insurance. It also increased the fraction of
children in the newly eligible group with a doctor visit in the previous year. The “133 percent” expansion,
effective in 1990, extended Medicaid to children under 6 in families with incomes below 133 percent of
the poverty line. This law had relatively small effects on Medicaid coverage for children near the
eligibility limits, and little or no effect on health insurance coverage.

       Concerns over the adequacy of health insurance coverage for low income children have

transformed Medicaid from a narrowly targeted program for welfare recipients and the medically

needy to a broad-based health insurance program for low-income families. Starting in the early

1980s a series of legislative changes allowed states to offer Medicaid coverage to children in

married-couple families with incomes below the maximum limits for welfare, and to younger

children in families with higher incomes. Two key laws at the close of the decade extended the

program even further. Effective in 1990, states were required to offer Medicaid coverage to

children under six in families with incomes up to 133 percent of the poverty line. A year later,

coverage was mandated for children born after September 30, 1983 in families with incomes

below the poverty line.1 Despite these expansions, health insurance coverage rates for children in

families just under the poverty line remain below those of children in richer or poorer families.

Figure 1, for example, shows the fraction of children with health insurance in different family

income groups in 1989, 1993, and 1999.2 Coverage rates in all three years exhibit a U-shaped

pattern, with the lowest rates for children of families with incomes from 75 to 100 percent of the

poverty line – a range that is just above the welfare threshold in most states. Although this group

experienced a modest rise in coverage between 1989 and 1993, the expansions only partially

closed the gap between the welfare system and private health insurance.

       Previous studies have examined the impacts of the Medicaid expansions and evaluated

alternative explanations for the continuing coverage gap in Figure 1. Currie and Gruber (1996)

       These data are drawn from the March 1989, 1993, and 1999 Current Population Surveys
(CPS). The samples include individuals age 0-18 who are neither a family head nor a spouse of a
head. See the Data Appendix for more information.

estimated that the takeup rate for Medicaid among the newly-eligible population was relatively

low – on the order of 20 percent. Cutler and Gruber (1996) argued that although the expansions

increased the fraction of low-income children enrolled in Medicaid, they also led to reductions in

the fraction covered by private health insurance, compounding the effect of low takeup rates.

Subsequent research (Dubay and Kenney (1996), Shore-Sheppard (2000), Yazici and Kaestner

(2000), Blumberg et al (2000), Ham and Shore-Sheppard (2001)) has confirmed the modest

effect of the expansions on Medicaid coverage, while finding less consistent evidence of crowd-

out. A number of explanations – mainly focusing on the administrative burden of establishing

and maintaining Medicaid coverage – have been offered for the apparently low takeup rate of

coverage among groups made eligible by the recent expansions.

       In this paper we re-examine the effects of the two major federal Medicaid expansions of

the early 1990s – the “133 percent” expansion covering children under the age of six, and the

“100 percent” expansion covering children born after September 30, 1983. Results from an

analysis of these two programs – one targeted at younger, somewhat more advantaged children,

and the other aimed at older, poorer children – should provide useful insights about the likely

success of the recent State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), which expanded

eligibility even further up the income distribution. A key feature of the early 1990s expansions is

the discontinuity in eligibility for children of different ages.3 Under the 133 percent provision,

five year olds in families with incomes from 100 to 133 percent of the poverty line are eligible

for Medicaid, whereas six year olds are not. Under the 100 percent provision, a child born in

focus on “discontinuous” program eligibility rules, and a survey of recent applications.

October 1983 whose family’s income is below the poverty line is eligible for Medicaid, whereas

a child born one month earlier is not. These rules allow us to construct simple comparisons

between otherwise similar groups of eligible and ineligible children and construct new estimates

of the effects of these expansions.

       Our results, based on data from the Surveys of Income and Program Participation, the

March Current Population Surveys, and the Health Interview Surveys, point to two main

conclusions. First, the 100 percent expansion covering children born after September 30, 1983

led to about a 10 percentage point increase in Medicaid coverage among children in families just

under the poverty line who were made eligible by the law, implying a takeup rate only one-half

as large as the estimate of Currie and Gruber (1996). We find a similar or only slightly smaller

effect on health insurance coverage, and evidence that the rise in coverage led to an increase in

the fraction of children with at least one doctor visit in the previous year. Second, the 133

percent expansion had much smaller effects on Medicaid coverage, and little or no effect on

health insurance coverage or the probability of visiting a doctor – at least for children near the

eligibility threshold of the expansion. We also consider two explanations for the difference in

takeup between the expansions: (1) that the richer families eligible for coverage under the 133

percent expansion had a relatively low probability of remaining Medicaid-eligible, and thus were

less likely to enroll; and (2) that families eligible under the 133 percent expansion had less

previous experience with means-tested benefit programs, and therefore had less knowledge about

such programs or attached greater stigma to participating in them. We find only weak evidence

for the first explanation, but somewhat stronger evidence for the second.

II. The Medicaid Expansions

       Medicaid eligibility for non-disabled children was originally limited to families receiving

cash assistance under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program. The first

loosening of the links between AFDC and Medicaid occurred in 1984 with implementation of the

“Ribicoff program” which allowed states to offer Medicaid to children in families that satisfied

the income limits of the AFDC program, but not the family structure rules (i.e., children in two-

parent families). Further decoupling occurred with passage of the Omnibus Budget

Reconciliation Acts (OBRA) of 1986 and 1987. As described in Appendix Table 1, these laws

permitted states to raise the income limits for Medicaid eligibility of pregnant women, infants,

and young children over and above the limits for AFDC. OBRA 1987 also required the states to

cover all children born after September 30, 1983 who lived in families with incomes below the

AFDC income threshold, regardless of family structure.

       The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act (MCCA, effective July 1989) and Family

Support Act (FSA, effective October 1990), both passed in 1988, required states to extend

Medicaid eligibility even further. The MCCA mandated eligibility for pregnant women and

infants in families with incomes up to 75 percent of the poverty line, and permitted coverage of

children up to age 8 in these families. The FSA required states to offer coverage to children in

two-parent families in which the principal earner was unemployed.

       Two further expansions of the Medicaid program – and the focus of the analysis in this

paper – were included in OBRA 1989 and OBRA 1990. Effective April 1990, OBRA 1989

required states to offer Medicaid coverage to pregnant women and children up to age 6 with
                                                 5

family incomes below 133 percent of the federal poverty level (the “133 percent expansion”).

Effective July 1991, OBRA 1990 required states to cover children born after September 30, 1983

with family incomes below 100 percent of the federal poverty level (the “100 percent

expansion”). These children continue to be covered until they reach the age of 18.4 We show in

the next section that the laws raised the fraction of children eligible for Medicaid by about 6

percentage points – a substantial increase in the potential coverage of the program.5



III. Measuring Medicaid Eligibility and Coverage

Data Sources

       We use three different surveys to measure the effects of the 1990 and 1991 expansions.

Our main evidence is drawn from the first waves of the 1990-1993 Surveys of Income and

Program Participation (SIPP). These data have the advantage that family income, composition,

and program participation information all pertain to the month just before the interview (i.e., the

fourth month of the panel), rather than to the previous calendar year, reducing the scope for recall

errors and minimizing the gaps between Medicaid eligibility rules and observed characteristics.6



       4
         Two other federal rule changes allowed the states to expand Medicaid eligibility. The
“Section 1902(r)(2) option” allowed states to adopt more liberal standards for calculating income
and resources for some categories of eligibility. The “Section 1115 waiver option” allowed
states to apply for a research and demonstration waiver that would allow higher income limits for
Medicaid.
       5
       Similarly, Currie and Gruber (1996, Table 1) report a 7 percentage point rise in eligibility
between March 1990 and March 1992.
       6
         For these and other reasons, health insurance coverage is thought to be better-measured
in the SIPP than the CPS, at least in the early 1990s. See Bennefield (1996) and Nelson and
Mills (2001).
                                                  6

A second feature of the SIPP (also shared by the Health Interview Survey) is that the public use

samples report month and year of birth. This information allows us to form precise comparison

groups of children on either side of the Medicaid eligibility thresholds.

       The SIPP data also have some limitations. The samples are smaller than Current

Population Survey or Health Interview Survey samples. Moreover, SIPP files do not identify

state of residence for 9 smaller states (Maine, Vermont, Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota,

Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming). Since we need this information to assign AFDC and

Medicaid eligibility, we exclude residents of these states from our SIPP analysis. Finally, SIPP

samples are not available for every calendar year. To confirm the SIPP findings and provide a

broader perspective, we use data from the 1990-1996 March Current Population Surveys (CPS)

and the 1992-1996 Health Interview Surveys (HIS). The HIS includes information on recent

doctor visits which we use as an indicator of health care access.7

       From each of the three data sources we constructed samples of individuals age 18 or

younger who were not heading their own families. The age, race, and ethnicity distributions of

children in the three data sets are very similar (see Appendix Table 2 for details). The three data

sets also give similar estimates of the family income distributions among children in the early

1990s.8 The SIPP and CPS show roughly comparable Medicaid coverage rates, and similar


       7
         Currie and Gruber (1996) look at this measure as well as the probability of a doctor visit
in the past two weeks, the probability of hospitalization last year, and the probability of visiting a
doctor’s office, hospital emergency room or clinic, or other site.
       8
         See the Data Appendix for details on the calculation of family income in the three
surveys. The similarity of the family income distributions in the SIPP and CPS is rather
surprising given that the SIPP income data are for the previous month and the CPS data are for
the previous year. Appendix Figure 1 of Card and Shore-Sheppard (2001) plots the distributions
of family income relative to the family poverty standard in the two data sets.
                                                 7

patterns of coverage across the family income distribution. The HIS shows Medicaid coverage

rates comparable to those in the SIPP or CPS, but slightly lower overall health insurance

coverage rates for low-income children.



Age, Income, Medicaid Eligibility, and Medicaid Participation

       Table 1 presents an overview of the age, income, and Medicaid eligibility characteristics

of our SIPP samples in 1990 through 1993. About one-third of the children in our sample are

under the age of 6, and between one-third and one-half were born after September 30, 1983,

depending on the survey year. These numbers suggest potentially large impacts of both the 133

percent expansion (for children under 6) and the 100 percent expansion (for those born after

September 30, 1983). In the early 1990s, however, there was a substantial overlap between the

groups. In 1992 – the first year affected by the 100 percent expansion – only 13 percent of the

children were born after September 30, 1983 and were at least 6 years old. This fraction rose to

19 percent in 1993, and continued to rise over the remainder of the 1990s.

       Medicaid eligibility under OBRA 1989 and OBRA 1990 is based on family income

relative to the family poverty threshold. In 1990, the poverty rate of the children in our sample

(i.e. the fraction with an income-to-poverty ratio under 100 percent) was 21.2 percent.9 Another

7.6 percent of children were in families with incomes between 100 and 133 percent of the

poverty line. The fraction of children in poor families rose in the early 1990s, reflecting the

cyclical downturn and other factors, while the fraction in families with income-to-poverty rates

of 100-133 percent was relatively stable.


       9
        The estimated child poverty rate in our March CPS sample was 21.6 percent in 1990.
                                                  8

       In classifying Medicaid eligibility it is useful to divide children in poor families into two

groups: those with family incomes below the appropriate AFDC income threshold (based on state

and family composition) and those with family incomes between the AFDC threshold and the

poverty line.10 The former are nearly all eligible for Medicaid through AFDC (if the family is

headed by a single woman) or AFDC-UP (if the state has an unemployed parent program) or

through the “Ribicoff” program adopted by most states in the mid-1980s.11 The latter are only

eligible through a poverty-based expansion. We use data on state benefit rates to assign each

family an AFDC threshold. We then express this maximum eligibility cutoff as a fraction of the

corresponding (family-specific) poverty line. In estimating AFDC income limits, a key issue is

the amount of child care allowances that workers can deduct from their gross earnings. We

assign the highest child care disregards that a family can potentially receive for children under 6

(see the Data Appendix), overstating the cutoffs for families that rely on unpaid child care.

       The average AFDC income limit for our 1990 sample was 68.9 percent of the family-

specific poverty line. Over the next three years the AFDC limit fell relative to the poverty line,

reflecting the erosion of the real value of benefits in many states and benefit cuts in some states.

Despite this decline, the fraction of children living in families below the AFDC cutoff rose

slightly, from 15.4 percent in 1990 to 17 percent in 1993. The fraction in families above the

AFDC limit but below the poverty line increased more, from 6.1 to 9.1 percent.



       10
          A small fraction of families in high benefit-level states actually face AFDC thresholds
that are above the family-specific poverty line.
       11
        85 percent of our 1990 SIPP sample resided in states with Ribicoff rules allowing
Medicaid eligibility regardless of family structure for all families with incomes below the AFDC
limit.
                                                  9

       In the absence of poverty-based expansions, the family income limit for Medicaid would

equal the AFDC limit. State and federal programs in place in 1990 raised the average Medicaid

limit 7.6 percentage points above the average AFDC limit, and extended coverage to about 1.7

percent more children than were eligible under the AFDC limits. In all, about 10 percent of

children who were financially eligible for Medicaid in 1990 were eligible under poverty-line

related expansion programs. Over the next three years, the OBRA 1989 and OBRA 1990

expansions, coupled with state-level programs, raised the average Medicaid income cutoff to 112

percent of the poverty line, and raised the fraction of Medicaid-eligible children in families with

incomes over the AFDC threshold to 40.8 percent.

       The final rows in Table 1 present data on AFDC and Medicaid participation. AFDC

participation rose faster than estimated eligibility in the early 1990s, from 8.4 percent in 1990 to

12 percent in 1994. The fraction of children covered by Medicaid and not on AFDC increased

even faster, from 3.7 percent to 7.7 percent. As a result, the share of Medicaid recipients from

outside the welfare system rose from 30 percent in 1990 to 40 percent in 1993. Data from the

March CPS show a similar rise, from 31 percent in the March 1990 CPS to 44 percent in the

1993 CPS.

       The results in Table 1 suggest that the Medicaid expansions of the early 1990s raised

eligibility, leading to a rise in the fraction of Medicaid recipients from outside the traditional base

of welfare recipients. At the same time, increasing welfare participation also contributed to the

growth in Medicaid caseloads. A more detailed look at changes in Medicaid eligibility and

coverage is presented in Table 2. Here, we use a simple hierarchy to assign the sources of

Medicaid eligibility: (1) eligible under the AFDC income limits; (2) eligible through a federal or
                                                 10

state program for infants; (3) eligible under the 133 percent program for children under age 6; (4)

eligible under the 100 percent program for children born after September 30, 1983; or (5) eligible

under a state program that provides coverage beyond the federal programs. Due to data

limitations we ignore eligibility for disabled children and those whose families have incurred

large medical expenses. For each eligibility group we show the fraction of children in the group

and the Medicaid coverage rate (or takeup rate). The right-hand columns of the table also report

the change in overall Medicaid participation attributable to the trend in Medicaid recipiency

within the group.12 Expansions in Medicaid coverage should not necessarily affect Medicaid

takeup among groups that were previously eligible. Arguably, then, these changes should be

factored out of the rise in Medicaid in assessing the effect of the expansions. On the other hand,

eligibility is measured with error, and takeup by newly-eligible children who are mis-assigned to

the ineligible or AFDC-related eligibility groups may cause measured takeup rates for these

groups to rise.

       This phenomenon could partially explain the rise in Medicaid coverage among children

we estimate to be ineligible for coverage, from 3.5 percent in 1990 to 5.1 percent in 1993.13

Although the takeup rate of the ineligible group is low, the group is large, and the rise in their

coverage accounts for 1.1 percentage points (or 15 percent) of the overall rise in Medicaid


       12
         We calculate this as the change in the participation rate of the group, multiplied by the
group’s population share in 1993. Using the 1990 shares leads to slightly different within-group
changes.
       13
          Even if eligibility is correctly assigned, errors in reported Medicaid coverage will lead to
some measured coverage among the ineligible group. Card, Hildreth, and Shore-Sheppard
(2001) estimate that the false positive rate of Medicaid reporting by lower-income children in the
SIPP is between 2 and 5 percent – enough to explain the mean level of reported coverage among
the ineligible population, but not the rising trend.
                                                 11

participation.14 A similar trend of increased Medicaid coverage is evident among children in

families with incomes below the AFDC threshold. The Medicaid participation rate of children

in female-headed families with incomes below the AFDC limit rose by 10 percentage points,

contributing 1.1 percentage points to the overall rise in Medicaid.15 For children in other types of

families (e.g., dual headed and single-father families) with incomes under the AFDC limit there

was a 20 point rise in takeup, accounting for an additional 1.2 percentage points of the rise in

Medicaid.16 Finally, there was also a rise in participation among the roughly 1 percent of

children covered by federal and state infant programs.

       The fifth and sixth rows in Table 2 present data on children eligible under the OBRA

1989 and OBRA 1990 programs. The 133 percent program became effective in April 1990.

Three quarters of the 1990 SIPP sample were interviewed before this date, leaving only one

quarter potentially eligible for coverage under the new program. By 1993, however, the fraction

eligible had risen to 4.1 percent. The 100 percent program became effective in July 1991, so


       14
         As we are unable to identify disabled children who may be eligible for Medicaid
through the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, some of the increase in participation
among the apparently ineligible may be due to the increase in disability rates and SSI
participation that occurred over this period (see for example Kaye et al. (1996) and Kubik
(1999)). An advantage of using the discontinuities in the Medicaid expansions to identify the
expansions’ effect is that trends such as increasing SSI participation will not confound our
estimates of the impact of the poverty-related expansions.
       15
         The rise in Medicaid for this group parallels a rise in AFDC participation, from 60.7
percent in 1990 to 69.9 percent in 1993.
       16
         About 90 percent of these children are in Ribicoff states, and so were eligible for
Medicaid throughout the sample period. The levels and trends in Medicaid participation for
children in Ribicoff and non-Ribicoff states are nearly identical. In addition to the Ribicoff
program, children in dual-headed families may be enrolled in Medicaid via the AFDC-
Unemployed Parent program, or via AFDC if the “father” is actually a stepfather (Moffitt,
Reville, and Winkler (1994)).
                                                 12

only the children in our 1992 and 1993 samples were potentially eligible for this expansion.

Because of the overlap in age coverage of the 133 percent and 100 percent programs, and the

modest gap between the AFDC income limits and the poverty line (see Table 1), less than two

percent of children in the later SIPP’s gained eligibility because of the 100 percent program.

Interestingly, the Medicaid takeup rate for the 100 percent program eligibility group is higher

than the rate for the 133 percent eligibility group, although both are below the rate among the

traditional AFDC-related eligibility group. Thus, as noted by Currie and Gruber (1996) and

Shore-Sheppard (1997), the marginal takeup rate of Medicaid among children made newly

eligible by the expansions was below the average takeup rate.

       Although OBRA 1986 permitted states to offer Medicaid coverage to children in families

with incomes over the AFDC limit, less than 1 percent of children were eligible under such

programs in early 1990. Over the next few years, however, many states began to implement

coverage expansions that went beyond the minimum federal requirements. Some of these

programs only covered certain categories of medical expenses, or required co-payments. By

1993, we estimate that optional state programs offered potential coverage to about 5 percent of

children who were otherwise ineligible for Medicaid. As shown in Table 2, the takeup rate for

this group was low, potentially reflecting the restrictive nature of some of the programs and/or a

lack of knowledge about them.

       The results in Table 2 point to three main conclusions. First, the rise in Medicaid

coverage in the early 1990s was driven by a combination of rising participation among groups

that were already eligible, expansions of eligibility, and a rise in participation among children

that appear to be ineligible. Given errors in imputing eligibility, it is hard to assess whether the
                                                 13

rises in participation among ineligible and AFDC-eligible children should be attributed to the

expansions, or to a general trend toward higher takeup of welfare programs. Second, prior to the

effective dates of the 133 percent and 100 percent federal expansions, optional state expansions

covered a very small fraction of children in families with incomes beyond the AFDC limit (less

than 1 percent), although subsequent state programs extended coverage further. Third, by 1993,

the 133 percent program offered coverage to about 4 percent of children in families with incomes

above the AFDC limit, while the100 percent program expanded coverage to an additional 2

percent of children.



IV. The 100 Percent Program

       We begin our analysis of the federal Medicaid expansions by considering the effect of the

100 percent program. To set the stage, Figure 2 shows Medicaid eligibility rates by quarter of

birth for children just under the poverty line (with family incomes from 60-99 percent of poverty)

and just over the line (100-140 percent of poverty) in our 1992 and 1993 SIPP samples. Since

most children in families with incomes below the AFDC limit were eligible for coverage before

the 100 percent program, we exclude anyone whose family-specific AFDC cutoff is above 70

percent of the poverty line.17 The graph illustrates the sharp discontinuity in Medicaid eligibility

induced by the expansion. Among children in families below the poverty line but above the

AFDC income limit, Medicaid eligibility rates average 6-8 percent for those born before the


       17
          An examination of AFDC participation rates shows that welfare participation falls off
very quickly once the income-to-poverty rate is within 10 percent of the AFDC cutoff – see Card
and Shore-Sheppard (2001, Figure 2). The fall-off before the cutoff presumably reflects the fact
that our calculations overstate the AFDC income limit. We build this 10 point gap into our
sample exclusion.
                                                  14

fourth quarter of 1983, and 100 percent after. Among children in families just above the poverty

line, eligibility rates are about 6-8 percent on either side of the 1983-III breakpoint. Since nearly

all the children in the above-poverty group are eligible under the 133 percent program if they are

under 6 years of age, the average eligibility rate for the above-poverty group rises to nearly 100

percent for those born 12-16 quarters after 1983-III.

       Figure 3 shows corresponding patterns of Medicaid coverage. There is a discernable

“jump” in Medicaid coverage for the below-poverty group between the 1983-III and 1983-IV

birth cohorts, with no such jump for the above-poverty group. Moreover, coverage rates of the

below poverty group are fairly stable on either side of the eligibility cutoff , suggesting that the

jump is not just a random blip.18 In contrast to the rise at 1983-III, there is no rise in coverage

for the above-poverty group born 12-16 quarters after 1983-III, despite the steep rise in eligibility

noted in Figure 2. This is consistent with other evidence (discussed below) that the 133 percent

expansion had very small effects on Medicaid coverage.

       The rules of the 100 percent expansion also create discontinuities in eligibility by family

income. In particular, for children born after September 1983, one would expect Medicaid

coverage rates to fall as family income passes through the poverty line. Figure 4 graphs

Medicaid coverage rates by family income for children in the 1992 and 1993 SIPP samples born

before and after the OBRA 1990 cutoff date.19 A key difference between these comparisons and



       18
          There are 25-30 children per birth quarter in the 60-99 percent poverty group in the
combined 1992 and 1993 SIPPs. Thus, the standard error of the estimated Medicaid participation
rate for a single birth-quarter is about 8 percentage points.
       19
          As in Figure 3 , the samples used in Figure 4 exclude children whose AFDC cutoff is
greater than 70 percent of the family-specific poverty line.
                                                 15

the comparisons by birth quarter in Figure 3 is that family incomes (unlike birth dates) vary from

month to month.20 Since enrolling in Medicaid is burdensome, families will not necessarily

enroll if their incomes are only temporarily low, leading to some fuzziness in the discontinuity by

income. Consistent with this reasoning, there is a smoother rise in Medicaid coverage around

the poverty line in Figure 4 than at the 1983-III cohort cutoff in Figure 3. Nevertheless, the

patterns of Medicaid coverage for the older and younger cohorts in Figure 4 suggest that the 100

percent program has a significant effect. Above the poverty line, Medicaid coverage rates are

fairly similar for the older and younger cohorts. Below the poverty line the coverage rate of the

younger cohort is 10 percentage points higher.



Differences-in-Differences and Regression-Discontinuity Estimates

       The evidence of discontinuities in Figures 3 and 4 can be evaluated more formally. One

way is to compare the differences in Medicaid coverage and related outcomes for children in

families just above and just below the poverty line who were born before and after September 30,

1983. The components of these “differences-in-differences” are presented in Table 3, using the

same samples underlying Figures 3 and 4. For children in the later cohort we show means for all

age groups and for the subset who are age 6 or older as of the SIPP survey. Focusing on children

6 or older eliminates the problem that most of the younger children in the higher-income group

are eligible for Medicaid through the 133 percent expansion.




       20
          See for example Pischke (1995), who fits a variety of models to monthly family income
from the SIPP. In our samples, the correlation of monthly family incomes measured 6 months
apart is around 0.80.
                                                    16

       The eligibility rates in the third column of the table show that children born before

October 1, 1983 have very low rates of Medicaid eligibility, regardless of whether their family

income is above or below the poverty line.21 Children born after the cutoff date in poor families

are all eligible for Medicaid. Children born after the cutoff in families just above the poverty line

but over age 6 also have very low rates of Medicaid eligibility. However, because of the 133

percent program, if younger children are included the average Medicaid eligibility rate of the

higher-income group rises to 50.8 percent. Thus, if the comparisons are restricted to children

over 6, the difference in differences in eligibility is 92 percent, while if younger children are

included it falls to 47 percent. The gap reflects the “contamination” of the above-poverty/post-

September 1983 group by children who are eligible under the 133 percent program.

       One way to focus more directly on the discontinuity is to construct regression-adjusted

differences in differences that include smooth functions of age and income, as well as controls

for age under 6 and other factors. In particular, consider the following regression model for the

event of Medicaid eligibility, or any related outcome (e.g. Medicaid coverage):

(1)     Y = a + b1 Poor + b2 (Born After 9/30/83) + b3 Poor × (Born After 9/30/83)

                   + b4 (Age<6) + b5 (Age<6) × (1Poor) + G(Age, Income) + d X + e ,

where “Poor” is an indicator for family income under the poverty line, “Age” represents an

individual’s age, “Income” represents family income relative to the poverty line, G( ) is some

smooth function of age and income (e.g. a low order polynomial), and X is a set of other

characteristics (e.g., year dummies and controls for race and ethnicity) This specification allows

the outcome variable Y to vary smoothly with age and family income, and to exhibit possible


       21
            Nearly all of the eligible children in this cohort were eligible under state programs.
                                                  17

discontinuities as family income reaches the poverty line, or the child’s birth date approaches

September 30, 1983, or the child reaches age 6. The impact of the 100 percent program is

identified by the coefficient of the interaction between poverty status and birth cohort. Any

confounding effect of the 133 percent program is captured by the coefficient b5 of the interaction

between age under 6 and above-poverty status.22

        Note that if only the first three terms of equation (1) are included, then the coefficient b3

of the interaction between poverty status and the indicator for born after September 1983 is just

the difference in difference. The addition of the G( ) function controls for any systematic

variation in the outcome by age or income, and shifts the source of identification from a “global”

difference in differences to a local one, concentrated around the eligibility threshold. The

addition of other covariates helps to control for factors such as region or time effects that might

be differentially distributed across the four groups in the difference-in-differences comparison.

        The regression-adjusted differences in differences in Table 3 include a cubic in age, a

quadratic in income (relative to poverty), dummies for race, Hispanic ethnicity, and living with a

single mother, and interactions of year effects with 4 region effects. Looking at the eligibility

models, when the comparison is restricted to children age 6 and older, the regression-adjusted

estimate of the eligibility effect is nearly identical to the unadjusted difference in differences (92

percent). When the sample includes children under 6, the adjusted estimate is also very close to

92 percent, suggesting that the controls effectively shift the identification to the eligibility

threshold.



        22
         Nearly all the children in our higher income group under the age of 6 are eligible under
the 133 percent expansion.
                                                  18

       The models for Medicaid coverage confirm the visual impression from Figures 3 and 4

that the 100 percent expansion led to a 10 percentage point rise in coverage for children close to

the eligibility limits. As with the eligibility models, the coverage effects from the regression-

adjusted models are similar whether or not children under 6 are included. Since the 100 percent

program increased eligibility by about 92 percent and increased coverage by 10 percent, the

implied takeup rate among the newly eligible group is 11 percent (with a standard error of 4.2

percent) – substantially below the 20 percent takeup rate estimated by Currie and Gruber (1996)

for the combined federal and state expansions over the 1985-93 period.23

       The other models in Table 3 analyze AFDC participation, Medicaid coverage outside of

AFDC, overall health insurance coverage, and the presence of non-Medicaid insurance. The

results for AFDC and for Medicaid coverage outside of AFDC can be interpreted as specification

checks. In principle, the change in the Medicaid income limit should not have affected AFDC

participation: thus, all of the rise in Medicaid associated with the rise in eligibility should have

occurred outside AFDC. This is confirmed by the unadjusted and regression-adjusted differences

in differences.

       The results for any health insurance, and for other (i.e., non-Medicaid) insurance, address

the issue of crowd out. The unadjusted difference in differences that includes children under 6

shows some evidence of crowd out, with a smaller rise in total coverage than in Medicaid, and a




       23
          Taking the ratio of the coverage and eligibility effects is equivalent to an instrumental
variables (IV) estimate of the effect of Medicaid eligibility on Medicaid coverage, using the
interaction of poverty status and pre-September 1983 birth cohort as an instrument for eligibility.
The corresponding OLS estimate is 8.1 percent with a standard error of 2.7 percent.
                                                 19

decline in other coverage.24 However, our preferred specifications that either exclude children

under 6 or add controls for age, income, and coverage under the 133 percent program show no

such patterns

       We have performed a number of specification tests to probe the validity of the methods

used in Table 3. One test is to perform the same analysis using data from 1990 and 1991, before

the 100 percent program took effect. Unfortunately, this exercise is not very informative because

there are very few children in the right income range who were at least 6 years old in 1990 or

1991 and were born after September 1983 (a total of only 121 observations). Using this small

sample, the difference in differences in Medicaid coverage prior to the effective date of the 100

percent expansion is actually negative (but statistically insignificant). The negative “pre-program

treatment effect” is attributable to a gap in AFDC participation: the difference in differences of

Medicaid participation outside of AFDC is close to zero.

       A second test is to drop the exclusion restriction that eliminates children in high-AFDC

benefit states. The main impact of this change is to raise the Medicaid eligibility and

participation rates of the below-poverty group born before October 1983. As a consequence, the

regression-adjusted difference in differences in eligibility falls to 66.3 percent, the corresponding

effect on Medicaid coverage falls to 8.8 percent (standard error 3.4), and the effect on overall

health insurance falls to 8.8 percent (standard error 3.6). For this broader sample the implied

takeup rate of Medicaid coverage by newly eligible children is 13.3 percent (standard error 5.2

percent) – quite similar to the estimate using the narrower sample, as would be expected if all the


       24
         Some children have both Medicaid and other coverage. Thus, the coefficients for
Medicaid coverage and non-Medicaid coverage do not “add up” to the coefficient in the model
for any coverage.
                                                 20

changes in the broader sample are generated by behavioral reactions among children above the

AFDC limit.

       A third test is to augment the sample for 1992 and 1993 with data from the earlier panels.

For example, month 16 of the 1991 panel represents the same calendar period as month 4 of the

1992 panel. We included these data (for the 90 percent of the 1991 panel who were still in the

sample at their 16th month) and re-estimated the models in Table 3. The results are very similar

to those in Table 3, and slightly more precise. For example, the regression-adjusted estimate of

the Medicaid coverage effect is 10.8 percent (standard error 3.4) while the corresponding

estimate of the overall health insurance effect is 9.2 percent (standard error 4.0). Adding in data

for month 28 of the 1990 panel similarly has very little effect on the character of the results.



V. The 133 Percent Expansion

       Like the 100 percent expansion, the 133 percent Medicaid expansion generates sharp

discontinuities in Medicaid eligibility along both age and income dimensions. As a first step in

evaluating this expansion, we compare children older and younger than 6 in families with

incomes from 100 to 132 percent of the poverty line in the 1991-93 SIPP, against similar age

groups in families with incomes from 133 to 166 percent of the poverty line. Figure 5 shows

Medicaid coverage rates by age measured in quarters for the two groups, using data from the

1991-1993 SIPP samples.25 Unlike Figure 3, there is no evidence of a jump in Medicaid




       25
          To avoid issues of AFDC eligibility, the underlying samples exclude children in
families whose AFDC income limit is above 100 percent of the poverty line. This affects a
relatively small number of children.
                                                  21

coverage associated with the age limit of the 133 percent program26. A graph of Medicaid

coverage by family income similarly shows no evidence of a drop in coverage as income reaches

133 percent of poverty.

       Table 4 presents means of Medicaid eligibility and coverage for children older or younger

than 6 in families with incomes just below and just above the cutoff of the 133 percent program.

We also show the associated differences in differences, following the same format as Table 3.

Both the unadjusted and adjusted differences in differences show that the 133 percent expansion

raised Medicaid eligibility of the target group by about 85 percent. Unlike the 100 percent

expansion, however, there was no corresponding effect on Medicaid coverage or health insurance

coverage. To check whether these estimates might reflect a slow diffusion of knowledge about

the 133 percent program, we constructed differences in differences using data for 1992 and 1993

only. The results, shown in the bottom row of Table 4, are not much different from the results

based on 1991-1993. We also tried various changes in the sample (e.g., narrowing the income

limits of the affected and unaffected groups around the 133 percent income cutoff; and narrowing

the age range), but found no changes in the results.

       A limitation of the analysis in Table 4 is that it focuses on only some of the children who

were affected by the 133 percent expansion – those in families with incomes from 100 to 133

percent of poverty. The program also extended coverage to children under the age of 6 with

family incomes below the poverty line. By pooling different age and income groups and

including indicators for potential eligibility under either or both expansions, it is possible to


       26
         As in Figure 3, the lines in Figure 5 are smoothed using a 3-quarter moving average
with weights (0.2, 0.6, 0.2). There are 40-50 observations per quarter for both income groups,
slightly more than in the samples in Figure 3.
                                                 22

determine whether this group responded more like the older group affected by the 100 percent

expansion, or more like the higher income group affected by the 133 percent expansion. The

results of this exercise – using SIPP data for 1992 and 1993 for children with family incomes

from 60 to 166 percent of the poverty line – are reported in Table 5. For simplicity, we report

only the coefficients of the potential eligibility indicators from regression-adjusted models that

control for age, income, demographic characteristics, and region and year effects.

       The results in the first column show that potential eligibility under the 100 percent

expansion, or under both expansions, was associated with about a 66 percent increase in

Medicaid eligibility, whereas potential eligibility under the 133 expansion was associated with an

83 percent rise in eligibility. The smaller effect for the 100 percent and combined expansions

reflects the fact that about one quarter of children in families with incomes between 60 and 100

percent of poverty had family incomes under the AFDC limit and were therefore already eligible

for Medicaid. In terms of Medicaid coverage, the estimates in Table 5 show that children who

were eligible for the 100 percent expansion only, or for both expansions, had 9-10 percentage

point gains in Medicaid coverage, while those who were eligible for the 133 percent expansion

had a slight decline in Medicaid coverage. In all three cases there is no significant effect on

AFDC participation. The results for the probability of any health insurance hint at a possible

difference between the older children eligible for the 100 percent expansion only, and the

younger children eligible for both. Specifically, the rise in overall insurance coverage for the

100-percent-only group is about the same size as the rise in Medicaid, implying (as in Table 3)

that there was little or no crowd-out for this group. By comparison, non-Medicaid insurance

coverage among the younger children affected by both expansions fell, leading to a smaller gain
                                                  23

in overall coverage than in Medicaid. It should be noted, however, that the differences between

the coefficient estimates for the 100-percent-only group and the group eligible for both

expansions are statistically insignificant, as shown by the probability values reported in the

bottom row of the Table.

       To summarize, the results in Tables 3, 4, and 5 indicate that the 100 percent expansion

led to about a 10 percentage point rise in Medicaid coverage and overall health insurance

coverage among previously ineligible children, whereas the 133 percent expansion had little

effect on either. Impacts for the set of younger children covered by both expansions are about the

same as for those covered by the 100 percent program only, although this group shows slightly

more evidence of crowd-out.



VI. Evidence from the March CPS

       In view of the surprising results for the 133 percent expansion obtained from our SIPP

samples, we decided to look at the program using March CPS data. Since the age limit of the

133 percent expansion falls at exactly 6 years, it is possible to distinguish eligible and ineligible

children using age data measured only in years. The results are summarized in Table 6. Despite

some small differences in the levels of Medicaid, AFDC, and health insurance coverage in the

CPS and SIPP, the differences-in-differences are very similar. In particular, March CPS data

from 1991-93 suggest that the 133 program had a very small effect on Medicaid coverage of

children under 6 in families with incomes from 100-133 percent of poverty – on the order of 2

percent or less. Despite the much larger CPS sample sizes, none of the differences-in-differences

is statistically significant, with the exception of the -3.9 percent effect on other health insurance.
                                                 24

Paradoxically, the CPS data suggest that the 133 program caused other insurance coverage to fall

by more than the rise in Medicaid, leading to a net loss in overall health insurance coverage. We

also conducted a year-by-year analysis using the CPS files for 1991 to 1996, to check if the

impact of the 133 expansion changed over time. The results are summarized in Appendix Table

3. While there is some year-to-year variation, on balance we see no systematic effects of the 133

percent expansion on Medicaid participation or overall health insurance coverage of children

close to the eligibility limits of the law.



VII. Evidence from the Health Interview Survey

        Our final set of estimates is based on data from the 1992-1996 Health Interview Surveys.

We focus on three key dependent variables from the HIS: Medicaid coverage, any health

insurance coverage, and the number of doctor visits in the past year. Following previous

researchers (Holl et al., 1995; Currie and Gruber, 1996), we distinguish between children who

had at least one doctor visit last year, and those who did not, and interpret the incidence of at

least one doctor visit as an indicator of access to preventative medical care.

        The upper panel of Table 7 reports unadjusted and regression-adjusted difference-in-

differences estimates of the effect of the 100 percent poverty expansion, using children in

families with incomes from 60 to 140 percent of poverty born before and after September 30,

1983.27 (The adjusted models include the same set of control variables used in Table 3 for our


        27
         Since the the public-use samples of the HIS do not report state of residence, we cannot
construct family-specific AFDC income cutoffs and eliminate children with high AFDC
thresholds who were eligible for Medicaid even before the exansion. As described in the Data
Appendix, we estimate the ratio of family income to poverty using income intervals reported in
the HIS and family size information. We exclude the roughly 15 percent of individuals with
                                                  25

analysis of the SIPP). The estimated effects on Medicaid coverage and overall insurance

coverage are slightly smaller than for comparable samples of the 1992-93 SIPP, and more

precise.28 The adjusted HIS estimates suggest that the 100 percent expansion raised Medicaid

coverage by 6 percentage points and raised health insurance coverage by about 5 percentage

points, although the gap – which is an estimate of the crowdout effect – is not significant (t=0.8).

The impact of the expansion is illustrated in Figure 6, which plots Medicaid coverage rates by

quarter of birth for children in families just below and just above the poverty line. As in Figure

3, there is a noticeable jump in Medicaid coverage after the September 30, 1983 eligibility date

for the poorer children, and no such jump for the richer children.

       The results in the third column of Table 7 suggest that the 100 percent expansion also had

a positive effect on health care utilization. The unadjusted effect is not quite statistically

significant, while the regression-adjusted effect is marginally so, with a t-ratio of 2.18.29

Considering the rather modest estimate of the expansion’s effect on insurance coverage, the

effect on doctor visits is relatively large. Specifically, the estimates suggest that children with

newly available health insurance coverage have a 60% higher probability of at least one annual


missing family income information.
       28
         The effects for the 1992-93 SIPP using a comparable sample are 8.8 percent on
Medicaid coverage (standard error 3.4) and 8.8 percent on overall health insurance coverage
(standard error 3.6). We cannot estimate the effects of the expansions on eligibility in the HIS
since we do not know state of residence and therefore cannot assign eligibility for those with
incomes under the AFDC income limits. However, assuming the eligibility effect is the same as
in the SIPP (66 percent), the implied takeup rate for the HIS sample is about 9 percent.
       29
         The mean fractions of children with at least one doctor visit in the previous year for the
four groups used in the difference-in-differences are as follows: poor children born before
October 1983 – 65.2%; poor children born later – 83.1%; above-poverty children born before
October 1983 – 65.6%, above poverty children born later – 81.6%.
                                                  26

doctor visit than in the absence of the expansion, although this estimate is rather imprecise

(standard error 31%). This is the instrumental variables estimate of the effect of health insurance

coverage on the probability of visiting a doctor at least once, using the interaction of poor and

born after September 1983 as an instrument for coverage. By comparison, an OLS regression of

doctor visits on insurance coverage and the same set of control variables has a coefficient of only

12 percent (standard error 0.6 percent).

       The models in the lower panel of Table 7 examine the combined effects of the 100 and

133 percent expansion, using the same framework as in Table 5. The results are comparable to

those based on the SIPP, although in the HIS sample there is more evidence of an effect of the

133 percent program on Medicaid coverage. Interestingly, however, this increase in Medicaid

was not associated with a significant rise in overall health insurance coverage, or with a

significant change in the probability of visiting a doctor.30 It is also interesting that although the

SIPP sample showed larger crowdout effects of the 100 percent expansion for younger children

who were also eligible for the 133 program, in the HIS sample the opposite is true: any evidence

of crowdout is confined to the older children who were excluded from the 133 percent program.

       Overall, we interpret the HIS results as supportive of our findings from the SIPP and

CPS, although differences across the various specifications suggest the need for caution in

drawing strong conclusions from any one data set. Based on the three data sets we conclude that

the 100 percent program had a larger effect on Medicaid and health insurance coverage than the



       30
         If we examine the 133 program separately looking at children with incomes from 100 to
166 percent of poverty, as in Tables 4 or 6, we obtain estimates of the effects on Medicaid and
overall health insurance coverage nearly identical to those reported in Table 7 for the 133-
percent-only group.
                                                   27

133 percent program. In fact, the 133 percent expansion seems to have had no effect on total

health insurance coverage, implying that any impact on Medicaid was offset by reductions in

other coverage. Evidence of crowd-out effects from the 100 percent expansion varies slightly

across data sets. The SIPP shows little or no crowdout effects among older children covered by

the 100 percent expansion, but some crowdout for younger children, whereas the HIS shows the

opposite pattern. In neither case, however, are the crowdout estimates statistically significant.

Finally, HIS data suggest that the 100 percent expansion led to a sizeable increase in the fraction

of newly-covered children who visited a doctor at least once in the previous year.



VIII. Explanations for Differential Takeup of the 100 Percent and 133 Percent Expansions

        The contrast between the modest but positive impacts of the OBRA 1990 expansion and

the more limited effects of the OBRA 1989 expansion raises the question: what factors can

explain the differential impact of these two laws? One hypothesis is that the higher-income

families eligible for coverage under the 133 percent expansion have a relatively low probability

of remaining Medicaid-eligible in the near future, and are therefore less willing to undertake a

lengthy enrollment process than families with a higher probability of continuing eligibility. To

evaluate this hypothesis, we used the 1992 and 1993 SIPP panels to calculate Medicaid eligibility

status 12 months after the first interview for children in different eligibility groups at the first

interview. The results are presented in Table 8. Among all children who were Medicaid-eligible

at the first interview, 78 percent were eligible 12 months later. As expected, the rate of future

eligibility is highest for the poorest children (who are eligible via AFDC at the first interview),

somewhat lower for those eligible under both the 100 percent and 133 percent expansions, and
                                                     28

lowest for those eligible under the 133 percent expansions only.31 Nevertheless, over 60 percent

of the 133-percent-only group are eligible a year later. By comparison, the rate of future

eligibility is only 21 percent for children who are ineligible for Medicaid at the first interview but

have family incomes under 166% of poverty. Qualitatively, future eligibility rates are lower for

families covered by the 133 percent expansion than for families covered by the 100 percent

expansion. Quantitatively, however, the difference is small.

        Another hypothesis is that the higher income families affected by the 133 percent

expansion have less experience with means-tested benefit programs and therefore have less

information about such programs, or perhaps attach greater stigma to participating in the them.

Comparisons of the characteristics of the children and families in the different eligibility groups

in Table 8 suggest there may be some truth to this idea. For example, families in the 133-

percent-only eligibility group are much less likely to be female-headed or black than families in

the 100-percent-only eligibility group: both characteristics are highly correlated with welfare

participation rates. To test the hypothesis more formally, we took all children in the 16th month

of the 1992 and 1993 SIPP panels, and calculated their Medicaid eligibility status. We then

compared rates of AFDC and Medicaid participation 12 months earlier across different eligibility

groups. The results, presented in Table 9, confirm that families of children in the 133-percent-

only eligibility group have lower rates of previous participation in welfare or Medicaid than



        31
          If income for family i in month t follows a simple mean-regressive process like: yit = i
+ uit, where uit = 'uit1 + it is a first order autoregressive process with '>0 and it is i.i.d. , then it
is easy to show that P(yit+k  M | yit  L) > P(yit+k  M | L < yit  M) . Thus, families whose
incomes fall below the poverty line (L) in month t are more likely to have income below the
Medicaid limit (M) k months later than those with incomes between the poverty line and the
Medicaid limit in month t.
                                                 29

families of children who are eligible under AFDC or the 100 percent expansion. The differences

in previous program participation rates are somewhat larger than the differences in future

eligibility rates in Table 8. For example, 45 percent of children in the 100-percent-only

eligibility group were on Medicaid one year earlier, compared with 29 percent of the 133-

percent-only group. To the extent that previous program participation increases knowledge

about Medicaid, or reduces the stigma associated with entering the program, these gaps could

help to explain the lower takeup rate by children in the 100-percent-only eligibility group than in

the 133-percent-only group.



IX. Conclusions

       This paper presents new estimates of the effects of the federal Medicaid expansions in the

early 1990s, using comparisons of children close to the eligibility limits of the laws. We find

that the 100 percent expansion – which extended Medicaid eligibility to children born after

September 30, 1983 in families below the poverty line – led to about a 10 percentage point rise in

Medicaid coverage for children just inside the eligibility limits, and a similar or slightly smaller

rise in overall health insurance. It also increased the fraction of children in the newly eligible

group with a doctor visit in the previous year. The impacts of the expansion on Medicaid

coverage are discernable from a simple graphical analysis, in conventional differences-in-

differences, and in a regression-discontinuity framework. Nevertheless, the takeup rate in the

newly eligible population was low – on the order of 10 percent. The 133 percent expansion –

which opened up Medicaid to children under 6 in families with incomes below 133 percent of the

poverty line – had even smaller impacts. We find no effect of the 133 percent expansion on
                                                 30

Medicaid coverage rates of children close to the eligibility limits of the law in the SIPP or CPS.

Even in the HIS, which shows a small effect on Medicaid, there is no effect on overall health

insurance coverage.

       Our findings underscore the conclusion of earlier research that the impact of recent

Medicaid expansions was limited by low takeup rates among the newly eligible children. Indeed,

our estimated takeup rates for children near the age boundaries of the federal laws are even lower

than suggested by previous studies. An examination of eligibility dynamics in the SIPP suggests

that the newly eligible children under the recent expansions differ from traditional Medicaid

participants in two key dimensions. Families of the newly eligible children – especially those

covered by the 133 percent expansion – have less previous contact with means-tested programs.

As a result, they may have less information about Medicaid, or may feel greater stigma from

participating in the program, than the traditional Medicaid clientele. The newly-eligible children

are also less likely to remain eligible in the near future. Consequently, their families may be less

willing to go through a lengthy enrollment process. Whatever the explanation for the low

takeup, the behavior of children affected by the 100 percent and 133 percent expansions suggests

that increases in the income limits for Medicaid eligibility have very limited effects on health

insurance coverage of poor and near-poor children. To the extent that these patterns continue,

the recent SCHIP programs will have only modest impacts.

Surveys of Income and Program Participation
        Our SIPP samples are taken from the 1990-1993 full panel research files. The samples
include individuals up to 18 years of age in the 4th interview month who are neither the head of a
family nor the spouse of a head. Individuals in 9 states that are not separately identified are
dropped. We constructed nuclear families for the children in our sample using information on
relationship to household head, family status, and relationship to family head. In most cases the
re-constructed families correspond to the members of the SIPP households. In cases where a
child and his or her parent(s) live with other adults, however, our families include only the
children and parent(s) of the appropriate subfamily. This definition corresponds to the family
benefit unit that would be potentially eligible for AFDC or Medicaid. Variables such as family
income and family structure are then calculated by summing the individual values for people in
the family. We also assign family-specific poverty thresholds based on family size and year.
        To determine the maximum income cutoff for AFDC, we merge AFDC benefit levels and
need standards to individuals, based on state of residence and family size. There are two income
tests that a family must pass in order to qualify for AFDC – the “gross test”, which requires that a
family’s gross income be less than 1.85 times the state’s need standard, and the “net test”, which
requires that a family’s income after disregards be less than the state’s payment standard. In
determining AFDC eligibility, families are permitted to disregard actual child care expenses up
to a maximum of $175 per month ($200 per month for children under 2). Since we do not know
actual child care expenses, we assume that families can deduct the full disregard for all children
under age 6, and no disregard for older children. This assumption overstates the amount of the
disregard for families that use informal or low cost care. Income eligibility cutoffs for Medicaid
are determined using the age of the child, the ratio of family income to the family-specific
poverty line, and the parameters of the relevant state Medicaid programs.

Current Population Surveys
        We use data for individuals 18 and younger who are neither the head of a family nor the
spouse of a head from the 1989-1999 March Current Population Surveys. Since subfamilies are
identified directly in the CPS, we use subfamily income and poverty levels to assign income
relative to the family poverty level. Income eligibility cutoffs for AFDC and Medicaid are
determined as in the SIPP. We use information on health insurance coverage from the
individual responses and the children’s recoded variables to assign Medicaid and other insurance
coverage.

Health Interview Surveys
        We use data for individuals age 18 or younger who are neither the head nor the spouse of
a head in the 1992-1996 Health Interview Surveys. We exclude observations with missing
family income, Medicaid coverage, parental status, or birth month/year. We assign midpoint
values to the HIS categorical annual family income variable, and we use information on the
number of individuals in the family to assign approximate family poverty lines. We assign
Medicaid coverage to individuals who report that they are covered by Medicaid or other public
                                              34

assistance health insurance programs. We assign overall coverage if an individual has Medicaid,
private health insurance, or military coverage.
