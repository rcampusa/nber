We use a UK employer-employee administrative earnings dataset to investigate the response of
earnings and hours to business cycles. Exploiting our long panel of data from 1975 to 2020 we
find wide heterogeneity in the exposure of different types of workers to aggregate shocks.
Employees who are younger, male, lower-skilled, non-union, and working in smaller private
sector firms show the largest earnings response to recessions. The qualitative patterns of earnings
changes across workers observed in the COVID-19 recession are broadly as predicted using the
previously estimated exposures and size of the GDP shock. This suggests the COVID-19
recession in terms of its impact responses was relatively similar to those that have gone before,
but the GDP shock was far larger in absolute size. Compared to aggregate shocks, we find a
relatively small role of firm-specific shocks, suggesting macro shocks play an outsized role in
individual earnings dynamics.

           We use a UK employer-employee administrative earnings dataset to investigate the response
       of earnings and hours to business cycles. Exploiting our long panel of data from 1975 to
       2020 we find wide heterogeneity in the exposure of different types of workers to aggregate
       shocks. Employees who are younger, male, lower-skilled, non-union, and working in smaller
       private sector firms show the largest earnings response to recessions. The qualitative patterns of
       earnings changes across workers observed in the COVID-19 recession are broadly as predicted
       using the previously estimated exposures and size of the GDP shock. This suggests the COVID-
       19 recession in terms of its impact responses was relatively similar to those that have gone
       before, but the GDP shock was far larger in absolute size. Compared to aggregate shocks, we
       find a relatively small role of firm-specific shocks, suggesting macro shocks play an outsized
       role in individual earnings dynamics.



1 Introduction
The UK has recently made available its earnings microdata covering the initial part of the COVID-
19 pandemic, offering an early window into the impact likely to be seen in the US and other
countries. This data spans from 1975 to 2020, providing earnings data over four recessions. Before
examining the impact of recessions on earnings, we start by analyzing some of the trends in earnings

dynamics seen in the UK to set the broader picture for analyzing the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic. As in the US, earnings inequality has been rising in the UK for both men and women,
particularly in the top 1%, while earnings volatility for men has been falling but is flat for women.
    Following the broad investigation of inequality, volatility and mobility, we narrow our focus
onto the responsiveness of earnings and hours to aggregate and firm-level shocks. We estimate
an aggregate earnings GDP beta of 0.38, meaning that a 1% increase in GDP is associated with
a 0.38% increase in earnings. However, we provide evidence of strong asymmetries, with this
elasticity rising to 0.73 in expansionary periods and falling close to zero in recessions. Leveraging
data on hours, we find a relatively large hours response to GDP fluctuations, with an elasticity
estimate of 0.16. Again, there are asymmetries, but these are in the opposite direction to earnings,
with hours responses coming mostly from recessionary periods.
    A unique aspect of our data is that it is updated frequently, meaning that it already includes
earnings data for 2020. This allows us to provide some early evidence on the earnings response
to the COVID recession. For administrative-quality earnings data, which is often associated with
a significant time delay, this is unusual. Our core results suggest that both on aggregate and in
cross-group comparisons, the earnings hit is close to what we would have predicted given the size
of the shock - in that sense, this time is not so different. This striking pattern is displayed in Figure
1, where we compare the estimated effect of the COVID-19 shock on the earnings of different
groups to the predicted effect based on historically-estimated earnings-GDP betas and the size of
the shock.

Section 3 we present a series of descriptive patterns in income inequality, volatility and mobility.
In Section 4 we exploit the long time dimension of our dataset to estimate the effect of aggregate
economic shocks on workers' earnings and hours. We show that there is substantial heterogeneity
across workers in their response to aggregate shocks and that the patterns are generally consistent
with those found in the United States (Guvenen, Schulhofer-Wohl, et al., 2017). We also expand
on the comparison of the COVID-19 shock and previous shocks, and inspect the effect of the UK's
furlough scheme. Finally, we report estimates of the impact of firm-level shocks on earnings before
concluding in Section 5.


2 Data
2.1    Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings


Our analysis requires data with detailed information on earnings and a long panel component. For
the UK the only available dataset which meets these requirements is the Annual Survey of Hours
and Earnings (ASHE), formerly named the New Earnings Survey (NES).12 This is the premier
source of earnings information in the UK and forms the basis for many official wage statistics. It
is a 1% sample of all employees, with a panel structure which makes it possible to follow workers
over time. The study has been used extensively for research on inequality, and due to its detailed
earnings information also for studies on wage rigidities (Nickell and Quintini, 2003; Elsby, Shin,
and Solon, 2016). Firm identifiers have also been included, allowing it to be used for studies on the
role of within and between-firm inequality (Schaefer and Singleton, 2019).
    The panel dataset is available back to 1975 and is administered by the Office for National Statis-
tics (ONS). Workers enter the sample frame by having a particular pair of digits at the end of their
National Insurance Number (NIN), the UK equivalent of a Social Security Number, assigned to
all workers upon labor market entry. Surveyers then identify the employer(s) of these individu-
als by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) Pay As You Earn (PAYE) system, the UK
government's income tax withholding system. This takes place each January.
    Survey forms are then typically sent to employers requesting information on the worker(s) in the
sampling frame who are identified as working for that employer in the PAYE records. Employers
complete the forms using information from payroll records. For larger employers, much of the
process is automated, with surveyors accessing payroll records and extracting information directly.

    2 The dataset is also sometimes called the New Earnings Survey Panel Dataset. Throughout the paper, we refer to

the dataset as ASHE.


                                                        4
The survey covers both the public and private sectors, and as it is administered via employers it
excludes the self-employed, who constitute approximately 15% of UK employment as of 2019.
The survey delivers useable information on 140,000 to 180,000 employees each year. Workers are
followed throughout their entire working lives, so years can be combined to form a panel dataset.
    The variables consistently available throughout the entire period include detailed wage and
hours information for a snapshot period in April. Wages are broken down into standard and over-
time pay. Studies using ASHE tend to use either weekly or hourly wages. From 1998 ASHE also
provides a measure of annual earnings over the previous April-April tax year. This variable refers
only to annual earnings at the worker's current employer, so needs to be used with caution as for
workers who move employers, this will cover only part of their annual salary.3 Wages in ASHE are
not top-coded.
    Earnings are deflated by CPI and given in 2018 GBP unless otherwise noted. To retain anonymity,
where percentiles or percentile-based statistics are reported, data are binned into groups of 10 indi-
viduals and each individual is assigned the group mean.
    This data misses out some important components of income. Most importantly, as pay refers
only to pay received within a particular reference period, for the most part this will miss bonus
pay. These payments are in theory captured by asking employers to proportionately allocate any
incentive or bonus payments made outside the survey week, provided the incentive was related to
work in that week. However, a large share of bonuses do not appear to be captured in the weekly
data. Bell and Van Reenen (2014) show that bonuses are an important component of the top 1%
inequality, and this issue is covered in more detail in Bell, Bloom, and Blundell (2021).
    The hours data refer to the total hours the employee worked in the reference week, accord-
ing to the employer. The hours variable is more accurate for hourly-paid workers. As is typical
in administrative employer-reported hours data, there is significant bunching at a handful of dis-
crete thresholds representing standard contracts. For some workers, these will not reflect the true
hours worked over the week. As discussed in Ritchie (2005), hours for non-manual workers are
consistently lower in this data than as reported in household surveys.
    The worker's three-digit occupation code is also available, along with age and sex. This is used
to assign a skill level to each worker using the UK government's skill level classifications.4 This is
possible only for years 2011 onwards. Employer identifiers, which allow the linking of other ONS
and external data are available from 2002 onwards.5 We also use a variable indicating whether

of work permit holders.
    5 The `entref' ID variable refers to the `enterprise', which is close to the typical definition of a `firm' and is the

standard grouping of organizations used by the ONS. Formally, an enterprise is the smallest combination of legal units
(based on VAT of PAYE records) that is an organizational unit producing goods or services, benefiting from a degree
of autonomy in decision-making, especially for the allocation of current resources. Enterprises carry out one or more

or not a worker's wage is covered by a collective agreement, which we will use as a measure of
unionization.6 There is also an indicator for whether or not a worker is in the public sector.
    Whilst the information in ASHE is thought to be of exceptionally high quality, not all workers
are covered. Firstly, employees that work at businesses outside of the interdepartmental business
register (IDBR) are excluded as they cannot be identified in the tax administration records. These
are typically very small businesses who fall below the Value Added Tax (VAT) threshold. Currently,
the threshold is set to a turnover of GBP 85,000 (USD 110,000). Relatedly, employees who earn
below the National Insurance Lower Earnings Limit (LEL) are not subject to PAYE tax withholding,
so will not be in the PAYE system. The current LEL is set to 120 GBP, or approximately 150 USD
per week. This means that a number of the very lowest-paid workers are omitted from the survey.
A minimum-wage earner working 15 hours per week in the UK makes 130 GBP, so the majority
of missing workers will be those working fewer than 15 hours a week on the minimum wage. This
is a small group, and will disproportionately be made up of women, who are more likely to work
part time. The ONS estimates that biases caused by omitting these missing firms and employees
are likely to be small, though it is difficult to precisely quantify their extent. Workers falling below
the LEL are not necessary excluded. As Ritchie (2005) points out "because tax records are held
over, even if no tax is paid in a particular year, rather more are included than might be expected".
    The two issues above are due to the administrative process of constructing the sampling frame.
However, a comparison of sample sizes in ASHE to employment count estimates suggests there to
be non-negligible non-response issues. Appendix Figure 11 compares the number of jobs appearing
in ASHE to 1% of the estimated aggregate number, provided by the ONS and drawn from a variety
of data sources. Between 30% and 40% of jobs are missing for most periods. We see that the share
missing is broadly stable from 1975-1996, then falls in the late 1990s before stabilizing again from
2000. It is not clear why this fall in coverage occurs, and this pattern means we must be cautious
when interpreting changes which occur in the mid-late 1990s.
    There are two points at which coverage falls below 50%. The first come in 2007 and 2008.
In these years, there was a temporary reduction in the sample size, which the ONS stated was
due to `work priority' reasons. Reductions were "targeted on those industries that exhibit the least
variation in their earnings patterns". This means that we should interpret the estimates for these
two years with caution, particularly when looking at earnings changes. The second comes in 2020,
which is attributable for the timing of the survey, during the first lockdown of the COVID-19 crisis.
The disruption caused by the crisis likely led to a number of firms not entering their information.
activities at one or more locations and may be sole legal units.
    6 For those covered by collective agreements at the national, sectoral or regional level, this is coded as 1. For those

covered by collective agreements at the organizational or workplace level, this is coded as 0. The share of workers
covered by unions according to this variable declines from just over half in 1975 to around a quarter in the most recent
years, in line with government statistics on trade union membership.

    At the worker level, the cause of non-response is primarily that the employee has moved em-
ployers between the point at which employers are identified in the tax data and the point at which
the survey is sent out (Ritchie, 2005). It can also be that employers have retained previous workers
in their PAYE records, despite the fact that they no longer work there. Bird (2004) reports that
in 2003, 12% of responses stated that the employee in question had left the business. This means
that job movers are under-sampled in ASHE. The second type of non-response is at the firm level.
Businesses are legally obliged to comply, though it is not clear how well this is enforced in prac-
tice. It is possible to identify in the data a small number of cases which are strongly suggestive
of complete firm non-response. Ritchie (2005) estimates that return rates on the ASHE forms are
typically 95%.7
    When an individual is missing, it is not possible to observe why this is. This makes the dataset
inappropriate for studying movements into or out of employment. Missing individuals could be
unemployed, have left the labor market or migrated abroad, be self-employed or be missing due
to the reasons described above. Missingness is non-random, with those who change jobs more
frequently more likely to become missing, along with women, low earners and workers at smaller
firms.
    Up to and including 2003, very little changed in the methodology underlying the survey. In
2004, the NES formally became ASHE. The most important change for the current paper is that the
latter attempts to improve on the tracing of workers who change jobs just before the survey period.
Originally, the NES finds workers from tax records in January or February, and bases their form
send-out addresses on this. From 2004, ASHE used an additional later date to identify new leavers
/ joiners. ASHE also included more small business which did not operate within the standard tax
withholding (PAYE) system. This was done using a supplemental survey. Finally, there is some
imputation of aspects of earnings and hours in the dataset, but this does not apply to our main
earnings and hours variables. Given these changes, we ought to be cautious when interpreting any
trend breaks around this time.
    For Section 3 of this paper in which we inspect trends in inequality, volatility and mobility, we
restrict our analysis to workers aged 25-55. As is standard when using ASHE data, we exclude
those whose pay is affected by absence in the reference week. Some papers using this data exclude
those on training / apprenticeship wages. In practice, the age restriction means that this applies to
very few workers in our sample, and irrespective of this, in our view a study of workers' wages
over time should account for these earnings.
    Unless otherwise noted we drop a number of workers at the bottom of each year's earnings
distribution, in order to select only those with reasonable labor market attachment. For years 1999
onwards, we drop those with weekly earnings below 7x the minimum wage, corresponding to one
  7 Limited   weights are available for the most recent years, but for consistency over time we do not use these.


                                                           7
days work for a low-wage worker. For the years before then, we scale the 1999 minimum wage by
median real earnings growth to calculate a pseudo minimum wage. Our threshold is 7x this value.
     Throughout the paper we refer to `raw', `residual' and `permanent' log earnings. Raw log earn-
ings corresponds to real weekly earnings above the threshold discussed in the previous paragraph,
unless specified otherwise. Residual log earnings is the residual of raw log earnings regressed on
individual age dummies for each year and each gender separately. Permanent log earnings in year
t is the average of year t - 2, t - 1 and t earnings, including any earnings that fall below the thresh-
old. Averaged earnings across these years are then residualized on age within year and gender. To
be assigned a value for permanent earnings, individuals must have above-threshold earnings for at
least two of the three years.
     We draw on three samples, CS (cross-sectional), LX (longitudinal) and H (heterogeneity). The
CS sample is made up of all those with earnings above the lower threshold. The LX sample is a
subset of this group for whom we also observe above-threshold earnings for years t + 1 and t + 5,
so that we can produce statistics based on one and five year changes. The H sample is a further
subset, for whom we are able to build a measure of permanent income in t - 1 as discussed above.8
     Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for the CS sample by year. Panel (a) shows mean real weekly
earnings for men and women, the share of female workers in the sample and the age distribution.
Panel (b) shows earnings percentiles.
     Tables 11 and 12 in the Appendix show summary statistics for the LX and H samples respec-
tively. Unsurprisingly given the issue of missingness, conditioning on having 1 and 5 year earnings
changes leads to a substantial drop in the sample size, as does having enough data to construct
permanent income in the H sample. Comparing LX to CS, we lose around half the sample. The LX
sample is younger by construction, similar in income and slightly less female. Younger workers
and those in the middle age bracket (36-45) are more likely to remain in the LX sample. Older indi-
viduals fall out of the sample when we require earnings at t + 1 and t + 5 due to the age restriction.
Relative to the LX sample, the H sample is older. Younger workers are mechanically omitted due
to a lack of earnings history. Given this, it is unsurprising that the H sample have higher earnings
than both LX and CS.


2.2    Firm-level data


Our firm-level data comes from two sources. Firstly, we use an ONS dataset called the Annual Re-
spondents Database (ARD),9 which is constructed from the Annual Business Inquiry (ABI) survey.
   8 When    presenting results from the LX and H samples using only one-year forward differences, we do not require
the sample to also have five-year. This means that the LX and H sample differs depending on whether one or five-year
changes are being presented.

We use data from 2002 to 2014, the latest year available. The survey is a census of large establish-
ments (250 employees or more) and a stratified sample of small and medium-sized enterprises.10
Larger firms appear in the sample throughout, but smaller firms move in and out. Stratification
for the smaller and medium-sized enterprises is based on industry, employment and country. We
use a measure of value added at factor cost at the firm level, which is derived by the ONS from
National Statistics, [original data producer(s)]. UK Data Service. SN: 7989, http://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-7989-4
   10 Sampling is actually performed at the reporting unit level, which in most cases coincides with the enterprise unit

level.

reported turnover and intermediate purchases. We then form our main labor productivity measure
by dividing by employment. Our employment data is drawn from the Inter-Departmental Busi-
ness Register (IDBR). While this approach represents the best-quality firm-level labor productivity
data available, there is likely to be measurement error. This will in part be due to mis-reported
or mis-recorded information on the components of productivity, but also due to timing issues, and
particularly a timing mis-match between value added and employment.
    To complement the ARD, we also use company accounts data from Bureau van Dijk's FAME
database. This contains company accounts data which we use to generate an alternative measure
of value added, which we calculated as the sum of each firm's operating profit and total staff costs.
We divide this by the number of employees in the FAME data, as reported in company accounts
for that year. Again, for the reasons discussed above there will likely be measurement error in this
calculation.
    A further issue with the FAME productivity data is that matching FAME to ONS data is im-
perfect. Matching has been performed via a lookup table held by the ONS which contains entref-
company number links for 2014-2018. For years prior to this, we backfill using the most recent
entref match available. This should detect firms whether they survive to 2014 or not, though cover-
age becomes less reliable for earlier years. This is exacerbated by older extinct firms being dropped
from the FAME database.
    Companies included in FAME may be subsidiaries of one-another, or part of a parent group.
In these cases, the FAME company number matches to multiple entrefs. When this occurs, we
check the population and turnover figures against the Business Structure Database (BSD)11 , the
main business register. This allows us to identify the most likely matches in cases where there is
ambiguity. This also helps exclude incorrect matches in the early part of the sample. Relative to the
ARD, the disadvantage is that despite best efforts, there will be some incorrectly-matched firms.
For this reason, we use ARD as our main source of firm-level information and will use FAME as
an instrument, to be discussed below.
    Appendix Table 9 shows the number of firms and workers in our worker-firm match sample,
along with summary statistics at the firm level. Panel (a) shows this for the ARD. We see that
between 31% and 40% of workers are matched to firm-level value-added measures in the ARD.12
Appendix Table 10 shows that on average, matched workers are at larger employers than in the full
sample, due to the nature of the ARD sample construction. They are also higher earning, older,
more likely to be male and more likely to be full-time workers.

3 Descriptive patterns in Inequality, Volatility and Mobility
To set the background for the analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic we first provide a battery of de-
scriptive patterns covering income inequality, volatility and mobility. We provide historical context
where appropriate, and refer the reader to Appendix A for more details on macroeconomic trends
and labor market institutions.


3.1   Inequality


Much has been written on the long-term trend of rising UK wage inequality. A succinct review
of inequality patterns and research contributions is provided by Hills et al. (2010), Machin (2011)
and more recently in Brewer (2019). The Deaton review at the Institute for Fiscal Studies presents
a thorough overview of wage inequality and how it relates to household income inequality. The
patterns we show here are consistent with this existing evidence, and provide important background
to the following sections on volatility and mobility.
     Figure 2 shows trends in log earnings percentiles. In panel (a) we can see strong male median
real wage growth throughout the 1980s, late 1990s and early 2000s. The period since the 2008
recession has been characterized by an extended decline in real wages, with only partial recovery
in the final part of the sample. As will be more clearly demonstrated in the figures to follow, the
period saw a widening of the wage distribution, with the greatest wage growth being felt at the top
percentiles. Panel (b) shows a contrasting picture for female workers. Median wage growth has
been stronger and shown more signs of recovery post-2008. While the top percentiles have growth
fastest over the period as a whole for women, wage growth has occurred across the distribution.
     Panels (c) and (d) demonstrate a pronounced fanning out of earnings within the top decile of
the earnings distribution, with the top 0.01% of earners seeing the largest growth over the period.
     Figure 3 shows trends in earnings dispersion. In panel (a), we can see the steady increase in
male earnings inequality both for the parametric (2.56*standard deviation) and non-parametric (P90
- P10) measure. This increase has tapered off and gone into decline since 2010, though dispersion
remains high relative to previous decades. In panel (b), we see that for women, inequality has been
roughly flat or falling since the mid 1990s. Panels (c) and (d) decompose aggregate dispersion into
right tail (P90 - P50) and left tail (P50 - P10) dispersion. For men, we can see that both right and
left tail dispersion have contributed to the overall rise in inequality over the period. The decline in
inequality felt in recent years comes entirely from the P50-P10 tail. Returning to Figure 2, we see
that significant wage growth in the 10th percentile has resulted in a closing of the gap between the

lowest and average earners. For women, the picture is different. We see that the substantial rise in
inequality from 1975-1995 was driven primarily by increases in P50 - P10. Since the mid 1990s,
this has been in decline. P90 - P50 on the other hand has been increasing steadily throughout, up
until the most recent years.
    It has been argued that since its introduction in 1999 the minimum wage has successfully
propped up the lower part of the earnings distribution, particularly among women.13 This is consis-
tent with that, though the fall in female P50-P10 predates its introduction. The largest single-year
increase in the minimum wage relative to average real wages came in 2016, with the introduction of
the `National Living Wage' (NLW), which was effectively a large increase in the minimum wage.
    13 The                         Low Pay Commission (LPC, 2020a) states that in 1999, 3.4% of jobs were covered. By 2018, this had grown
to 7.0%.

In both the female and male wage distributions, it is possible to see the strong 1-year increase in the
10th percentile, and a substantial drop in P50-P10 for this year. The rising minimum wage coupled
with low aggregate real wage growth has led to a decline in the dispersion of earnings.
    Considering the period as a whole, there have been many explanations offered for the rise of
wage inequality. Increasing education premiums account for some of the gap, with the wage gaps
between graduates and non-graduates rising particularly fast throughout the 1980s and 1990s. A
key factor underpinning rising inequality has been a relative increase in the demand for skilled
workers. Labor market polarization (Goos and Manning, 2007) is also part of the story, with the
share of jobs with the lowest and highest average occupational pay growing the fastest. Various
studies of skill-biased technical change (Berman, Bound, and Machin, 1998; Machin and Van


                                                                                 13
Reenen, 1998) have found support for technology being an important part of the story of rising
wage inequality in the UK.

    Figure 4 shows inequality for those aged 25, close to the start of a workers' career.14 In panel
(a), we see that male bottom-tail inequality has been rising throughout most of the period, partic-
    14 In                        the UK, it is unusual to remain in tertiary education past the age of 25.

                                                                                     14
ularly since the early 2000s. Top-tail inequality has been relatively stable. The picture is broadly
similar for female workers aged 25, though the sharp increase in bottom-tail inequality began ear-
lier. There is a marked difference between the aggregate inequality patterns shown previously and
those seen among the youngest workers.
     In Figure 5 we show how earnings inequality progresses over the life cycle for different cohorts.
The 1975 cohort here refers to workers aged 25 in 1975, so those born in 1950. The blue line shows
earnings inequality among these workers throughout their working lives. The red line shows the
same for the cohort born 10 years later. The gray dashed lines show earnings for individuals of
25, 30, 35 and 40 years of age over time, as indicated by the arrow markers. For men, we see that
inequality is increasing at a steady and relatively constant rate within cohort as each cohort ages.
Comparing the two figures, we see that dispersion changes over the lifecycle more for women
(panel (b)) than for men (panel (a)). Women see a large increase in dispersion between ages 25 and
35. For women, all the increase in dispersion comes in the first decade of labor market experience,
unlike among men for whom dispersion increases over the lifecycle.


3.2   Volatility


Similar to what has been found in the US, studies of income and earnings volatility in the UK have
found a variety of results which are not always consistent with one-another, and vary by dataset and
methodology. Most of the existing work on income dynamics in the UK has used survey data, and
is best reviewed in Jenkins (2011a). The BHPS has been used in Jenkins (2011b) and Cappellari
and Jenkins (2014), the latter of which uses non-parametric measures similar to those of this paper,
finding a slight decline in earnings volatility. Francesco Devicienti (2011) fits several variance
component model specifications to BHPS data and finds little change over time. Ramos (2003)
on the other hand uses the same data to show an increase in the transitory component of earnings
from 1991-1999. Dickens (2000) finds an increase in the transitory variance of earnings using the
New Earnings Survey from 1985-1995. Dickens and McKnight (2008) using the Lifetime Labor
Markets Database (LLMDB) find falling mobility for men. Kalwij and Alessie (2007) use NES
data to show increases in both the transitory and permanent component of wages between 1975 and
2001.
    We contribute to this literature by examining a longer time period, and using non-parametric
methods which are increasingly recognized for their robustness and rely on few assumptions of un-
derlying earnings processes, but which require a large amount of data. We present various statistics
on workers' earnings changes over 1-year and 5-year periods. These figures show that consis-
tent with the US evidence in Guvenen, Karahan, et al. (2015) earnings changes are leptokurtic,
exhibiting substantial deviations from the log normal distribution. In terms of skewness, for one-


                                                 15
year earnings changes we find a relatively symmetric distribution. For five-year changes we find
negative skewness, in line with the recent US evidence. 15

    In Figure 6 we show top and bottom tail dispersion in 1-year log earnings changes. In panel (a),
we see spikes in P50-P10 and drops in P90-P50 around recessions for men. The spike in the most
recent recession (2020) stands out as an outlier. The most recent recession dwarfs the previous
three in terms of its effect on lower-tail wage volatility. For both men and women, the P50-P10
statistic is higher in 2020 than in any previous period. As will be discussed later in this article, this
likely stems from large wage cuts associated with being furloughed during the COVID-19 shock.
    In terms of aggregate volatility, as measured by the sum of P90-P50 and P50-P10, for men
there appears to have been a decline in volatility from the mid-1990s onwards, with fewer workers
seeing large wage changes relative to the median. As in the US, this was a period of macroeconomic
stability in the UK, and the patterns here match those in Sabelhaus and Song (2010). The trend is
less clear for women.
    Figure 7 shows non-parametric measures of skewness and kurtosis of one-year earnings changes
over time.16 Reflecting the patterns discussed in the previous figure, skewness is strongly pro-
cyclical, dropping in recessions. The pattern is more visible for men than for women, reflecting a
greater sensitivity to business cycle fluctuations among male workers. This figure also again shows
   15 The
        lack of any skewness in one-year changes may reflect the under-sampling of movers in the ASHE dataset.
Where possible we present both 1 and 5 year earnings changes.

3.3                                                  Mobility


In this section we present patterns of wage mobility. Whereas the previous section of volatility,
focused on absolute wage changes, here we look at how individual workers' positions in the income
distribution evolves over time.
    Figure 8 shows 10-year mobility for two different age groups. The lines give the mean per-
centile of workers in the t + 10 permanent income distribution for workers at different points in the
permanent income distribution at year t . Permanent income is defined as in the data section above.
The dashed diagonal black line corresponds to perfect immobility. For both men and women, we
see that stickiness is greater at the top of the distribution than the bottom, which the curve lines be-
coming steep in the top few percentiles. Mobility is declining in age for both genders. As workers
age, their position in the income distribution becomes stickier.
    Figure 9 shows how 10-year mobility has evolved over time. For men, we see a decline in
mobility from 1977 through 1990 to 2015. To the left of the intersection with the 45 degree line, the
line for the first year is above those for the later years. To the right of the intersection, it lies below
them. Stickiness at the top increased from 1977 to 1990, before falling back somewhat in 2005.

This is consistent with Dickens and McKnight (2008), who find that male earnings mobility fell
throughout the 1980s and 1990s. For women, there is little change across most of the distribution,
though 10-year stickiness has increased towards the top of the distribution.

4 Wage and hours responses to aggregate and rm-level shocks
In this section we exploit the long time dimension of our dataset and the availability of information
on hours, to explore how aggregate and firm-level shocks affect workers' wages and hours. We also
exploit the recent availability of data for 2020 to examine the impact of the COVID recession and
compare it with previous recessions.


4.1       Aggregate shocks


Here we estimate how workers' wages and hours respond to changes in real GDP. This relates to
a recent literature using administrative data (Guvenen, Schulhofer-Wohl, et al., 2017) and an older
literature on wage cyclicality (Devereux and Hart, 2006). In column (1) of Table 2 we report the
estimated elasticity of (weekly) earnings with respect to GDP, obtained by regressing changes in log
weekly earnings on changes in log real GDP. The estimate, which we will refer to as `GDP beta',
is 0.381, meaning that a 1% increase in real GDP is associated with an increase of roughly 0.4%
in real weekly earnings.17 In column (2), we include an indicator for whether or not the economy
is in recession, defined by a period of negative real GDP growth, whilst in column (3) we allow for
asymmetries in the elasticity, interacting the recession indicator with GDP growth. Columns (2) and
(3) make it clear that there are strong asymmetries. Column (3) shows that in non-recession years,
the elasticity is 0.73, almost double the aggregate number from column (1). Out of the 45 years for
which we construct earnings changes, only 5 are recessions. These 5 years have a strong impact
on the overall GDP beta. This suggests that estimates of GDP beta require long time dimensions
to be estimated robustly. With short panels, the estimated coefficient will strongly depend on the
number of recession years in the sample. The negative coefficient on the recession interaction in
column (3) demonstrates that workers are protected from large earnings declines during recessions,
consistent with previous UK evidence in Gregg, Machin, and Fernández-Salgado (2014).
  17 We have performed an exercise in which we compare the GDP response of annual earnings to that of weekly
earnings. For the overlapping years, the estimates approximately coincide.

    In columns (4), (5) and (6) we repeat the exercise for changes in log hours of work. From
column (4), we can see that hours responses are relatively large. The coefficient of 0.155 is around
two-fifths of the coefficient in column (1), suggesting that a significant share of the response of
weekly earnings to aggregate fluctuations can be explained by changes in hours worked. Given the
discussion of our hours variable in the data section, if anything this is likely to be an underestimate
of the importance of hours.
    Columns (5) and (6) again show strong asymmetries. In non-recession years, the coefficient
falls below 0.05. Comparing the first row of column (6) to that of column (3) suggests that in non-
recession years, a small share of the weekly earnings response can be explained by hours changes.
The high coefficient in column (4) can be explained by strong declines in hours of work in recession
years.
    The results of Table 2 are consistent with the large body of work on wage rigidities. In re-
cessions, as hourly wages cannot be reduced sufficiently, to reduce labor costs firms reduce hours
of work. In times of economic growth, hours are relatively unresponsive to differences in growth
rates. Instead, adjustment comes through hourly wages.
    Next we explore how the estimated GDP beta varies across worker characteristics, asking
whether workers bear the incidence of aggregate shocks equally. We find patterns that closely
match those for the US presented in Guvenen, Schulhofer-Wohl, et al. (2017).
    In Table 3 column (1) we interact the change in GDP with gender. We see that women's earnings
are less responsive to aggregate shocks, with an estimated elasticity of 0.28 relative to an estimate of
0.47 for men. In column (2) we interact with a set of age group dummies. Responsiveness is highest

                                                         20
for the youngest workers (the omitted group), decreasing with age for most of the distribution
before rising again for the oldest workers. In column (3) we include an indicator for public sector
and an indicator for unionization. As the two are highly correlated, unlike in the other columns we
include both predictors in the same regression. We see that both have a dampening effect on the
estimated relationship. Those in the public sector experience half the aggregate earnings risk of
those in the private sector.
    Next in column (4) we include firm size dummies. Responsiveness to aggregate shocks is high-
est for workers with the smallest employers (the omitted group). Those working for employers with
2000 or more employees have an estimated GDP beta which is a quarter of that of those at employ-
ers with under 100 employees. In column (5) we estimate heterogeneity by skill level. The earnings
of those in higher skilled occupations are less responsive to GDP. Those in high skilled occupation
bear around a third of the aggregate earnings risk as those in low skilled occupations.18 Finally
in column (6) we report heterogeneity estimates by quantile of the wage distribution (an alterna-
tive skill measure), which again points to reduced exposure to aggregate fluctuations for the most
skilled.
    In Table 4 we perform the same exercise with hours as the outcome variable. In column (1), we
can see that as was the case with earnings, women's hours are less responsive to aggregate shocks.
When it comes to age, the patterns are different. The hours of the youngest workers are actually
the least responsive to aggregate shocks. Older workers, and particularly those aged over 55, see
the most responsiveness of hours to aggregate shocks. In column (3), we see that as with earnings,
public sector workers are shielded from changes in hours. However, union-covered workers' hours
are more responsive to aggregate shocks. This makes sense if one considers that wage rigidities
are particularly binding for this group, so hours adjustments become more attractive for employers
faced with shocks. For firm size in column (4), we see the same patterns as when the outcome
variable was weekly earnings, with those at larger employers seeing a lower responsiveness. In
column (5), we see that low skilled workers are the most responsive in terms of hours. As the
sample for the final result includes only the COVID-19 recession, we again stress caution when
interpreting these estimates. Due to the furlough scheme, discussed further below, hours data from
2020 are likely to be less reliable than for other years.
  18 Forthis column, we are only able to use data from 2011 onwards, so these estimates will to a significant extent be
driven by the most recent COVID-19 recession.

4.2    The 2020 recession


The data used for the UK are uniquely up-to-date. This enables us to investigate patterns in the
most recent recession. As shown in Section 3 of this paper, the COVID-19 shock has resulted in
substantial wage drops for many workers. Here we investigate this in more detail, focusing on the
size of the falls relative to previous recessions and on the role of the UK's furlough policy.19
    In Table 5 we inspect heterogeneity in earnings changes from April 2019 to April 2020, com-
paring this year to the previous 9 years of April to April wage changes. We see that qualitatively,
the earnings patterns of this recession appear similar to those of the average recession from the
previous section. To more directly compare the response of earnings in the COVID-19 recession
to those of previous shocks, in Figure 1 we plot the patterns predicted from the estimates reported
in Table 3 for a drop in GDP of 7.4%. This is the annual change in the monthly GDP index as
of March 2020 - the month just prior to the earnings data being reported. It is also close to the
overall fall in GDP for 2020, which was 9.9%. These are given in the "Predicted COVID-19 ef-
fect" bars.20 We then compare these with the figures reported in Table 5, indicated in the figure as
"Actual COVID-19 effect". Despite the very different causes of the COVID-19 recession, in terms
of earnings the relative size of the effects are very close to what would have been predicted given
the size of the GDP shock and the historic beta estimates. Across all workers, the predicted effect
on earnings is 2.8%, which is a little greater than the actual estimated effect of 2.3%.21 This broad
similarity of previous shocks and the COVID-19 shock in terms of labor market effects has also
been shown in survey data by Bell, Codreanu, and Machin (2020).
    As in previous recessions, younger workers are the most exposed to the COVID-19 shock in
terms of earnings, followed by the very oldest workers. Higher earners are less exposed, with
the COVID-19 recession seeing a steeper gradient across permanent earnings than that found in
previous years. COVID-19 has hit those in smaller firms the hardest, in line with our expectations
based on previous shocks. Despite the ample literature showing the shock to have a disproportionate
effect on female workers (Adams-Prassl et al., 2020; Alon et al., 2020), we find that in terms of
earnings, men experienced a larger shock. Our data are not well suited to studying the extensive
margin, however Bell, Codreanu, and Machin (2020) find little gender difference in the employment
effect of the COVID-19 recession.22 This suggests that including zero earnings would not change
the result here that male earnings have taken a harder hit than female earnings.
    As in previous recessions, those in the private sector and outside of union agreements have the
  19 The  caveat to this section is that firm non-response for this year was higher than in previous years, meaning the
sample is smaller. Non-response is not likely to be random, and a reasonable assumption is that firms who experienced
a greater negative shock were less likely to respond.
   20 The qualitative patterns from Table 3 and Table 4 hold with the latest recession excluded.
   21 This is approximate, and based on the results in Table 5.
   22 This is unlike in previous recessions, where male workers experienced greater drops in employment.

largest drops, with public sector unionized workers seeing wage increases relative to recent years.23
While the cause of the 2020 recession is unique, in terms of how it is affecting the earnings of
different workers, the qualitative patterns closely resemble those of previous recessions.
    On aggregate, 26% of workers are furloughed in our data in April 2020. This aligns well
with the ONS statistic of 27% for the same period across the UK workforce, derived from other
sources.24 The scheme was open to all employers, and enabled employers to furlough employees
in exchange for a cash grant of 80% of wages, up to GBP2,500 per month. The equivalent annual
salary of 2,500 per month is close to the median annual salary in the UK in 2020. The employer
can choose whether or not to top-up the remaining 20% of pay. While this changed later in the
crisis, in April 2020 workers were not able to work any hours for their employer if they had been
furloughed.
    Firstly, we investigate the characteristics of workers who were likely to be furloughed. In Table
6 columns (1) and (2) we show estimates from a linear probability model in which the outcome
variable is a binary indicator for whether a worker has been furloughed. In column (1) we can see
that furlough is more likely for women, younger workers, private sector and non-unionized workers,
those in smaller firms, low-skill workers and those with shorter firm tenures. These patterns are
consistent with the survey evidence presented in Adams-Prassl et al. (2020).
    Other than gender, we can see that the patterns here match those shown in the previous sub-
section. Those whose earnings tend to be more responsive to aggregate shocks are precisely those
who were furloughed in the COVID-19 crisis. In column (2), we investigate how the probability
of furlough varies by quintiles of permanent income, where permanent income is as defined above.
We see a strong profile, with those at the bottom of the permanent income distribution significantly
more likely to be furloughed.
    In Appendix Table 13 we show the analogous estimates for hours, conditional on not being
furloughed. The high prevalence of the furlough scheme makes these estimates difficult to interpret.
  23 These  responses are calculated by summing the relevant coefficients. This pattern likely in part reflects public pay
restraint since the Great Recession, meaning low increases in public pay in the early 2010s.

    Our data also indicates whether employers have opted to top up furloughed workers' salaries to
normal levels. This was asked directly, and has not been inferred from earnings data. In Table 6
columns (3) and (4) we repeat the specifications of columns (1) and (2) with an outcome variable
which equals one if the worker's wages are topped up by their employer.25 These regressions
include only furloughed workers. On aggregate, approximately half of furloughed workers had
their wages topped up by their employer. In column (3), we can see that middle-aged furloughed
workers are the most likely to have their pay topped up. The coefficient on public sector workers is
0.252, around half the mean value. Furloughed public sector workers are significantly more likely
to have their pay topped up than furloughed private sector workers. However, this is not due to
their union coverage. Unionized workers were actually less likely to have their pay topped up.
There is a U-shaped profile in firm size, with the smallest and largest firms the most likely to top
up furloughed workers wages. Higher skilled workers with more tenure were more likely to have
wages topped up.
    In column (4), we again include quintiles of permanent income, showing that workers with
higher incomes were more likely to have their wages topped up. Given the cap at 2,500 per month,
had these furloughed workers not had their salaries topped up, they would have seen far more
dramatic declines in incomes than lower earning furloughed workers.
  25 This refers to workers who despite being furloughed, saw no change from their normal rates of pay. Workers

whose pay is partially but not fully topped up will not be included.

    How is furlough associated with earnings changes? Table 7 contains coefficient estimates from
a set of regressions where the outcome variable is the change in log earnings between 2019 and
2020. Unsurprisingly, in column (1) we see that being furloughed is associated with a 15 log point
drop in earnings. While we include a wide set of controls including two-digit industry fixed effects,
we do not claim this to be causal, as there will be strong selection into which types of workers
are chosen for furlough. In column (2), furlough is split into those whose employer tops up their
salary and those whose do not. Even among workers whose salary is topped up, there is a greater
fall in earnings than in non-furloughed workers. This could be selection (on earnings trajectory),
or could be due to employers mis-interpreting the question. In column (3), we interact furlough
with permanent earnings. All interactions are estimated precisely and are insignificantly different
to zero. The zero coefficients here are interesting, as they suggest that the earnings drop associated

                                                           29
with being furloughed does not differ across workers of different permanent incomes.
    This is capturing two offsetting effects. While furloughed workers of higher incomes are more
likely to have their salaries topped up by employers, among the minority whose employers do not
top up their salaries, the income loss is substantial as they are paid the maximum furlough level of
GBP 2,500 per month. This is shown through the interactions in column (4). Workers of higher
permanent incomes who do not have their salaries topped up see a far greater fall in earnings from
2019-2020.
    The furlough scheme is the first of its kind in the UK. While it is challenging to assess the
causal impact of the introduction of the furlough scheme on earnings inequality and volatility, we
can see clearly here that those who are furloughed receive a substantial earnings shock on average,
and that those who were already low earners are most likely to be furloughed. However, given the
economic context, it has undoubtedly dampened the employment effects of the COVID-19 shock.
In a counterfactual without furlough, these furloughed workers would likely have been laid off, so
the effect of furlough is likely to have reduced overall inequality.


4.3   Firm-level shocks, earnings and hours


Having explored the role of aggregate shocks, we now turn to the transmission of firm-specific
shocks to workers. To do so, we run a series of earnings regressions, in which the measure of firm-
level performance is log value added per worker, consistent with the existing literature. Concerns
over measurement error and endogeneity, lead us to report both OLS and a set of IV estimates. The
results are shown in Table 8. Columns (1) to (4) use log weekly earnings as the outcome variable.
Panel (a) shows the OLS estimates and Panel (b) the IV estimates.
    In column (1) the instrument is the log of the average value added per worker among all the firms
in each firm's 3-digit industry, excluding the firm's own measure. This leave-out mean specification
is common in the rent-sharing literature, and uses industry-level productivity shocks to instrument
for firm-level productivity shocks. The instrument is strong, delivering an F-statistic of 35. The IV
coefficient is 0.065, an order of magnitude higher than the OLS estimate of 0.007. This large rise
in the coefficient when comparing OLS and IV is common in the literature. For example, Card,
F. Devicienti, and Maida (2014) using matched worker-firm Italian data report an OLS elasticity of
0.008 and an IV estimate of 0.029. As this is the most common approach in the literature and we
are able to use the largest sample for this instrument, we consider the IV estimate from column (1)
as our baseline specification.
    In column (2), an alternative instrument is used. We use the value added estimate from FAME
data to instrument our primary measure of value added, which comes from the ARD. The sample
is smaller here, as our matched FAME sample contains only a subset of firms in the ARD. If


                                                 30
measurement error is indeed an issue, and we assume the measurement error in the ARD and FAME
are uncorrelated, we can use the FAME-based measure as an instrument to remove the measurement
error in the ARD-based measure. The IV estimate however is similar to that of column (1), at 0.062.
This is consistent with measurement error being the issue that is addressed via instruments of these
types, rather than endogeneity.
    In column (3), we use the lagged value added per worker as an instrument. This delivers a
lower point estimate, of 0.028. Once again however, the qualitative pattern of the IV estimate being
substantially larger than the OLS estimate is maintained. In column (4), we jointly include all three
instruments. Hansen's overidentification test delivers a p-value of 0.672, so we cannot reject the
null that the overidentification restrictions are valid. The estimated coefficient is 0.061, close to our
baseline estimate.
    Columns (5)-(8) replicate columns (1)-(4) but with hours as the outcome. Whilst the IV esti-
mates are imprecisely estimated, and often insignificantly different from zero, the point estimates
suggest that perhaps a quarter of the response of weekly wages to firm-level shocks is coming
through an hours response. The ratio of the hours and earnings effects is close to that which we
found when estimating responses to aggregate shocks above.
    Overall, the results suggest that wages are moderately responsive to firm-level shocks. IV
estimates are significantly larger than the OLS estimates, and the evidence suggests that this is a
result of measurement error in the firm-level measure of value-added per worker. Even though the
IV estimates are larger, they are substantially smaller than the elasticity estimates for aggregate-
level shocks of around 0.4, suggesting that workers are significantly more exposed to aggregate
shocks than firm-level ones. This highlights how aggregate shocks like COVID-19 can have far
larger impacts on employee earnings than firm-level shocks, and hence the importance of using
long panels of micro-data spanning several recessions to estimate this macro response.


5 Conclusion
In this paper we start by using an employer-based administrative dataset on earnings and hours to
set out the key patterns in UK earnings dynamics from 1975 to 2020, with a particular focus on
the recent COVID-19 shock. Consistent with previous work, we demonstrate a significant rise in
earnings inequality throughout most of the period, with a leveling off in more recent years. We
then investigate the effect of aggregate shocks, finding that earnings and hours are procyclical. Ex-
ploiting our long panel of data from 1975 to 2020 we then investigate the response of earnings to
business cycles. We find wide heterogeneity in the exposure of different types of workers to aggre-
gate shocks. Employees who are younger, male, lower-skilled, non-union, and working in smaller
private sector firms show the largest earnings response to recessions. The qualitative patterns of

earnings changes across workers observed in the COVID-19 recession are broadly as predicted us-
ing the previously estimated exposures and size of the GDP shock. This suggests the COVID-19
recession in terms of its impact responses was relatively similar to those that have gone before, but
the GDP shock was far larger in absolute size. Compared to aggregate shocks, we find a relatively
small role of firm-specific shocks, suggesting macro shocks play an outsized role in individual
earnings dynamics.

A Background on the UK labor market
A.1    Macroeconomic trends


Figure 10 shows the evolution of annual real GDP growth, inflation and unemployment over the
period, which saw four recessions (1980-81, 1990-91, 2008-09 and 2020). The first five years of
the period was a particularly volatile period. The `winter of discontent' in 1978-79 saw widespread
industrial action, with the government clashing with unions in an attempt to bring high inflation
under control (Hay, 2009). The outcomes of these wage negotiations and the double digit inflation
rates combine to deliver unusual and highly unstable wage patterns over the period, which will be
evident in the wage data presented in Section 3.
    To combat inflation, in 1979 Margaret Thatcher's newly-elected conservative government tight-
ened monetary and fiscal policy (Backhouse, 2010). This led to the 1980-81 recession, which was
swiftly followed by high unemployment for most of the 1980s, peaking at 12% in 1984. Sterling
appreciated significantly, and the manufacturing sector was struck particularly severely. Following
a sharp rise in union power throughout the preceding decade, Thatcher's government was successful
in reducing the power of unions (Machin (2000), Blanchflower and Bryson (2008)).
    The mid to late 1980s saw high economic growth and rising inflation. Low interest rates led to
a boom in the housing market and income tax cuts helped fuel an increase in consumer spending.
In 1990 the boom turned to bust, the economy again entering a recession. This second recession
was shallower than that of 1980-81, with unemployment peaking at around 10% between 1992 and
1994. Unlike the previous crisis, house prices crashed, losing 10% of their value in 1990 (Pintér,
2019).
    The `great moderation' period from the early 1990s into the late 2000s is characterized by low
inflation, falling unemployment and steady growth. Relative to the US and many other European
countries, the UK did not experience an early 2000s recession. Throughout the period, output per
hour worked grew steadily at a rate of approximately 2% (Herz, 2020).
    The UK did however experience a sharp downturn in the Great Recession of 2008-9. The
economy contracted by over 5%, representing the deepest recession since the Second World War.
Given the scale of this recession, Figure 10 shows the employment effects to be relatively mild
in the short term. While employment held up, wages and productivity stagnated in the decade
that followed (Herz (2020), Crawford, Jin, and Simpson (2013)). During the 2010s there was
a substantial fiscal tightening. The Conservative government's austerity programme consisted of
sustained reductions in public spending and tax rises (Fetzer, 2019). This included cuts to public
services and a public sector pay freeze from 2011 and 2013, followed by commitments to wage
restraint since then (Cribb, Emmerson, and Sibieta, 2014).
    At the time of writing, we are still experiencing the 2020 COVID-19 recession. In terms of

aggregate growth, the UK has been particularly negatively affected. Figure 10 shows data up to
Q1 2020, at which point the fall looks relatively mild. In Q2 2020, real GDP was 21.7% lower
than it was a year earlier, dwarfing all previous downturns. For 2020 as a whole, GDP declined by
9.9% - one of the largest drops across the OECD. As elsewhere, the government have responded by
introducing unprecedented labor market support programmes. Most relevant to the current paper is
the furlough scheme, in which the government provides employers with 80% of employee wages,
on the condition that the worker is not performing any work at the time.
    Another key part of the story of the UK's economy over the period is migration. From 1975-
1995, net migration to the UK was stable. Since then, and particularly since 2004, net migration has
increased. In the years that followed the expansion of the EU in 2004, the UK saw high immigration
from Central and Eastern Europe (Dustmann and Frattini, 2014). Despite this, the share of foreign-
born population in the UK is comparable to that of other European countries (Eurostat, 2021). Since
the EU referendum in 2016, the number of EU workers moving to the UK has fallen, but the number
of non-EU workers has risen. Kerr et al. (2017) have shown that the UK is a particularly attractive
destination for high-skilled migrants. More recent work has used tax data to show that almost all
(85%) of the growth in the UK top 1% income share over the past 20 years can be attributed to
migration (Summers et al., 2020). Looking ahead, the UK's exit from the EU is likely to change
the UK's labor market substantially. European immigrants constitute a large share of workers in

                                                       40
particular sectors and occupations, and any worsening in the UK's access to international markets
may have substantial effects on some workers.
    In terms of labor force participation, The UK has not seen the long decline found in the US
(Krueger, 2017). Over the period under study, female labor force participation increased from
55% to 72%.26 The gender pay gap, as in the US, has been falling over the period (Petrongolo,
2019). Until very recently, part-time work has been rare among male workers, so the part-time pay
penalty plays an important role. Manning and Petrongolo (2008) report the gap to have widened
greatly over the period of study, and that it can be mostly explained by worker characteristics and
occupational differences.
    The UK has particularly strong geographical inequalities. Many of the highest-skill jobs, par-
ticularly in professional services, are found in London and the South-East. Previous industrial
heartlands of the Midlands, South Wales, the North West and the North East have lower wages and
high unemployment. While narrower today than in the 1980s, (Dolton, Rosazza-Bondibene, and
Wadsworth, 2011) show persistent differences in wages and employment by area.


A.2     Labor market institutions


Turning from macroeconomic trends to labor market institutions, the UK is typically thought to
occupy a relatively distinct space between US and European-style labor markets. Compared to
elsewhere in Europe, UK workers are provided little employment protection. Summarizing regu-
lation of individual worker dismissals, the OECD scores only the US, Switzerland and Canada as
offering less protection.27 A key labor market policy shift came in 1999 with the introduction of a
national minimum wage.28 Initially, this was low by international standards. It has risen substan-
tially in real terms and for most workers in 2020 was 60% of the median full-time hourly wage
(Dolton, Bondibene, and Wadsworth, 2010; LPC, 2020b). As a proportion of median full-time
wages, it is now among the highest in the world.
     As discussed in the previous section, aggregate union density begun a long downward trend
from 1980 onwards, a trend that occurs across sectors but most notably in manufacturing. The
public sector has remained highly unionized despite the decline in the private sector. While union
density has fallen dramatically, the decline in coverage of union-negotiated collective agreements
has been significantly less precipitous (Bryson and Forth, 2011).
     The labor market has seen a rise in the share of workers in `alternative working arrangements'.
Most prominent is the rise in self-employment, particularly the solo self-employed (Boeri et al.,
2020). As of 2019, the self-employed constitute 15% of aggregate employment, and recent survey

  28 Before this year, there were limited sector-specific minimum wages.

evidence suggests that the COVID-19 crisis has struck the self-employed particularly hard (Blun-
dell, Machin, and Ventura, 2020). The period has also seen growth in Zero Hours Contracts -
employment contracts in which a worker is not guaranteed any hours and is only paid for work car-
ried out. Datta, Giupponi, and Machin (2019) estimate their prevalence to be at 2.7% of workers.
These workers are covered by many of the same regulations as permanent employees. Unlike Italy,
France and Spain, in the UK we have not seen extensive use of temporary contracts among workers
early on in their careers. Medina and Schneider (2018) estimate the UK's shadow economy to be
under 10% of total employment, small by global and European standards.
