       This paper examines the problem of measuring the growth of a monetary aggregate in the

presence of innovations in financial markets and changes in the relationship between individual

assets and output We propose constructing a monetary aggregate so that it is a good leading

indicator of nominal GDP; in general the weights on its components vary over time. We

investigate two specific procedures: one in which subaggregates discretely switch in and out, and

one in which the growth of the aggregate is a time-varying weightt2 average of the growth of

the subaggregates. where the weights follow a random walk. These procedures are used to

consauct aggregates which potentially augment M2 with stock and/or bond mutual funds. Over

1960-1991. the time-varying aggregates look much like M2, but during 1992-93 the time-varying

aggregates outperform M2.

   This paper addresses the problem of constructing a monetary aggregate when financial
innovations change the relative importance of different monetary subaggregates. Our objective
is to develop a procedure that automatically adjusts the composition of the monetary aggregate
in a way that makes the resulting measure of the money stock a stable leading indicator of
nominal GDP and potentially a useful control instrument for altering nominal GDP. Two
alternative solutions to this problem are developed and applied to the U.S. experience over the
past three decades.
   Although we are very much aware that the link between M2 and nominal GDP has been far
from perfect, we are nevertheless impressed by the evidence that this link has been sufficiently
strong and stable in the past to make the existing M2 series a useful leading indicator of
nominal GDP. More specifically, Feldstein and Stock (1994) found that the rate of change of
M2 is a statistically significant predictor of the rate of change of nominal GDP over the period
1959-92. When short term interest rates are added to the relation, M2 remains statist.ical1'
significant although interest rates add marginally to the equation's predictive power. Our
earlier analysis also showed that the strength and historical stability of this relationship implies
that, if the Federal Reserve were able to control M2 optimally, then both the long-term average
rate of inflation and the variance of the annual growth rate of nominal GDP could be reduced.
Although there is a danger that attempting to use M2 to control GDP would weaken that
relation (the "Goodhart's law' problem), the potential gain appears to be large enough to make
further analysis of the control possibility worthwhile.
   In practice, the current broad monetary aggregate M2 has been redefined by the Federal
Reserve on several occasions. For example. M2 was expanded to include money market deposit
accounts and, subsequently, money market mutual funds. The apparent weakening of the



                                                —1—
relation between the existing M2 measure and nominal GDP that began in 1992, along with the
rise in M2 velocity since 1990 in the face of low and falling interest rates, has caused some
analysts to conclude that M2 should be expanded again to incorporate bond and stock funds (see
Duca (1993) and Orphanides, Reid and Small (1993) for discussions of this proposal). Such
changes in the definition of the monetary aggregate are potentially appropriate when households
and businesses substitute existing or new financial instruments for previous components of the
monetary aggregate. Money market deposit accounts and money market mutual funds were new
financial instruments that households could easily substitute for small time deposits. More
recently, households have begun to substitute highly liquid bond and stock funds for shorter
maturity money market funds. Since the substitutions are never complete or perfect. the
desirability of expanding or redefining the monetary aggregate is an empirical issue.
   The decision to redefine the monetary aggregate involves three questions. First, does the
proposed new aggregate have a stronger and more stable leading relation with nominal GDP
than the existing monetary aggregate? Second, would a decision by the Federal Reserve to shift
from the old aggregate to the new alternative weaken public confidence in the Federal
Reserve's determination to control the money stock and thereby to limit the rate of inflatipn9
And third, would the new monetary aggregate be more difficult to control than the old one?
   The methods described in this paper revise the definition of the monetary aggregate when
the rate of growth of the resulting new aggregate would have a stronger relation to the rate of
growth of nominal GDP. More specifically, the analysis relates the quarterly rate of growth of
nominal GDP to distributed lags of past growth of nominal GDP and the monetary aggregate.
The monetary aggregate is changed when the new monetary aggregate improves the ability of
that relation to explain changes in nominal GDP.1
   The timing procedures that we discuss are non-judgmental. Given a list of possible

monetary subaggregates (e.g., the existing Ml, small denomination time deposits, overnight
repurchase agreements, money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds, bond
funds, etc.), the procedure would automatically decide which ones should be included in "the'



                                               -2-
monetary aggregate or how much weight should be assigned to each. This inclusion or weighting
decision varies with time. If the list of possible subaggregates is specified in advance, the fact
that these changes in the defmition of the monetary aggregate are generated by a pre-
established rule should reduce suspicion that the redefinition of the aggregate reflects an
attempt by the Federal Reserve to avoid a previous commitment to control the growth of the
monetary aggregate and thus the future rate of inflation. Indeed, even if the procedure that we
develop produced the same redefinitions of the monetary aggregate as the Federal Reserve
would choose judgementally, the ability to arrive at those changes by a prespecified set of rules
would be desirable. Alternatively, these procedures can provide a framework for initiating
Federal Reserve discussions about changing the monetary aggregate and a standard by which to
evaluate judgmental decisions about including o excluding a particular subaggregate.
   There is frequently a tradeoff between the controllability of a monetary aggregate and the
strength of its link to nominal GDP. Advocates of controlling the monetary base (e.g.,
McCallum (1988. 1990)) emphasize that it is directly controlled by the Federal Reserve, unlike

any of the broader monetary aggregates. Similarly, the Federal Reserve has been much better
able to control Ml than any broader aggregate because reserve requirements are based on the
non-currency components of Ml while the components of M2 that are not in Ml are no longer

subject to reserve requirements. This may explain why the Shadow Open Market Committee and
others have focused on the growth of Ml. While it is true that the monetary base and Ml are
now more controllable by the Federal Reserve than M2 • the evidence that we have examined
(Feldstein and Stock, 1994. section 6) indicates that the predictive content of these narrower
aggregates is much less than the predictive content of M2. Expanding reserve requirements to
all of M2 would make it possible for the Federal Reserve to control M2 over any periodof

more than one or two months (Feldstein (1993)).
    In designing our current procedures for redefining the monetary aggregates we have not
 given explicit attention to the controllability of the resulting aggregate. Indeed, one set of
experiments in the current paper considers aggregates which include bond and stock mutual



                                                 -3-
funds. Direct control of the size of these funds is well outside the range of current policy
options facing the Fed. This raises the question of how one should interpret the shift by one of
our automatic procedures to a monetary aggregate which includes bond and stock funds, since a
switch from M2 to M2 plus stock and bond funds is a move away from controllability. One
interpretation of such an automatic switch is that this is signalling to the Fed that control of M2
should be deemphasized and replaced with an alternative rule or judgmental procedure, perhaps
one based on interest rates, In this sense, the composition of the appropriate aggregate can be
interpreted as an indicator of when a monetary aggregate rule may or may not be appropriate.
We provide evidence on the magnitude of the improvement in predictability that is achieved by
using a less controllable index than M2, However, we do not examine systematically the
relative degree of controllability (using interest rates as well as reserves) of M2 and the broader
aggregates considered here.
   The current paper considers two quite different approaches to redefining the monetary
aggregate. The first approach regards the appropriate aggregate as an unweighted sum of certain
monetary subaggregates and considers once each quarter whether the set of those subaggregates
that is defined to constitute the monetary aggregate should be expanded or reduced in order to
improve the predictive link between that overall aggregate monetary stock and nominal GDP.
For example, before 1983 the broad M2 money stock did not include money market mutual
funds. The "switching regressions" procedure presented in section 2 considers the possibility of
adding the money market mutual funds to the narrower pre-1983 aggregate each quarter until
the procedure indicates that it is desirable to do so. The results of this approach, presented in
section 3, are quite similar to the actual timing decision of the Federal Reserve in expanding the
definition of Mi to include the money market mutual funds. These results also indicate that
expanding the aggregate further to include bond and stock funds would now improve its
predictive content but would not have done so in 1989.
   The second approach models the growth of the monetary aggregate as a weighted sum of the
growth of certain monetary subaggregates and reestimates optimal weights each quarter. This



                                               -.4-
"time varying parameter' procedure, described in section 4, changes the relative importance of
different subaggregates over time and allows new subaggregates to be introduced. Although
previous researchers have constructed monetary aggregates with time varying weights (e.g..
Barnett (1980), Spindt (1985), Driscoll, Rotemberg and Poterba (1991), and Barnett, Fisher and
Serletis (1992); also see Friedman and Schwariz (1970, ch. 4.1) for a discussion of unequal
weighting schemes), those weights were based on a priori theoretical considerations. Despite
this virtue, these alternative aggregates have met with limited empirical success and have not
been widely adopted by practitioners; see for example Lindsey and Spindt (1986) and Fisher,
Hudson and Pradhan (1993). In connast, the present paper constructs the aggregate to optimize
a prediction function that causes the weights to vary over time. The results of this analysis are
presented and discussed in section 5.
   Notably, we find empirically that the TVP monetary aggregate is similar to the unweighted
inclusion-exclusion aggregate derived by the switching regressions method. Despite the
differences in the two techniques, the quantitative similarity of the resulting series suggests that
this approach is robust to changes in its implementation.




                 2. SwItching Regression Model of a Monetary Indicator


   The switching regression model provides a framework for making discrete additions of a

new component to an existing monetary indicator. The implementation here assumes that there
is a natural order in which to introduce subaggregates into the indicator. For example, in the
first empirical application we consider the mutually exclusive subaggregates Ml. those
subaggregates in M2 excluding Ml and money market mutual funds (MMMF's), and MMMF's.
Consequently the decisions modeled are when (if ever) to switch from Ml to an aggregatewhich
 is M2 excluding MMMF's, and subsequently when (if ever) to include MMMF's in M2. This
 assumption could be relaxed but only at considerable computational cost (each additional



                                                 -5-
switching option increases the number of regressions by approximately a factor of the sample

size).
   Let Z1, I =   1     I denote the level of the i-th monetary subaggregate, and suppose that Z1
are mutually exclusive. Let      be the sum of the first through i-th monetary subaggregates, so
    =     zJ= . and let      = M11Sa    The growth rate of the monetary indicator is defmed by


(2.1)                m(r1....,ri_i) = s1lctcr1)   + t1(rit<r2) + +

where 1(tCt1) takes on a value of one iftci-1 and is zero otherwise, etc. Thus the monetary
indicator is defined in terms of the growth rates of the increasing family of aggregates S,
where the indicator switches from the (i-1)-th to the i-Ui aggregate at date jl 2
   The switching dates are estimated by selecting those dates which produce the aggregate with
the greatest ability to forecast GDP growth in a stable forecasting relation. Let x = AlnGDP
Here, we consider the bivariate forecasting equation,


(2.2)                xt = s + cr(L)x.t_i + y(L)m1(r1 rl +          €t.


Thus the forecasting relation between the monetary indicator m 1fr1        l j) and GDP
growth, conditional on lagged (3DP growth, is assumed to be stable. The standard switching
regression model has the same set of regressors, with coefficients that change at an unknown
date. In contrast, in (2.2) the coefficients are stable and the only time-varying feature is the
monetary aggregate itself.
   The switch dates are estimated by least squares. Let SSR(t1       r11) denote the sum of
squared residuals from estimating (2.2) by OLS, given r1        l1• The switch date estimator
solves,

                     min      <11-I SSR(r1      ri_I).



                                               -6-
   If {Zt} are strictly exogenous and the errors are i.i.d. Gaussian, then this procedure would
yield the maximum likelihood estimators of the switch dates. More plausibly. {Z} are
predetermined but not exogenous and there is no reason to believe the errors to be Gaussian, in
which case one might consider other estimators. An alternative would be to choose r1                iI
to minimize a multistep ahead forecast error.
   One would of course like to be able to perform statistical inference on the estimated switch
dates, in particular testing the hypothesis that there is no switch and constructing confidence
intervals for the switch dates in the event that there has been a switch. These questions have
been studied in the related change-point problem. In the change-point model, statistical
significance can be studied using maximal Wald or likelihood ratio statistics, or using related
tests with explicit break dates; seefor example Andrews and Ploberger (1992). Also,
nonstandard techniques can be used to construct confidence intervals for a break date (Picard
(1985), Bai (1993)). However, the structure of the problem at hand is sufficiently different that
these results do not apply directly (here, the coefficients are constant and the series itself is
changing, while the reverse is true in the change point literature). We hope to be able to
provide results about inference in this model at a later date.




                    3. Empirical Results: Switching Regression Model


   The switching regression procedure is examined by performing two experiments. Following
Orphanides and Porter (1993), we first examine the switch from MI to M2 (excluding
MMMF's) and the subsequent decision toincorporate MMMF's into M2. The second examines
whether M2 might usefully be extended to include bond, or bond and stock, mutual funds. The
data are quarterly. 1959:1 to 1993:4. Quarterly money quantities are the monthly average for
the final month in the quarter. Our data on MMMF's begin in 1975:2, and the stock and bond



                                                 -7-
mutual fund data begin in 1976:1; these are the first dates at which the instruments are
permitted to enter the switching regression aggregate.3 All regressions are executed for samples
starting in 1960:2, with earlier observations used for initial conditions for lagged variables.


   A. Results for Ml, M2 a MMMF, andM2
   For this experiment we set S1 = Ml, s2 = M2 excluding MMMF's, and S3 = M2. Using
data through 93:4, the least-squares estimator of the break dates, based on two lags each of x.t

and the monetary aggregate in (2.2). are      = 71:3 and > 93:4. Thus, through 1969:4 the
selected monetary aggregate is Ml and thereafter it is M2 excluding MMMF's. The growth
rates of the resulting series and M2 are plotted in figure 1.
   These results are based on all the data through 1993:4. A natural question is what aggregate
this procedure would produce were it nm in real time. This question is addressed by using this
algorithm to estimate the break dates for samples with terminal dates running from 1978 to
1993. The results are summarized in table 1. For example, using data from 1959:1 to 1978:4.
the best indicator would have switched from Ml to M2 ex MMMF's in 197 1:3, thai would have
included MMMF's starting in 1975:4. During 1982, the best indicator would have excluded
MMMF's, and subsequently MMMF's reenter only after the recovery from the second early-
80's recession is under way. From 1983:3 through 1993:3, the aggregate would have included
MMMF's, although MMMF's would have been dropped in 1993:4. However, it should be noted
that the objective function is very flat in 1993:4 and the full-sample estimates    = 71:3 and
   > 93:4 produce a sum of squared residuals which is less than 0.02% smaller than for            =
71:3 and     = 83:1. the optimal choice for the subsample through 89:4. Thus, with even a very
small penalty for switching (which one might plausibly introduce), the real-time aggregate
would not have switched and instead would have continued to include MMMF's since 83: I.
Mechanically, the reason the procedure drops MMMF in 1993:4 is that during the 1990's
M2exMMIvIF was growing more rapidly than M2 (see figure 1) so the increase in M2exMMMF
velocity was not as sharp as for M2 velocity. Thus M2exMMMF was a better predictor than
M2 over this episode.

Notes: Each row presents results from estimating the switching regression
procedure sunriarized in (2.1) - (2.3) using data from 1960:2 to the date in
the first column. The two estimated switch dates for the regressions with
that final date are reported in the next two columns. A dashed line indicate!
that the switch did not occur during the sample.
   The growth rate of the monetary aggregate produced by this recursive procedure is plotted
in figure 2. This aggregate was computed supposing that it is redefined quarterly; for
example, the aggregate reported in 1978:4 would have been M2 because the recursive estimate
of the break dates would have placed both M2exMMMF's and MMMF's in the aggregate prior
to 1978:4, as indicated in the first row of table 1. Evidently, the simulated real time aggregate
is very similar to M2 itself, with the main exception being 1982, when MJvIMF's would not
have been included and when the aggregate would have grown more slowly than did M2.


   B. Results for Bond and Stock Mutual Funds
   The second experiment examines whether an alternative aggregate based on M2 and stock
and bond mutual funds could be a better economic indicator than M2 alone. Specifically, we
consider results based on the subaggregates M2, bond mutual funds (MFB), and stock mutual
funds (MFS), added sequentially, so that S1=M2, S2=M2+MFB, and S3=M2+MFB+MFS. The
full-sample OLS estimates of the break dates are i=89:l and 2=89:3. Historical values of
this series are plotted in figure 3. Evidently, the only substantial difference between M2 and
the switching-regression aggregate is the higher growth rate of the alternative aggregate since
1991.

   The results of the recursive simulation, in which the break dates were estimated over
subsamples with increasing terminal dates, are summarized in table 2. The results indicate more
revisions of the historical series than in the experiment with MMIvIF's. Through the mid-
1980's, the simulated real-time series would have included both bond arid stock funds. Not
surprisingly, both bond and stock funds would have been dropped after the stock market crash
in the final quarter of 1987. This is evident in the plot in figure 4 of the simulated real-time
monetary aggregate which this procedure would produce. The stock market crash resulted in a
large decline in this monetary aggregate; the decline was not associated with subsequent
reductions in output, so stock funds were automatically dropped from the series in 1988:2 and
were not reintroduced until 1990:1.

                4. Time-Varying Parameter Model of a Monetary Indicator


    The time varying parameter (TVP) model provides an alternative framework for measuring
the rate of change of a monetary aggregate with stable indicator properties. In contrast to the
switching model of section 2, the TV!' model produces a series in which the weights on the
subaggregates vary over time but in general are neither zero nor one. The growth rate of the
aggregate is constructed as a weighted average of the growth rates of the subaggregates. To a
first order, the growth rate of a conventional aggregate such as M2 can be approximated as a
weighted average of the growth rates of its components, where the weights are the time-varying
shares of the components in the total aggregate. Weighted averages of growth rates are also
used in the monetary services and transaction cost index approaches. For example, Barneti's
(1980) Divisia monetary aggregate is constructed in growth rates as a time-varying weighted
average of the growth rates of the subaggregates, where the weights depend on the
subaggregate's expenditure share based on user costs. Our TVP approach allows the weights on
the components to differ from their shares by choosing them to produce an aggregate with a
stable predictive relationship to (3DP. The use of growth rates here is mainly for computational
convenience, since this produces a model which is linear in the (unresiricted) parameters. An
advantage of the TV!' model over the switching model of the previous section is that there is a
well-developed theory of inference in the model, and in particular the Kalman filter produces
estimates of standard errors on the time-varying weights.

   The standad time-varying parameter model proposed by Cooley and Prescott (1973a, 1973b.
1976), Rosenberg (1972, 1973) and Sarris (1973) has time variation in all of the regression
coefficients. In contrast, the statistical model considered here presumes a stable relation
between the monetary aggregate and output, so only the weights used to consiruct the aggregate
vary over time. The model is,



                                              - 10-

where x1 is the logarithm of nominal GDP and          is the vector of first differences of logarithms

of the various mutually exclusive subaggregates. The weights at are assumed to evolve as,

technically is not observable. However, fl can
                                                     be estimated using the full data set. Let

denote the estimate of a given data through time T (that is, given all the available data). Then
the estimated monetary aggregate is,

Note that °T+1IT = TlT' c, for the final observation 'tIT = fTITZT.
   If all the subaggregates exist over the entire time period, then the dimension of is
constant. In practice, however, over time new fmancial instruments become available. This is
 handled by permitting the dimension of and           to expand when a new instrument is

 introduced, a modification which is conceptually straightforward using the Kalman filter.
    Econometric implementation of (4.1) and (4.2) entails the estimation of the parameters of
                                                                                                 and thereby

   The parameters of the model consist of 8 = (cr0, a(L), y(L), $.      a, a). Given 8, $÷ ljt
and 01+111 respectively can be estimated using the Kalman filter and the Kalman smoother for
the TVP model. The state vector consists of (fl,   ji        fi). where p is the order of
y(L). The state transition equation is (4. ib), augmented to handle the lags of       The
measurement equation is (4. la). This constitutes a standard state space model so the Kalman
filter and smoother can be applied directly to yield estimates of and its standard error; see
for example Harvey (1989). The only remaining issue is the choice of initial conditions for the
filter. The convention adopted here depends on the subaggregate. For subaggregates which
exist at the beginning of the sample,       is set to the share of each subaggregate in the total, so

that the first-period growth rate equals the growth rate of an aggregate which is equally
weighted in levels. For subaggregates introduced after the beginning of the sample, the initial
weight on a new aggregate is set to zero. In both cases the element of the state covariance
matrix corresponding to this weight is set to zero in its initial period. The choice of initial
conditions has only transitory startup effects, and unreported experiments indicated that our
empirical results are insensitive to these initial condition assumptions. Also, for producing the
aggregate, the weights are normalized to add to one in each period; that is, the weights used
are         ...         where 0ttT are the weights produced by the Kalman smoother.
   For our main results, 8 is estimated by maximum likelihood. The Kalman filter as just
described produces as a byproduct the value of the Gaussian likelihood given 8, and the MLE is
obtained by maximizing this likelihood. The likelihood was optimized using a simulated
annealing algorithm, modified with a local quadratic search routine.
   One part of the analysis, the construction of a simulated real time monetary aggregate, does
not use the MLE's. The simulated real time monetary aggregate is produced by reestimating
the parameters every quarter, so that each quarter the data set increases by one observation;
the weights on the subaggregates for the fmal period of the subsample, based on these
reestimated parameters, is then used to construct the simulated real-time monetary aggregate.
In the empirical work, the simulated real time period extends for more than a decade, entailing



                                                - 12-
numerous parameter reestimations. The computationally intensive Kalman filter MLE's are
therefore impractical. Instead 0 was reestimated by nonlinear generalized least squares (NGLS).
In brief, if the regressors are strictly exogenous, the NGLS estimator would be approximately
equivalent to the MLE, where the approximation arises by setting for numerical convenience
             = j3e(L)z..1).    This introduces approximation error into the model, but this

error will be small if 4ovar(z1t)IvM(€t)   << 1 for j 2, I =    1     I. This condition is
satisfied in the empirical work where this ratio is typically less than 1 %. With this assumption

and the identity$ =      +             the model (4.la) and (4.lb) can be rewritten,


(4.3)             Ax =        + a(L)Ax1..j + 7(L)(fl6zt4) + ut.


where u1 = (L.... 15)'(y(L)zj) +          The nonlinearities come through two restrictions: the
restriction i(L)13o places on the unrestricted coefficients on the lags of and the restriction
that y(L) appears in both the mean and the conditional covariance matrix of (u1        UT).   If
   were strictly exogenous, then feasible nonlinear GLS would yield the Gaussian MLE. This

is readily implemented numerically by (i) obtaining preliminary estimates of a(L), 7(L) and
(ii) computing the TXT variance-covariance matrix of "i        Ut) and inverting it; (iii) using
this to compute the one-step NGLS esthuator, imposing the conditional mean restrictions
implied by ,t(L)Øo; and (iv) iterating on this until convergence. This NGLS algorithm was
used to produce the subsample estimates in the simulated reai time experiment. Because {xt. '}
are only predetermined but not strictly exogenous, this algorithm does not produce the MLE
here. However, using the full sample the point estimates from the NGLS algorithm are similar
to the MLE's, as are the implied historical monetary aggregates; this suggests that the
simulated real time results are insensitive to the use of the NGLS estimator rather than the

MLE.

    A. ResultsforMl, M2 aMMMF and Ml, and MMMF's
    The first experiment considers an aggregate, the growth of which is a time-varying linear
combination of the growth rates of Ml, M2R M2 excluding MMMF and Ml, and MMMF.
For the initial years after their introduction, the value of MMMF's was small so small changes
in their value resulted in large changes in theft growth rates and hence the growth rate of
MMJvIF's has a large variance in these early years. We therefore chose 80:1 as the first quarter
in which MMMF's could enter the monetary aggregate mt; that is, through 79:4, we set the
weight on MMMF's in tnt to zero.
    Three sets of MLE's, computed over the full sample. are given in table 3. In the first two
columns a, was restricted to .025 and .05. respectively; in the third column, a,7 was estimated
along with the other parameters. Notably, the point estimate of a-,7 is very small, so that the
estimated weights vary trivially over the sample. However, the values of the likelihood are
relatively close, suggesting that nonzero values of      are also plausible. (Formal distribution
theory of the likelihood ratio rest statistic when the true value of a, is nearly zero appears to be
unavailable so we are unable to produce formal confidence intervals for an.) The subsequent
results therefore focus on the cases with nontrivial movements in f3 in the first two columns.
    Results for the case a,=.O25 are presented in figures Sand 6. Figure 5a presents the
smoothed estimates of the weights, a1T. Because these weights are on growth rates, they are
not immediately comparable to the unit weights on the dollar-valued levels of the various
components actually used to construct Mi To provide a basis of comparison, figure Sb plots
the effective weights on the growth rates of the components in M2 based on the first order

weights and their standard errors are tabulated in appendix table A-I for        =   .025.

      Growth rate of alternative monetazy aggregate (dashed line) and M2 (solid line):
                      Historical series produced by TVP model.

                         Full-sample estimates, 1960:2 - 1993:4
         Subaggregates: Ml, M2 cx Ml and MMMF, MMMF; = .05. 3 lags
    Consider first the results for or,=.025 in figures 5 and 6. Overall, the pattern of weights
placed on the subaggregates by the TVP model is broadly similar to the pattern of implicit
 weights they receive in M2. In both aggregates M2R receives the greatest weight. followed by
Ml and MMMF's. However, there are some important differences in the weights in specific
episodes. Although MMMF's receive similar weights in the two aggregates in the late 1980's.
during most of the sample the weight placed on MMMF's is less than the weight with which it
implicitly enters the M2 growth rate. In fact, for several years, including 1991 and 1992. the
weight placed on MMMF growth is actually negative, so that a decline in MMMF's increases
the growth of this monetary aggregate, and during this period the weight given Ml slightly
increases. However, this result should not be overinterpreted, since the weights on the
individual components are rather poorly estimated; for example, the smoothed TVP weight on
MMMF's in 1991:1 is -.04 with a standard error of .09. More importantly, the estimated new
aggregate and M2 are similar over most of the period, as can be seen from figure 6. The
greatest discrepency between the two is during the 1981-1982 recession, when the new
aggregate grew approximately six percentage points (annual rate) more slowly than M2. and
during the final two years of the sample, when its grows somewhat more rapidly than M2.
   When the smoothing parameter is increased to             = .05, the weights in the TVP model are
more variable, but the results remain similar to those for o,=.O25. Importantly, even though
the weights differ in the two cases, comparing figures 6 and 8 shows that the estimated
monetary aggregates are robust to this change in            With some important episodic differences,
the main conclusion is that the new aggregate is quite similar to M2.
   Our TVP model presumes that the relation between the monetary aggregate and output is
stable. This is an overidentifying restriction in the model and therefore can be tested. To
check for instability in the presumed time-invariant parameters a0, a(L), y(L), and c, we
reestimated the model by maximum likelihood (imposing c           = .025) on the first and second
halves of the data set (through 1992:4), that is, over 1960:2 - 1976:3 and over 1976:4 - 1992:4.
The resulting likelihood ratio statistic, which has a       disthbution, is 6.89 which has a p-



                                               -   15   -
value of .55. This provides no evidence against the overidenti'ing restriction that the time
variation enters only through the weights;.
   We next consider how this procedure would have worked in a simulated real-time setting, in
which the parameters as well as the weights are reestimated in each period. For this exercise,
a(L) and y(L) were estimated by NGLS for the various subsamples. The results are summarized
in figure 9. for the case o,=.O5. In general the monetary aggregates are close to M2 and close
to each other. The greatest differences between the aggregates and M2 are for the early
samples, where there is the least data and presumably the greatest sampling error in the
estimation of the parameters. All subsamples which include the early 1980s yield TSP
aggregates which have slower growth than M2 during the 1980-82 period.


   B. Introduction of Stock and Bond Mutual Funds
   The three mutually exclusive subaggregates considered here are M2, bond mutual funds
(MFB), and stock mutual funds (MFS). Estimates of the parameters of the model are given in
table 4, with a,1 fixed to .025 in the first column, a, fixed to .05 in the second column, and
estimated in the third column. Like MMMF's, stock and bond mutual funds had relatively
small dollar values in the 1970's and consequently had highly variable growth rates. We
therefore use 81:1 as the quarter in which MFB and MFS are first considered for inclusion in
the new aggregate, that is, the weights on MFB and MFS are set to zero through 80:4.
   Figures 10 and 11 respectively show the weights and the resulting aggregate computed with
   set to .025. and figures 12 and 13 present results for a=M5. In figures lO(b) and 12(b), the
'equal-weighting implicit weights are the implicit weights on growth rates of the subaggregates
for the total, M2+MFB+MFS. that is, the shares. Values of the weights for a, = .025, along with
their standard errors, are tabulated in table A-2.
   The results for the two values of show qualitatively similar patterns, although of course
the weights vary more smoothly for the smaller value of        A noteworthy feature of the

results is the different weights placed on MFB and MFS. With the exception of a single quarter

(1981:!), throughout the sample bond funds receive zero or negative weight in the new

aggregate. In contrast, stock funds receive positive weight, with the magnitude of the weight
approximately what it would be in an equal-weighted levels index (figures 10(b) and 12(b)).
Because the growth rate of the stock funds reflects both changes in stock prices and net flows
into the funds, without further analysis we cannot say whether it is the flow of funds or

changes in stock prices which are driving this positive weight on stock funds, It is not
surprising however that including a subaggregate which is determined in part by stock prices

improves the predictive content of M2.
   The estimated new monetary aggregate including stock funds has a growth rate similar to
M2, although their growth rates differ in some episodes. For example, the aggregate including
stock funds decreased sharply with the stock market crash of 1987. Over 1992 and 1993, the

new aggregate exhibited a slightly higher average growth rate than M2.

   The simulated real tune aggregates are presented in figure 14 for         .05. Based on the full

sample and in the subsamples, the TV? aggregate is very similar to M2 from 1988 through

1990; the two aggregates beginto diverge substantially only in late 1991 and 1992. As seen in
figure 14(d), by the end of 1992 this aggregate had diverged sufficiently to suggest that it might

be appropriate to switch or to consider tracking this broader TVP aggregate as a monetary

indicator. While the long-term differences between M2 and the new aggregate are slight, these

initial results suggest that a new aggregate which includes bond and stock funds with a time-
varying weight could provide an improved monetary indicator of future nominal GDP.




                             6. Discussion and Conclusions


   The past few years have seen an historically unprecedented deterioration of the relationship

between M2 and nominal GDP, most notably an increase in M2 velocity in the face of low and
declining interest rates. One way to judge the importance of using these alternative aggregates

is therefore to compare the forecasts of GDP growth based on the switching and TVP aggregates
which consider stock and bond mutual funds, with forecasts based on Mi One-quarter ahead
forecasts using the various monetary aggregates over the period 1988:1 - 1993:4 are given in
table 5 and are plotted in figure 15 * These forecasts are computed recursively to simulate real-
time implementation of the alternative aggregates. For example, the forecast of GDP growth in
1991:4 based on M2 is computed using the regression of GDP growth on its lags and on lagged
values of M2 growth over the period 1960:2 - 1991:3 (earlier values are used as initial
conditions). The switching forecasts are based on the simulated real-time switching aggregate
plotted in figure 4, that is, the switching aggregate and its GDP forecasting equation are
computed using data through the quarter prior to the quarter being forecasted. The TV?
aggregate is based on the weights for or=.O2S (parameter values in table 4, column 1). As
discussed previously, it is computationally infeasible to compute MLE's of the time-invariant
parameters of the TVP model recursively, so the TV? forecast is based on the full-sample
parameter estimates in column 1 of table 4. but the weights used are the Kalman filter estimates
         • where t denotes the quarter being forecasted.
  it-i
   The different forecasts in table 5 and figure 15 show that using an alternative monetary
aggregate matters over this period. For the entire period 1988-1993. conventional Mi
forecasted better than the switching regression aggregate but not as well as the TV? aggregate.
But although none of the monetary aggregates forecasted the 1990 recession, especially the
nearly zero growth in the fourth quarter of 1990, both the switching and TVP aggregates
forecasted growth over the final two years more accurately than Mi. Because these regressions
are computed using recursive forecasts, this is not an artifact of the aggregate being defined ex-
post as that which forecasts GDP well over this period. Rather, this can be taken as reflecting
a deterioration in the forecasting performance of M2 relative to the broader aggregates.
   While these results are promising, they are limited in several regards. The analysis has
focused entirely on the bivariate Mi-output relation. A natural extension is to higher
dimensional models, in particular models with interest rates. Of particular interest are models

           C. GD? growth (solid line) and recursive forecast based on TVP model (a, = .025)
in which the weights are determined in part so that the long-mn velocity-interest rate
relationship remains stable. This would entail extending the foregoing bivariate regressions to
single-equation error correction specifications. This involves technical complications,
particularly for the TV? model, and work on this extension is under way.

1. It would be appropriate to examine longer term relations as an alternative to the quarterly
forecast.


2. The level of the aggregate would be given by S1 when the growth rate is given by s1. At
     the date of switching to the i-th aggregate, there would be a jump in the level of the

aggregate from             to          This jump does not imply a splice in the growth rate as

defmed in (2.1), however, because at date          the growth rate of S.1 is used.


3. We thank John Duca for providing the stock and bond fund data. These data are market
values and exclude IRA and Keogh accounts and institutional holdings, which are also excluded
from M2. By using market values, the data also include capital gains. These two features
make these data less like M2. An alternative approach is to use total inflows excluding capital
gains, as is used by Orphanides, Reid and Small (1993). Different results could of course
obtain using other data, and in this sense our results should be taken as illusftative.
