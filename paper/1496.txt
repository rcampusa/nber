                   Planned and Unplanned Bequests



                              ABSTRACT



       We make the distinction between bequests that are planned as part

of some lifetime optimization stemming from a bequest motive, and those

that are unplanned and result when the date of death differs from what

the consumer might forecast. Lifetime optimization should lead to a

negative effect or no effect of the expected horizon on the size of the

bequest, and to a negative relation between unexpectedly long life and

the bequest.

       Using data on wealthy decedents and their parents, we form

measures of the expected horizon based on parents' longevity. There is

no relation between unexpectedly early or late death and the bequest,

but a significant positive relation between the bequest and the length

of the horizon. Several explanations for this unforeseen result are

offered, including the inference that uncertainty about length of life

is important in studying bequest behaviors

     A growing literature has begun to study the role of intergenerational

transfers in households' life—cycle behavior. In part this increased interest

has stemmed from the apparent inabil it',' o-f   simple versions of the theory of
1 i-fe—cycle decision—making to account for such phenomena as the close

correspondence between age—earnings and age—consumption profiles (Nagatani

1972; White, 1978) and the inexplicably high average level of savings, far

above what could be explained solely by planned saving for retirement

(Kotl ikoff—Summers, 1981). Saving for bequests has been proposed as an

extension a-f the life—cycle theory that might reconcile these phenomena, and

some evidence on the magnitude and determinants of bequests has been presented

(Merichik—David, 1983).

     What is missing from this reconciliation is any direct evidence that the

bequests that are made are in fact an expression of people's tastes for

passing on wealth to their offspring. Current evidence prevents one from

distinguishing between this possibility and an alternative that views bequests

as the assets that remain at the death of risk—averse consumers who cannot

purchase actuarially fair annuities or catastrophic health insurance due to

problems of adverse selection. In this study we construct a method that could

allow us to examine these alternatives. The method is based on the

distinction between planned and unplanned bequests, a distinction we try to

make operational by introducing a proxy for individual differences in the

planning horizons that will in part affect the amount of such transfers.


                            II. Bequests and Horizons


    Two issues must be considered in distinguishing the effects of the




                                       —1—
horizon on bequests: 1) What does a more distant horizon do to the amount of

the    transfer, other things equal? and 2) I-F the plarin rig horizon proves to be
incorrect, what are the effects of the mistake on the transfer? We take these

questions    in   order, assuming throughout that the consumer has point

expectations      about the horizon T*. We assume that the wage rate and hours of

work    are fixed, so   that earnings per period are not subject to choice and, for

the moment, that lifetime earnings too are exogenous. Finafly, we assume that

the consumer horizon is fixed, though we examine the effects on our

conclusions of relax ing th is assumption.

        Following Blinder (1974) we assume the consumer seeks to maximize:


(1)        1T* U(C(t))e       dt + B(KT*),


where C is consumption, p is the rate of time               preference,   KT* is   the bequest,

and U and B are the components o-F        the    utility function defined over
consumption and bequests, with UO) = B'(o) =                 . Total utility (1) is
maximized subject to the lifetime wealth constraint that:


                  = e_T*
                      r                         —rt
                                        C(t)e         dt,
(2)        W0 + E       KT* +


where W0 is initial wealth, E is the present value o-F lifetime earnings, and r

is the rate at which households can borrow or lend.

        The solution to this maximization problem includes the conditions:


(3a) C = —[r—PU'(C)/U"(C), for any t,


and


(3b)     U(C(T*))e_PT*    =
                              E:'(KT)

Condition (3b) states that the marginal utility of a dollar of consumption at




                                             —2—
T* equals the marginal utility of dollar given in     bequests.    Together with the

lifetime wealth constraint, conditions (3a) and (3b) imply initial

consumption, terminal wealth (the bequest) and the pattern of consumption over

time. Implicit in the solution is the notion that the consumer equates the

discounted marginal util ity   of   consumption, V'(C(t)), across all time periods

t, U     t     T*.

       Let T* increase, all else, including lifetime resources, remaining

constant.1 (Essentially we are comparing two otherwise identical people at the

same   point   in time whose life expectancies differ from one another for some

reason.) Then if C(t) decreases for any t, it must by (3a) decrease for all

t, including T*. If C(T*) decreases, though, the discounted marginal utility

V'(C(T*)) must increase. The only way (3b) can still be satisfied if this

occurs is if KT* decreases also. Similarly, if C(t) increases for any t, it

must increase in all periods, and         must increase also. Since C<t) cannot

increase for all t, this demonstrates that an increase in the length of the

planned horizon reduces the amount of the bequest if lifetime resources remain

constant, assuming an additively separable utility function. It is also

easily shown that increases in        and E increase the size of KT* if T* is

constant.

       Maintaining the assumptions of fixed lifetime earnings and point

expectations about the date of death, consider now how imperfect forecasting

of that date affects the bequest. If consumers reach T* and are still alive,

they reallocate KT* according to a new utility—maximizing plan derived at T*

and projected forward to some new horizon, T** )     T*.   The assumption that the

marginal utility of consumption approaches infinity as C approaches zero

guarantees that consumption will be positive for all t > T*, and thus that

actual bequest, KT, will be less than K1.




                                        —3—
       H consumers die    suddenly at T < T* they bequeath

                                              r(T t)
(4)       KT = KT*   e_T*_T) +        C(t)e            dt;
             =                     r(T t) dt —
                 KT* + fT* C(t)e                 KT* [l_er(TT)l


Whether the amount actually bequeathed at the date of death,         K1, exceeds or

falls   short of the planned bequest, K1., depends on the relative magnitudes of

the last two terms in (4). Some insight into this issue can be gained if we

assume T =   fl—i    arid operate in discrete time. The comparison of the last two

terms becomes a comparison of C(T*) and rKfl i.e., a comparison of the

resources that are not consumed, because the person dies unexpectedly, to the

interest that is lost on the amount that the person planned to bequeath at T*.

(KT > KT* if C(T*) > rK1.) Since there is some evidence (Merichik—David,

1983) that bequests are on average not more than five years of consumption,

unless r exceeds .20, c(T*:i > rK. This implies that K1 >I(; together with

the discussion of the case of unexpectedly long life, it indicates that

unplanned bequests are negatively related to unexpected extra years of life.

       The analysis thus far has assumed lifetime resources are unchanged by

changes in T*. To the extent we can measure lifetime resources well this

assumption makes sense. However, if they are measured imperfectly,

differences      in T* will represent differences in lifetime income as well. Thus
if    consumption, leisure and bequests are normal goods, an interior solution to

the consumer's maximization would imply lifetime resources and bequests both

rising as T* increases. If lifetime earnings are large relative to initial

wealth,   errors in measuring them will       produce a poE.itive relationship between

T* and the amount of bequests.

        Dropping the assumption of fixed resources may also affect inferences
about the impact of a deviation of the date of death from T* Without



                                          -4—
specifying a dynamic model of utility maximization defined over   consumption,
bequests and labor supply, we cannot infer the effect of this deviation on the

amount bequeathed if lifetime resources are variable. However, if the

consumer survives beyond an initial planning horizon T*, and had planned to

retire before T*, the unexpected extra years of life will probably reduce the

actual bequest below KT*. Having already retired the person is uni ikely to

reenter the labor force.2 Resources are fixed as of T*, and the arguments made

above that        < K apply. Since most people do plan some period of

retirement, we may assume that unexpectedly long life reduces bequests in most

cases. Thus people who live an unexpectedly long time will bequeath less than

otherwise identical people whose expectations about T* are fulfilled. ilso,

if death occurs before T* and the person had already retired, 1<T> 1<1*.

       If the person had planned to work until T*, or if death occurs before

retirement, no unambiguous conclusion about the effect of a deviation from T*

is possible. The outcome depends on the relation of the age—consumption and

age—earnings profiles, and on the relative magnitudes of planned lifetime

earnings and       If initial wealth is much greater than annual earnings, KT

>KT* even if T*—T is large (since the lost earnings comprise only a small

fraction of lifetime earnings).

      Other inferences can be drawn based on observations of patterns of
                                                                     3   -
retirement.                                     -
               Assume there is some normal retirement age, perhaps 65. If r*     is
below this retirement age, the person is more likely to have planned to work

until T*. Ihat being the case, an unexpectedly early death will reduce

I ifetirrie resources and make it less likely that KT KT*. Similarly, if death

occurs substantially before the normal retirement age, it is more likely that

the   person had planned additional years of work, and thus more likely that the
observed bequest will fall short o-f what was       planned.
        Thro'jqhout this discussion we have assumed that the expected date o-f

death,     T*, is cc'ristarit even      as t    increases. This is unlikely: Consumers, as.

shown by Harnermesh (1985), are aware that the expected ae at death is higher

the cider one is.            If we   specify a   model that allows horizons to be updated

(dT*(t)/dt :>      0),    KT* will fail continually with t. However, each

worker/consumer          will    die "earlier than expected,' and thus each will leave

positive unplanned bequests. Given two worker/consumers with identical

resources and the same age and 1*, the one who                   dies earlier after retirement
will leave a larger unplanned bequest. Thus even if people do continually

update their forecasts of the horizon as they age, we should still find that

unplanned bequests are negatively related to T—T*.


                                       III.    Data and Estimation

        The discussion in Section 11 suggests estimating:


(5)         K. =         +      T' + 82 T + 83 W. +        84
                                                                M.



where        is initial         wealth, M is    lifetime earnings, i        is. an individual, and Tu

is the number of          years of unexpected I      ife    If   M   is   measured without error, or

if M    is small relative to W,           we should   observe that                 0; regardless of
these provisos, we should also find $3                84) 0. In      order to separate planned

from unplanned bequests we need to derive some method of                       determining   the

consumer's horizon. While simple actuarial data provide some                        distinctions
among individuals, the effects of differences in horizons based on such data

cannot be distinguished from those based on age and cohort differences (since

these    are what    determine the       actuarial   data) except because of the underlying

nonlinearities. Accordingly, we                calculate   the years remaining until death,

T*, as.:
(6) T* = e0 +P NPARGE8O -    )   NPARLT6O


e0 is the expected years of remaining life based on data from actuarial tables

at time t; NPARGE8O is the number of the person's parents who survived to age

80, and NPARLT6O is the number who did not survive to age 60. The coefficients

P and Y are fixed at 3 and 2, reflecting the findings on subjective horizons

in Hamermesh (1985).

       The formulation of T* in 6 is implemented in two ways. First, we

calculate T*1 as of the fixed chronological age of 55 for all observations.

Second, we calculate T*2 as of the date when the secor!d parent of the

individual in question died. Thus for each person the forecasted horizons

will reflect parents' longevity as well as the actuarial life expectancy for

people of their sex during their lifetimes. Throughout the study we assume

=           and TU2= T—T*2, where T is the years of life remaining from the time
    T—T*1
1* is calculated.

       The data set is from Connecticut and was used by Menchik (1979) to

examine the relation between the estates of parents and those of their

offspring. It covers men and women who died between 1939 and 1976 and whose

parents left large estates. These data are especially suited to this problem,

as they contain information on the decedents' estates as well as on bequests

the decedents had received (a partial measure of W). They also contain

information on the age of death of the individual and of one or both parents,

as well as the individual's date of death. The people in the sample had very

large inherited wealth, a mean of $202,560 (in 1967 dollars), a median of

$50,844, and a range from $0 to $2,917,757. Even though we ma>' measure

1 ifetime earnings with error or with poor proxies, W, as proxied by

inheritance of physical wealth, may be sufficiently large relative to lifetime

earnings that our hypotheses about           and 02 could hold in this sample i-f the




                                            —7—
simple model 4C have outlined is correct.

       The equation actually eE.timated is:


(5')    log (Estate) =     + 8T* +   0 TU +    log   (Inheritance) +   82   ET +
                                                                                   8 Male,
We measure the dependent variable as the loqarithm of one plus the value (in

1967 dollars) of the estate left by the individual. Initial wealth is proxied

by one plus the value (in 1967 dollars) of the bequest the individual received

from his or her parents. Since people who receive their inheritances earl icr

have greater initial wealth (because of the interest that can accumulate on

that inheritance), we also include, following Menchik (1979), ET, a weighted

average of the differences between the dates of death of each parent and of

the child.4 No data are available on earnings or any of the standard human

capital measures that affect earnings. However, we do know that female

labor—force participation during the lives of members of our sample was far

below that of men, and that wage discrimination by sex also existed.

Accordingly, a dummy variable equalling one for males is also included in (5')

as a partial proxy for differences in M.

       For a number of sample members data were only available on one parent.

For these people we treat the second parent as if he or she died between ages

60 and 80. Also, for those people who died before age 55, or predeceased one

or both parents, we calculate T*1 and/or T*2 based on information available at

the time of the individual's death.

       Of the full sample of 165 usable observations, 81 had one or more

sib] ings in the sample. The OLS estimates of the residuals from equation (5')

can thus be used to examine the extent to which there is a correlation of the

error terms within families. The intra—class correlation coefficient of the

residuals for these observations is a measure of this correlation, p..5 To the




                                       —8—
extent that this correlation is important it also suggests that the OLS

estimates of (5) are inefficient, and that some generalized least squares

method should be appl led to this equation.


                           IV. ResultE. and Discu.ior


     Two aspects of the sample require us to estimate (5') on various

subsamples as well as on the entire 165 observations. First, one person left

no estate; for this person the dependent variable takes the value zero and

accounts for approximately 25 percent of the sample variance. Second, 15

people died before age 56. These include all but one of the people who

predeceased their parents. Thus for this group T*2 provides a poorer measure

of the horizon; and, uni ike for other sample members, T*1 is measured at ages

before 55. Accordingly we form three subsamples, respectively excluding the

person who left no estate, excluding early decedents, and excluding both of

these.

     Table 1 shows the sample statistics on the T* and Tu measures for each of

the four samples. It is worth noting that there is substantial variation in

the T*, especially in T*2, which is measured at different ages for each sample

member, but even in T*1, which is measured at age 55 for each person (except

for early decedents). Also, the means of the Tu are negative, even for the

subsamples that exclude early decedents. Since the means of forecast errors

should equal zero if forecasts are on average correct, the negative means on

these measures suggest a bias in the forecasts we have attached to these

individuals. The sources of the bias and their potential effects on the

estimates o-f the parameters iii   (5')   are discussed below.

     Table 2   presents the estimates of equation (5') for each of the four
samples, in each case using horizons based on T*1 and T*2. The coefficients on

ET suggest that each extra year during which people own       their   inheritance adds

between 1 and 9 percent to their estates. The upper part of this range

implies a remarkably large real rate of return on the assets that form the

inheritances these people received. It is not inconceivable, though, that

this very wealthy sample is willing to undertake investments that are

sufficiently risky to yield a fairly high average real rate of return.6 The

coefficient on the dummy   variable   for men (who constitute about 60 percent of

the samples) is positive and quite large, as expected. While its magnitude

seems large, one should remember that this variable proxies any sex—related

differences in lifetime earnings, differences that may be big enough to

generate bequests that are about twice as large for men as for women.

     The estimated intra—class correlation coefficients for the 81 sample

members (68 in the samples excluding early decedents) who belong to 34 (28)

separate farnil ies differ sharply depending on the sample used. If we include

early decedents these coefficients are all significantly positive at least at

the 95 percent level using the appropriate t—statistic. In the samples that

exclude early decedents, though, none achieves this level of significance.

There does appear to be some correlation within families in bequest behavior

(controlling for initial inheritance, duration of life, and our admittedly

poor proxy for lifetime earnings). The low correlation, at least in the

samples excluding early decedents, suggests that any inefficiency in the

estimates of the parameters that is induced by our failure to account for

intra—farnily correlation in estimating (51)     is   likely to be unimportant.

     The effect of extra years of unanticipated life, TU, on the size of the

person's estate varies greatly with the choice of sample and proxy -for TU.

When we exclude early decedents and base the horizon on people's life

expectancy at age 55, we find either an unexpected positive impact or no

effect on the size of the estate. When early decedents are included and the

horizon is based on life expectancy at the death of the second parent, the

irpact is negative and significant. Hover,            ase   noted in Section III, the

computation of both horizon measures T*1 and T*2 has problems in the case of

early    decedents.
        These considerations suggest that the most reliable estimates cone from

the samples that exclude      early decedents. That being the case, the results in

the    Table can best be interpreted as implying that there is little if any
effect of extra years      ol u <pc ted I ife me     on the size of the   estate.

Perhaps the best conclusion to be drawn from these estimates is that, given
the way we have proxied the horizon using point estimates, unplanned bequests
do not seem important.
        UnI ike the coefficients on Tu, those on the proxies for the horizon, T*,
are significantly positive in all four samples and for both farms of this
proxy.7    If   the errors in measuring lifetime resources had little impact
because those resources were small relative to initial        wealth in this sample,

we    would expect the point estimate of the horizon     to have a negative effect on

the    size of the estate. The result is thus clearly quite surprising. There
are three possible explanations for this finding. The first is simply a
measurement problem: People's expectations, as        proxied by the T*, overshoot
the actual ages at death. s Table 1 showed, TU is           on average negative in

this sample.      We know (Hamermesh, 1985) that the estimates of         and I' used to
form the T* are far above what epidemiological evidence indicates to be the

true relation of parents' to offspring's longevity. Since many more people in

the sample had long— than short—lived parents, this consideration suggests why

T* could overestimate the actual horizon, and why higher T* would be

associated with a larger estate. This possibility does not, however, explain




                                        —   11   —
the -failure to observe a sign if icant neQative impact of TU or the size o-f the

estate.

     A second possibility is based on our inability to measure differences in

li-feume   earnings (except weakly with the dummy variable indicating the

decedent's 5CX:    l4hile   we argued that lifetime earnings are small relative to

initial wealth, the lack of qood measures of earnings may still imply that our

proxies for the horizon also proxy lifetime earnings. Since higher lifetime

earnings are associated with higher consumption and larger bequests, this can

explain the significant positive effect of T*. However, since TT—T*, T' will

be negatively correlated with 1 ifetirne earnings if T* is partly a proxy for

earnings. That correlation should have resulted in an even more negative

coefficient on TU than we would have observed if a good measure of lifetime

earnings had been available. Thus this measurement problem too can explain

the results on T* quite well, but cannot explain the general insignficarice of

the coefficients on TU.

     A third explanation, more in the nature of a specification than a

measurement problem, is that it may not be correct to focus only on the means

of people's subjective survival distributions. In particular, Harnerrnesh

(1985) showed that having long—lived parents significantly increases the

variance of this distribution. Thus our proxies for the horizon are also

inextricably proxies for the degree of uncertainty about the horizon.       I-f


risk—averse consumers facing imperfect annuities markets accumulate assets

sufficient to maintain consumption throughout a possibly quite long

retirement, we would observe estates being left by people who had no bequest

motive pr se. As Davies <1981) discusses, this effect will be especially

pronounced for those facing the greatest uncertainty (those who have the

highest value of our measure of T*).

     In this study we have constructed arnodel designed to examine the effects

of differences in individuals' subjective horizons and years of unexpected

longevity on their terminal wealth. Using a transformation of actuarial data

and their parents longevity to proxy the horizon of a sample of wealthy

decedents, we have found a significant positive effect of proxies for the

horizon, but no significant effect of unexpected years of life. Both findings

are inconsistent with a simple model of a consumer with fixed lifetime

earnings who derives utility from consumption and bequests and plans around a

point estimate of the horizon. Two measurement problems help explain the

first result, but neither can explain the insignificant effect of unexpected

years of life. A third possibility is that our proxies for the horizon also

proxy uncertainty about it, so that we cannot distinguish between the effects

of a longer horizon and increased uncertainty on the size of bequests.

     It is unl ikely that something that affects the mean of the distribution

of subjective survival probabil ities does not also affect its variance, since

both stem from the same underlying distribution of subjective survival

probabil ities. This suggests that the current state of our knowledge makes

the distinction between planned an unplanned bequests empirically

problematic. Only with substantially more research on the nature of

subjective survival distributions, and careful modell ing of proxies for their

means and variances, can one hope to distinguish the relative importance of

planned and unplanned bequests, and of bequests in the form of asset; that

remain at the end of n unctrin H-fetrne.

   There is some evidence (Harnermesh, 1984b) that labor supply, and thus

• i
lifetime earnings, are independent of the horizon T*, though Wolfe (1983)
        this is not the case for early decedents.
2. Among a sample of older couples with no earninqs in 1973 (Hamermesh.
404a), average earninps in 1975 totalled only $93.

3. This may be induced by economic incentives associated with the interaction
of ubl ic and private pension proorarns; see Lazear (1979).

4. The weights are the sizes of each parent's estate.

5. Kendall—Stuart (1973. p.  315) discuss how this correlation can be
estimated in the presence of groups of varying sizes.

6. That the coefficients on ET are larper when T*2 and T'2 are used is the
unsurprising result of the introduction of multicollinearity between these
measures and ET. This problem does not exist when the other measures, which
are based on the horizon at a given aQe, are used.

7. This is not due to a confusion of the T* with secular improvements in
longevity: When the date of death is added to (5'), the significant positive
effects of T* remain.
