I.   Introduction

     In 1985, the 50 states raised $349 billion in revenues from their own

sources, and received $84 billion in grants from the federal government.

(U.S. Bureau of the Census [1987, p. 266].)            State governments are clearly

important   players     in the U.S. system of public finance,     and the efficiency

with which they conduct their financial affairs has an important            impact on

consumer welfare.       One important determinant of a state's ability to conduct

reasonable fiscal policies is the quality of its revenue forecasts. Sensible

deliberations about expenditures cannot be made in the absence of "good"

forecasts.     Indeed, in the presence of constitutional or statutory provisions

for balanced budgets, unanticipated changes in revenues can wreak havoc not

only on proposals that are scheduled for funding, but on plans that have

already been put into effect as well.

     In recent months, two powerful governors, Michael Oukakis of

Massachusetts and Mario       Cuorno   of New York, have suffered major political

embarrassments because actual revenues fell substantially short of the

predictions in their respective states.             Such episodes focus attention on the

question of whether states do a "good" job of forecasting revenues.             In

modern economics, forecasts are evaluated on the basis of whether or not they

are "rational--do the forecasts optimally incorporate all information that

Is available at the time they are made?             Although there is a large literature

on state revenue forecasting methods, that literature focuses mostly on state

budgetary institutions.        Forecasts themselves are evaluated only in an

informal    fashion.1     Although the theory and econometric methods of rational
                                                  made by households and
expectations have been used to evaluate forecasts

forecasts. This paper brings these methods to bear on the problem of state

revenue forecasting, and as an example, applies them to the analysis of data

from New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Maryland.        The results cast light not

only on the question of rationality per Se, but on Issues such as the impact

of political factors on forecasts.

      Section II presents the conceptual framework for testing rational

expectations. The relevant institutional        issues and data are described in

Section III.   Estimation problems and results are discussed in Section        IV.


We find that in all three states forecasts of own revenues are systematically

biased downward.    Section V concludes with a summary and suggestions for

future research.



II.    Basic Concepts

      State revenue forecasters operate   in   an environment characterized by

great uncertainty. Future revenues generated by a given revenue structure

depend on future values of variables like employment, population, and nominal

income,   none of which is easy to predict.      Additional uncertainty is created

by the fact that the state tax structure itself may be changed in the

future.    Such changes depend in part on the political climate in the state,

another thing that is hard to predict.         To make matters even more

                                                                  actions
complicated, state revenues may depend upon difficult to forecast

taken by the federal government.     For example,     in 1986,   the federal

                                                       taxes would no longer
government announced that after that year, state sales

be deductible on federal tax returns. As a consequence, many taxpayers moved
                                                                  increase in
up their purchases of durables to 1986, creating an unanticipated

sales tax revenues that year.

                                                           be expected to
      Operating In such an environment, forecasters cannot



                                           2
obtain precisely correct answers. Rather, the most one can ask is that

forecasters do as well as possible given the available information at the

time the forecast is made.             To formalize this notion, let Rt be

the actual percent change in nominal revenues in period t, and

        be the forecast of Rt made f periods ago.3                 is the set of
Rf                                                           'tf
information available when the forecast is made.              By definition, the

conditional expectation of the forecast error, vt_f, given this information

set, is



     (2.1)    vtf       E[(Rt-Rf)JItf]

Following Brown and Maital [1981], note that (2.1) implies the following

regression equation:


     '22 )    k'R      Re
                        t-f
                               =
                                     Vtf t-f + Ut
                                        'I



where                  = 0
         E[utlltf]

                                     said to be strongly rational if         =
        The forecast    Rf      is
                                                                       R_f       E[RtFIt_r].
From equation (2.2), this implies that vtf(Itf) is zero.                Hence, suppose

we estimate a regression of (Rt —            R_f)       on    If the variables
included in 1t-f are statistically significant, then we can reject the

hypothesis of strong rationality. Intuitively,               if predictions are strongly

                             should incorporate all relevant Information available
rational, then       Rf
at the time the forecast is made.             Therefore, the forecast error (Rt        R_f)
should be uncorrelated with any of this information.

     Suppose now that only a subset of 't—f Is utilized in making the

prediction.         If this subset Is used efficiently, then the forecast is said to

be weakly rational. That is, even if all information is not fully utilized,

the forecaster gets the correct answer on average.



                                                    3
    Like strong rationality, weak rationality has a simple interpretation in

a regression framework.         Suppose we estimate


    (2.3)     Rt
                   =
                       o+   i   Rf + Lit
If Rf     Is weakly rational,      then    = 0 and       1.   Hence, a test of weak


rationality requires only that we estimate (2.3) and use appropriate

statistical methods to test that joint hypothesis.

     There are conflicting views with respect to whether revenue predictions

are unbiased, and if not, whether revenues are over or underpredicted. Klay

[1983, p. 308] argues that the forecasts          are systematically too low:

            [It] is common for revenue forecasts to be made
            conservatively in a wide range of settings
            Intentional underestimates are a means of coping
            with uncertainty by reducing the likelihood that
            program reductions will become necessary during
            the budget year

          if a surplus 'unexpectedly" surfaces during the budget year,            this

might enhance the popularity of the administration. Another possible

motivation for underpredicting revenues is to conceal from legislators and
                                                                                Giovinazzo

the Legislature can't find, it can't spend."

    On the other hand, there are also arguments that forecasters have

Incentives to overestimate revenues.         High revenue forecasts might help

                                              4
     It is reasonable to ask whether over—                    underpredicting revenues year

after year is a viable strategy for fooling people.                   One would expect that


eventually the forecasts would lose credibility.                   This point is especially

telling   in states whose legislatures have their own revenue forecasting


organizations. (The legislatures of New Jersey and Maryland have such

organizations; Massachusetts does not.)                  Indeed,   it could also be argued that

like their counterparts in the private sector, public sector officials have

incentives   to forecast rationally. The present and former state budget

officials with whom we spoke claimed that they did their best to be on

target.     Interestingly, they stated that unexpected surpluses are just about

as bad as deficits from their point of view.                  When there is an unexpected

surplus, much of the extra revenue goes to localities.                   While the localities

are happy to receive the new money, they are Irked that they have to re-do

their planning,    and resent the fact that they were not given correct figures

at the outset.    Budget officials also emphasized the fact that the newspapers

point out forecast errors very aggressively, whether they are negative or

positive.    This observation is consistent with press reports that In 1988,

Governor Cuomo was    '.   .   .   annoyed that      his budget aids had embarrassed him by


underestimating revenue        .   .   .   in   each of the three previous years, [and]

ordered them this year not to be so conservative."4 Taken together, these

considerations suggest that forecasters have incentives to be rational in the

technical sense defined above.

     In short, there appears to be substantial                 disagreement regarding the

likely outcome of estimating equation (2.3).                  Resolution of this disagreement

requires analysis of the data.

III.        Institutional   Background and Data

       A.     The Budgetary Process

       New Jersey.     The last week of every January the Governor of New Jersey

submits to the legislature a budget statement that includes forecasts of

revenues and expenditures.5 The forecast for each item is made over two time

horizons.        The first, which we call the short forecast,        is for the fiscal

year that began the previous July         1.   The second, which we call the     J2
forecast, is for the fiscal year beginning the subsequent July 1.               Hence, the

short forecast presented in January 1988 covers the period July 1, 1987 to

June 30, 1q88; the long forecast contained in that message is for July 1,

1988 to June 30, 1989.

       In most states, forecasts are made by a budget division within the

executive branch (Hyde and Jarocki [1983,             p. 266]).   The final responsibility

lies with the governor,         who reviews the forecasts, and can modify them before

presentation. New Jersey is typical in these respects.               Legal   responsibility

for revenue estimation resides with the Governor and the Director of Budget

and Accounting.        However, the forecasts are developed in consultation with a

number of offices in the executive branch, particularly the various tax

bureaus.

       The forecasting process begins in the October precedIng the budget

address, and a set of figures is produced by November.               However, these

figures are usually revised once or twice before the budget message goes to

press in January.

       Revenue forecasting methods differ widely across the states.             Some

states rely on econometric models, others on much more Informal methods. In

the early 197Os Glovinazzo [1971, p. 27] noted that in New Jersey

"formalized, systematic techniques are seldom, if ever, used."                Rather than




                                                  6
using econometric models, forecasters      used a 'judgmental approach--they

informally analyzed past trends in different revenue sources, and relied

heavily on the expertise of members of the various tax bureaus.        Our

conversations with current and recent budget officials indicated that this is

still pretty much the case.       These officials indicated that attempts at

econometric modelling generally led to disappointing results, and that It was

better to rely on the advice of 'old hands" who had a good sense of what was

really going on in the state.       Revenue forecasts are made entirely In—house;

there is no contracting to outside consultants.

    Massachusetts. The Massachusetts institutions are very similar to those

of New Jersey.       Revenue estimates are prepared each November,   and forwarded

to the Governor, who presents them during the last week of the following

January. These estimates are prepared by the Bureau of Administration and

Finance   (B,A&F).    Formal econometric modelling plays a somewhat greater role

than it does in New Jersey.       Specifically,   BA&F receives econometric

forecasts for Massachusetts generated by a consulting firm (Data Resources,

Inc.), and then plugs these forecasts      into a micro simulation model based on

Massachusetts tax returns. However, all forecasts are subject to the

judgment of "old hands," and some revenue sources are forecast without any

formal modelling at all.       Corporate income taxes were offered as an example

where familiarity with individual cases was sufficiently important that

                                                                      forecasts.
"judgment forecasts" were used to the exclusion of statistical

    Maryland.        Estimates of state revenues in Maryland are developed through

a process that Is similar to the processes of New Jersey and Massachusetts.

Revenue forecasting is carried out by the Bureau of Revenue Estimates (BRE)

under the supervision of the State Comptroller, Treasurer, and Secretary of

Budget and Fiscal Planning.       The Governor receives the estimates in



                                            7
mid—December and incorporates them into his budget message which   is presented


to the state legislature in mid-January.

    The use of econometric forecasting techniques appears to be more

prevalent in Maryland than in either New Jersey or Massachusetts. Regression

models have been utilized In forecasting state revenues in Maryland since the

early 1970s.    The models tend to be quite simple——generally there are fewer

than three explanatory variables for each revenue source, and estimation is

by ordinary least squares. While revenue forecasting models are developed

entirely in—house, BRE officials depend significantly on outside econometric
                                                                            Such
forecasting services for the information on which the models are based.

services provide forecasts of various explanatory variables such as state

personal income.    As of 1987, econometric methods were applied to revenue

sources that comprised 87.5% of Maryland tax revenues.

    Of course, the unvarnished regression output is not included in the

governor's message-—quite a few modifications are made.    Nevertheless, it

will be of some interest to see whether the heavier reliance on econonietrics

leads to more accurate forecasts.

    B.   Data

    New Jersey.    The budgetary data are from the budget messages of February

1948 through January 1987.    Although budget documents were available back to

the 1930s, there appears to have been a change in accounting conventions

after World War II that made it difficult to construct a coherent time series.
                                                                   for the
     For each revenue source, the budget contains the actual value

fiscal year that ended the previous June 30, as well as the short and long

 forecasts for each revenue source.   The actual percent changes correspond

 to the Rt'S of the previous section, and the forecasts are the   R's.

     State revenues are disaggregated very finely.    In 1985 there were over




                                           8
170 revenue sources, which included items such as hunters       license fees and

shell fisheries leases.    For many of these   individual   items, the time series

are not very long—-particular taxes and license fees come and go.6 For this

reason and for purposes of simplicity, we aggregated all revenues into two

categories, revenues fro, own sources and revenues in the form of grants from

the federal government.    The distinction between own source revenues and

grants has played an important role In both theoretical      and econometric

analysis of state and local government fiscal decisions (see Inman [1979));

it seems worthwhile to investigate whether the expectational mechanisms for

the two revenue sources differ.    As in most states, federal grants have

played a very important role in the New Jersey budget.        In 1986, grants were

25 percent of own source revenues;   the ratio has been as high as 40 percent.

    In addition to budgetary data, execution of the strong tests requires

the variables in the information set.    As usual in studies of this kind, it

is not quite clear how to answer the question,     "What did they know and when

did they know it?'    For the "what" part of the question,     we assume that

information on the percent changes In the following economic and demographic

variables is relevant for predicting future revenues:        nominal personal

income (INC), population (POP), consumer price index (CPI), non-agricultural

employment (EMP), and the lagged value of revenue itself (Rt_f_1).        Except

for lagged revenue, each variable Is available on a calendar year basis.7

This leads to a complication in answering the "when" part of the question.

Given that the forecasts are made before the calendar year is entirely over,

it is not clear whether variables dated that year should be included in the

information   set.   On one hand, it could be argued that even though the

official estimates for the year are not out by December, officials can

monitor things closely enough to have a pretty good idea of what the values



                                         9
are.     However, one could just as well argue that the actual values for these

variables may be quite different from the officials' perceptions.          Our

conversations with budget officials indicated that except for income, it is

reasonable to treat the variables as "known" by the time the forecasts are

made.     On the other hand, income data are available only with a lag; hence,
                                                             In the
only the lagged percentage change In income is assumed to be

information set.

       As noted in Section II, revenue forecasts must take into account possible
                                                                 and signed
changes in tax structure that will be enacted by the legislature
                                                                         as well as
by the governor.        Hence, revenue forecasters must make political

 The general impression conveyed by the table is
                                                 that own revenues are

 predicted better than grants.

      Another interesting question about the forecasts Is
                                                          whether they have
 been improving over time. To
                                investigate this issue, we estimated a series of

 regressions of the form      -       =

                                           percentage points.         These

levels.      The values of
                           yj   for   grants are also negative, but they are

imprecisely estimated. One cannot reject the hypothesis of no

estimates of grants can only be constructed for fiscal years 1972 through

1987.   As 'own source" revenues, we aggregated all revenue sources which are

categorized in Maryland as "General Fund" revenues.        This category makes up

about 75% of non-grant evenues, and includes all non-dedicated state funds

such as receipts from the individual    income tax, corporate income tax, and

the retail sales and use tax.     Time series for both short and long forecasts

of own source revenues are available starting in fiscal year 1946.            The

variables relating to the political    environment   are from Boyd   C   1987].
    The Maryland summary statistics are presented in Table ic.           All sources

of revenue grew at faster rates In Maryland than their counterparts in New

Jersey and Massachusetts. (Recall, however, that the time periods over which

the averages are taken differ somewhat across the states as do the

definitions of "own revenues.")    With respect to forecasts of own source

revenues, the qualitative picture is much the same as that for New Jersey and

Massachusetts——on average, revenues are underforecast, and there has been

some tendency for the absolute value of the forecast errors to fall over

time.

    As is also the case in New Jersey and Massachusetts, grants play an

important role to state public finance.       In 1987,   the ratio of grant to

non—grant revenues was about 24 percent; it has been as high as 31 percent.

However, Table ic indicates   that unlike New Jersey and Massachusetts, in

Maryland predictions of grants are too optimistic on average.            Moreover,

using any method for measuring the errors, the grants forecasts are much

worse than In New Jersey and Massachusetts. Closer investigation of the data

indicated that these results are dominated by several years in the mid—1970s,

when the forecast rate of growth of grants exceeded the actual by as much as



                                         13
86 percentage points.                 According to the budget officials we consulted, those

errors were largely due to unanticipated Increases in the prices of petroleum

products.

depends on the outcome of the          hypothesis that ij = 0 and cq          1.   The

p—value for the appropriate chi-square test    is 0.00.      Thus, the data reject


by a wide margin that tne short forecasts of own revenue are weakly rational.

    It was already clear from Table la that New Jersey's short own revenue

forecasts tend to be biased downward. The estimates of         e.j   and c* in Table 2

indicate that there is no simple way to characterize the nature of the bias.

That is, forecasters do not always underforecast by the same number of

percentage points (because    u   is not zero); neither do they underforecast by

a constant proportion of the correct forecast (because aj is not zero).

Hence, there does not appear to be a simple rule of thumb producing the

the joint test, which has a p-value of 0.408.        Thus,   unlike own revenues,    the


short forecasts    for grants are weakly rational.     Although the grants

forecasts are 'worse" in the sense of having a lower R2, they are unbiased.

results are similar to those for New Jersey.      Weak rationality cannot be

rejected for the short forecasts of grants; it is rejected decisively for

each category are smaller than those of the associated short forecasts. But

                                           For short forecasts    of own revenues,
there are several differences as well.

                                                                           is

the significance level of the test was 0.790; for the long forecasts, it was

0.248.

    We do not regard these results as "proof" that econometric forecasting

methods are useless--it could be that Maryland implements these methods

poorly,   and/or that the results are ignored by political decision-makers,

and/or that for some reason revenues have become Intrinsically more difficult

to forecast since 1973, so that in the absence of econometric methods, the

results would have been worse.      Still, on the basis of these results, one

would have to be cautious about urging states to fire their "old hands" and

replace them with computers.

    Turning now to the grants forecasts,        we see that unlike New Jersey and

Massachusetts, weak rationality is rejected.         This finding is not altogether

surprising given the discussion surrounding Table ic.          The series of gigantic

over—predictions of grants in the mid—1970s makes it Impossible that the

forecasts as a whole would exhibit weak rationality.



    C.    Results:   Strong Tests of Rationality

    New Jersey.      In light of the fact that the New Jersey data already

rejected weak rationality for own revenues, we expect that strong rationality

will also be rejected.       Nevertheless, it   is still   of some interest to examine

the coefficients on the various variables in the information         set.   This

should indicate which information      is not being properly assimilated into the

forecasts.    In contrast,    on the basis of the weak tests, the grants equations

are still in the game.       For them, a test of the joint hypothesis that all the

coefficients are zero is of considerable interest.

    Table 3a shows the results for the strong tests.           As noted above, the

similar to those for New Jersey.       Thus, for example,   increases   in past

revenues lead to more optimistic forecasts, as do being in the first year of

an administration and being in an election year.         Like their New Jersey

counterparts, the Republican governors of Massachusetts tend to be more

pessimistic about revenues than the Democrats (compare the coefficient on

REPUB of 0.0183 to 0.0205 from column (1) of Table 3a).         Of course, one

should not make too much of these similarities, given that on a one-by—one

basis, the coefficients In column (1) are Insignificantlydifferent from

zero.   Similarly,     the column (3) results for the long forecasts     of own

revenues do not contain any significant variables.

    With respect to the results for grants In columns (2) and (4), the key

result is that one cannot reject the hypothesis that all the coefficients are

                                                       for the long

    Maryland.        The strong tests of rationality for Maryland are reported in

Table 3c.   As was the case for New Jersey and Massachusetts, strong

rationality     is   rejected for forecasts of own source revenues. However, on a

coefficient by coefficient basis, many of the results are different. In

particular, the signs of the "political" variables are reversed. While one

should not make too much of this result due to the fact that the Individual

coefficients are Imprecisely estimated, It is perhaps worth noting that

unlike New Jersey and Massachusetts, during our sample period Maryland was

pretty much a one-party state.        The Democrats controlled the governorship for

all but two years.        (The one Republican was Spiro T. Agnew.) This political

environment differs considerably from that in New Jersey and Maryland; we



                                             19
conjecture that this difference might affect political       Incentives   to over- or

underestimate revenues.

     Columns (2) and (4) of Table 3c indicate that forecasts of grants in

Maryland are not strongly rational.     Given the results In Tables ic and panel

(c) of Table 2, it is no surprise to find that forecasts       of grants in

Maryland do not incorporate all of the relevant information.



V.   Conclusion

     This paper has suggested a framework for examining whether state revenue

forecasts are formed rationally, and used this framework to analyze budget

data from New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Maryland. The states are remarkably

similar in several ways:     a) on average the forecasts of the growth of own

revenues have fallen short of actual growth;      b) there has been some tendency

for the forecasts of own revenues to improve over time, but the improvement

is generally not statistically significant;     and    c) forecasts   of own revenues

fail to incorporate all the information     available to the forecasters.

     On the other hand, we have also found some differences among the three

states.     The most important of these concern the forecasts for federal grant

receipts.     In New Jersey and Massachusetts, forecasts of grants are weakly

and strongly rational;     In Maryland they are neither.    The results for New

Jersey and Massachusetts seem more intuitive.         Federal grants depend

partially on expenditures from state funds.      Their underestimation will

neither restrain legislative spending in a way that might be desired by the

executive, nor provide the executive with "unexpected" surpluses out of which

to fund favored programs.1° As we noted earlier, the time series on grants

forecasts for Maryland is dominated by several large outliers in the

mid-1970s. Of course,      it is illegitimate to discard outliers from a time




                                          20
series, and we have not done so.   Still,    our   guess is that if the grants

forecasts of other states are analyzed, they will tend to be more like those

of New Jersey and Massachusetts than those of Maryland.11

    We also found that Maryland's more extensive use of econometric methods

does not seem to have produced results much different than those of New

Jersey and Massachusetts. However, data on more states are required to test

carefully whether differences in state budgetary methods and institutions

affect the quality of revenue forecasts.

         in parentheses are standard errors. In cases where the
Durbin-Watson statistic rejects the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation,
standard errors are computed using Newey and West's [1987] correction for
autocorrelation. Also, the variable GOVAGR Is perfectly collinear with other
right hand side variables throughout all the sample periods considered here,
and is therefore omitted.

+The time period used to estimate the equations for long forecasts of grant
revenues was 1972—1987; durIng this period there were no Republican Governors
in Maryland, and therefore the variable REPUB was omitted. This problem did
not arise In the longer periods used to estimate the other equations.

1.   See, for example, Litterman and Supel (1983]. Klay [1983] and

     Hyde and Jarocki [1983] discuss the various institutional

     arrangements for making revenue forecasts,    summarize the techniques

     that have been used, and provide brief histories of state revenue

     forecasting.

2.   For some examples, see Bernhelm (1987] on expected social security

     benefits, Zarnowitz (1985] on expected business conditions such as

     GNP and the inflation rate, Leonard [1982) on businesses'    wage

     expectations,   and Mankiw and Shapiro [1986] on the GNP predictions

     made by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.     Lovell [1986] summarizes a

     number of other studies.

3.   The analysis can just as well be conducted in terms of levels as

     percent changes; we follow Zarnowltz [1985] and others in using percent

     changes.

5.   Before 1973, the message was presented in mid-February.

6.   An Important example is the state income tax, which has only been in

     existence since the 1970s.

7.   Data sources for New Jersey are as follows:     Employment: Bureau of Labor

     Statistics, Statistical Abstract of the United States, various Issues;

     Political Affiliations (for both governor and state legislators): Counci

     of State Governments, Book of the States, various issues; CPI: Economic

     Report of the President 1987, Table B—57; Population and Personal

      Income: Bureau of Economic Analysis,    State Personal Income:   1929—82,

     and updated with various issues of the Statistical Abstract of the

     United States.

8.   INC, POP, CPI and EMP are from the same sources as New Jersey.

     REPUB, FIRSTYR. GOVAGR and ELECTYR are from Dalton and Wlrkkala [1984].

9.   Brown and Maital [1981] stress that for multi—period ahead forecasts,

     the error terms may be moving averages.       The Newey-West procedure

     produces consistent standard errors in the presence of such an error

     structure.

10. We are grateful to a referee for pointing out this fact to us.

11. Another possible reason for the poor quality of Maryland's grants

     forecasts is that they are not Integrated with the rest of the budget

     document.    That   Is,   the "bottom line" that indicates whether the budget

     is in balance is not affected by the forecast of grants.
