                                          ABSTRACT

A product market is concentrated when a few firms dominate the market. Similarly, a labor
market is concentrated when a few firms dominate hiring in the market. Using data from the
leading employment website CareerBuilder.com, we calculate labor market concentration for
over 8,000 geographic-occupational labor markets in the US. Based on the DOJ-FTC horizontal
merger guidelines, the average market is highly concentrated. Using a panel IV regression, we
show that going from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile in concentration is associated with
a 17% decline in posted wages, suggesting that concentration increases labor market power.

1    Introduction

    There is growing concern about increasing market concentration and its potential effects on
the economy, including increases in markups (De Loecker and Eeckhout, 2017) and the decline
in the labor share (Autor et al., 2017; Barkai, 2016). Concerns about a lack of competition in
the labor market have also reached the policy debate (CEA, 2016). While interest in monop-
sony has grown in recent years (Ashenfelter, Farber and Ransom, 2010; Manning, 2011), firms’
ability to pay workers less than their marginal productivity is not generally taken into account
in antitrust practice. Antitrust enforcement is mainly concerned with consumer welfare, and
hence the impacts of a lack of competition on product prices, not wages. Antitrust enforcers
have historically paid little attention to labor market power, despite the labor economics liter-
ature finding that firms can have substantial market power in the labor market (Staiger, Spetz
and Phibbs, 2010; Falch, 2010; Ransom and Sims, 2010; Matsudaira, 2013). This empirical work
has generally focused on particular labor markets. Therefore it is not clear how widespread
labor market power truly is, and how much it affects wages.
    In this paper, we approach this question by directly quantifying the level of labor mar-
ket concentration across a wide range of occupations and for almost every commuting zone
in the US. In a nutshell, we find that labor market concentration in the average market is
high, and higher concentration is associated with significantly lower posted wages. Given
high concentration, mergers have the potential to significantly increase labor market power.
This type of analysis could be used by antitrust agencies to assess whether mergers can create
anti-competitive effects in labor markets.
    We measure labor market concentration using traditional measures such as the Herfindahl-
Hirschman Index (HHI), which have the advantage that they can be compared with the thresh-
olds in the antitrust agencies’ horizontal merger guidelines (FTC/DOJ, 2010). The same thresh-
olds apply to seller and buyer power, as the horizontal merger guidelines state that “To evalu-
ate whether a merger is likely to enhance market power on the buying side of the market, the

                                               1
Agencies employ essentially the framework described above for evaluating whether a merger
is likely to enhance market power on the selling side of the market.” The buying side of the
market refers to inputs markets, including the labor market. Therefore, a merger can be said to
enhance market power if it results in a high level of concentration in specific labor markets.
   To calculate market shares in geographic and occupational labor markets, we use data from
CareerBuilder.com, the largest online job board in the United States, matching millions of work-
ers and firms. We calculate vacancy shares and HHIs of market concentration for over 8,000
labor markets, defined by a combination of occupation at the SOC-6 level and commuting
zone. The occupations we cover include the most frequent occupations among CareerBuilder
vacancies, plus the top occupations in manufacturing and construction. We show that, on av-
erage, labor markets are highly concentrated: the average HHI is 3,157, which is above the
2,500 threshold for high concentration according to the Department of Justice / Federal Trade
Commission horizontal merger guidelines. Concentration varies by occupation and city, with
larger cities being less concentrated.
   We document a negative correlation between labor market concentration and average posted
wages in that market. We then run both OLS and instrumental variables (IV) regressions of
posted wages on concentration at the market level (HHI), using quarterly panel data ranging
from 2010 to 2013. Our instrument for the IV specification is the inverse number of posting
employers in other geographic markets for the same occupation in a given quarter. This instru-
ment uses variation in market concentration that is driven by national-level changes in occu-
pational hiring over time, and not by potentially endogenous changes in occupational hiring
within a particular local market.
   The OLS and IV results are qualitatively similar, but quantitatively the instrumented esti-
mates are much larger. In the baseline IV specification, the elasticity of the real wage with re-
spect to the HHI is -0.127, while in the baseline OLS specification the elasticity is -0.038. Going
from the 25th to the 75th level of concentration decreases posted wages by 17% in the baseline
IV specification, and by 5% in the baseline OLS specifications. The instrument we use may not


                                                2
be fully exogenous. Therefore, we allow departures from full exogeneity (Conley, Hansen and
Rossi, 2010): we find that the second-stage estimate of the impact of HHI on wages is bounded
away from zero as long as the direct (endogenous) effect of the instrument on wages is not
more than 75% of the reduced form effect. We thus show that the negative effect of HHI on
wages is robust even for large departures from exogeneity.
   One might be concerned that the impact of concentration on posted wages is endogeneous
due to the relationship between the number of vacancies and concentration. The sign of the bias
could be positive or negative: a decrease in labor demand can lower wages and the number
of firms hiring in the market, leading to higher concentration; a decrease in labor supply can
increase wages, and lower the number of firms hiring, also leading to higher concentration. To
alleviate this concern, we control for labor market tightness, defined as vacancies/applications
(Davis and Marinescu, 2017). We find that the negative effect of concentration on wages is
essentially unchanged. Overall, our results are consistent with labor market concentration cre-
ating labor market power, and hence putting downward pressure on wages.
   We perform a number of additional robustness checks. Most importantly, Marinescu and
Wolthoff (2016) show that posted wages are largely explained by job titles. Therefore, it is im-
portant to control for heterogeneity by job title to get an estimate of the impact of concentration
on wages for a given job type. When we control for job titles, the effect of concentration on
wages is still highly significant and negative but smaller, suggesting that concentration may
change the composition of jobs toward lower paying jobs. We also use alternative measures of
labor market concentration, such as the inverse of the number of hiring firms, or market con-
centration as measured by the number of applications: these alternative measures also yield a
negative and highly significant impact of labor market concentration on posted wages.
   This paper provides for the first time to our knowledge a measure of labor market concen-
tration for many of the largest labor markets in the US. Our measure of concentration is distinct
from the industry concentration measures used by Autor et al. (2017) and Barkai (2016): it is




                                                3
based on concentration in the labor market rather than concentration in the product market.1
Our contribution is therefore complementary: while those authors show that product market
concentration is associated with a lower labor share, we show that labor market concentration
is associated with lower posted wages.
    The papers that come closest to ours in approach are Benmelech, Bergman and Kim (2018)
and Rinz (2018), which build on the present article by studying concentration of employment
in labor markets defined by geography and industry, using Census data on employment by
firms and establishments.
    The monopsony literature in labor economics approaches the issue of market power through
questions such as the impact of the minimum wage and unionization. This literature focuses
on the elasticity of labor supply to the individual firm, as opposed to market concentration2 . In
such “New Monopsony” models, employers trade off wages with their employees’ quit rates,
and they face an upward-sloping supply curve due to search frictions, firm-specific amenities,
and limited geographic mobility of workers, in addition to other mechanisms. If workers have
a high labor supply elasticity, then firms pay them more to get them to stay. The literature
generally finds low elasticities of labor supply and interprets this as evidence for firm-level
monopsony power to reduce wages below the marginal product of labor (Webber, 2015; Dube
et al., 2019).
    Our approach is complementary to this literature, but with a different mechanism at play.
We measure market-level concentration in local and occupational labor markets, implicitly
arising from restrictions to employer entry or other characteristics of firms or industries, as
opposed to characteristics of workers. In our framework, firms pay higher wages if the labor
market is unconcentrated and workers can expect abundant job offers from competing employ-
ers.
   1 Toour knowledge, the last published measurement of labor market concentration is Bunting (1962). Boal and
Ransom (1997) reviewed the literature.
   2 An older literature has explored the impact of labor market concentration on wages. However, this literature

is mostly limited to teachers’ and nurses’ markets and uses cross-sectional identification, as discussed in Boal and
Ransom (1997).

    Buyer-side market power caused by concentration and the upward-sloping firm-level labor
supply curve are mutually-reinforcing mechanisms for monopsony power and for the empir-
ical findings from the aforementioned labor literature, such as the small effect of minimum
wage increases on employment.
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data, and our
measure of labor market concentration. Section 3 analyzes the relationship between labor mar-
ket concentration and posted wages. Section 4 performs robustness tests and addresses re-
maining limitations. Finally, section 5 concludes.



2     Measuring labor market concentration

2.1   Data

    We use proprietary data from CareerBuilder, which is the largest online job board in the
United States. The site received approximately 11 million unique job seeker visits in January
2011. Job seekers can use the site for free, while firms seeking to hire workers must pay a fee of
several hundred dollars to post a job opening for one month. The total number of vacancies on
CareerBuilder.com represents 35% of the total number of vacancies in the US in January 2011
as counted in the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. The dataset used here was first
used in Davis and Marinescu (2017). Occupations were selected based on counts of jobs posted
between 2009 and 2012 on CareerBuilder: at the broad SOC level, i.e. SOC-5 digits, the 13 most
frequent occupations were selected. We also added the three most frequent occupations in
manufacturing and construction (17-2110, 47-1010, 51-1010). The full list of SOC-6 occupations
is as follows:


    • 11-3011 Administrative services managers

    • 13-2011 Accountants and Auditors



                                                5
• 13-2051 Financial Analysts

• 13-2052 Personal financial advisers

• 13-2053 Insurance Underwriters

• 13-2061 Financial Examiners

• 15-1041 Computer support specialists

• 17-2111 Health and Safety Engineers, Except Mining Safety Engineers and Inspectors

• 17-2112 Industrial engineers

• 29-1111 Registered nurses

• 41-4011 Sales representatives, wholesale & manufacturing, technical & scientific products

• 41-9041 Telemarketers

• 43-3031 Bookkeeping, accounting, and auditing clerks

• 43-4051 Customer service representatives

• 43-6011 Executive secretaries and administrative assistants

• 43-6012 Legal Secretaries

• 43-6013 Medical secretaries

• 43-6014 Secretaries and Administrative Assistants, Except Legal, Medical, and Executive

• 47-1011 First-Line Supervisors of Construction Trades and Extraction Workers

• 49-3041 Farm equipment mechanics

• 49-3042 Mobile Heavy Equipment Mechanics, Except Engines



                                           6
   • 49-3043 Rail Car Repairers

   • 51-1011 First-line supervisors/managers of production and operating workers

   • 53-3031 Driver/sales workers

   • 53-3032 Truck drivers, heavy and tractor-trailer

   • 53-3033 Light Truck or Delivery Services Drivers


   Our data includes, for each vacancy, the number of applicants. This allows us to calcu-
late labor market tightness at the occupation by local labor market level as (number of vacan-
cies)/(number of applications).
   Only about 20% of the CareerBuilder vacancies post salary information. The posted wage
is converted into an annual salary if it is hourly. The posted wage is defined as the middle of
the range if the vacancy posts a range rather than a single value. We estimate posted wages for
a given market and year-quarter as the simple average of the posted wage in the wage-posting
vacancies. Figure 1 shows the distribution of log real wages across markets and year-quarters.
The distribution is bi-modal and there are a small number of outliers on the left and the right
sides of the distribution.


2.2   Labor market definition

   Given that monopsony power in labor markets has not been a focus of antitrust policy, the
crucial question of how to define the relevant market for antitrust analysis is relatively unex-
plored in the literature. The twin imperatives contained in the Horizontal Merger Guidelines
are that markets be defined in terms of “lines of commerce” and “section of the country.”
   Marinescu and Rathelot (2018) show that applications to a job decline rapidly with distance,
although most applications are still outside the applicant’s zip code. It is therefore key to define
labor markets geographically to obtain meaningful measures of market concentration. For our



                                                 7
baseline analysis, we use commuting zones (CZs) to define geographic labor markets. Com-
muting zones are geographic area definitions based on clusters of counties that were developed
by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) using data from the 2000 Census on
commuting patterns across counties to capture local economies and local labor markets in a
way that is more economically meaningful than county boundaries. According to the USDA
documentation, “commuting zones were developed without regard to a minimum population
threshold and are intended to be a spatial measure of the local labor market.” Marinescu and
Rathelot (2018) also show that 81% of applications on CareerBuilder.com are within the com-
muting zone, and Manning and Petrongolo (2017) similarly find that labor market searches
are local in UK data, and Bartik (2018) finds evidence against full worker mobility across com-
muting zones. We conduct robustness checks using single counties for our geographic market
definition instead of commuting zones.
   When it comes to defining the analog to “line of commerce” in labor markets, the economic
literature shows that there are substantial frictions associated with transitioning between jobs
(Artuc, Chaudhuri and McLaren, 2010; Dix-Caneiro, 2014; Artuc and McLaren, 2015; Traiber-
man, 2017; Macaluso, 2017). No work, to our knowledge, attempts to define labor markets in
the education space. Macaluso (2017) defines the concept of "skill remoteness" on the supply
and demand sides of a labor market and finds that workers whose skills are further away from
the available jobs in their local labor market (defined by city and occupation) are more likely
to either move or exit the labor force in response to a layoff. Hershbein and Kahn (2016) and
Modestino, Shoag and Ballance (2016) characterize the skill distribution of job vacancies as
changing in response to the severity of local labor market recessions. But the extent to which
workers confine their job searches to an education- or skills-delimited segment of available jobs
has not yet been systematically explored (but see some evidence on search across occupations
in Marinescu and Rathelot (2018)).
   Using the a vacancies dataset from the same source as the one used in this paper, Marinescu
and Wolthoff (2016) show that, within a 6-digit SOC, the elasticity of applications with respect


                                               8
to wages is negative. Therefore, the 6-digit SOC is likely too broad to be a labor market, since we
would expect applications to increase in response to posted wages in a frictional labor market
(see Subsection 3.3 below). Nonetheless, we consider SOC-6 occupation to be a conservative
benchmark, with the understanding that concentration measured within labor markets defined
that way is likely to be an under-estimate.
   We calculate labor market concentration using posted vacancies and applications to those
vacancies. Concentration could also be computed using observed employment (albeit not with
this dataset). The concentration of employment is almost certainly lower than the concentra-
tion of vacancies–only a subset of the firms in a given labor market (defined by geography
and occupation) will be hiring at any given time. But our measure of concentration based on
vacancies is more relevant for active job seekers, especially in light of evidence of lengthening
job tenures, which implies that a given position will remain filled for longer (Hyatt and Splet-
zer, 2016). Moreover, our results about the effect of concentration on wages are estimated from
variation in concentration over time within a labor market, and in our robustness checks we ag-
gregate vacancy postings over time, which reduces observed concentration levels–toward what
we would probably observe if concentration were computed from firm-level employment.
   We do our analysis at the quarterly level, since the median duration of unemployment was
about 10 weeks in 2016 BLS (2017). We consider for our market share calculations all vacancies
or applications that occur within a given quarter, including vacancies with missing wages.


2.3   Measuring concentration

   We keep an unbalanced panel of 61,017 CZ-occupation-year-quarter observations, cover-
ing the period 2010Q1-2013Q4, 681 commuting zones, and 26 SOC 6-digit occupations. These
markets all include at least one vacancy with a posted wage.
   Our baseline measure of market power in a labor market is the Herfindahl-Hirschman In-
dex (HHI) calculated based on the share of vacancies of all the firms that post vacancies in



                                                9
that market.3 The HHI is widely used as a measure of market concentration in the industrial
organization literature and in antitrust practice. An advantage of this measure of market con-
centration is that there are guidelines for what represents a high level of market concentration.
The DOJ/FTC guidelines: an HHI above 1500 is "moderately concentrated", and above 2500 is
"highly concentrated". An HHI of 2,500 occurs when four employers have equal shares of the
vacancies in a labor market. A merger that increases the HHI by more than 200 points, leading
to a highly concentrated market is "presumed likely to increase market power".
    While these measures and thresholds are generally used to evaluate market concentration
in product markets, the antitrust agency guidelines state that “[t]o evaluate whether a merger
is likely to enhance market power on the buying side of the market, the Agencies employ
essentially the framework describe above for evaluating whether a merger is likely to enhance
market power on the selling side of the market.” This implies that adverse effects of mergers on
the inputs market, including the labor market, are part of the legal framework for evaluating
mergers.
    The formula for the HHI in market m and year-quarter t is

                                                              J
                                              HHIm,t =       ∑ s2j,m,t                                       (2.1)
                                                             j =1


where s j,m is the market share of firm j in market m. For the HHI based on vacancies, the
market share of a firm in a given market and year-quarter is defined as the sum of vacancies
posted in CareerBuilder by a given firm in a given market and year-quarter divided by total
vacancies posted in the website in that market and year-quarter. We treat all vacancies posted
by a recruiting / staffing firm as belonging to the same firm, since we cannot observe which
firm the recruiting / staffing firm is hiring for.
    In addition to calculating HHIs for each labor market based on shares of vacancies, we
   3 Byconfining this investigation to only the largest online job board, CareerBuilder, we add another dimension
to market definition, that of the search platform. If workers search for jobs across multiple platforms, this might
yield an excessive concentration estimate, but if most users use only one platform, then that concern would be
mitigated.


                                                        10
also calculated HHIs based on shares of applications (more specifically Expressions of Interest,
i.e. clicking on the button "Apply now"). For the HHI based on applications, we define the
market share of a firm in a given market and year-quarter as the sum of applications through
the website to a given firm in a given market and year-quarter divided by the total number of
applications to all firms in that market and year-quarter.
   Table 1 shows summary statistics of the main variables used in our analysis. The average
real wage was 41,547 USD (in 2009 dollars). The average market in our sample had 20 firms, 83
vacancies, 441,156 searches, and 3,612 applications. The average HHI based on vacancies was
3,157. The average HHI based on applications was somewhat higher: 3,480, reflecting the fact
that not all vacancies received the same level of interest from job seekers.
   Table 1 also shows that the average HHI calculated using shorter time periods than the quar-
ter is higher, and the HHI using longer time periods is lower but still highly concentrated. The
population-weighted quarterly HHI is lower and moderately concentrated. As would be ex-
pected, county-level HHIs are higher than CZ-level HHIs, and state-level HHIs are lower than
CZ-level HHIs. With the exception of a state-level definition of the labor market, all alternative
definitions still show moderate to high concentration.
   Figure 2 shows a map of all the commuting zones in the United States color-coded by the
average HHI, based on vacancy shares. Commuting zones around large cities tend to have
lower levels of labor market concentration than smaller cities or rural areas. This suggests
a new explanation for the city-wage premium (Yankow, 2006; Baum-Snow and Pavan, 2012):
cities, and especially large cities, tend to have less concentrated labor markets than rural areas.4
   Figure 3 shows the distribution of the HHIs based on vacancies and of the HHI based on
applications in our sample. Under both definitions for market shares, the median market is
moderately concentrated, while the average market is highly concentrated.
   Figure 4 shows the average HHI, based on vacancy shares, by 6-digit SOC occupation.
The occupations that are least concentrated on average are "Customer service representatives",
  4 Manning   (2010) shows evidence on plant size that is consistent with lower monopsony power in cities.


                                                      11
"Sales representatives, wholesale and manufacturing, technical and scientific products", and
"Registered nurses", each with an average HHI of around 2,000. The occupations that are most
concentrated on average are "Farm equipment mechanics", "Rail car repairers", and "Light truck
or delivery services drivers", each with an average HHI well above 5,000 (which is the level of
concentration of a symmetric duopsony market).
     In summary, we find that reasonably defined local labor markets are highly concentrated
on average. A limitation of our analysis is that we only use vacancies posted on the Career-
Builder website.5 Given that CareerBuilder is the largest job-posting website in the United
States, the high level of concentration was somewhat surprising to us, especially given that
many economists’ prior seems to be that labor market monopsony power, if it exists at all, is
due primarily to search frictions. Our findings can, however, be consistent with the search fric-
tions story, in the sense that if we consider a longer time period the market is less concentrated
(Table 1). Also, while the CareerBuilder website does not contain all vacancies, it is likely that,
for job seekers who use it, the site is a main source of information on the labor market.



3      Concentration and wages

     Figure 5 shows a binned scatter plot of the log real wage and log HHI based on vacancies.
The two variables are strongly correlated and the association is close to log-linear. Appendix
Figure 6 shows a similar relationship between the real wage and market concentration obtains
when using the log HHI based on applications instead of the log HHI based on vacancies.
     This negative correlation between market concentration and real wages is consistent with
standard oligopsony theory, which predicts that firms in more concentrated labor markets
should be able to pay workers wages below their marginal product. Of course, we cannot
infer a causal relationship from this correlation alone. It could be driven, for example, by the
fact that larger cities tend to have both a higher number of firms and higher wages, perhaps
    5 Thisis less of an issue for interpreting the within-market variation over time in concentration, which is the
basis for the regression analysis in the following section.


                                                        12
due to a higher cost of living. To address this issue, we conduct panel regressions that con-
trol for commuting zone by occupation effects, and identify the effect purely from variation in
concentration and wages over time within a given commuting zone-occupation pair.


3.1   Empirical specification: OLS and IV

   Our baseline specification is the following:


                     log(wm,t ) = β · log HHIm,t + γ · Xm,t + αt + νm + ε m,t ,                (3.1)


where log(w) is the log real wage in market m in year-quarter t, log HHIm,t is the corresponding
log HHI, Xm,t is a set of controls, and αt and δm are year-quarter and market (commuting zone-
occupation) fixed effects and em,t is an error term.
   We run a first specification with just year-quarter fixed effects. We then add successively
market (CZ by SOC-6) fixed effects and log tightness (defined as the number of vacancies di-
vided by the number of applications in a labor market) in the commuting zone and occupation
for a given year-quarter. We then run a fourth specification further controlling for year-quarter
by commuting zone, and finally we also add year-quarter by SOC fixed effects in a fifth speci-
fication, to control for any possible changes in the characteristics of the commuting zone or the
occupation over time. We cluster standard errors at the commuting zone-occupation level.
   The key threat to identification is that there is a time-varying market-specific variable that is
correlated with HHI and drives wages. According to search and matching theory, posted wages
are determined by labor market tightness, productivity and the worker’s out-of-work benefit
(Rogerson, Shimer and Wright, 2005). We already control for labor market tightness. Since
unemployment benefits are determined at the state level, we are able to control for workers’
out-of-work benefits by controlling for market fixed effects, and, in some specifications market
by time fixed effects. Therefore, the main threat to identification is time-varying market-specific
productivity changes.


                                                  13
   To further address the issue of the endogeneity of HHI, we instrument the HHI with the av-
erage of log(1/N ) in other commuting zones for the same occupation and time period (where
N refers to the number of firms in the market). That is, for each commuting zone-occupation-
time period combination, we calculate the average of log(1/N ) for the same occupation for
every other commuting zone. We use log(1/N ) instead of HH I as the instrument because it
is less likely to be endogenous, as it does not depend on market shares. This provides us with
variation in market concentration that is driven by national-level changes in the occupation,
and not by changes in the occupation in that particular local market. For example, if the pro-
ductivity of customer service representatives falls in the Chicago area, this could both decrease
wages and increase concentration, since fewer firms would likely be recruiting. By instrument-
ing with the number of firms posting vacancies for customer service representatives in other
areas, we rule out a direct effect of productivity in Chicago on the HHI.
   This type of instrumental variables strategy is commonly used in industrial organization to
address the endogeneity of prices in a local product market. For example, Nevo (2001) uses
prices in other geographic markets to instrument for city-level prices of various products in
the ready-to-eat cereal industry. Outcomes in other geographic units have also been used as
instruments in Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2013), who instrument for growth in US imports from
China using Chinese imports in other high-income countries.
   The main threat to identification for the instrumental variable strategy is that productivity
shocks could be correlated across areas. For example, a national level decline in the productiv-
ity of customer service representatives would likely increase concentration and decrease wages
in most labor markets. Therefore, the instrument protects us against a spurious correlation be-
tween concentration and outcomes that is due to local changes in productivity, but not against
national-level changes in productivity (for an occupation relative to other occupations) that
influence both concentration and other labor market outcomes.
   While the instrument may not be not fully exogenous, it is plausibly more exogenous that
the local market HHI, in particular because it is less likely to be correlated with uncontrolled


                                               14
for variations in productivity for the local CZ by occupation market. We exploit this idea by
deriving bounds for the causal effect of HHI on wages using the method developed by Conley,
Hansen and Rossi (2010). Suppose that the instrument has a direct effect on the outcome of
interest, with a coefficient of γ 6= 0. If we assume a range of values for γ, we can derive an
interval for the causal effect of the HHI on wages. The stronger the first stage, the tighter the
interval for the causal effect.


3.2   Regression results

   We find that higher labor market concentration is associated with significantly lower real
wages. Table 3 Panel A shows the results from the baseline wage regressions. In the first re-
gression, using vacancy-share HHIs and only year-quarter fixed effects, we find that a one log
point increase in the HHI is associated with a decline in wages of about 0.103 log points. Fur-
ther controlling for market fixed effects (CZ by 6-digit SOC) reduces the coefficient to -.0347,
showing that some of the negative relationship between posted wages and HHI is driven by
cross-sectional variation in posted wages. Specification (3) shows that controlling for log tight-
ness and does not substantially change the result from specification (2). We consider specifi-
cation (3) to be the baseline for OLS results. Figure 7 shows a binned scatter corresponding to
specification (3): the relationship between the residualized wages and the residualized HHI is
negative and linear, similar to the raw relationship between wages and HHI (Figure 5).
   Specifications 4 and 5 allow for commuting zone and occupation effects to change over time.
Adding year-quarter by CZ fixed effects does not affect the impact of HHI on wages (compare
column 3 and 4 in Table 3), showing that the effects are not driven by time-varying effects at
the CZ level. When we further add year-quarter by 6-digit SOC fixed effects (column 5), the
impact of HHI on wages remains negative and of a similar size. This shows that the negative
impact of HHI on wages is not explained away by changes in occupational wages over time,
due to e.g. technological change.
   Specifications (6) to (8) show analogous results but based on the instrumental variables es-

                                               15
timation strategy (see Table 2 for the first stage). The estimated effect is still negative but much
larger in absolute value. The IV estimate may be higher because it corrects the endogeneity
bias from market-level labor supply and demand effects, and possibly also corrects for mea-
surement error. A one log point increase in the HHI is associated with a decline in wages of
about 0.14 log points. This implies that an increase in HHI of 200 in a market with an HHI of
2000 (moderately concentrated), which is a decline of 10 log points, is associated with a decline
in wages of about 1.4%. Going from the 25th percentile of market concentration to the 75th per-
centile of market concentration is associated with a decline in wages of 5% using specification
(3), and of 17% using specification (7), our baseline specification for the IV.6
    The main threat to identification for the instrumental variable strategy is that productivity
shocks to occupations could be correlated across areas. We cannot control for occupation by
time fixed effects in the IV specifications due to the fact that the instrument is essentially de-
fined at that level. Nevertheless, it is reassuring to see that controlling for occupation by time
effects does not substantively change the OLS results (column 4).
    We recognize that the instrument may not be not fully exogenous, and we provide bounds
on the second stage effect of HHI on wages, assuming a degree of endogeneity in the instru-
ment. Using market-level data, we regress wages on the instrument, and controls (Table 4),
which gives us the reduced form effect of the instrument. We then calculate the bounds for the
second stage effect of HHI on wages, assuming that the direct effect of the instrument on wages
(γ) ranges from zero (perfectly exogenous) to the reduced form effect. We use Stata’s plausexog
and start with a simple specification in column 1, and control for tightness in column 2. When
controlling for tightness, the second stage effect of HHI on wages ranges between -0.177 and
0.036 (Table 4 , col. 2, β bounds). The bounds for the second stage estimate exclude zero as long
as the direct effect of the instrument is smaller than -0.112 (γm ax in Table 4 , col. 2), or 75% of
the reduced form effect. Specification 3 adds year-quarter by CZ fixed effects, and the results
   6 Thecorresponding effects using the 25th and 75th percentiles of the residuals from a regression of log HHI on
market and CZ-year-quarter fixed effects are 2% using specification (3) and 6% using specification (7).




                                                       16
are very similar to specification 2. We conclude that the negative impact of concentration on
wages is robust to a large degree of instrument endogeneity: the instrument would have to be
very endogenous for the impact of concentration on wages to plausibly take positive values.


3.3   Controlling for job titles

    Marinescu and Wolthoff (2016) showed that job titles are an important predictor of wages
and are informative about the type of job and required skills beyond a pure wage-signalling
effect. We are thus interested in studying to what extent market concentration affects wages
through job titles and to what extent it has a direct effect beyond the effect that can be ex-
plained by job titles. For this purpose, we conducted regressions at the individual vacancy
level controlling for job title fixed effects (based on strings capturing the first three words in the
vacancy’s job title).
    The results are shown in Table 3 Panel B. The first three specifications show results using the
same controls as in the market-level baseline regressions, and find similar results. The fourth
specification controls for commuting-zone times job-title fixed effects. The effect has a negative
sign and is statistically significant, but the magnitude is about half of the effect without job title
fixed effects. This mitigation of the effect is present in both the OLS and the IV specifications.
This indicates that the effect of an increase in market concentration on wages is expressed both
directly through lower wages conditional on a job title, as well as by increasing the likelihood
of posting lower-wage job titles.



4     Robustness checks

4.1   Interaction with city size

    We tested whether the negative effect of market concentration on wages is driven by small
or large cities, or whether it holds across the whole range of city sizes in our sample. For


                                                 17
this purpose, we ran a specification interacting the vacancy HHI in a market with a 5th-order
polynomial in the percentile of the population of that market’s commuting zone, which we
instrument using a 5th-order polynomial in the mean of log(1/N) for the same occupation in
other CZs.
   The estimated effect of market concentration as a function of commuting zone population
percentile is shown in Figure 8, together with 95% confidence bands. The effect is negative and
significant over the range of population going from the 10th to the 90th percentile, and it it is
higher (in absolute value) for smaller markets than larger markets.


4.2   Alternative concentration measures

   As a robustness check, we estimated panel IV regressions similar to our baseline specifica-
tion from Table 3, column 6, but using log 1/N as the measure of market concentration. The
results are similar to the baseline, and shown in Table 5, specification (1).
   We also estimated regressions using log HHI based on share of applications as the measure
of concentration, again with similar results. The results are in Table 5, specification (2). This
shows that our results are robust to using a range of standard measures of market concentra-
tion, and therefore not driven by a particular choice of measure.


4.3   Alternative market definitions

   We chose to use commuting zones as a market definition because they were designed to
capture meaningful geographic labor markets based on commuting patterns across counties.
However, the correct geographic definition for labor market competition for hiring is still an
open question. We decided to test the sensitivity of our results by using an alternative definition
based on counties, and running panel IV specifications analogous to our baseline.
   The results are shown in Table 5, specification (3). The estimated coefficient is similar to
those in the baseline, indicating that our results are robust to other plausible geographic labor



                                                18
market definitions.


4.4   Excluding monopsony (HHI=1) markets

   The histogram in Figure 3 shows that many markets in the sample only have one firm hiring.
We checked that our estimates are not sensitive to excluding these markets by running addi-
tional regressions that do exactly that. The results from the panel IV specification are reported
in Table 5, specification (4), which show that the magnitude and significance of the estimated
effect is similar to the analogous specification in the baseline.


4.5   Cross-sectional specification

   Our baseline specification identifies the effect of market concentration on wages purely from
variation within a market over time. One may also be interested in identification from cross-
sectional variation. We implemented a specification based on the entire 2010-2013 period. We
included CZ fixed effects and 6-digit SOC fixed effects, so that our estimates are not driven by
variation in average wages across cities, or in average wages across occupations. Similar to
the baseline, we instrument the log HHI using the log 1/N, except that we use the number of
firms for the entire period. The impact of concentration on posted wages is still negative and
significant in this cross-sectional data (Table 5, specification (5)). Furthermore, we find that the
impact of concentration on prevailing wages measured from the BLS occupational employment
statistics is also negative and significant (specification (6)). This alleviates the concern that our
results are driven by the less than fully representative nature of our data.


4.6   Controlling for fraction of vacancies posting wages

   An important limitation of the dataset is that only a fraction of the vacancies on Career-
Builder post wages. To address this issue, we ran a panel IV specification controlling for the
fraction of vacancies in each market that post wages. Table 5, specification (7) shows the results.


                                                 19
We find that this variable has a positive effect on wages, but does not meaningfully affect the
coefficient on log HHI.


4.7   Controlling for tightness based on searches instead of applications

   Another concern is that the tightness measure could be endogenous with respect to wages:
high-wage vacancies get more applications, so this lowers the tightness measure. As an alter-
native measure of tightness, we use the log of the ratio of total vacancies in the market to total
searches in the market. Searches should not be affected by posted wages because workers do
not search by wage by typically by job title and location, so this can address the endogeneity
concern. Table 5, specification (8) shows the results from the corresponding panel IV specifica-
tion, which are similar to those in the baseline specification.


4.8   Remaining limitations

   Our analysis accounts for a number of biases in the estimation of the relationship between
labor market concentration and posted wages. However, a number of limitations remain.
   Only 20% of vacancies post wages, and we are therefore not measuring all wages in a given
occupation by commuting zone market. However, Marinescu and Wolthoff (2016) show that
the distribution of posted wages on CareerBuilder is very similar to the distribution of wages
for employed workers in the Current Population Survey. Therefore, posted wages are typical
of wages overall in the labor market.
   Our data comes from a single website, CareerBuilder.com. While this is the largest US
website, and contains overall about a third of US vacancies, it does not contain all vacancies
in the occupations that are in our sample. This could lead us to overestimate labor market
concentration. At the same time, CareerBuilder vacancies are the relevant ones for job seekers
that use it as their primary website for job search. Furthermore, the fact that we only capture
some of the vacancies should not affect our estimate of the relationship between posted wages



                                                20
and labor market concentration.
    Our data contains the most frequent occupations by number of vacancies on CareerBuilder.com,
and a number of manufacturing occupations. Therefore, our results, while fairly general, do
not necessarily apply to the whole US labor market. It is noteworthy that Benmelech, Bergman
and Kim (2018) and Rinz (2018) find a negative and significant relationship between wages and
employment concentration at the county and industry level. Therefore, studying employment
rather than vacancies and changing the labor market definition does not affect the basic fact
that wages are negatively associated with labor market concentration.



5    Discussion and conclusion

    Labor economists are increasingly questioning the assumption of almost-perfectly-competitive
labor markets (Card et al., 2016), and they have begun to address the antitrust policy impli-
cations of relaxing that assumption. Ashenfelter and Krueger (2017) study the prevalence of
anti-competitive no-poaching language in franchising contracts, leading to a series of recent an-
titrust cases against franchise employers. Marinescu and Hovenkamp (2018) and Naidu, Pos-
ner and Weyl (2018) both consider the implications of concentrated labor markets for merger
enforcement. Recently, the chairman of the FTC said in Congressional testimony that he had
instructed the agency’s staff to examine the labor market impact of every merger the agency
reviews, and he further elaborated that market definition in labor markets for antitrust en-
forcement purposes should be guided by the elasticity of labor supply to the individual firm
(Simons, 2018).
    The idea that monopsony power can harm efficiency dates to the origins of American an-
titrust policy. One of the reasons Senator John Sherman gave for legislating against monopoly
was that “[i]t commands the price of labor without fear of strikes, for in its field it allows no
competitors.” (Congressional Record 2457, 1890) The horizontal merger guidelines recognize
that the same framework can be applied to market power on the part of buyers as well as sell-


                                               21
ers, although there have been few merger challenges premised on monopsony theories of harm,
and none in which the labor market is where the monopsony power is being challenged7 .
   In this paper, we contribute to this growing debate by calculating measures of market con-
centration in local labor markets for the most frequent occupations on the leading employment
website CareerBuilder.com. We have shown that concentration is high, and increasing concen-
tration is associated with lower wages. Our results suggest that the anti-competitive effects of
concentration on the labor market could be important. The type of analysis we provide could
be used to incorporate labor market concentration concerns as a factor in antitrust analysis.




  7 Antitrustagencies have recently brought to court conduct cases regarding labor market monopsony in which
they found evidence of overt written agreements not to compete for workers (DOJ, 2007, 2010).

Table 4. Plausibly Exogenous Instrument Regressions (Market-level data).
Data are for the period 2010Q1-2013Q4. We consider the following model, in which the instrument is not fully exogenous and therefore can
enter in the second stage:
                                       log(wm,t ) = β · log HHIm,t + γ · z + θ · Xm,t + αt + νm + ε m,t ,
where z is our instrumental variable. We implement the plausibly exogenous instrument regression methodology as follows. We start by
running reduced form OLS regressions analogous to our IV specifications, but including the instrument directly in the second stage instead of
log HH I. The value of γ̂ in the table refers to the coefficient of the instrument in this regression. We take γ̂ as the lower bound for the range
of γ, and zero as the upper bound, and then compute bounds for the coefficient on log HH I (β) using the plausibly exogenous regression
methodology of Conley, Hansen and Rossi (2010). We implement the methodology by (i) within-transforming all the variables (including the
dependent variable, the regressors, and the instruments) by running regressions with each variable on the left hand side and the corresponding
set of fixed effects on the right hand side, and taking the residuals as the transformed variables, and (ii) running the plausibly exogenous
instrument regressions on the within-transformed variables using the plausexog command in Stata developed by Clarke (2017). We cluster
standard errors at the market level. We also calculate the value of the lower bound for γ that would make the interval for β be fully to the left
of zero. We call this value γmax .

Figure 2. Average HHI by commuting zone, based on vacancy shares. This figure shows the average of the
Herfindahl-Hirschman Index by 6-digit SOC occupation code for labor markets over the period 2010Q1–2013Q4.
The categories we use for HHI concentration levels are: "Low": HHI between 0 and 1500; "Moderate": HHI
between 1500 and 2500; "High": HHI between 2500 and 5000; "Very High": HHI between 5000 and 10000. These
categories correspond to the DOJ/FTC guidelines, except that we add the additional distinction between high and
very high concentration levels around the 5,000 HHI threshold. Market shares are defined as the sum of vacancies
posted in CareerBuilder.com by a given firm in a given market and year-quarter divided by total vacancies posted
in the website in that market and year-quarter.

Figure 7. Binned scatter of residualized log HHI based on vacancies and residualized log real wage. This
figure shows a binned scatter plot of the residuals of a regression of log HHI (based on vacancy shares) on log
tightness, CZ times SOC fixed effects, and CZ times year-quarter fixed effects and the residuals of a regression of
log real wage in the same market, also on log tightness, CZ times SOC fixed effects, and CZ times year-quarter
fixed effects.

Figure 8. Effect of Log HHI (Vacancies) on Log Real Wage by Commuting Zone Population Percentile. Es-
timated effect from a panel IV regression of log real wage on a 5th order polynomial in log HHI (in terms of
vacancies), instrumented with a 5th order polynomial in average log 1/N in other commuting zones for the same
occupation, controlling for log tightness, CZ-6-digit SOC fixed effects and time fixed effects. Data are for the
period 2010Q1-2013Q4. We cluster standard errors at the market level.
