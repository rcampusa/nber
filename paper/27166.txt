Reopening Under COVID-19: What to Watch For
Jeffrey E. Harris
NBER Working Paper No. 27166
May 2020, Revised August 2020
JEL No. I1,I12,I14,I18,I24

                                           ABSTRACT

We critically analyze the currently available status indicators of the COVID-19 epidemic so that
state governors will have the guideposts necessary to decide whether to further loosen or instead
retighten controls on social and economic activity. Overreliance on aggregate, state-level data in
Wisconsin, we find, confounds the effects of the spring primary elections and the outbreak among
meat packers. Relaxed testing standards in Los Angeles may have upwardly biased the observed
trend in new infection rates. Reanalysis of New Jersey data, based upon the date an ultimately
fatal case first became ill rather than the date of death, reveals that deaths have already peaked in
that state. Evidence from Cook County, Illinois shows that trends in the percentage of positive
tests can be wholly misleading. Trends on emergency department visits for influenza-like illness,
advocated by the White House Guidelines, are unlikely to be informative. Data on hospital census
counts in Orange County, California suggest that healthcare system-based indicators are likely to
be more reliable and informative. An analysis of cumulative infections in San Antonio, Texas,
shows how mathematical models intended to guide decisions on relaxation of social distancing
are severely limited by untested assumptions. Universal coronavirus testing may not on its own
solve difficult problems of data interpretation and causal inference.

What To Watch For                                Jeffrey E. Harris                        12-May-2020


Introduction
       This article is motivated by a striking disconnect. On the one hand, various think tanks,
foundations, and academic institutions have issued their own formal plans to guide the reopening
of the U.S. economy in the face of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic (Allen et al. 2020, Watson
et al. 2020, Rockefeller Foundation 2020, Romer 2020). These white papers, for the most part,
envision the widespread if not universal testing for active coronavirus infection as fundamental
to the nation’s recovery. On the other hand, governors of numerous states throughout the country
have already issued orders as to what worksites and places of congregation can reopen and under
what conditions (Murphy 2020, Kemp 2020, Evers 2020a, b, Abbott 2020c, Polis 2020).
       One side is abstract, conceptual, and far-sighted. The other side is concrete,
microscopically focused on details, and keyed to the here and now. Both sides have nothing but
the best intentions. They are, however, living in different worlds.
       The gap between these two approaches may narrow once we come up with rapid,
inexpensive tests for viral antigens to replace the current time-consuming, expensive tests for
viral RNA, and once we decide collectively as a society how to coerce each other into being
tested, traced and isolated. And, of course, everything could change for the better if we had
highly effective antiviral medications and even a moderately effective vaccine, or if we jointly
developed adequate herd immunity, or if the virus ultimately mutated to adapt to its human host
(Taubenberger and Morens 2006, Packer 2020). Until then, we will need what economists call a
second-best strategy for a judicious recovery.
       Since we don’t yet have universal compulsory testing to give us a detailed, complete and
timely snapshot of the epidemic, we will have to make do for now with a diverse collection of
imperfect indicators. If we cannot critically analyze these status indicators in order to reliably
discern the underlying trends, we will have more than a few problems trying to determine
whether various state governments’ efforts to rekindle economic and social activity have been
working or failing. The governors of these states will lack the guideposts necessary to decide
whether to further loosen or instead retighten controls. Imagine trying to bring a plane to a soft
landing when you don’t really know its altitude or velocity.
       What follows is a detailed vetting of the most salient status indicators. For the most part,
our analysis shies away from modeling of future trends based upon untested assumptions.
Instead, we focus sharply on real historical data. Our objective is not to exhaustively cover every

state, county and city in the country. Instead, we attempt to learn lessons from selected cases. We
make no pretense that these cases were drawn randomly.

Incidence of Infection Based on Partial Voluntary Testing: Wisconsin
       Figure 1 below shows the daily incidence of newly diagnosed COVID-19 infections in all
counties of the state of Wisconsin combined from March 15 through May 4, 2020. The
incidence, measured in terms of numbers of cases per 100,000 population, is rendered on a
logarithmic scale so that a straight line would represent exponential growth (Harris 2020a). The
incidence data are calculated as the numbers of positive tests for coronavirus infection
(Wisconsin Department of Health Services 2020) divided by the state’s residential population
(Wisconsin Department of Administration 2020). The numbers of positive tests in turn are
derived solely from individuals who voluntarily sought testing.

       The arrows point to a few of the potentially relevant events during the time period
covered in Figure 1. On April 20, 2020, Gov. Tony Evers announced his Badger Bounces Back
plan to reopen the Wisconsin economy (Evers 2020a). Following the most recent federal
guidelines (White House 2020), Evers’ plan continued the state’s Safer At Home restrictions,


                                                                                                                                       3
What To Watch For                               Jeffrey E. Harris                       12-May-2020


issued March 24 (Palm 2020a), which kept non-essential businesses closed until certain criteria
were met, including a sustained 14-day decline in documented cases. Golf courses, however,
were allowed open, and exterior lawn care was permitted (Evers 2020b). A week later, the state’s
secretary of health services announced an Interim Order to Turn the Dial, allowing non-essential
businesses to make curbside drop-offs and opening up outdoor recreational rentals and self-
service car washes, so long as social distancing measures remained in place (Palm 2020b).
       The observation period covered Figure 1 also includes the April 7 spring primary
elections, when the number of polling places in Milwaukee was reduced from 180 to five, and
where some voters had to wait up to two and half hours to cast their ballots (Rakich 2020).
“Now, over two weeks later,” wrote the newly elected justice to the Wisconsin Supreme Court in
a recent opinion article, “we have an uptick in Covid-19 cases, especially in dense urban centers
like Milwaukee and Waukesha, where few polling places were open and citizens were forced to
stand in long lines to cast a ballot.” (Karofsky 2020). Press reports have quoted Milwaukee’s
health officials that from 7 to 26 new cases of coronavirus infection appeared to be related to in-
person voting at the primaries (Associated Press 2020, Spicuzza 2020).
       What inferences can we draw, if any, about the trends in Figure 1 and their relationship to
the highlighted events? After an upsurge in cases during the weeks of March 15 and March 22,
the incidence of new infections in Figure 1 appears to have leveled off. More recently, however,
new daily cases have been increasing statewide. On April 14, there were 127 new infections,
yielding a statewide incidence of 2.17 cases per 100,000 population. By April 25, the number of
new infections had increased to 331, yielding a rate of 5.66 per 100,000.
       With an incubation period from initial infection to onset of symptoms averaging 5 days
(Linton et al. 2020, Li et al. 2020), and with the additional delay between the onset of symptoms
and the performance of a diagnostic test, no one is going to attribute the recent doubling of daily
coronavirus cases to the governor’s April 20 Badger Bounces Back order or the April 27 Interim
Order to Turn the Dial. But the data do raise the question whether the original Safer at Home
restrictions of March 24 were enough. They certainly do not satisfy the original requirement for a
sustained 14-day decline in documented cases.
       Figure 2 below shows the incidence of new coronavirus cases in three Wisconsin
counties, Milwaukee County (the orange points), Waukesha County (the yellow points), and
Brown County (the purple points), which houses the city of Green Bay. Once again, we would

not expect to see a rise in incidence during the week immediately following the primaries.
Without definitive data on delays between symptoms and testing, it is difficult to determine
whether an increase in cases attributable to the primary elections would have occurred 1 or 2
weeks later. We obtained similar results with data from the City of Milwaukee (Mukai 2020).

       Table 1 shows the average daily incidence by week, where “week 0” started on primary
day, Tuesday April 7. In Milwaukee and Waukesha counties, the incidence does not increase
above baseline until the third week starting April 28. This is certainly not strong evidence in
favor of a large effect of the primary elections on the incidence of new cases. It does not,
however, rule out a smaller effect detectable only through detailed case finding.

        The data for Brown County both Figure 2 and Table 1, by contrast, show a marked
increase in the incidence of new cases. The Brown County data are in fact quantitatively
responsible for the apparent increase in the overall statewide incidence seen at the same time in
Figure 1. The cumulative total of 971 cases through April 29 is attributable mostly to outbreaks
of COVID-19 infection at three meat packing facilities. At one plant, there were reportedly 262
cases of coronavirus infection among employees and 86 cases of secondary spread among the
employees’ contacts (Amundsen 2020). On April 28, two days after the plant had voluntarily
closed, the president issued an executive order, under the authority of the Defense Production
Act, declaring that “[s]uch closures threaten the continued functioning of the national meat and
poultry supply chain, undermining critical infrastructure during the national emergency.” (Trump
2020)
        Our examination of the data for Wisconsin has so far taught us three important lessons.
        (1) We need to be very cautious about relying on state-level data to make policy
           decisions about reopening. In this case, state-level data obscured critical events
           occurring at the micro or county level.
        (2) Even if state governments are granted the power to manipulate the levers of
           renormalization, they need to take account of strategic interventions at the federal
           executive level.
        (3) It may be difficult to make causal inferences about the consequences of state policies
           to relax or tighten social distancing rules.
        Would we have drawn different conclusions if we had data from universal testing of new
coronavirus infections? Researchers suspect that the actual incidence rates are from twice to ten
times those shown in Figures 1 and 2 (Sutton et al. 2020). The main reason for the undercount is
presumably that many people have had infections so mild that they did not seek medical
attention. But Figures 1 and 2 would remain valid guides to the actual trend in COVID-19
infection rates so long as undercount factor remained unchanged (Harris 2020a). We’ll
investigate the validity of this key assumption below.

30, 2020. Since there is only one geographic area with a constant population, we have not
converted the counts into incidence rates. The horizontal axis ticks off the date that the test was
performed or the date of death (Los Angeles County Department of Public Health 2020). This
dating convention differs from Figures 1 and 2 above, where the horizontal axis marked the date
the report was received. The convention is more accurate in pinning down the test date, but it has
the disadvantage that the more recent counts remain unreliable until all the reports are in.

       While the rapid increase in positive cases during the first week in March has slowed, new
cases in Figure 3 still appear to be increasing. The counts of COVID-19 attributable deaths, on
the other hand, appear to be flat. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health
originally discouraged healthcare providers from ordering tests on presumptively infected but
uncomplicated patients. As tests have become increasingly available, the Department has relaxed
its position and, in fact, will now test anyone with or without any symptoms.
       The apparent continuing rise in positive cases may thus be no more than an artifact of
increased testing. But does that mean the data points showing COVID-19 attributable deaths are

more reliable? Figure 4 below addresses this question. In the figure, we have duplicated the plot
of Figure 3, but with one critical modification. As indicated by the leftward pointing gray arrow,
we’ve shifted the data series on deaths backward by 16 days. By one estimate, that’s the average
time from the onset of symptoms until a patient dies of complications (Muzimoto and Chowell
2020). Instead of the mango data points (which we’ve partially erased), we now have light gray
data points to indicate when those patients who will ultimately succumb to the virus first got
sick. The light gray data points are almost perfectly parallel to the pink data points on
coronavirus-positive cases. The near-constant vertical distance between the two plots indicates a
near-constant case fatality rate of 9 percent. For a related approach, see (Baud et al. 2020).

       We’ve now learned the following additional lessons.
       (4) Data from partial voluntary testing can give a misleading picture of the state of the
                              epidemic if standards for testing have been recently changing.
       (5) Data on case fatality rates can serve as an indicator of the degree of penetration of
                              voluntary testing. When case fatality rates are unusually high, testing penetration is
                              likely to be low.

       (6) While data on deaths attributable to COVID-19 may avoid this bias, they lag data on
           testing-based incidence by about 16 days.
       (7) The inherent lag in COVID-19 attributable deaths will prevail even if we had near-
           perfect data on incidence derived from universal testing.
       (8) With an incubation period of about 5 days from infection to symptoms, the data
           derived from symptom-based testing offer at least a reasonably rapid indicator of
           what’s happening in real time. But when we add another 16 days from symptoms to
           death, we’re talking about a three-week total lag time from infection to death.

Deaths Attributable to COVID-19: New Jersey
       We turn to the problem faced by Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey, who on
Wednesday, April 29, 2020 reopened state parks to fishing, hunting and hiking, while keeping
picnic areas and playgrounds closed and limiting parking to 50% of maximum capacity (Murphy
2020). State golf courses were likewise reopened so long as minimum social distancing policies
were observed. Yet the following day, the New York Times relayed, “New Jersey reported 460
new virus-related deaths on Thursday, more than any other state in the nation. … The increase
came in a week when Mr. Murphy, encouraged by other measures that showed New Jersey
making progress in fighting the virus, began to sketch out how the state might reopen in the
weeks ahead.” (Badger et al. 2020)

       Figure 5 above shows a screen shot of the New York Times data on daily cases and deaths
in New Jersey as of April 30, based upon the date of report of each event (New York Times
2020). The bars show the daily numbers, with the solid connected line segments showing the 7-
day moving averages. While the counts of voluntary testing-based infections are falling, the
number of reported deaths is still surging. If thousands of New Jerseyans go back to their state
parks and golf courses, are we risking thousands of additional deaths and tens of thousands of
new infections before we can belatedly step on the brakes?
       Figure 6 below resolves the apparent contradiction. The data, published by the
Communicable Disease Service of the New Jersey Department of Health (New Jersey
Department of Health 2020), show the numbers of newly reported COVID-19 infections
according to the date the test was performed. Likewise, the counts of COVID-19 attributable
deaths are related to the date the test was performed on the same patients. Put differently, New
Jersey’s Communicable Disease Service has already been backed up each death to the date when
the patient got sick, just as we did in Figure 4 for Los Angeles. As before, we’ve omitted the
most recent week because counts based on the date of testing are subject to reporting delays.

        Figure 6 makes clear that the numbers of patients with fatal COVID-19 infections in New
Jersey had already peaked and turned downward about three weeks before Gov. Murphy
reopened the state’s parks and golf courses. As in Figure 4, the vertical distance between the two
data series reflects the case fatality rate, with a large gap reflecting lower fatality. In fact, the
case fatality rate dropped from 10.6 percent for the week starting March 1 to 4.4 percent for the
week starting April 12, once again suggesting that the apparent stagnation of the case counts
resulted from enhanced testing of less seriously ill individuals.
        The analysis of Figure 6 does not eliminate the problem that COVID-19 attributable
deaths are a lagged status variable. In order to confirm that fatal COVID-19 infections actually
peaked around the first of April, we still had to wait until the end of the month for all the death
reports to come in. Still, the figure teaches us another important lesson.
        (9) For the purposes of deciding whether to relax or tighten controls, we should be
            thinking not only about dates of death, but also about the dates that ultimately fatal
            cases first became sick.
        It is arguable, nonetheless, that the graphs of COVID-19 attributable deaths by date of
death are more relevant to strategic decision making. While we defer a full treatment of this
point to a later section, here is the basic argument. Strategic decision makers need to be
concerned not only about overall trends in the path of the epidemic, but also on the real-time
capacity of the healthcare system. Since resource requirements are likely to be maximal as the
patient approaches death, graphs of COVID-19 attributable deaths by date of death inform us
about the demands on those resources. Put differently, if all 460 deaths reported in New Jersey
on April 30 had occurred among patients admitted to the same medical center, the center’s
resources would have surely been overwhelmed, no matter when they were first admitted.

Deaths Attributable to COVID-19: New York City
        In Figure 7 below, we inquire: Are we accounting for all COVID-19 attributable deaths?
The data points, derived from the New York City Department of Health database (Montesano
2020b), show numbers of deaths confirmed by coronavirus testing (orange points) and the
combined numbers of confirmed and probable deaths attributable to COVID-19 (purple points).
In view of current limitations on data availability, the horizontal axis reverts to measuring the
date of death rather than the date the patient was first tested.



                                                                                                        11

       Figure 7 strongly suggests that deaths confirmed by coronavirus testing may significantly
understate the total number of deaths attributable to COVID-19. The possible but not confirmed
deaths are likely to include patients who tested negative or were never tested, but who
succumbed to acute adult respiratory distress syndrome, cardiogenic shock, cytokine storm,
overwhelming acute kidney injury, and strokes from massive coagulopathy. At least from the last
week of March onward, the inclusion of probable cases increases the total death counts by about
one third.

       Whether the undercount reflects narrow limits on the availability of coronavirus testing or
broader limits on our healthcare system remains unclear. Still, the lessons of Figure 7 are clear.
       (10)                                     No matter what definition is used, deaths from COVID-19 reached their peak in
                            New York City during the second week of April, and are now declining.
       (11)                                      The actual demands on our healthcare system to identify and adequately treat
                            seriously ill COVID-19 patients are likely to have been seriously underestimated.

delays, provisional counts after April 25 are excluded. As we would expect, the trend in deaths

cases.

    Figure 8. Daily Cases, Hospitalizations and Confirmed Deaths from COVID-19, March 1 – April 25, 2020.


         Our focus here is on hospitalizations (the green points). The excess of hospitalizations
over positive tests during the first week in March suggests the possibility that hospital admission
was delayed among some individuals who were actually infected in the month of February.
There is also an expected time lag between the onset of initial symptoms leading an individual to
get tested and subsequent hospitalization for worsening illness. This time delay may have
changed during the course of the month of March. Still, the curve of hospitalizations reaches a
peak during the first week of April.



                                                                                                                                     13

       Figure 8 communicates three important messages.
       (12)    As a potential status variable, daily hospitalizations gauge the incidence of
           seriously ill cases that place significant demands on healthcare resources.
       (13)    The time lag between new infection and hospitalization appears to be significantly
           shorter than the lag between infection and death.
       (14)    The peak incidence of hospitalizations could serve as an indicator of peak
           demands on healthcare resources so long as hospital admissions are not rationed as
           a result of bed unavailability or personnel constraints.

Daily Hospital Census: Orange County, California
       Focusing further on the demand for healthcare resources, Figure 9 shows the current daily
census attributable to COVID-19 in a universe of 25 reporting hospitals in Orange County,
California (Orange County Health Care Agency 2020). The number of hospitals reporting on any
given day varied from 19 to 25, with an average of 23. Accordingly, the data points in Figure 9
below show the scaled-up census for all 25 hospitals, based upon the assumption that each
nonreporting hospital had the same census as the average of the reporting hospitals. The best-
fitting regression line covering the points from April 10 onward gives a doubling time of the total
COVID-19 census in a bit more than a month. The results are basically the same without the
imputation for nonreporting hospitals.
       The findings in Figure 9 are important and ominous. As the weather has improved in
Southern California, people have been flocking to some beaches in Orange County, culminating
in the arrival of an estimated 40 thousand beachgoers at Newport Beach on the April 25-26
weekend (Lozano 2020, Baxter, Wigglesworth, and Chang 2020, Andone and Vercammen 2020,
Connelly and Kopetman 2020). In response, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California shut down
beaches in Orange County on April 30 (Badger et al. 2020). At this juncture, we cannot attribute
the increasing census of COVID-19 cases in Orange County hospitals to the recent influx of
thousands of beachgoers. Press reports suggest, in fact, that many of the attendees were from
neighboring cities and counties, including Los Angeles, Santa Monica, Laguna Beach, Malibu,
and Venice, where beaches remained closed. If they came down with COVID-19 and became
seriously ill, they might not end up in an Orange County hospital.

       Still, Figure 9 teaches us another important lesson.
       (15)                                               Highly focused measures of intensive healthcare demands in micro areas may be
                                   critical status variables for the implementation of effective reopening strategies.

Percent Positive Tests Among Those Tested: Cook County, Illinois
       We move on to another measure based on voluntary testing, namely, the percentage of
positive COVID-19 tests among those tested. This indicator is featured in the White House
Guidelines (White House 2020), which specifically recommend reliance on a “Downward
trajectory of positive tests as a percent of total tests within a 14-day period (flat or increasing
volume of tests).” Why the volume of tests needs to be flat or increasing remains unclear. It is
well acknowledged that voluntary testing results are based on a self-selected sample. At least
during the initial response to the outbreak, healthcare providers on the front lines were routinely
counseling patients with fever, cough, shortness of breath and loss of taste to stay home and not
get tested so long as they were stable. With expanding availability of tests even to those with
minimal or no symptoms, the percentage positive would tend to be increasingly biased
downward, thus giving the false impression of a favorable trend in disease rates.


                                                                                                                                          15

          Figure 10 illustrates the point, using data from Cook County, Illinois, which includes
Chicago (Illinois Department of Public Health 2020). During the observation period, the volume
of tests was steadily increasing, from 224 on March 15, to 5,402 on April 5, to 19,417 by May 3.
Yet the percent tested positive, as indicated by the sky-blue data points has been declining since
the first week in April. That’s certainly more than 14 days. Yet the daily incidence of newly
diagnosed COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population, as indicated by the orange data points, has
continued to increase. It would seem that the percent tested positive is a wholly misleading
indicator of the epidemic trend.

Guidelines (White House 2020), and not because it appears to be particularly informative.
                              Figure 11 superimposes two trends. The first trend (the dark red line segments) shows the
percentage of visits to New York City emergency departments for ILI from the start of the
annual flu season in October 2019 through mid-March 2020 (New York Department of Health
and Mental Hygiene 2020). One can see the wave of emergency department (ED) visits taking
off after Thanksgiving and peaking in January 2020. This wave represented the flu season for
this past year. Just when it appeared that the seasonal wave was coming to an end, however, a
new wave of ED visits took off on March 1. This new upstroke, which reached 10 percent of ED
visits (as gauged on the left-hand axis) was undoubtedly powered by the rapidly emerging
COVID-19 epidemic.

                              The problem with this impressive graph is that a new wave of COVID-19 could come at
any time. If it happened to arrive during the regular seasonal wave of influenza next fall or
winter, we won’t have any idea from the ILI data alone whether it was COVID-19 or the flu.
                              What’s worse, the timing of waves of both seasonal and pandemic influenza is quite
varied. The second trend in Figure 10 (the lavender area bounded above by black line segments)
shows the death rates for the 1918 influenza pandemic of 1918–1919 (as gauged on the right-
hand axis). (See Figure 1 of (Taubenberger and Morens 2006).) The first wave (not shown in
Figure 11 above) came out of nowhere during July 1918. The second wave (as shown in Figure
11) picked up steam in October 1919, with a peak mortality about 5 times that of the first wave.
Then, after a lull in January 1919, the third wave came rolling in, peaking in March 1919.

           One could argue, of course, that surveillance data on ILI could be used in combination
the other indicators reviewed above. All of these other status variables are specific to COVID-19.
So why not just rely upon them alone?
           (17)     Trends in emergency department visits for influenza-like illnesses, while a basic
               staple of public health reporting, are unlikely to serve as reliable status indicators of
               COVID-19 resurgence or decline.

the same order, Abbott mandated that “people shall avoid eating or drinking at bars, restaurants,
and food courts, or visiting gyms or massage parlors,” with an exception for “drive-thru, pickup,
or delivery options.” (Abbott 2020a) The order was continued on March 31, barring attendance
at nursing homes and keeping schools closed to in-classroom instruction (Abbott 2020b). In an
April 27, 2020 partial reversal of his original orders, Gov. Abbott allowed non-essential retail
establishments, movie theaters, and shopping malls to reopen for in-store services provided that
the stores operate at no more than 25 percent occupancy (Abbott 2020d). (p. 3)
           Figure 12 below shows the daily incidence of new COVID-19 infections per 100,000
population in the City of San Antonio, Texas, from March 19 – May 4, 2020 (City of San
Antonio 2020). Superimposed on the raw data points is the centered, 7-day moving average.*
Figure 12 shows a rapid uptake of new COVID-19 infections during the second half of March,
followed by an apparently abrupt leveling off on April 6. Once again, given the lag between
initial infection and subsequent testing, that looks a bit too soon to attribute the change to the
governor’s March 31 renewal of his order. Figure 13, also shown below, provides exactly the
same plot with a superimposed left-sided, 7-day moving average.† The trend in new COVID-19
infections now appears to be leveling off is now on April 9. If we were to take any steps to
smooth or otherwise digest the raw data in Figures 12 and 13, the most appropriate method
would be to aggregate the rates by week.

       In view of the significant variability in the daily diagnosis counts, it is difficult to discern
when the incidence curve flattened or whether it has in fact started to resume an upward trend.
The use of moving averages doesn’t really add any information to the raw data, but it can create
the false impression of breaks in the data or reversals of trend that simply aren’t there.
       (18)                                                  Moving averages may make noisy data plots look smoother, but they are to be
                                                      avoided. Moving averages are no substitute for additional, more reliable data on
                                                      trends in COVID-19 incidence.

        The details of the SIR model are given in the Appendix. In this particular application of
the model, which we describe as “unrestricted,” almost everyone is the population starts out as
susceptible (S), a handful start out as infective (I), and no one is naturally resistant (R). As the
susceptible and infective persons repeatedly engage in contact with each other, the former
become infected by the latter. Over time, the I’s lose their infectivity and convert to R’s, either
by getting better or dying. By selecting the appropriate mathematical constants for this model
application, we were able to track the cumulative incidence for about the first four weeks of the
city’s epidemic.
        At some point around April 12, the data points on cumulative infections start to deviate
from the unrestricted model. To accommodate this deviation, we’ve modified the unrestricted
model to take account of social distancing. That’s the solid black curve in the figure. The basic
idea is that every day, an additional fraction of the susceptible population avoids contact with
others, including the infectives. This modification appears to fit the data points quite well.
        After April 27, however, when Gov. Abbott partially releases the restrictions in his
original order, a third alternative model takes over, as indicated by the purple curve. The basic
idea is that some of the susceptible people who had reduced contact with others begin comingle
with others.
        As a general matter, the underlying concepts of the three related models are entirely
reasonable. And, in fact, a more sophisticated version of the basic SIR model that also takes into
account the presence of asymptomatic carriers has been applied to the San Antonio data
(Gutierrez 2020). But there are two critical problems that give us pause when we seek to rely
upon such modeling exercises.
        First, it’s easy to fit a mathematical model to the cumulative counts of the COVID-19
cases. That’s because the cumulative cases just keep going up. Fitting a model to the underlying
incidence data, which jump up and down in Figures 12 and 13, is a lot harder. The apparent fit to
the cumulative counts makes us overconfident that the model is correct.
        Second, all the action is in the purple curve. This curve is generated under the critical
assumption that a specific percentage of susceptible people who had isolated themselves will
abandon their efforts. But that specific percentage is an untested number. We can make the
purple curve look better or worse simply by changing it. What appears to be a model driven by
the facts is in fact a model based on facts plus one untested assumption.



                                                                                                       21

       (19)    Graphs of cumulative cases (or cumulative deaths) provide little or no guidance
           in the decision to release or tighten social distancing measures. These graphs always
           go up, and never down.
       (20)    Because graphs of cumulative cases go up smoothly, it’s too easy to fit them to
           mathematical models. The apparent fit gives us false confidence in our model.
       (21)    When mathematical models are extended to predict future responses to releasing
           or tightening restrictions, it is critical that we make explicit their untested
           assumptions.

Discussion
       We summarize here what we’ve learned about those status indicators we can reliably
monitor as we judiciously loosen controls on economic activity.
       Reports of the incidence of new coronavirus infections based solely upon partial,
voluntary testing can still provide a reliable picture of the recent path of the epidemic.
Increasingly relaxed standards of eligibility for testing, however, can artificially raise the counts
of positive cases and thus give the false impression of an upward or sustained trend in infection
rates. The observation of a progressively declining case fatality rate can provide a clue to the
presence of this potential bias. While some have appropriately proposed representative sampling
(Kaplow 2020) or pooled testing (Lakdawalla et al. 2020) in the absence of universal testing, the
detailed mechanics of obtaining and properly weighting representative samples have yet to be
fully worked out.
       Like all status indicators, reports of the incidence of new infections at the aggregate
geographic level can obscure critical trends at the micro level, including counties,
neighborhoods, and even individual firms and residences. Rules for reopening will need to be
adaptable to micro-level events, especially isolated outbreaks in residential facilities, retail
establishments serving the public, and firms requiring high concentrations of workers. Examples
include the meatpacking firms in Brown County, Wisconsin, discussed here, and the outbreak of
frontline transit workers in New York City, discussed in (Harris 2020b).
       Counts of deaths from COVID-19 suffer from the serious limitation that these reports lag
behind the incidence of new infections by about three weeks. Reliance on trends in the numbers
of deaths can result in an entirely misleading interpretation of the effects of the recent tightening
or relaxation of controls on social and economic activity. This inherent lag in death rates would


                                                                                                     22

prevail even if we had reliable data on the incidence of infection from near-universal testing. For
the purposes of deciding whether to relax or tighten controls, we need to look at the dates that
individuals with fatal infections became ill, and not the dates when they died.
       Deaths from COVID-19 are undoubtedly being underdiagnosed, especially in the absence
of universal testing and full knowledge of the multi-organ system manifestations of severe
disease. Still, there is no evidence that incomplete ascertainment of death has seriously biased
our analyses of trends in numbers of deaths.
       Data on the percentage of positive tests among all persons tested are uninformative and,
in fact, can be outright misleading. Trends in emergency department visits for influenza-like
illnesses, while a basic staple of public health reporting, are unlikely to serve as reliable status
indicators of COVID-19 resurgence or decline. There is just too much potential confounding
with other viral illnesses, including influenza. Even seasonal influenza does not keep its
appointments on a fixed calendar, and pandemic illnesses – which will remain inevitable – don’t
arrive at pre-appointed times.
       Hospital-based measures of COVID-19 morbidity are likely to be superior, more stable
indicators of underlying trends, and thus more reliable status variables for determining whether
and when to relax or tighten economic controls. Reports on the census of hospital cases are also
sensitive indicators of the demand for constrained medical resources.
       Techniques to smooth trends, such as moving averages, can give the false impression of
bends, breaks or abrupt changes in the data. Some of the noise in the data is undoubtedly due to
sampling error, but some of the day-to-day variability is inherent in the system of measurement.
Even with universal testing for COVID-19 infection, not everybody is going to get tested on the
same day.
       Cumulative rates of infection or death have little informative value. These numbers
always go up. It is easy to fit a predictive model to cumulative rates, and the apparently good fit
gives a false impression of reliability. The predictive value of such a model rests on the validity
of its underlying untested assumptions, and not on its fit to historical data.
       Even if we had perfect data on the incidence of new infections through mandatory,
universal testing, we would still need to confront the difficulty of drawing causal connections
between the incidence of infection and policy measures to tighten or loosen controls on social
and economic activity. In some cases, the temporal and geographic patterns may be strong, as in



                                                                                                       23

a recent study of the relation between subway traffic and the unique surge and subsequent
decline of coronavirus infections in New York City during the month of March 2020 (Harris
2020b). And in other cases, such as our analysis of the data from Wisconsin here, one may be
able to isolate an outbreak at the micro level as the underlying basis of a statewide trend. But in
other cases, we may end up with perfect data on trends in incidence but no way to clearly
disentangle their causes.
        The underlying purpose of universal testing is not simply to monitor trends, which we
might very well be able to do with representative testing or testing of pooled samples, but also to
track contacts and isolate those affected. When one thinks about the hundreds of contacts just
one subway rider would make on a single trip into work, such a task seems all the more daunting.

Appendix: SIR Models
        We follow the basic notation in (Harris 2020a) with slight modifications. The time course
of an epidemic can be described by a set of coupled differential equations. Let S ( t ) denote the

number of susceptible individuals, I ( t ) denote the number of infective individuals, and R ( t )

denote the number of resistant individuals at time t ≥ 0 . All individuals in the population are in
one of these three states. In the basic version of the model, which we adopt here, the population
is assumed closed. Without loss of generality, we specify S ( t ) + I ( t ) + R ( t ) = 1 , so that each of

the state variables is expressed as a fraction of the total population. Thus, S! + I! + R! = 0 , where
                                   dS ( t )
we have used the notation S! =                for the first derivative.
                                     dt
        In the unrestricted version of the SIR model, the rate of new infections per unit time is
assumed to be proportional to the number of interactions between susceptible and infective
individuals, that is, − S! = α S I , where α > 0 is a constant. Once an individual is infected, he is
infective and remains infective until he becomes resistant, either through recovery or death.
Infective individuals are assumed to become resistant at a constant proportional rate, that is,
R! = β I , where β > 0 is also a constant. Since our population is closed, we have

I! = − S! − R! = α S I − β I .
        To fit this unrestricted model to the data from San Antonio in Figure 13, we converted
the basic differential equations into difference equations in discrete time format. That is,


                                                                                                          24
What To Watch For                                    Jeffrey E. Harris                           12-May-2020


ΔSt = −α St I t , ΔI t = α St I t − β I t , and ΔRt = β I t , where time t is marked off in days. The black

curve in Figure 13 is based upon the parameters I 0 = 1 N , where the population N of San

Antonio is taken as 1,493,000. That is, at the start of the epidemic, one person is infected. In
addition, we take α = 0.162 and β = 0.05 . As explained in (Harris 2020a), these parameters

give a basic reproductive number at the start of the epidemic equal to R0 = α S0 β = 3.24 . The

value of β = 0.05 implies a mean duration of infectivity of 20 days, considerably larger than
some estimates, but more in line with other data (Wölfel et al. 2020, Xiao, Tong, and Zhang
2020).
         In the social distancing variant of the SIR model, we add another state variable, denoted
by D, which represents those susceptible individuals who do not come into contact with infective
individuals. This is a feature of many variant SIR models in the literature (Greenhalgh 1988, Yi
et al. 2009, Hansen and Day 2011). Initially, the model starts as the unrestricted model. Then,
starting at time t = t0 , the differential equation governing susceptible individuals switches to

S! = −α S I − γ S , while the corresponding equation for individuals who avoid contact is D! = γ S ,
where γ > 0 . Once again simulating the discrete version of this model, we obtain the black

curve in Figure 13 with γ = 0.03 and t0 corresponding to March 30, 2020. From that date

onward, we’re assuming that the population of self-isolating individuals is growing at 3 percent
daily.
         In the SIR variant with released restrictions, we simulate the social distance variant, but
then modify the parameters at t1 corresponding to April 27, 2020. From that point onward,

D! = −δ D , where δ = 0.09 and S! = −α S I + δ D . That is, we’re assuming that population of self-
isolating individuals is declining at 9 percent daily.
