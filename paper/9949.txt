       In countries with weak legal systems, there is a great deal of tunnelling by the entrepreneurs

who control publicly traded firms. However, under some conditions entrepreneurs prop up their

firms, i.e., they use their private funds to benefit minority shareholders. We provide evidence and

a model that explains propping. In particular, we suggest that issuing debt can credibly commit an

entrepreneur to propping, even though creditors can never take possession of any underlying

collateral. This helps to explain why emerging markets with weak institutions sometimes grow

rapidly and why they are also subject to frequent economic and financial crises.

1. Introduction

       In countries with weak legal protection for investors, strong evidence indicates

that entrepreneurs often tunnel resources out of firms, i.e., expropriate funds that

rightfully belong to minority shareholders (Johnson, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and

Shleifer 2000, Glaeser, Johnson, and Shleifer 2001). However, the anecdotal evidence

also suggests that sometimes entrepreneurs in these countries transfer private resources

into firms that have minority shareholders. Propping is often clandestine, but several

examples came to light in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis of 1997 and 1998.

Lee Kun Hee, chairman of Samsung Electronics and head of the family that controls

Samsung Group, donated some of his personal wealth to pay off the debts of Samsung

Motors Inc, which was a subsidiary on the verge of bankruptcy in summer 1999 (Wall

Street Journal, July 1, 1999, p. A19).2 The controlling shareholders in CP Group sold

assets in Thailand and China apparently in order to inject cash into publicly listed Thai

companies (Far Eastern Economic Review, 1998a.)3 The Salim group sold privately

held assets in the Netherlands in order to bail out publicly listed operations in both the

Philippines and Indonesia (Far Eastern Economic Review, 1998b); it also injected funds

from a publicly listed Hong Kong company into a publicly listed Indonesian company

(Asian Wall Street Journal, 1999).4 In many countries, the evidence suggests controlling

shareholders use private funds to provide temporary support to a firm that is in trouble.5

       This paper suggests that propping may be an important part of how firms operate

in countries with weak legal environments. In particular, it helps to explain why many

firms in these countries rely heavily on debt finance. A weak legal system would seem to

make debt unappealing because creditors can never effectively take control of collateral.6



3
For example, most collapses of banks and firms in Russia after the devaluation of August

1998 were associated with complete looting so that creditors and minority shareholders

got nothing while the firms went out of business (Troika Dialog 1999).7 The experience

of creditors in Hong Kong who lent to firms doing business in Mainland China is

similar.8 Bankruptcy in Thailand typically takes up to 10 years and anecdotal evidence

indicates that creditors ultimately receive very little through either court settlement

(Foley 1999) or private debt renegotiations.9 This paper suggests that the possibility of

propping makes issuing debt attractive to entrepreneurs and investors, when courts cannot

enforce contracts.

         Our interpretation of the evidence suggests that large business groups exhibit a

form of the soft budget constraint, which is usually associated with government-backed

enterprises or bank-supported firms (Dewatripont and Maskin 1995). Because the

funding source cannot commit not to bail out firms, it is tempted to bail them out ex post;

hence, this expectation induces inefficient behavior (Roland 2000, p.215). In contrast,

we suggest that budget constraints are soft for large conglomerates in developing

countries because the legal and regulatory environment is weak. In this context, debt is a

commitment by the entrepreneur to bail out a firm when there is a moderately bad shock.

However, this debt also creates a potential cost in that it makes it more likely that the

entrepreneur will abandon the firm, i.e., take the money and run when there is a very bad

shock.

         Our analysis has three parts. First, we establish that firms in developing countries

with weaker corporate governance also have a higher ratio of debt to total assets. Firm-

level corporate governance and debt appear to be substitutes. This relationship is most




4
robust for Asian emerging market countries. Second, we develop a simple model that

explains this observation as propping. Entrepreneurs choose how much to expropriate, as

in Jensen and Meckling (1976), but they can also inject private cash today in order to

preserve their options to expropriate and to obtain a legitimate share of profits

tomorrow.10 Both expropriation and propping cannot be monitored, prevented, or

punished in countries with weak legal protection of investors.11 If the legal system is

weak, creditors cannot take possession of collateral but a firm that defaults on existing

debts will not generally be able to borrow further. In this framework, the direct effect of

debt is to increase the potential for propping and make it more likely that outside

investors will participate in financing the firm.12

       From our perspective, debt commits the entrepreneur to bailing out a project and

effectively establishes a credible soft-budget constraint, which is usually associated with

government bailouts (Kornai 1979). Soft-budget constraints in socialist countries and

state-owned enterprises destroy incentives for good performance (Roland, 2000).

However, in our model, the commitment to bail out a project may actually increase its

value, because it reduces the incentive of an entrepreneur to expropriate investors when

returns are temporarily low. This debt-induced softening of a particular firm’s budget

constraint may actually make it easier to attract outside investors. La Porta, Lopez-de-

Silanes, and Shleifer (1999) show that groups of connected firms are observed more

frequently than stand-alone firms in most countries. These groups typically control at

least one company that is publicly traded or otherwise used to raise funds from outside

investors, although with a number of other companies that are privately held without any

outside investors. Some valuable assets are usually kept private. This type of




5
organization is particularly common in emerging markets in which the legal protection of

minority shareholder rights and creditors is weaker (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer

and Vishny, LLSV 1998 and 2002).

       Third, the empirical evidence suggests that the propensity to tunnel is higher for

groups of interconnected firms, particularly if they are organized in pyramids. We

assume that the propensity to tunnel is correlated with the propensity to prop, i.e., that

transfers in and out of firms are symmetric. Using this assumption, we test for the

presence of propping and find that a higher propensity to prop is associated with more

debt, and with less adverse effects of debt on stock price when there is an adverse

macroeconomic shock.

       We model tunnelling following LLSV (2002), Johnson, Boone, Breach and

Friedman (2000), and Shleifer and Wolfenzon (2000) and introduce the possibility of

propping, i.e., negative tunnelling. More generally, our model builds on the work of La

Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer and Vishny (1997, 1998, 2000, and 2002), who show

that many countries do not protect investors adequately. Specifically, in countries with

weak investor protection, entrepreneurs can tunnel resources out of their firms in ways

that cannot be prevented by outside investors (Johnson, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and

Shleifer 2000). Faccio, Lang, and Young (2001) show that firms in Asia that are lower

down a pyramid, i.e., have a greater divergence between cash-flow and control rights,

tend to have more leverage, but that this result does not hold in Europe. These authors

use different variables for the risk of expropriation and offer a different interpretation of

the phenomenon. Kim and Stone (1999) emphasize the importance of corporate debt in

explaining the severity of the Asian financial crisis.




6
       Section 2 establishes the correlation between corporate governance and debt in

emerging markets. Section 3 presents a simple dynamic model for an entrepreneur who

has issued debt in a firm with minority shareholders. Section 4 examines evidence from

the Asian financial crisis to test the theory. Section 5 concludes with directions for future

research.



2. Evidence on Debt and Corporate Governance

       Theoretically, firms with stronger corporate governance may issue more or less

debt. For example, firms with better corporate governance may find it easier to issue

debt or firms with better investment prospects may improve their corporate governance

contemporaneously with issuing more debt. Alternatively, firms may use the issue of

debt as a substitute for improving corporate governance. In this section, we seek to

establish some basic robust facts for developing countries.

       We report firm-level regressions intended to measure the relationship between

corporate governance and levels of debt. Specifically, we estimate the following

equation:

       Debt ratio = a + b1(Corporate Governance) + b2(Size) + b3(Profitability) +
       b4(Growth) + b5(Industry Dummies) + b6(Country Dummies) + e,                     (1)


where the inclusion of size, profitability, and growth follows Lee, Lee, and Lee (2000).

       This specification assumes that corporate governance at the firm level is an

exogenous variable, e.g., it is given by the tastes of the entrepreneur. This characteristic

is consistent with firm-level literature and is developed further below. Ideally, we would

instrument for corporate governance but no suitable instrument is currently available. As



7
              a result, these regressions may suffer from the usual problems of endogeneity, omitted

              variables, and measurement error. Although the basic results are suggestive, we are not

              confident that these regressions are properly identified.

{Insert Table 1 here}

                        Table 1 presents summary statistics for the firms. In subsequent tables, we match

              our primary data with other data sources; thus the number of firms and countries covered

              varies in each table. The primary data source is the September 1997 Worldscope disk.

              We chose this month because it appears to be the one that gives the most recent updates

              but also has no updates based on post-June 1997 data, i.e., the data are all pre-Asian

              crisis. The data could be based on financial statements as late as June 1997; however,

              because the most popular fiscal year-end is December, the majority of these data are from

              the end of 1996.

{Insert Table 2 here}

                        Table 2 reports coefficient estimates from regressions of debt ratios on corporate

              governance ratings for 447 firms that are actively traded by international investors and

              held partly by investors who are not controlling shareholders. Therefore these firms

              should be raising capital from outside investors. Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia (CLSA)

              compiles the ratings used in Table 2 for companies in 25 emerging markets, i.e., the set of

              developing countries that are open to capital flows.13 The selection bias is interesting

              because CLSA includes firms attractive to international investors. CLSA rates firms on

              57 issues in seven areas of corporate governance. For our measure, we take the simple

              average of CLSA’s ratings in the areas of transparency, independence, accountability,

              responsibility, and fairness. We omit two of CLSA’s ratings, namely, the social-




              8
awareness rating because it does not relate directly to minority shareholder protection and

the discipline rating because limiting the use of debt is one of the factors in its

calculation. The ratings are from 1 to 100, with a higher score indicating better corporate

governance.14 These ratings are for 2001, so we match them with Worldscope data from

the same year.

        The dependent variable, debt ratio, is defined here as the book value of debt

divided by the book value of total assets. Firm size is annual net sales in billions of

$U.S., profitability is return on sales, and firm growth is the one-year growth rate in total

assets. We include dummy variables for 12 of the 13 industries, which are based on

Campbell (1996) and correspond with the firm’s primary SIC code. The number of

observations declines when we control for firm growth due to missing data. We control

for the basic determinants of debt established in the corporate finance literature, namely,

firm size, profitability, and growth.

       Table 2 considers nonfinancial firms as a separate category because differences in

financial reporting make it misleading to compare nonfinancial and financial firms. We

find some evidence that larger firms have higher debt ratios, as predicted by Titman and

Wessels (1988), and little evidence that more profitable firms have lower debt ratios, as

would be suggested by Myers (1977). Table 2, Column 1 shows a strong negative

correlation between corporate governance ratings and debt ratios, which is not

significantly affected when controls for size and profitability, industry dummies, industry

and country dummies, and firm growth are included. This result holds when we include

financial firms in column 6 and 7, but it is weakened when firm growth and country

dummies are included in column 7. In results not reported, we find that firms in Asia




9
              drive these results, which is one reason for our focus on Asia in the empirical analysis.

              The magnitude of the coefficient on the CLSA rating indicates that a 10-point

              improvement in a firm’s corporate governance score is associated with a lower debt ratio

              of 2.3 percentage points.

{Insert Table 3 here}

                        Table 3 reports similar results from a much broader set of nonfinancial firms,

              using the Worldscope database and additional sources on cross-listings. For this set of

              firms we have a variety of indicators of corporate governance, following Mitton (2002).

              Cross-listed is an indicator set equal to one if the firm is listed on a major U.S. exchange,

              either directly or in depository receipt form; listing on such an exchange is considered to

              represent better corporate governance. Big Six auditor is an indicator set equal to one if a

              Big Six accounting firm audited the firm; having such an auditor was considered to

              represent better corporate governance, although we have not checked for an Arthur

              Andersen effect. Diversified is an indicator set equal to one if the firm operates in more

              than one two-digit SIC industry; a more diversified firm is considered to have weaker

              corporate governance. Ownership concentration is the percentage of shares held by the

              largest shareholder; higher concentration is considered to represent stronger corporate

              governance (if the large shareholder exerts power in the interest of minority

              shareholders).

                        We conduct the analysis separately for three distinct regions. Our data sources

              have over 3,000 firms for Asia, including Japan, and Western Europe but only about 300

              firms for Latin America. Table 3 reports coefficient estimates from regressions of debt

              ratios on variables related to corporate governance. In our Asian subsample, columns (1)




              10
through (3), weaker corporate governance is correlated with higher levels of debt. The

number of observations declines due to missing data as we add additional variables, but

the coefficients remain fairly consistent across specifications. The one exception is

cross-listed, which increases greatly in magnitude and significance when size is added as

a control. From column (2) of Table 3, being cross-listed is associated with an 8

percentage point lower debt ratio, having a Big Six auditor is associated with a 3.4

percentage point lower debt ratio, and being diversified is associated with a 2.5

percentage point higher debt ratio. From column (3), an increase in ownership

concentration of 10 percentage points is associated with a 1.4 percentage point lower debt

ratio. The results for Asia are similar if we exclude Japan from the sample, as columns 4

through 6 demonstrate.15 Although not reported, the coefficients are very similar if we

include each corporate governance variable separately. The results are unchanged

qualitatively if country and industry dummies are omitted, with the exception that the

coefficient on the diversified dummy loses statistical significance although it retains its

sign.

        The correlation between governance and debt is much weaker for the Latin

American subsample reported in columns 7 through 9, although this is probably because

we have fewer firms. However, it is also strikingly weaker for the Western European

subsample reported in columns 10 through 12 and the number of firms is now

comparable to the Asian subsample. In Western Europe, being cross-listed is actually

associated with having more debt. Ownership concentration is the only variable that has

a similar effect in Western Europe, although the coefficient is much smaller in this

subsample.




11
       We present a simple model that incorporates the fact that debt is attractive when

corporate governance is weak, either because the legal system is weak or because the

firm chooses not to protect minority shareholders. Our objective is to develop our

intuition about the nature of propping and to suggest some simple empirical tests.



3. A Simple Dynamic Model of Propping16

       Consider an entrepreneur who controls one publicly traded firm and can steal any

amount from this firm, including looting everything.17 However, the entrepreneur can

also prop up the firm’s performance with privately controlled funds. Although the

entrepreneur controls the firm, it has a separate legal status. The entrepreneur owns a

share equal to α of the firm and outsiders own the remaining share β=1-α. Retained

earnings are denoted by I. We assume that the capital structure is already in place and

that the firm is operating. In period t, the entrepreneur steals St of retained earnings from

the firm and obtains utility equal to St. The cost of stealing is (St2/2k). The parameter k,

which we assume to be no greater than I, represents the strength of the legal system so

that a higher value of k means that stealing is less costly.

       Stealing is wasteful in the sense that it reduces the amount invested, i.e., there is

an opportunity cost to diverting resources out of this firm. The entrepreneur invests what

he does not steal in a project that earns a gross rate of return Rt in period t, from which he

obtains a share equal to α. We assume that the entrepreneur can steal as much as he

wants from the firm before investment takes place, but he cannot steal the proceeds of the

investment, at least not until the next period. This assumption indicates that investors

cannot observe investment and never know the per unit return, R, but they can see the



12
level of physical activity of the firm, e.g., the quantity produced or the number of

customers so that they can obtain a reasonable estimate of revenues.18 To simplify the

analysis, we assume that the support of Rt is contained on [0,1/α].19 Also, we assume

that the stochastic variable Rt is persistent so that [Rt+1|Rt] dominates in a first order

stochastic manner [Rt+1|Rt′] when Rt>Rt′. We assume that the entrepreneur observes Rt

before choosing St and that outside investors never observe Rt.

        The publicly traded firm needs to make a debt payment, D, each period, that does

not vary over time and cannot be renegotiated.20 For example, D can be considered as the

regular payment due on a long-term bond. Therefore, the firm’s profit in period t is:

                                     F(St,Rt)=Rt(I-St)-D.

We assume that, if in any period the firm’s profit including the debt payment is negative,

bankruptcy is declared and the firm ceases to operate. Hence, no future profits or debt

payments exist and no opportunities to steal these assets are now available. Intuitively,

the entrepreneur equates the marginal cost and marginal benefit of stealing. Because the

entrepreneur owns α of the firm, he has an incentive to invest at least some of the firm’s

assets rather than to steal them all. As α rises, the amount of stealing falls in equilibrium.

As k rises, the amount of stealing rises in equilibrium.

        We determine the entrepreneur’s optimal behavior by solving the stochastic

dynamic program.21 The entrepreneur’s expected payoff in any period is:

                         πg(St,Rt) = α max[0,F(St,Rt)] + St - St2/2k,

which can be written as:

                             πg(St,Rt) = α F(St,Rt)* H(F(St,Rt)) + St - St2/2k,




13
where H(x) = 0, if x<0, and H(x)=1, otherwise. Let δ denote the discount factor. The

Bellman equation for the entrepreneur’s expected discounted present and future earnings

can be written as:

                V(Rt) = maxS {πm(St,Rt) + δ*E[V(Rt′) | R] * H(F(St,Rt)) };

thus, the entrepreneur’s expected payoff is V(R0).

       The value function V(Rt) is strictly positive and non-decreasing in R as is its

conditional expectation given by:

                                    W(Rt)=E[V(Rt′) | Rt],

due to the persistence assumption. Let Su(Rt) = argmaxS α F(St,Rt)+St-St2/2k.

Solving the first-order condition yields:

                                     Su(Rt) = k(1 - αRt),

which would be the solution for a static model without debt found in Johnson, Boone,

Breach, and Friedman (2000).

       First we consider the case in which δ=0 and future payoffs do not matter so that

the entrepreneur’s optimization problem deals only with a single-period. Hence, the

problem can be written as:

                     S*(Rt)=argmaxS α max[0,F(St,Rt)] + St - St2/2k.

The function to be maximized is continuous with at most two local maxima. Thus, we

can show that the optimal policy is S*(Rt)=Su(Rt) for Rt≥Rm and S*(Rt)=k for Rt<Rm,

where Rm satisfies the following equation:

          F(Su(Rm), R+)+δw+ Su(Rm) - Su(Rm)2/2k = k/2.                         (1)

If D=0, then Rm=0 and we get the same result as in the model without debt in Johnson,

Boone, Breach and Friedman (2000); however, if D>0, Rm>0. In fact, Rm is strictly


14
increasing in D. Thus, for Rt<Rm the presence of debt causes the entrepreneur to loot if

rates of return are too low, due to impending bankruptcy. This looting effect is similar to

the debt overhang results in Myers (1977).

       Returning to the case in which δ>0, but we assume, for simplicity, that R(t) is an

independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variable. Hence, W(Rt)>0 is

independent of R so that we denote this value by w. In this case, the entrepreneur’s

optimization problem is written as:

      S*(Rt)=argmaxSt α [F(St,Rt)+δw]* H(F(St,Rt)) + St - St2/2k.                  (2)

The function to be maximized has two local maxima and a single downward

discontinuity at Sd(Rt)=I-D/Rt. If D=0, the firm never goes bankrupt and S*(Rt)=Su(Rt).

However, in general, the optimal decision policy, S*(Rt), can be of two forms depending

on the relationship between Rm, which was defined in equation (1), and R+, which is

determined as R+*(I-Su(R+))=D. In other words, R+ is the rate of return at which the firm

can just make its debt payment given the amount that the entrepreneur wants to steal. If

R+<Rm, the optimal policy is the same as in the case for δ=0. However, if R+>Rm, the

optimal policy function becomes more interesting because three regions of behavior are

possible.

       In the first region, Rt≥ R+ and S*(Rt)=Su(Rt). In this case, the presence of debt

does not alter the entrepreneur’s behavior. In the second region, S*(Rt)= k for Rt≤R_,

where R_ satisfies

                      F(Sd(R_), R_)+δw+ Su(R_) - Su(R_)2/2k = k/2.

Hence, the entrepreneur steals as much as possible, i.e., k from the firm, establishing the

looting effect of debt. In the intermediate region, R_≤R≤R+ and S*(Rt)=Sd(Rt). Note that



15
               Sd(Rt) is increasing in Rt. In this region, Sd(Rt)<Su(Rt) so that the presence of debt

               actually reduces stealing because the entrepreneur is trying to protect his future earnings.

               We call this the propping effect of debt because debt induces better performance by the

               entrepreneur from the perspective of shareholders.

{insert Figure 1 here}

                         These three regions are illustrated in Figure 1 in which stealing S(t) is represented

               on the y-axis and Rt is represented on the x-axis. The dark line corresponds to S*(Rt),

               which is the optimal amount of stealing given the value of Rt. The straight line from

               (0,k) to (1/α,0) is Su(Rt) which is the optimal policy if debt were equal to zero. As

               argued above, the presence of debt may reduce stealing by the entrepreneur in the

               intermediate region, R+>Rt>R_, because the entrepreneur steals less so that the firm will

               remain solvent. In this region, debt strengthens the entrepreneur’s incentives to act in the

               interest of shareholders, as suggested by Grossman and Hart (1982), Jensen and Meckling

               (1976), and Jensen (1986). In this intermediate region, the entrepreneur may even put

               some of his own money into the firm to prevent bankruptcy. The reason for this behavior

               is that earnings in the future, both from profit sharing and stealing, are valuable so that

               the entrepreneur wants to keep the firm in business for these opportunities.

                         In the region where Rt is small, the presence of debt increases the amount of

               stealing by the entrepreneur since the firm is going bankrupt so that there is no gain

               accrues from profits. Debt overhang causes the entrepreneurs to steal more at the

               expense of outside shareholders and bondholders as in Myers (1977). The qualitative

               aspects of this analysis are not changed if Rt is persistent but not necessarily i.i.d. In this

               case, w is replaced by W(Rt) in equation (2). Since this function is nondecreasing, the




               16
solution still has three types of regions, namely, the normal one in which debt has no

effect, a looting region in which the debt increases stealing, and the propping situation in

which debt causes the entrepreneur to steal less in order to protect the firm from

bankruptcy. The major difference in the more general model is that the points at which

the transition between regions occurs have to be derived by solving the complete

stochastic dynamic program.



4. Testing for Propping

       The anecdotal evidence discussed in the introduction suggests that propping

occurs in some emerging markets. Tables 2 and 3 present further information that is

consistent with the presence of propping. However, it is difficult to observe propping

directly because it is relatively easy to hide transfers in and out of firms when investor

protection is weak. Furthermore, in contrast to tunnelling, minority shareholders and

debt holders do not protest if propping occurs so that no scandals arise and not much

public information is available. However, if we think that investors discern the behavior

of entrepreneurs, or if there is sufficient trading based on insider information, stock price

performance may provide some useful information about propping situations.

       According to our theory, propping occurs when there is a negative shock to the

macroeconomy. This shock needs to be large enough to induce propping but not too

large or otherwise looting occurs. If such shocks are rare, evidence of propping will be

difficult to find by examining performance over long periods. These considerations lead

us to construct a test using stock price performance at a time of an intense but short-lived

economic crisis. The Asian financial crisis of 1997 and 1998 provides a quasi-natural




17
experiment that allows us to test the effect of debt and corporate governance on firm-

level performance. This crisis was undoubtedly an unexpected shock to Asian firms so

that most of them could not adjust either their corporate governance or their debt levels

immediately. At the same time, relatively few firms collapsed or were looted outright.

Therefore, we can infer how the stock market views different corporate finance

arrangements during an economic crisis when, according to our theory, the incentive to

prop should be strongest.

        Basically, we are looking for a difference-in-difference effect. Within the set of

publicly traded Asian firms, all of which experienced a stock price decrease due to the

adverse macroeconomic shock, was this decrease larger or smaller for firms that could be

expected to be propped by an entrepreneur? Hence, we search for a particular interaction

effect, namely, a propping propensity that is relevant only when there is a shock. Critical

to this analysis is a measure for the propensity to prop; to construct such a measure, we

consult the literature on tunnelling. Tunnelling appears to be more likely if a firm is part

of a family group of firms. If firms are organized in pyramids so that one firm is

controlled by another firm, which may in turn be controlled by another firm, tunnelling is

facilitated as La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (1999) and Bertrand,

Mullainathan, and Mehta (2002) argue. Our theory suggests that tunneling and propping

are basically symmetric behaviors so that so pyramids should also make propping

easier.22

        Table 4 reports coefficient estimates from regressions of debt ratios on a

pyramidal ownership indicator. The data come from nine Asian countries, namely, Hong

Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand,




18
and are compiled from the Worldscope database. The ownership data assembled by

Claessens, Djankov, and Lang (2000) are used to define pyramids and group affiliations.

Pyramid is an indicator set equal to one if the firm is controlled through a pyramid

structure. Group affiliation is an indicator set equal to one if the firm is associated with a

family business group. We control for group affiliation in this context because some

pyramidal firms may have better access to capital by virtue of being associated with a

family group.

       Table 4 indicates a positive relationship between pyramidal control and debt

ratios, even after controlling for size, profitability, and growth in column 2, and for group

affiliation in column 3. This relationship is robust to the inclusion of financial firms in

columns 4 through 6. The magnitude of the coefficients indicates that pyramid-

controlled firms have higher debt ratios of about two percentage points on average.

Taken together, tables 2, 3 and 4 taken together demonstrate that, at least for Asian

companies, weaker corporate governance is correlated with higher levels of debt.23 These

results are consistent with the work of Faccio, Lang, and Young (2001), who find higher

levels of debt among Asian corporations that are more vulnerable to expropriation

measured by group affiliation and divergence between cash-flow and control rights.

       Table 5 reports coefficient estimates from regressions of crisis-period stock

returns on debt ratios. These data are from the five Asian countries that were most

affected by the crisis, namely, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand.

They are compiled from the Worldscope database in combination with data on ownership

structure of firms assembled by Claessens, Djankov, and Lang (2000). The crisis-period

stock return is defined as the stock return in local currency over the period from July




19
1997 to August 1998.24 The key independent variable is the debt ratio, defined as the

book value of total debt over the book value of total capital. Financial firms and firms

not included in the IFC global index are excluded, to ensure that the data are comparable

and that stock prices are informative. The dependent variable is stock price performance

during the crisis. Firms with more debt suffered larger falls in stock price, which is not

surprising because leverage increases a firm’s covariation with the market and highly

levered firms could also be hurt by exchange rate movements if their debt is dollar-

denominated. More interesting is the fact that this effect is considerably stronger for non-

pyramid firms than for pyramidal firms.

       As Table 5 indicates, when we split the sample into pyramid and non-pyramid

firms, the coefficient on the debt ratio for pyramid firms is less than half the magnitude

and only marginally significant when we control for firm size in column (6). The results

are similar if we omit industry or country dummies, although the divergence between

pyramid and non-pyramid firms is largest when we include both sets of controls.

Alternatively, if we pool all firms and include debt, a dummy for pyramid, and a pyramid

times debt interaction term, the coefficient on the interaction term is positive at 0.22,

which is a little less than half the magnitude of the coefficient of -0.46 on debt, and

significant with a t-statistic of 1.99. The coefficients on debt and pyramid are both

negative and significant in this unreported regression.

       These results suggest an interpretation of business groups as an organizational

form. If groups develop, they may be an effective way to prop up firms, but they can also

facilitate more effective tunnelling. However, both group and non-group firms can loot

in the same way. Therefore, the comparison of group and stand-alone firms depends on




20
the relative importance of tunnelling compared with propping. Group firms have an

advantage when propping is relatively valuable to investors. Under such conditions,

group firms can raise capital more cheaply or undertake more projects than stand-alone

firms.25



5. Conclusions

       There is strong empirical evidence that entrepreneurs tunnel resources out of

firms in countries with weak investor protection. There is also anecdotal evidence that,

under some circumstances, the same entrepreneurs may prop up firms using their own

private resources. We developed a simple model in which it is optimal for entrepreneurs

to prop when there is a moderate adverse shock, so that the firm stays in business. In this

model, the entrepreneur can commit to prop by borrowing rather than issuing equity.

However, if the negative shock is too large, the entrepreneur loots the firm and it

collapses.

       Evidence from the Asian financial crisis of 1997 and 1998 is broadly supportive

of the idea that propping exists. Asian firms in pyramids are more prone to tunneling,

presumably because it is less costly to transfer resources between firms with this

ownership structure. We suggest that pyramid firms also find it easier to prop.

Consistent with this idea, and the prediction of our model, we find that pyramid firms

with more debt experienced smaller stock price declines during the crisis, controlling for

other factors.

       These results are suggestive but the ideas presented here need to be tested further.

Direct evidence on the size and nature of propping would be helpful. The model fits the




21
fact that corporate governance and debt are substitutes in emerging markets, i.e., worse

firm-level corporate governance is associated with higher levels of debt. However, we

still need a more fully developed theoretical structure within which entrepreneurs choose

an ownership structure and how they finance their activities, given that outside investors

know both tunneling and propping are possible.

       If our results hold up under further theoretical and empirical scrutiny, there are

several interesting implications. The first is that even in countries with very weak legal

protection for investors, it is possible for firms to attract money from outsiders.

However, outside investment will tend to be in the form of debt rather than equity. High

debt ratios mean that there is propping in some negative scenarios, but if a shock is

sufficiently bad, then firms will simply shut down. This pattern of financing may help to

explain why emerging markets with weak institutions can experience episodes of rapid

growth, at the same time as remaining vulnerable to severe economic crises.

    Mitton (2002) finds evidence of propping in diversified firms in Indonesia, the

Philippines, Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand during the Asian crisis of 1997 to 1998. His

results suggest that the misallocation of investment in diversified conglomerates may

become worse when an economy experiences a crisis.
3
    CP Group is a large complicated conglomerate and the precise nature of transactions

involving privately held affiliates is difficult to discern. In China, “CP has sold its stakes



29
in Shanghai-Ek Chor Motorcycle and a brewery it set up with Heineken NV of the

Netherlands… In Thailand, the group has sold its entire stake in Sunny Supermarkets, a

24-hour grocery store chain; 75% of Lotus Distribution, which runs a discount-store

chain; and a small stake in CP 7-Eleven, which runs a 24-hour convenience store

franchise” (Asian Wall Street Journal, March 3, 1998). At the same time, it supports its

three companies that are listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand, namely,

TelecomAsia, Charoen Pokphand Feedmill PCL, and Charoen Pokphand Northeastern

PCL (Asian Wall Street Journal, March 3, 1998 and June 10, 1999).
4
    Some minority shareholders in the Hong Kong company have expressed concern that

this transaction amounts to expropriating them in order to prop up the Indonesian

company.
5
    The strongest evidence of systematic propping comes from Japan, where Hoshi,

Kashyap and Scharfstein (1991) find that banks provided capital to firms experiencing a

liquidity shortfall, so long as the firms belonged to the same industrial group. In Japan

the transfers are not from the private pocket of an entrepreneur to a public company, but

rather between linked companies, both of which may be public. There is also evidence of

tunnelling and propping in India (Bertrand, Mullainathan, and Mehta 2001) and Korea

(Bae, Kang and Kim 2002, Joh 2003).
6
    This violates a basic assumption of Hart and Moore (1998), who model environments in

which a debts are noncontingent payment stream, creditors have the right to foreclose in

the event of a default, and credit has priority in bankruptcy. In the environments

considered in this paper, a creditor cannot foreclose or otherwise take control of assets in

bankruptcy.



30
7
    Asset stripping in bankruptcy happens in many countries. Akerlof and Romer (1993)

analyze a related form of looting that they argue occurs in the US. In their model, the

entrepreneur always intends to abscond with some assets and shift his debt onto the

government.
8
    One informed observer reports, “I have yet to hear of a single case where Hong Kong

liquidators have gone to China and succeeded in recovering assets” (Wall Street Journal,

August 25, 1999, p.A14.) More generally, very few debt defaults from the Asian crisis of

1997 to 1998 have resulted in investors receiving any liquidation value. The Economist

reports “Despite the creation last year of a bankruptcy law in Indonesia where there had

been none before, it is still virtually impossible to force a defaulted debtor into

liquidation (the few creditors that have tried are still tangled up in legal appeals)” (30

January 1999).
9
    In November 1999, Thailand Petrochemical Industries had still not reached a

rescheduling agreement with its creditors more than two years after it suspended debt

repayments (Financial Times, November 18, 1999.) Korean private sector debt

renegotiations were proceeding so slowly that, in the summer of 1999, the Financial

Supervisory Commission created an alternative procedure for debt rescheduling and put

pressure on banks to reach agreements with debtors (Choi 1999).
10
     Jensen (1986) suggests that high levels of debt can induce greater effort from

managers. In our terminology, he is proposing the existence of a non-cash variety of

propping.
11
     In contrast, in the United States, it is illegal to provide financial support to a publicly

traded firm unless this behavior is disclosed fully. For example, a controlling shareholder



31
could not make a loan secretly or buy a product at inflated prices through another

company that he controls. More generally, it is illegal to manage earnings so that a firm’s

financial performance looks better than it actually is.
12
     In addition, there is an indirect and less obvious effect of debt. For a given level of

desired funding, an increased use of debt reduces reliance on outside equity, thus

allowing the entrepreneur to retain more ownership. This reduces the moral hazard

problem of the entrepreneur and, potentially, increases the value of the firm.
13
     CLSA ranked firms in 25 countries. Of these, 21 of them had matches with

Worldscope and are in our sample. They are identified in Table 1, in the next-to-last

column. The other 4 countries that had no matches with Worldscope are the Czech

Republic, Peru, Russia, and Venezuela. Durnev and Kim (2002) give more details about

the CLSA rankings.
14
     These CLSA measures are imperfect but they have some plausibility. Khanna, Kogan

and Palepu (2002) report that Indian firms with a lower CLSA score are more likely to

experience corporate governance scandals. Durnev and Kim (2002) and Klapper and

Love (2002) have shown that firms with a better CLSA measure of corporate governance

have higher valuations.
15
     The exception is cross-listed which is no longer significant.
16
     We use the basic structure of the entrepreneur’s decision from LLSV (2002) and

Shleifer and Wolfenzon (2000), although stealing takes place after the investment has

been made in their models. A static version of this problem appears in Johnson, Boone,

Breach and Friedman (2000) and a discrete time variant with debt is developed in




32
Friedman and Johnson (2000). The intuition of the basic agency problem is close to

Jensen and Meckling (1976).
17
     To avoid confusion, we divide expropriation into two parts. The first is routine

stealing, which can take place every period without the firm going out of business. The

second is looting, which consists of the entrepreneur grabbing all available assets so that

the firm must shut down. None of the terms we use are intended to convey a normative

judgment or to imply that a particular behavior is actually illegal.
18
     Essentially, we are assuming that, if investors observe stealing, they will withdraw

their support. The entrepreneur steals before investing either because this can be

concealed easily or, in the case of looting, because returns are so low that it is not worth

undertaking any investment.
19
     No stealing occurs if αR is sufficiently high. Given that α is often high in emerging

markets, an economic boom may make it optimal for the entrepreneur not to steal at all.
20
     We model the case where the firm has debt, but it could have equity with some debt-

like characteristics, e.g., the firm is punished if it has below market expectations for

earnings, so that there is some incentive for smooth performance. As long as both the

entrepreneur and investors lose something when the firm goes bankrupt, the intuition

behind our results holds.
21
     Because there are no infinitely long-lived securities, no pathologies such as bubbles

can arise in our model.
22
     Wolfenzon (1999) develops a model in which entrepreneurial expropriation is

consistent with the development of pyramidal ownership. Our approach is

complementary to his.



33
23
     Alternative interpretations of these results are possible. For example, diversified firms

may have higher levels of debt because their revenues are less volatile, not because their

governance is weaker. However, taken as a group, these tables confirm this relationship

between governance and debt for a broad sample of firms and for a variety of variables

associated with corporate governance. This relationship appears to be particularly strong

in Asia.
24
     More discussion of this variable can be found in Johnson, Boone, Breach, and

Friedman (2000) and Mitton (2002).
25
     This interpretation may explain why groups have an advantage in countries with weak

legal environments as Khanna and Palepu (1997) argue but it also recognizes that groups

may themselves steal or loot (see also Kim 2003).
