Euro Membership as a U.K. Monetary Policy Option: Results from a Structural Model

                                              ABSTRACT

Developments in open-economy modeling, and the accumulation of experience with the monetary
policy regimes prevailing in the United Kingdom and the euro area, have increased our ability to evaluate
the effects that joining monetary union would have on the U.K. economy. This paper considers the
debate on the United Kingdom’s monetary policy options using a structural open-economy model.
We use the Erceg, Gust, and López-Salido (EGL) (2007) model to explore both the existing U.K.
regime (CPI inflation targeting combined with a floating exchange rate), and adoption of the euro,
as monetary policy options for the United Kingdom. Experiments with a baseline estimated version
of the model suggest that there is improved stability for the U.K. economy with monetary union. Once
large differences in the degree of nominal rigidity across economies are considered, the balance tilts
toward the existing U.K. monetary policy regime. The improvement in U.K. economic stability under
monetary union also diminishes if imports from the euro area are modeled as primarily intermediates
instead of finished goods; or if we assume that the pressures reflected in foreign exchange market
shocks, instead of vanishing with monetary union, are now manifested as an additional source of disturbances
to domestic aggregate spending.

1. Introduction


In June 1999, a poll taken of London-based economists indicated that 65% believed that
the United Kingdom would join the euro area by 2005.1 A decade later, not only has U.K.
participation in monetary union not taken place, but such a development no longer seems
to be the question of “when, not if” that it once appeared. While euro entry has faded as
a likely prospect for the United Kingdom, the decade of coexisting European Central
Bank and Bank of England monetary regimes has provided a firmer picture of the
differences between the two regimes and of the likely effect that monetary union would
have on U.K. economic performance. The analysis that follows uses a structural open-
economy model to evaluate the effect that becoming a euro area member would have on
the U.K. economy.


Our discussion in Section 2 provides a background to the debate on European monetary
union in the United Kingdom. Section 3 discusses some of the economic arguments that
have been raised on both sides of the euro-adoption debate. Section 4 describes the main
properties of the model, which is given in detail in an appendix. Section 5 provides
simulation results for alternative policies. Section 6 concludes.


2. The United Kingdom and European economic and monetary union

The issue of economic and monetary union has been a longstanding—though until the
late 1980s only a sporadic—part of the debate about the implications of the United
Kingdom’s integration into the European Union. The successful negotiations for U.K.
entry into the European Economic Community (EEC, now the European Union) during
1970−72 coincided with the EEC’s consideration of the Werner Report2 proposals for
economic and monetary union. In fact, the first instance of the term “euro” being used to
describe the putative union currency appears to have been in a discussion in the U.K.
press during that period.3 The United Kingdom seemingly affirmed its commitment to
economic and monetary union in joint statements with EEC members in 1972, 1974,
1985, and 1989. But since 1974, U.K. policymakers have expressed reservations about

  The Oxford English Dictionary online (www.oed.com) gives a 1971 U.K. press discussion as the first use
of the term “Euro.” But we have been unable to verify this, as the citation details given in the OED appear
to be faulty.

economic and monetary union, which were finally made official with the securing of an
“opt-out” clause in 1991 that was executed in 1997.


The United Kingdom did not join the European Communities until January 1, 1973. At a
Paris summit in 1972, however, Prime Minister Edward Heath had endorsed the concept
of economic and monetary union, with a 1980 deadline. In October 1972, Alec Douglas-
Home, the Foreign Secretary in the Heath Government, listed European monetary union
as a priority in the U.K. government’s agenda for the EEC (Associated Press, 1972). But
after a change of government and a further Paris summit in 1974, the official position on
monetary union changed. Prime Minister Harold Wilson said he “did not find anyone in
Paris… who believed there was the remotest possibility of economic and monetary union
by 1980,” adding that there was “not a hope in hell… of EMU taking place in the near
future.”4 Elsewhere in his statement, Wilson appeared to suggest that EMU was
undesirable in principle even without the 1980 timetable, but he acknowledged that the
1974 summit communiqué had “made EMU a long-term objective.” The wording of the
communiqué specifically referred to EMU as an “ultimate goal,” though Wilson
explained to his Cabinet colleagues that, despite signing the communiqué, “I made it
clear it was a goal we do not share.”5 This discrepancy foreshadowed the pattern in the
1980s, where the United Kingdom would co-sign affirmations of the EMU goal, only to
express qualifications in an unwritten or unofficial form.


For the rest of the 1970s, EMU receded as an issue. The EEC’s Study Group on the Role
of Public Finance (1977, p. 11) noted, “Monetary union, on which much has been
written, is... a long way off and will probably have to await major developments in the
political, monetary, and fiscal fields.” A step in this direction was the European
Monetary System (EMS), in particular its exchange rate mechanism (ERM),6 which the
United Kingdom contemplated joining as a founding member in 1978−79. At the time,
however, the exchange rate mechanism was not perceived as part of a formal plan for
monetary union. For example, a 1978 U.K. parliamentary committee noted that the EMS
proposal was “far from being a major step on the way to European Economic and
Monetary Union,” and that the Werner proposals for monetary union had been “agreed…
but subsequently abandoned.” (Expenditure Committee, 1978, p. X.)

  The “ERM” terminology only became prevalent in U.K. policy debates starting in mid-1989; in most of
the pre-1989 discussions within the United Kingdom, the term EMS was used to refer to the exchange rate
mechanism.

The lull in progress toward European economic and monetary union was broken in 1985
with agreement on a single market. This involved the United Kingdom and other EEC
members signing a treaty amendment referring to economic and monetary union as a
goal. The United Kingdom under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher further joined in
Madrid (1989) and Dublin (1990) summit declarations endorsing a process that would
culminate in economic and monetary union. In explaining her apparent endorsement of
EMU on occasions like these, Thatcher said in 1990 that her definition of EMU was
“economic and monetary cooperation.”7


In 1990 Thatcher came out unambiguously against monetary union, declaring the United
Kingdom’s own currency (the pound sterling) its “greatest expression of sovereignty.”8
Disagreement over EMU played a key role in her forced resignation. Thatcher’s
successor, John Major, was not opposed unconditionally to EMU but took the key step of
securing for the United Kingdom the option not to participate in monetary union. At the
Maastricht summit in December 1991, Major obtained an opt-out provision as a condition
of U.K. participation in the Maastricht Treaty. The opt-out pertained to “Stage 3” of
economic and monetary union, i.e., the stage at which the union amounted to a single
currency.


The likelihood of the United Kingdom joining in monetary union receded further with the
collapse of its membership of the exchange rate mechanism in 1992 and the perceived
success of domestic monetary policy in the early years of inflation targeting (1992−97).
For the 1997 general election, both major political parties were committed to a policy of
seeking referendum approval before any final decision to enter monetary union could be
formalized. Shortly after its election in 1997, the Blair Government “committed the U.K.
to the principle of joining the single currency” (HM Treasury, 2003a, p. 1), but made any
recommendation of actual entry (and hence a referendum) conditional on the five
economic tests being passed. The five economic tests (with our numbering in square
brackets) are:9

   [5] In summary, will joining EMU promote higher growth, stability and a lasting
   increase in jobs?


The U.K. Government determined in 1997 and 2003 that these tests had not been
satisfied, and so did not proceed to a referendum on U.K. membership of the euro area.
(See especially HM Treasury, 2003b.)


The prospect of the United Kingdom becoming a member of the euro area now seems
remote. Good macroeconomic performance from 1997 to 2007, the related consolidation
of the inflation targeting regime, and the move to even greater seniority within the U.K.
government of critics of membership (most notably Gordon Brown’s move from
Chancellor of the Exchequer to Prime Minister) have all been factors reducing the
likelihood of euro adoption.


Let us consider, however, the five economic tests and the extent to which our analysis
below can bear on them. Question [4] is an industry-level question not easy to answer
with a macroeconomic model, while [3] and aspects of [5] cover questions more suitably
answered with a model that accounts for changes in long-term economic growth. We
therefore consider those questions most suited to a macroeconomic analysis: the
interrelated questions [1] and [2] as well as the “stability” aspect of test [5]. These were
also the aspects of the five economic tests which the U.K. authorities (in HM Treasury,
2003a) stressed that the United Kingdom had not met. We interpret these tests as jointly
amounting to a test of whether monetary union improves upon or is at least competitive
with the existing U.K. monetary policy regime (inflation targeting) in contributing to
macroeconomic stabilization.


Before outlining our modeling strategy for investigating this question, we consider some
key aspects of the economic debate on the United Kingdom’s place in European
monetary union.




                                              4
3. The economic debate over the merits of monetary union

Some early discussions of the United Kingdom’s position in the European Union took
monetary union as an eventual implication of movement to a single trading market. For
example, Lionel Robbins stated in 1971, “I do not think that in the end a common market,
just like that, can function well if there is not something like a common money.”10 In
1991, former Prime Minister Edward Heath said that “any economist” would say that that
once the European Union became a single market (in 1992), “there was no alternative to a
single currency.”11 These positions, have, however, not had an enduring influence, and
the merits of monetary union for the United Kingdom are now seen as an issue separable
from the merits of membership in the European Union.


As noted above, a major element of the opposition to European monetary union has taken
the form of opposition to the perceived loss of political sovereignty, and some adherents
to that political argument regard it as a sufficient condition for rejecting monetary union
even if euro membership could be shown to be desirable on economic grounds. This
seemed to be the stand taken by several members of the Conservative governments over
the 1990s—see Stephens (1997, pp. 309−315)—but that position was decisively
renounced as government policy when in 1997 the Blair Government appealed
exclusively to economic merits as the criteria for entry.


The most important implication of monetary union for economic management was
identified by Prime Minister Wilson’s observation in 1974 that union “would mean one
central bank, one central currency… [E]very country would have to pursue exactly the
same policy with that single currency…” Wilson argued that therefore it was an
“illusion” to believe that monetary union would occur.12 While Wilson’s conclusion
proved to be a flawed prediction for much of the European Union, his discussion of the
main economic implications of monetary union did anticipate much of the subsequent
debate. This debate takes as a starting point the acceptance that a single macroeconomic
or demand management (specifically, monetary) policy is implied by union, and aims to
establish whether the associated loss of flexibility for the U.K. economy is outweighed by
economic benefits of membership. The debate on euro membership therefore combines
two long-lasting themes in U.K. policy debates: the desirable degree of economic

integration with “Europe”; and whether the United Kingdom should give up its freedom
to have its own monetary policy.13


Many of the details of the economic debate on U.K. membership have been concerned
with exchange rate behavior. Euro adoption would mean the end of a regime in which
the U.K. pound sterling floats against the euro. Much of the discussion of Buiter (1999),
Minford (2002), and Artis and Ehrmann (2006) centers on the issue of whether the
exchange rate, when allowed to float, adapts efficiently to shocks; or if it instead fails to
respond to fundamentals in a stabilizing manner, and so (ceteris paribus) magnifies
macroeconomic variability. Such a way of framing the issue happens to understate the
benefits for a country of monetary policy autonomy. For it is certainly not the case that
the benefits of monetary autonomy are absent if the exchange rate is driven by
nonfundamental factors. Irrespective of what factors drive the exchange rate, a floating
rate confers on the central bank autonomy in determination of the amount of base money
in existence and so the ability to use domestic short-term interest rates as a policy
instrument. This benefit does not depend on a well-behaved exchange rate—it is
completely ensured by Phillips and IS curves that have standard properties (i.e., with
aggregate demand sensitive to real short-term interest rates—possibly indirectly via a
term-structure connection to long rates; and with prices adjusting gradually to aggregate
demand, so that a Phillips curve that becomes vertical in the long run describes inflation
dynamics). So for the exchange rate to respond to “fundamentals” is not a necessary
condition for a floating exchange rate to be desirable. In relation to this point, Corsetti,
Dedola, and Leduc (2007) present a model where the exchange rate fails completely to
adhere to fundamentals, yet the monetary policy strategy followed by the U.K. authorities
in preference to monetary union—i.e., focusing on a CPI inflation target alongside a
floating exchange rate—is optimal.


Nevertheless, it is true that one possible benefit of a floating rate is its potential ability to
contribute to stabilization. The debate on whether the exchange rate provides this
stabilizing role in practice can be represented by reference to a standard uncovered
interest parity condition (see e.g., Woodford, 2001, p. 308):


———————————————————————————————————

   Debates on the second issue predate the creation of any version of the European Union. Indeed, one of
the pioneer Keynesians, Richard Kahn, argued, “If Keynes can be said to have devoted his life to anything,
it is to liberating internal policy from the domination of external factors.” (Kahn, 1956, p. 113.) Milton
Friedman made a similar assessment of Keynes’ contribution (Friedman, 1983).


                                                    6
qt = Etqt+1 –[(Rt – Etπt+1) − (Rt* – Etπt+1*)] + ψt                                  (1)


where asterisks denote other-economy values, qt is the log real exchange rate, Rt is the
domestic short-term nominal interest rate in quarterly units, πt is quarterly inflation, and
ψt is an exogenous time-varying risk-premium (i.e., a shock to the UIP condition). There
is wide agreement that, in practice, the real exchange rate and the nominal exchange rate
move in the same direction in the short run under floating exchange rate regimes.
Therefore, claims about whether the nominal exchange rate performs a stabilizing
function can be mapped into similar claims about the short-run behavior of qt.


The view that a floating exchange rate helps macroeconomic stabilization can be broken
into two elements: (i) Different shock patterns or different structure in the home
economy, relative to the other economy, might lead to the “natural interest rate” differing
across economies. To the extent that stabilization of the home economy’s output gap and
its aggregate inflation rate require adjustment of nominal interest rates to levels different
from those prevailing in the other economy, this adjustment can be accomplished because
exchange rate flexibility allows interest rates to differ across economies—i.e., qt and
Etqt+1 are free to move to satisfy the UIP condition if monetary policy moves domestic
real and nominal interest rates away from the corresponding other-economy values. (ii)
Fluctuations in the risk premium ψt may occur for reasons of economic fundamentals,
and the efficient response might be a nominal exchange rate reaction rather than a
reaction of domestic interest rates. With a floating nominal exchange rate, this can occur,
and this kind of adjustment has, for example, often been argued to describe the Australian
dollar’s reaction to the 1990s Asian market crises. Monetary union, however, precludes
an adjustment along these lines of the domestic economy and of the nominal exchange
rate.


The advocacy of euro membership for the United Kingdom in Buiter (1999) does not use
an explicit model, but Buiter’s analysis implicitly assumes away the model elements that
deliver the scenarios described in (i) and (ii) above. Buiter (1999, p. 30) essentially rules
out case (i) in his statement that “in a rather small and open economy like the U.K.,
monetary policy works primarily (even if not reliably) through the exchange rate.” The
position that the exchange-rate channel is the main channel through which monetary
policy operates in an open economy is very restrictive. It is true that the Mundell-
Fleming model and some modern optimization-based models remove the real interest rate



                                                7
from the list of variables that the home-country central bank can influence in the short
run.14 But this result does not hold in models in which the aggregate consumer price
index is sticky (e.g., models where imports are intermediates alone and final goods prices
are sticky, as in McCallum and Nelson, 1999; or models where imports are final goods
but are priced sluggishly, as in Monacelli, 2005). And it is not obvious that the domestic
channel of monetary policy is negligible in open economy models in general. In other
words, a portion of aggregate real spending may be sensitive to the real interest rate
rather than just the real exchange rate, so this component of aggregate demand can be
affected by any monetary policy that can influence real interest rates even if monetary
policy’s impact on the exchange rate is unreliable. Work done with explicitly
optimization-based open-economy models with nominal rigidities does not in general
support the notion that, in an open economy, monetary policy ceases to work through any
channel other than the exchange rate. Thus Faia and Monacelli (2008, p. 745), while
concluding that “the nature of optimal monetary policy in an open economy emerges as
fundamentally different from the one of a closed economy,” do not deny a domestic
monetary policy channel; domestic real short-term interest rates appear in their
consumption Euler equation in the usual manner, so monetary policy can influence
aggregate demand via this “domestic” channel if it is able to affect domestic short-term
real interest rates in the short run.


The existence of a substantial domestic-spending channel of monetary policy seems to be
widely accepted for the analysis of the United Kingdom, and the Bank of England’s
official descriptions of its view of monetary policy transmission include a prominent
domestic channel (see, for example, Bank of England, 1999). Moreover, the U.K.
Treasury’s assessment of the costs and benefits of euro adoption emphasized the different
arrangements for mortgage lending across the United Kingdom and euro area, a
comparison that would be irrelevant if no domestic channel of monetary policy existed.15
The record of U.K. monetary policy episodes also suggests that aggregate demand and
inflation do respond to monetary policy actions even when the behavior of the exchange
rate does not appear to be in keeping with the direction expected from a monetary policy
change: for example, tightenings in 1976 and 1989 were followed by contractions in
aggregate demand, even though the sterling exchange rate depreciated for protracted

optimizing open-economy models.

   See H.M. Treasury (2003b). The Treasury emphasized the fact that in the U.K. mortgage interest rates
are predominantly adjustable, while in the euro area they are often fixed. See Rubio (2008) for an
investigation of this distinction in a general equilibrium model.


                                                    8
periods. The predominant conclusion from theory and evidence is that domestic channels
of monetary policy are present and substantial, so, as suggested above, floating exchange
rates confer on the central bank the ability to determine nominal aggregate demand and
the inflation rate, even if the exchange rate channel cannot be relied upon.


In opposition to position (ii), the euro entry advocates have argue that the UIP shock ψt is
not a fundamental shock; rather, it reflects an inefficiency or “noise” created by the
foreign exchange market, and so any movement it tends to induce in qt is undesirable. By
analogy with the cost-push shock in large DSGE models (see especially Smets and
Wouters, 2005, p. 163), the UIP shock is, according to this argument, a friction that
distorts prices and moves the economy further away from its efficient allocation, and is
not a shock to which real variables would respond in an efficient flexible-price
equilibrium. This argument leads to Buiter’s (1999) position that it is desirable to abolish
the sterling/euro foreign exchange market by imposing monetary union. Then the
condition Rt = Rt* is an identifying feature of a monetary union. The nominal exchange
rate is removed from the system as a variable. To the extent that UIP shocks owe their
existence to the market for nominal foreign exchange, the elimination of that market
removes UIP shocks from the model. Monetary union is, in that case, materially different
from both floating-exchange-rate and fixed-exchange-rate environments.


The view of critics of monetary union is that union does not remove UIP shocks; instead,
it changes the way that they create pressures. Blanchard (1997, p. 288), for example,
argues that “while a common currency will indeed eliminate exchange rate crises, it will
not eliminate the underlying reason for such crises—namely, the fact that different
interest rates, as well as adjustments in exchange rates, are needed…” Elimination of a
floating nominal exchange rate, according to this view, removes a convenient means with
which to adapt to the pressure of UIP shocks. Absent floating exchange rates, the
pressure of such shocks might be felt in other economic relationships. For example, the
pressure formerly felt as UIP shocks might now manifest itself as an increase in the
variance of shocks to the IS equation.


All in all, the a priori arguments that led to Buiter’s (1999) conclusion that the case for
euro adoption by the United Kingdom was “overwhelming” do not seem compelling, as
modern open-economy models produce many counterexamples. It is desirable instead to
consider an explicit structural model that embeds and quantifies many of the model
elements underlying the debate on monetary union. We do this in Section 4.

                                             9
3.1 The sterling appreciation

The United Kingdom experienced a “strong pound” period starting in 1996 and
continuing during nearly a decade of the euro’s existence (see Figure 1). This period has
been said to demonstrate the defects of floating exchange rates as an arrangement for the
United Kingdom. It has been emphasized by critics of floating that the sterling
appreciation is difficult to trace to economic fundamentals (see e.g., Cobham, 2006). The
recent sudden reversal of the pound appreciation, at a time of worldwide contraction in
the financial services business, is said by euro-membership advocates to demonstrate
further the disadvantage of the United Kingdom’s exercise of its opt-out from euro
participation. Proponents of U.K. participation contend that the strong pound shifted
U.K. employment from the exchange-rate-sensitive manufacturing sector to the financial
services sector, and that the latter increase in employment has proved to be ephemeral.


In our view, however, this episode does not provide unambiguous evidence against the
advantages claimed for floating exchange rates. In particular, the case made by
membership proponents neglects the major contribution to macroeconomic stabilization
that U.K. monetary policy made during the strong-pound period of 1996−2007.
Monetary Policy Committee decisions had a favorable effect during the period of
stagnant or falling manufacturing output and industrial production indices from 1997 to
2007. In 1990−92, the United Kingdom had a fixed exchange rate and no monetary
policy autonomy; during this earlier episode of an overvalued pound, contraction
proceeded in both the manufacturing sector and aggregate economic activity. In
1997−2007, by contrast, the strong pound was associated with stagnant or declining
indices of industrial and manufacturing production, but also with continuous and
respectable growth in real GDP. This is brought out in Figure 2, which plots annual-
average data (from IFS) of U.K. industrial production and U.K. real GDP for 1990−2007.
We would argue that, by concentrating on the stabilization of macroeconomic aggregates,
the Monetary Policy Committee over this period managed to stop the manufacturing
contraction from being associated with aggregate economic contraction. The reason it
was able to do this was the United Kingdom’s monetary policy autonomy, which neither
a monetary union nor fixed exchange rate would have permitted.


As for the rapid end of the strong-pound era in 2008, this can be seen as a stabilizing
development. By stimulating net exports, the turnabout in sterling behavior lessened the
implications for U.K. aggregate output and employment of the downturn in the U.K.

monetary policy vigorously relative to euro area policy—a room to move dramatically
exemplified by the MPC’s 150-basis point cut in the U.K. Bank Rate in November 2008,
and by its adoption of quantitative easing in 2009.


4. A structural model for considering monetary union questions

The model we use is the two-country open-economy system of Erceg, Gust, and López-
Salido (EGL) (2007). This model has several major attractions for the study of the
United Kingdom’s monetary policy options. First, the model is based on optimizing
behavior, so consideration of alternative monetary regimes (in either the U.K. economy
or the euro area) is a natural and legitimate experiment. In particular, we can explore CPI
inflation targeting and monetary union as U.K. monetary policy options. Second, the
model is flexible enough to allow the two economies to be asymmetric on several
important dimensions: e.g., relative size, technology, shock specification and degree of
nominal rigidity (for both prices and wages). This flexibility allows us to determine the
impact of monetary union in the presence of different economic structures (and different
shock processes) in the United Kingdom and the euro area. Third, Erceg, Gust, and
López-Salido (2007) show that the model allows the domestic real interest rate and
output gap to be affected substantially by domestic shocks, so there is a nontrivial
“domestic” channel despite the presence of openness. This means that our results do not
depend on the caricature that U.K. monetary policy effectiveness relies on an exchange
rate channel. Fourth, the model can be adjusted to allow for a portion of the volume of
imports to be intermediate goods. We can therefore use a feature that was advocated for
optimizing open-economy models by McCallum and Nelson (1999), and found
convenient for the analysis of monetary policy in open economies by Erceg (2002) and
Smets and Wouters (2002).


As the model has been laid out in detail in Erceg, Gust, and López-Salido (2007), we
simply summarize its main elements here, presenting the basic equations in an appendix.
Households’ consumption choice is represented by a standard Euler equation.
Government spending in each country is exogenous and is the source of an “IS” shock.
The production function features labor input, an exogenous technology shock specific to
each economy, and a fixed capital stock. Labor is immobile across countries. Firms and
workers enter the goods and labor markets respectively with a degree of monopoly power
and with Calvo-style obstacles to adjustment of the offered prices for their goods and

                                            12
labor services. These contracts are augmented by dynamic indexation: all wage contracts
are scaled up by the prior period’s wage inflation rate; all price contracts, by prior price
inflation. In our estimated version of the model, imports are final consumer goods. The
prices of imports are flexible.


4.1 Specification and estimation

We assume that the home economy’s size is 20% that of the other economy, in order to
give the model a “United Kingdom = home economy; euro area = other economy”
interpretation. We set the steady-state share of government spending in GDP to 0.33 in
the United Kingdom, 0.338 in the euro area. The import share of GDP for each economy
is intended to capture the degree of each economy’s trade with one another. We make
the share 13.5% for the United Kingdom; together with the relative sizes of the economy,
this implies a 2.7% import share for the euro area. The latter takes such a low value
because we are neglecting non-U.K. imports into the euro area, given the model’s two-
economy structure. We fix the exchange rate elasticity of traded goods at EGL’s baseline
value of 1.5 and the steady-state wage markup in both economies at 50%. The discount
rate (β) is set at 0.9925, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is set at 1/σ = 1/2, and
the inverse of the Frisch elasticity of labor supply assumed to be χ = 5.

While we estimate the intertemporal elasticity of substitution for consumption and the
labor supply elasticity of households using U.K. and euro area data, we constrain the
estimate of each parameter to be the same across the two economies.

The monetary policy rule specification is similar but not identical across economies. For
the United Kingdom, the monetary policy rule has the short-term nominal interest rate
respond in a smoothed manner to the lagged four-quarter retail price inflation rate (which
we use as the empirical measure for the United Kingdom of consumer price inflation, πC)
and to lagged detrended log output y:

RtU.K. = ρRRt−1U.K. + (1−ρR) γπ(0.25*(πC,t−1U.K. + πC,t−2U.K. + πC,t−3U.K. + πC,t−4U.K.))
       + (1−ρR) γyyt−1U.K. + eRt U.K.                                                     (2)

Here constants are suppressed, and the monetary policy shock eRt is assumed to be an
AR(1) process. Other than lagging the variables one more period, this specification is a
restricted version of the policy rule estimated for the United States by Rotemberg and



                                               13
Woodford (1997), and also follows their use of loglinearly detrended real GDP as the
variable to which the authorities respond. Again paralleling Rotemberg and Woodford’s
specification, the above reaction function above delivers a “long-run” rule of the Taylor
form. Our modeling of policymaker behavior using this simple three-parameter rule
requires justification in light of Favero’s (2001, p. 237) position that “a strategy closer to
the spirit of intertemporal optimization seems more appropriate” in the estimation of
policy rules. The use of a simple rule can be defended both on practical grounds—the
EGL model is too large for the implied optimal-policy conditions to deliver rules
tractable enough for econometric estimation—and for reasons of realism—the inflation
variable that U.K. policymakers over our sample concerned themselves with was a CPI-
like concept, not the combination of wage inflation and domestic-goods price inflation
that the EGL model would tend to suggest should be targeted.


For the euro area, a similar policy rule specification is estimated, though with no
constraint that the estimated responses, or the AR(1) parameter and innovation variance
for the shock, be the same as in the United Kingdom. An important qualification is that
for the euro area we assume that the inflation variable that enters the rule is the
(annualized) one-period lagged quarterly GDP deflator inflation rate (as opposed to the
lagged four-quarter CPI-type rate in the U.K. case). The deflator inflation rate is
assumed to enter the rule even though it is the HICP aggregate that we use as an
observable in obtaining our estimates below (where it is used to correspond, for the euro
area, to the model’s consumer price index). The assumption that euro area policy
responds to deflator inflation follows Smets and Wouters (2005).16


Each economy has Phillips curves for wage and for price adjustment. Each Phillips curve
has its own univariate AR(1) shock term. The remaining shocks in the model are two
real shocks for each economy—government spending and technology—and a shock that
we add to the EGL model, namely a shock to the UIP condition, so that the UIP condition
in our model resembles equation (1). The two real shocks for each economy (four in
total) and the UIP shock are assumed to be AR(1) processes. Because asymmetry of
shocks is a central issue for the debate on monetary union, the stand we take on
correlations of shocks is important. We allow the government spending shock to be

  The United Kingdom is the “rest of world” for the euro area in the two-economy model we are using.
Assuming a euro-area monetary policy response to deflator inflation captures, more than would an
assumption of a policy response to consumer prices, the notion that euro area policy does not respond to
U.K. inflation when the United Kingdom is outside the monetary union.


                                                    14
correlated across economies, and so too the technology shock to be correlated across
economies. This cross-correlation is allowed for by empirical estimation of cross-
correlations of the shock innovations. We constrain the monetary policy and Phillips
curve shocks to be uncorrelated across economies.


The data used in model estimation are, for each economy, detrended logs of per capita
consumption, output, and the quarterly real wage (with consumer prices used to deflate
nominal wages); (consumer/retail) price inflation for each economy; the nominal U.K.
Treasury bill rate; the euro area short-term nominal interest rate; and the change in the
nominal exchange rate. Logs of output, consumption, and the real wage are detrended
over 1980−2005. U.K. data sources are described in DiCecio and Nelson (2007).17 Euro
area data come from the ECB’s Area Wide Model database (see Fagan, Henry, and
Mestre, 2001) and other ECB sources. The sterling/euro exchange rate is from Haver/IFS.
Population data are from Haver, the ECB, and (for the United Kingdom) the Office of
National Statistics.

We estimate the model by Bayesian likelihood methods (see Smets and Wouters 2003,
2007) on the sample period 1981 Q1−2005 Q4,18 and report parameter estimates in
Tables 1A to 1C. The posterior estimates indicate a standard amount of price stickiness
(around twice-a-year price adjustment, other than the adjustment occurring via the
indexation term) for both economies. But there is little estimated wage stickiness. For
the euro area, this result is puzzling in light of estimates such as those of Smets and
Wouters (2003). One of the simulation experiments that we undertake below allows for
more wage rigidity in the euro area. For both economies, the rule estimates indicate
substantial interest-rate smoothing, a long-run response to inflation close to 1.5, and an
output response somewhat below the value (0.5/4 = 0.125) associated with the Taylor
rule.

   In addition to the U.K. variables described there, we have nominal wages for the United Kingdom among
our observables. Nominal wages for the United Kingdom consist of total compensation (Office of National
Statistics series dtwm.q), divided by aggregate employment (series bcaj.q).
18
   Starting estimation in 1981 allows the overhaul of doctrine that took place in U.K. economic
policymaking in the late 1970s, documented in Nelson (2008), to make itself felt in changed monetary
policy responses to the state of the economy. As a related matter, omitting pre-1980 observations from the
sample helps avoid inclusion in estimation many of the substantial breaks in means, trends, and variances
from the 1970s to the 1980s in the U.K. data, documented for example by Stock and Watson (2002), Benati
(2008), Boero, Smith, and Wallis (2008), and Surico (2008).

With the partial exception of the monetary policy shocks, which have only moderate
autocorrelation, all the estimated shocks in the model are strongly persistent. In
particular, the UIP shock is highly serially correlated. This autocorrelation combines
with the estimated innovation variance to give an unconditional standard deviation for the
UIP shock of about 0.5%, a surprisingly modest value.


There is considerable asymmetry in the real shocks facing each economy, with the
correlation between innovations to technology being below 0.2 and that between
government spending innovations being below 0.3. This is consistent with previous
evidence for European economies. For example, Söderström (2008, p. 10) argues that
“asymmetric shocks seem to be important for the Swedish economy,” while Artis and
Ehrmann’s (2006) VAR analysis suggests that German and U.K. real shocks may even be
negatively correlated.


A serious question raised about empirical open-economy DSGE models is raised by
Justiniano and Preston (2006). They argue that estimated (small) open-economy
structural models understate the contribution of international shocks to an open
economy’s economic fluctuations. In their empirical example of the United States and
Canada, the U.S. shocks in combination contribute about two-thirds to Canadian output
fluctuations in an identified VAR, but to less than 10% of Canadian output variation in
the estimated DSGE model. We have looked at the impact on our results of this problem
by comparing our estimated open-economy structural model for the euro area and the
United Kingdom with an identified VAR including data for the two economies. The
VAR is a four-lag system consisting of a major subset of the variables we use in
estimation of the structural model: namely, output growth, inflation, and interest rates for
both economies, as well as the change in the nominal exchange rate. The VAR identified
shocks are obtained with a Choleski decomposition, with euro variables ordered first,
followed by the exchange rate, then the U.K. variables, and the ordering of the variables
within each block being: interest rate; output growth; inflation. This identified VAR
delivers an estimated contribution of foreign shocks (including the exchange rate shock)
to U.K. output growth variability of 32.7%. The contribution of foreign shocks (including
the UIP shock) to U.K. output growth variation in the estimated structural model, on the
other hand, is 29.9%. The results differ from Justiniano and Preston’s in two respects.
First, for the identified VAR, the estimated foreign contribution to domestic economic
variability is more modest in our example—and this is despite the fact that we do, and
Justiniano and Preston do not, include the exchange rate shock among the foreign shocks.

                                             19
Second, in moving to the structural model, we do not find a dramatically smaller
contribution of foreign shocks’ contribution to domestic economic fluctuations. In that
sense, the understatement problem for our euro area/U.K. structural model is less serious
than that found by Justiano and Preston (2006) for their open-economy model of the
United States and Canada. But this finding is subject to the proviso that, as noted above,
we categorize exchange-rate shocks in both the VAR and structural models as foreign
shocks. It is true that most of the foreign contribution to U.K. output variation in our
structural model comes from this source, whereas in the VAR, the shocks to the euro-area
variables form the bulk of the foreign influence on U.K. output growth.


5. Simulation experiments

In this section we present illustrative results from simulations of the model. We consider
three assumptions about model structure, starting with the estimated model as the
baseline.


A. Baseline case

In the baseline case in Table 2, we assess U.K. economic performance using the
estimated model under different monetary policy rules: historical policy and monetary
union. We focus on variability of output, CPI inflation, and the short-term nominal
interest rate. We acknowledge that open-economy models like those used in this paper
frequently do not justify a monetary policy focus on aggregate CPI inflation, and direct
attention instead to domestic-goods inflation or to a combination of domestic-goods and
wage inflation. But CPI inflation is bound to be a key variable in a study of U.K. policy
options. That is the inflation rate focused upon in the U.K. current policy framework,
and so is a key variable to consider in judging the merits of U.K. entry into monetary
union.


Historical policy uses the U.K. and euro area interest-rate rules set out in the estimated
model. The mode values in Tables 1A to 1C are taken to be the model estimates. When
we consider monetary union, the historical U.K. policy rule is dropped in favor of RtU.K. =
REAt (where “EA” denotes euro area), and since the United Kingdom is then a euro area
member, the euro area output and price aggregates that enter the euro area policy rule
include the corresponding U.K. series. The price aggregate is assumed to be a loglinear
combination of the non-U.K. and U.K. economies’ output deflators. Subject to these

augmented definitions of the aggregates, the interest-rate policy rule assumed for the
monetary union is the same as that estimated empirically for the euro area: smoothing of
0.79, a response to lagged quarterly inflation that implies a 1.27 “long-run” response, and
a response to lagged detrended output that implies a 0.085 “long-run” reaction.19

Historical policy in our parameterized model gives, as reported in Table 2, standard
deviations of 4.8% for inflation, 3.3% for the output gap, and 5.1% for the nominal
interest rate. The alternative regime of monetary union is considered with and without
UIP shocks. When UIP shocks are present, they act in a way that does not disturb
equality of interest rates across economies; instead, UIP shocks effectively become a
second IS shock and so a source of disturbance to output demand. According to Table 2,
monetary union reduces output gap variability and does so irrespective of the assumption
about the presence of UIP shocks. Improvement in U.K. inflation stabilization does
occur with monetary union but is somewhat dependent on whether union eliminates UIP
shocks. The standard deviation of U.K. inflation falls if UIP shocks vanish.
Nevertheless, even when UIP shocks are present, their effect on the results is not
dramatic, apparently because our estimates imply a fairly modest variance for this class
of shock.


B. Wages relatively more flexible in the United Kingdom

Estimates of a dynamic general equilibrium model for the United Kingdom in DiCecio
and Nelson (2007) suggested that U.K. nominal rigidity was concentrated in prices, rather
than spread across wages and prices equally. This finding is roughly reflected in our
estimates here too. But it is puzzling that we also find that the probability of wage
adjustment is also quite rapid in the euro area, which contrasts with estimates such as
those of Smets and Wouters (2003). In light of this, we now consider an alternative
parameterization of the EGL model in which wages are more flexible in the United
Kingdom than in the euro area. Specifically, we raise the degree of nominal rigidity in
the euro area above its estimated value. It is now assumed that the probability that wages
are not reoptimized is 0.60 in the euro area.




———————————————————————————————————
19
  The monetary policy shock autocorrelation and variances for the policymaker in the monetary union, are
also those estimated in Tables 1B and 1C for the euro area.


                                                   22
We report the simulation outcomes in the middle set of results (Case B) in Table 2.
When there is no monetary union, the standard deviations of U.K. series are virtually
unchanged from those under the baseline parameterization. Since the only change in
parameterization is to the degree of euro area wage rigidity, the results make economic
sense; they reflect the notion that floating exchange rates can insulate the domestic
economy from divergences across economies in the degree of nominal rigidity. The loss
of the exchange rate mechanism and of an own-economy interest-rate rule now seem to
have visible costs; U.K. inflation stabilization worsens drastically under monetary union,
when compared to that under the historical U.K. monetary policy rule, regardless of
whether UIP shocks are present. The magnitude of the difference in inflation variability
implied by historical rules and that implied by monetary union is very large in Table 2,
and may be questioned. The difference would likely be more modest if, for example, we
had assumed a more modest divergence between U.K. and euro area nominal rigidity.20
We would not give credence to the quantitative magnitude of the results from this model
setting. But, qualitatively, the results illustrate the possibility that nominal exchange rate
movements help compensate for differences in nominal rigidities across countries.


As in the previous set of results, U.K. interest-rate variability does decline when there is
monetary union. Thus embrace of monetary union appears to confer on the United
Kingdom more stable interest rates, but these are accompanied by a rule that is directed at
aggregates of which U.K. variables make up only a modest portion. Furthermore, the
mismatch of contract durations across economies means that rules that are successful at
stabilizing euro area inflation are less effective at stabilizing U.K. fluctuations. The net
outcome is greater U.K. macroeconomic instability.

Monetary policy is less volatile in the sense that interest rate volatility declines when the
United Kingdom joins the union; it gives up a domestic policy rule that was associated
with less smooth interest rate behavior. But inflation outcomes become more volatile for
the U.K. economy. What appears to be happening is that the less volatile rate behavior is
destabilizing for U.K. inflation because of the major mismatch in nominal rigidity; i.e.,
the interest rate should be more volatile, or should be responding in a different way to
shocks than what is implied by the euro rule, if the objective is to insulate the U.K.



———————————————————————————————————
20
  Equally, we found that making the discrepancy in nominal rigidity across the two economies larger than
that used in Figure 2 worsens the variability of U.K. inflation.


                                                   23
economy from the effects of nominal rigidity.21 The damage done by the imposition of
the euro area rule overwhelms one beneficial effect on inflation variability arising from
euro area wage patterns. This beneficial effect is that the relatively greater euro area
wage stickiness by itself should be helpful for U.K. inflation stabilization by stabilizing
U.K. import price inflation. This partial effect seems to dominate when the difference in
wage stickiness across economies is a little less than what we are using in the table.

C. Intermediate goods predominant

We revert our settings of wage rigidity to the estimates in Table 1 in order to consider a
third model variant. Wilson (1976) and Allsopp, Kara, and Nelson (2006) argue that, for
U.K. inflation analysis, it is appropriate to model all imports as intermediate goods. With
this formulation, imports enter the model alongside labor in the production process to
yield final consumption goods. We consider a parameterization of the EGL model that
allows for this view of imports’ role to predominate. In the baseline parameterization,
100% of imports were final consumer goods; now, by contrast, 90% of imports are
assumed to be intermediate goods and only 10% to be final goods.22 We repeat the policy
experiments with this alternative setting of the model in the final segment of Table 2.
Monetary union appears to worsen inflation performance somewhat—even when UIP
shocks are absent—and to reduce the variability of the output gap and the interest rate.
When imports are primarily intermediates, exchange rate variations have a less automatic
connection to CPI variations; the fraction of the CPI that is flexible and linked tightly to
the exchange rate is small. Under these conditions, extinguishing exchange rate
variations is less likely to deliver improved inflation performance, if this also entails
giving up the ability to manipulate domestic interest rates.




———————————————————————————————————
21
   Output gap variability falls under union. In a closed-economy sticky-price model with no Phillips curve
shocks and no indexation, this reduction would by itself imply that policymakers had succeeded in
removing the effects of nominal rigidity; it would necessarily be associated also with lower inflation
variability. But this implication does not carry over to the present model. Because there are several
sources of nominal rigidity in the open-economy model we use, as well as Phillips curve shocks, the
stability of the U.K. output gap is not a reliable index (as it is in a sticky-price closed-economy model) of
the effects of nominal rigidity, so CPI inflation is destabilized by the euro rule despite the accompanying
improved stability of the gap.
22
   The intermediate technology is that in EGL (2007), including a 1/3 weight on imports.


                                                     24
6. Conclusions

We have considered euro area membership as a U.K. monetary policy option by studying
the effect of monetary union under various parameterizations of the Erceg, Gust, and
López-Salido (2007) model. One issue in determining whether monetary union
contributes to an improvement in U.K. macroeconomic stabilization is the status of the
“UIP,” or foreign exchange risk-premium, shock. Much hangs on whether the
elimination of the sterling/euro exchange market will be associated with the suppression
of UIP shocks, which have been thought to be a major source of exchange rate variation.
Suppose these shocks stand in for pressures that the economy needs to adjust to whether
it is part of a monetary union or not. Then if the United Kingdom joined the euro area,
UIP shocks, instead of vanishing, would continue to make themselves felt via different
channels. Our results suggest that monetary union may increase inflation variability if
UIP shocks do not disappear at the inception of monetary union. This effect is detectable
even though, according to our estimates, UIP shocks are actually only a modest inherent
source of exchange rate variation.


We also affirmed that if the differences in the degree of nominal wage rigidity across the
United Kingdom and the euro area are sufficiently large, U.K. inflation variability under
monetary union is higher than that achievable under monetary policy autonomy. Finally,
we found that the improvement in U.K. economic stability under monetary union also
diminishes if imports from the euro area are modeled as primarily intermediates instead
of finished goods.

Appendix. The Erceg, Gust, and López-Salido (EGL) model setup

The EGL (2007) setup, as applied here, consists of 25 equations determining the
following 25 endogenous variables (with real variables in log-deviation form):

        [c   t
                     j         j       j       j   j    j       j       j         j     j     j
                                                                                                            ]
                         , y t , l t , c D ,t , mC ,t , π t , π C ,t , π w,t , p CD ,t , ζ t , Rt , ρ t ,τ t , s t , j=U.K., EA,


where EA denotes “euro area.”


The consumption bundles in each economy consist of the aggregates:

             j
                           (               )
        ct = 1 − ω j cD ,t + ω j mC ,t , j=U.K., EA,
                                               j        j




where c is total consumption, cD is consumption of domestically produced output, and mC
denotes imported consumption goods. The two-economy structure implies that ωU.K. =
υωEA.


Production functions take the form:

        yt = zt + lt , j=U.K., EA,
                 j                 j       j




so that output (expressed as a log-deviation from its steady state value) is equal to the
sum of the technology shock, z, and log labor input, l.

where πw is nominal wage inflation, (ζ − pCD ) is the log real wage in consumption units
(i.e., the log real wage in output units, ζ, adjusted for the log aggregate relative price of
consumer goods in terms of output, pCD); μw is a wage markup shock. The parameters θw
(common across economies) and ξw (different across economies) respectively denote the
steady-state wage markup and an index of the degree to which households are not given
clearance to reoptimize nominal wages.

Price inflation is driven by the Phillips curve:
