                      Utilitarianism and Horizontal Equity:
                          The Case for Random Taxation



                                    ABSTRACT



     This paper establishes that, far from being able to derive the principle

of horizontal equity from utilitarianism, the principle is actually in-

consistent with utilitarianism in a variety of circumstances. We derive

conditions under which (a) it is optimal to impose random tax schedules

(ex post randomization); and (b) it is optimal to randomize the tax schedules

imposed on a set of otherwise identical individuals (ex ante randomization).

The implications for optimal tax theory are discussed. More generally,

it is shown that there are a number of potentially important economic

situations with which the principle of horizontal equity may be incon-

sistent not only with utilitarianism but even with Pareto optimality.

1. ntroduct ion

     The    concept   of horizontal equity has long had a special place

in public finance. In particular, the iiposition of a'ndo Lax

would generally be viewed to be unfair. Most econonists

would say that such a tax is "hoizontaily inequitable. More

sophisticated    econornistc night distinguish between cx ante horlzontal
equity and cx post horizontal equity: if the tax were acplied in      a

truly random way, then cx ante it would be horizontally equitable;
individuals with identical utility functions and endowments would have
identical   ex ante expected utility, since they all face equal chances;

x post, it would be horzontally inequitable since individuals with the

same endowments and tastes may have very different values of realized

utility. But most economists would dgrcc with Musgrave (1976) that

it is ex post horizontal equity    in   which we are interested. (These

arguments cannct be pushed oo far: the draft lottery can be thought

of as a random tax applied to a particular subgroup of the population,

and it did receive widespread —— though far from universal ——     acceptance.)
       Indeed, so basic is the notion of horizontal equity that It is

incorporated in the Constitution (jf the United States in the 3tequal

protection clause.T' The government may not treat. differently individuals

who are, for the purposes at hand, otherwise identical.

       Horizontal equity is usually presented ac a principle in its

own right. It is not derived from other principles. Nor is there

any discussicn of the relationship of this principle with other

principles. For instance, is it ever inconsistent with Pareto optimality?

If it is, does one of the principles have priority over the other?

       In recent years there has developed a large literature on optimal

tax structures, using a utilitarian (or more general, social welfare)

criterion.' This approach provides a simple and useful framework

within which altnrriativ structures can be evaluated. Most of this

literature has, however, ignored the question of horizontal equity.2

The question naturally arises, can the principles of horizontal equity

be derived from a utilitarian (or more gei.ieral social welfare) criterion?



    See for instance, Ramsey (1927), Diamond and Mirrlees (1971), Stiglitz
    and Dasgupta (1971), Atkinson and Stiglitz (1972), and Nirrices (1971).

        The object of this paper is to show that it cannot) Indeed,

we establish that the principle of horizontal equity may be inconsistent

with utilitarianism. That is, social welfare (as measured by the sum

of utilities) is higher if individuals who have the same tastes and

the same endowments are treated differently.2 Even more strongly, we show

that horizontal equity may be inconsistent with the principle of

Pareto opt imality.

       Most of our analysis is focused on the desirability of random

taxation.    We show that random taxation may lead to a Pareto improvement.

The implications of our analysis extend, however, to a wide variety of

social decisions. Thus, in Section 6 we present several other contexts

in which horizontal equity is either inconsistent with social welfare

maximization (utilitarianism) or with Pareto optimality; and In Section 9,

we discuss briefly the implications of our results for earlier analyses

of optimal tax structures.

       Our analysis also has implications for pricing policies of

monopolists: in Section 8 we show that it may be desirable for

regulated and unregulated monopolists to randomize prices.



    At least from the form of utilitarianism represented in the optimal
    tax literature, See below, Section 9.

    The same results may be obtained wltn other social welfare functions
    as well.

    That horizontal equity may not he consistent with Pareto optimality
    is perhaps not as surprising as it first sounds — the familiar story
    of the two shipwrecked sailors with only enough food for one (so horizontal
    equIty entaIls both dying) at least shows the possibility of a contra-
    diction. We are suggesting that conflict among these principles is more
    common than such exanpies may suggest.

      We conclude with some speculative remarks about the implications

of our results for the role of the concept of horizontal equity in the

analysis of questions of public policy.


2. Utilitarianism and Horizontal Equicy: The Conventional View

      The intuitive derivation of the principle of horizontal equity

from utilitarianism is a special application of Lerner's (1944) argument for

progressive taxation. Assume two individuals 'A' and "B" have identical

incomes and utility functions


           UA(cA)     uB(cB) i cA

where C is the i—th individual's consumption:


           Ci =Yi —i

where       is his income and T is his tax payment. Thus, if we

maximize social welfare


           max {13A(VA      TA) + HB(yB -   TB)}
         {TA,TB}


subject to the revenue constraint

equal taxes paid by identical individuals. Concavity (in this case of

the utility function) implies equality and, as most readers of Samuelson's

           With a concave utility function and lump sum taxation, individuals

      with same Y should face the same taxes.
                                       —5—



Foundations will attest, every well behaved problem is concave. The

modern corollary of Marshall's dictum that nature abhors discontinuities

is that nature abhors non—concavities, and it is this, I suspect, that

provides the intuitive rationale for the widespread belief in equality

and   the   belief that the belief in equality can be justified by
                   1
utilitarianism.

      It is my belief, on the contrary, that a variety of problems of

economic irterest exhibit non—concavities of the sort that imply that

social welfare maximization may require unequal treatment of equals.

Such is the case of indirect taxation to which we now turn.

      We consider two versions of the problem of random taxation. In

the first, the individual knows his tax rate before he decides on

his labor inputs, in the second, he is only told his tax rate after

he has supplied his labor (although he knows the probability dis-

tribution of tax rates before he decides on his labor supply.) In

both cases, randomization may be desirable, although the conditions

under which it will be desirable differ in the two cases. In both

cases, we focus on the desirability of a small degree of randomization;

that is, we provide conditions in which a slight randomization in

the tax rate would lead to Pareto improvement (in terms of cx ante

expected utility); it should be noted that there may be cases where


1   Since, as we shall show, this belief is not correct, one can only
    surmise why someone might have come to such a belief. Talks with
    economists a a large number of institution3 lead ma to believe
    that some argument, such as that given here, though usually slightly less
    formally presented, lies behind their conclusion.
                                            —6—




a slight randomization would not be desirable, but a "large" randomi-

zation would. Thus, the case for randomization of taxes is ronger

than that presented here.


3. Randomization of Taxes Prior to Labor Decision

 3.1 The Model

        In this and the next section we consider the simplest possible

model of indirect taxation: there is a single good (C) and lhor

 (L). We assume that in the absence of taxation, the wage is unity

and the price of output is unity (this is just a normalization)

and that output is proportional to labor input. Let T be the tax

rate and p the (after tax) price of consumption goods (relative to

labor numeraire). Then1


(3.1)       p = 1      T



We write the indirect utility function


(3.2)       V V(p,I)           max U(C,L)
                               s.t. pC < L + I


There is no lump sum taxation, and no profits, so income apart from

that generated by work is zero;2 hence I          0. Wa can easily derive

the individual's consumption function, using Roy's identity,

            C =   C(p,I)   =   — V(p,I)/V1(p,I)

    For simplicity, we assume that the price of tput remains unchanged
    throughout the analysis (the production technology 'is 1.Lnear.) The
    results are, however, more general.
2
    The result extends to the case where there is lump sum taxatioii but
    distortlonary taxation is also employed. Thus, the results may be
    extended in a straightforward way to linear income tax schedules,
    See below, Section 5.
                                                    —7 -




        Assume, for simplicity, there are two identical individuals. We

wish to maximize social welfare by choosing a pobability distribu4op,

of tax rates on consumption.. We focus on the simplest case where

one individual will face a low tax rate and the other individual will

face a high tax rate. We randomize the taxes, so each individual has

exactly an equal chance of facing the high tax rate                   (A — 1)     and

the low tax rate (B —               1).       Thus, his expected utility can be

written    as
                         A                B
(3.3)           w =   V(p ,O)   +   V(p,O)


Since the two individuals are identical, maximizing ex ante expected

utility is equivalent to maximizing social welfare using any individualistic

social welfare criterion. Moreover, if we use a utilitarian criterion,

maximizing ex ante expected utility is equivalent to maximizing the

sum of (ex post) utilities, i.e.


                vA(pA0) + VB(PB           ,O)



where superscripts A and B refer to the different individuals.

        In either interpretation, we need to maximize W subject to                      the

constraint that the government raise the requisite revenue:


                (A - 1) cA(pA,o) + (B - 1) cB(pB,o) >               R.

      (a) At T =       0,    randomization is never desirable.

      (b) At the maximum feasible revenue,

is    desirable.

3.4 Intuitive Interpretation in Terms               of    Excess Burden

        The basic intuition behind our argument can be seen as follows.

In Figure 3.2a we have plotted the excess burden (EB) (deadweight loss) imposed on an

individual as a function of the revenue raised from him.                     Clearly, if
the curve is concave at the required revenue, R, it pays to introduce

some randomizaticn, for then average excess burden will be reduced.                        Thus
a sufficient condition for random taxation to be desirable is that
                                          —13—



            din EB = d in EB /d in R
            dlnR dlnT/ dinT

                         (EB,T/l +
                    =                                 < 1,



where


             EB,T =
                        dinEB     the elasticity Oi excess burden with respect
                        d in T
                                   to the tax rate.


This can be rewritten equivalently as

                          T   d in c
            EB T —i
                          p   dlnp

As igure 3.2b illustrates, the percentage incrent in excess burden from

an increase in the tax rate will be small if the consumption demand

curve is convex.

        These conditions can perhaps be interpreted more easily in terms

of a tax on labor. Let t be the tax on labor, and            L be labor supply.

Then, we obtain as before that randomization is desirable if


             dlnEB=dlnEB
             dlnR dint / /dlnR
                          dint <

Thus some randomization is desirable if

 the elasticity of the excess burden with respect to the tax rate

 is less than one plus the elasticity of the labor supply with respect

 to the tax rate.

       Notice that it is the uncompensated elasticities which are relevant

here, for it is the uncompensated elasticities which are critical in

determining the shape of the revenue function.


 3.5 An Alternative Interpretajon

       There   is an alternative interpretation that will prove useful
in some of the subsequent discussion. In Figure 3.3 we have depicted
the relationship between the revenue raised from an individual       (by
means of a proportional consumption tax) and the utility he attains.
(The curve     is   derived from plotting, in the lower right hand quadrant,
the   relationship between the revenue raised and the tax rate, and in

upper left hand quadrant, the relationship between the utility attained

and   the tax rate.) This utility—revenue curve      may not be concave;

clearly, if it is not, we can increase average utility by concavifying

the   curve (as in the diagran).       To collect the average revenue R, it is
optimal to collect the revenue            from some individuals and the

revenue R2 from others.

3.6    The Optimal Randomization Scheme

       So   far, we have established   that some randomization is preferable

to   no randomization. e now analyze the optimal random tax structure.

Let F(r)       be the proportion f individais
                                             —15-




assigned a tax   rate   less than or equal tO           T • Then we seek that F(T)

function which


(3.15)      maximizes f V(1 + T,O)dF(T)


s.t.

(3.16a)      ITC(l + T,O)dF(T) >R
(3.16b)     fdF(T)      1.
                                                           the constraints,
Letting p and y be the Lagrange multiplier associated with
we obtain




             V(1 + T,O) + pTC(l + 'r,O)             y    for all T    with   positive density
(i.17)


             V(1 + T,O) + pTC(l + T,O) <            y    otherwise.



We now prove there exists an optal probability distributiofl of positive

density atatmostW9 points.
                                                               <                     <
       Assume not. There are then at least three tax rates, T1

                                               1, yielding revenues (per capita)
with   relative frequency      Tt.,   Thr.

                                                          < R <       and yielding utility
of R., for an average revenue R, with

                      average utility level V, V1 > V > V3.
                                                                         From (3.17),
levels V.,     with
V. is a linear function of R. Hence the same level of expected utility

 could be attained simply by randomizing among T1

                     R3-R

3.7 Randomization of Optimal Linear Income Taxes

       In the simple model we have developed here, with identical

individuals, there is no real reason to impose a distortionary tax:

a uniform lump sum tax would clearly be preferable. It is only because

individuals differ, say, in their abilities, but these differences are

not directly observable, that we need to resort to distortionary taxation.

(See Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976, 1980).) Our analysis can be easily

extended to show that the optimal linear tax structure involves randomization

of the marginal tax rate on consumption.

       To see this, assume we have a distribution of individuals by ability

(before tax real wage) given by G(w)) With a linear tax structure, the

individual's budget constraint is given by


               C1+(l—t)wL

where I is the lump sum payment to each individual and t is the

marginal tax rate. The individual's utility is represented by his

indirect utility function, now written as a function of the after tax

wage rate and the lump sum payment,


                =   (w(1   —
                               t),I)
Assume   the   government can impose different marginal tax rates randomly;

as before, half the population faces a rate of tA, half a rate of tB.

The government wishes to

     The analysis proceeds exactly as before. We take (for the moment)

I to be fixed. Then     tA =          is   always a critical point, but it may

be a local minimum rather than a local maximum. We can derive expressions

sufficient conditions for randomization.

     There is one problem with the implementation of the kind of random

tax scheme we have described in this section.

Since whether the individual will be faced with a low or a high

tax rate is an insurable risk with no moral hazard associated with it,

clearly individuals would be willing to purchase insurance to reduce this

risk. If perfect insurance were purchased, the individual's behavior

would be identical to that with no randomization, and obviously then

randomization would have no effect. Thus, it is apparent tha social

optimality   requires, in this case, restrictions on the set of insurance

markets which are allowed to operate)



4. Randomization of Taxes After Labor Decision

     The reason that random taxation was desirable in the previous

section was, roughly, that the amount of revenue raised increased more

than proportionately to the tax because of the differences in response

of labor supply to different after tax wages. Thus, the average tax

rate could be reduced by having some individuals face a high tax

rate and some a low rate.

     In this section, we consider the case where the individual must

decide on his labor input prior to knowing the tax. If the individual

is risk averse, he will "plan" on facing a high tax rate, and hence each

individual will reduce his labor suppiy by less than he otherwise

would; this enables the average tax rate to be reduced. Individuals are




 There may be no scope for insurance of the conventional kind (the
 individual pays so much to the insurance company if his tax rate is low,
 receiving some fixed amount if his tax rate is high). Whether such
 policies are desirable, and the nature of these policies, depends on
 the value of V1. If V1 0, as it may (the marginal utility of income
 does not depend on the real wage), then there is no scope for such insurance
 contracts. If V < 0, then the insurance contract actually leads the
indIvidual with the higher tax rate to pay money to the individual with
the lower tax rate. With normal demand curves, this would decrease the
desirability of randomizaton of a consumption tax, since it will redistribute
consumptiou away frL.m highly taxed indijidu.als. The inaurancconjracts
may make randomization undesirable, and ttie government may need to
intervene to restrict such insurance markets.

worse off because they face the risk arising from the random tax.

They are better off because they face a lower average tax rate. We

shall show that this second effect can dominate the first; randomization

may increase everyone's ex ante expected utility.

        It is more convenient in this section to take th2 tax as

one on labor; the individual is assumed to face the tax rate t + A

with probability .5, and                t     A with probability .5, where A > 0.

Now, we take the price of output as our numeraire (p =                          1).   The

individual chooses L to


             maximize
                         U((ci + —            t)L,L)         U((u —   A-   t)L,L)     w

where    w is the real wage rate. The revenue constraint is now


(4.2)             tL = R.


Since individuals are all identical, maximizing the individual's

expected utility is equivalent (as before) to maximizing social welfare.

Hence, as Figure 4.1 illustrates randomization is desirable if

The reduction in the tax rate depends on three factors:

         (a) The responsiveness of labor supply to risk. Variability

in after tac wages increases or decreases labor supply (Rothschild—

Stiglitz (1971)),depending on the concavity or convexity of the

first order condition (U1w + U2 = 0) in terms of the wage                  w.

(The change in the after tax wage is a mean—preserving spread in

the wage distribution.) Clearly, a necessary condition for the

desirability of randomization is that risk increases labor supply

(a2L/A >       0).       (Later we provide conditions ensuring that this will occur.)


         (b) The responsiveness of labor supply to taxes. The more

that an increase in taxes reduces labor supply, the greater the return

from being able to reduce the (average) tax rate, and thus the more

likely that randomization will be desirable.

         (c) The size of the required tax revenues R. When t = 0,
 2
     =   0;   hence for sufficiently small         tax   revenues randomization is
never desirable.

       To see the effect of large revenues, we cbserve that the

 denominator of (4.6) can be rewritten as

                 Lt         1 dtLl dR

 (.)       1
                +tL_        L   dt       L        dt


The value of t which maximizes revenues without randomization is




                          l/
denoted by t*, and the corresponding value of R by R*. Thus,


 (4.8) t              =              =   1/elasticity         of labor supply.


The maximal tax rate ia the inverse of labor supply elasticity.

     Thus, if risk increases the labor supply and if there exists a

maximal revenue without randomization of R*, for sufficiently high

revenues, randomization is desirable, since



                            as t-t.
     'dA
               IA=O



     Indeed, for sufficiently large government expenditures, the only

ising the requisite revenue may be to randomize. For, if
at t*, randomization increases labor supply, clearly government

revenue will be raised.


4.1 Derivation of Sufficient Conditions for Randomization in Terms of
     Utility Functions

     To see more generally the conditions under which randomization is

desirable, we need to express d2t/dA2 in terms of the utility function.

Straightforward dif:erentiating of the first order conditions yields

      Substituting     (4.9) and (4.10) into (4.6) and that into (4.4), we

obtain

The denominator of (4.9)—(4.11) is unambiguously negative (provided that
                                                            revenue). Hence a sufficient

can be positive, but it can be very large, in which case randomization
will be desirable (for t large enough).

 A is the elasticity of                           ,   the      individualTs risk aversion.

 Substituting into (4.9) and (4.10) we obtain


             —         L            =         P                 L
 (4.14)                                                                 (-A + 1 - p)

                       (w— t)(p+)

       Thus, randomization leads to increased labor supply if



             A > 1—                 p




and increased taxation reduces the labor supply if



             p < 1.


       Substituting (4.14) nd (4.15) into (4.6) we observe that

(4.16)                          >   o as

Thus, with separability, if there is rapidly decreasing relative risk

aversion (A is very large), andomizatjon becomes desirable even at low
tax rates.

    These results, like those of the preceding section, may seem

rather counterintuitive: after all, one is imposing more risk on the

individual. Yet, remarkably enough, the condition we      have   derived

(in the simple case of separable utility functions) suggests that

randomization may be attractive even with high risk aversion.

     There are two effects of randomization. First, it imposes a risk

on individuals. By the usual kinds of arguments, the welfare loss

can be sho to be of the order of (for small risks)        pA2/2. At the

same time, it affects labor supply; the change in aggregate labor

supply affects the (average) tax rate; changing the average tax rate

changes the deadweight loss associated with the tax. The deadweight

loss is approximately



                 -
                 —            — ______
                              —

                          2          —

                                            2



Thus, the deadweight loss is inversely related (for constant elasticity

supply functions of labor) to the aggregate labor supply.        If aggregate

supply increases when we randomize, i.e. if — > 0 is sufficiently

large, then the effect of the benefit from reduction in the average tax

rate is greater than the lOSS from the induced risk.

     One interpretation of the kind of random taxation we have discussed

in this section is the random enforcement of taxes. (Fixed costs of

auditing increase the desirability of random audits.) This inter-

pretation has been discussed at greater length by Weiss (1976)




5. The Randomization of the Optimal Tax and Optimal Randomization

     In the preceding two sections we established the desirability of

randomization for linear tax structures. In this section, we ask, what

can we say about optimal randomization of linear tax structures, on the

one hand, and the randomization of optimal non—linear tax structures,

on the other.


5.1 Optimal Ex Post Randomization

     In Section 3.6        ,   we established that the optimal ex ante randomization

(i.e. randomization before the individual has decided on his level of effort)

required only two tax rates.1          Here, we show that ex post randomization

entails O1'7    three   tax rates.

     Formally,   the government wishes to find a probability distribution of
tax rate represented by F(t), which maximizes         individuals' expected utility

subject   to the government's budget constraint, i.e.

A necessary condition for this is that we maximize expected utility,

for optimal L, we have


(5.3)     f[U1(w —      t)   + TJ2I dF(t) = 0.


Letting p be the Lagrange multiplier associated with the revenue

constraint (5.2a), y be the Lagrange multiplier associated with the

constraint (5.2b), and i              be the Lagrange multiplier associated with the

constraint (5.3), then

5.2 Ex Post and Ex Ante Randomization

     In the two preceding sections, we analyzed separately ex post and

ex ante randomization. In fact, the optimal tax           structure   may entail

both simultaneously; that is, individuals are told, before they decide

on the level of effort, that they will face one of two          random   tax

lotteries, one yielding, say, tA —             with   probability        and t +
with probability 1 -        A,   the other yielding            with probability

    and tB +          with probability 1 —            Given that ex post randomization

is desirable, the desirability of ex ante randomization may be analyzed

exactly as before, but now, for each avera level of tax, we calculate

the optimal random distribution and the associate level o expected

utility and average revenue.


5.3 Randomization withplTaxes
     This paper has focused on the desirability of randomization when

the government is restricted to employing linear taxes. The question

naturally arises, is randomization desirable if this restriction is

removed? Does randomization, for Instance, arise simply because of the

second best nature of the problem?
                                        —28—



       On the contrary, it turns out that Pareto efficient taxation, with

individuals differing say by ability as in the model of Section 3.7

entails randomization under much weaker conditions than those derived

in the preceding two sections. The use of randomization enables the

government to distinguish between high and low ability individuals, at

a lower cost (in terms of the distortions imposed). The analysis of

this problem involves rather different techniques than those employed

here, and hence is taken up elsewhere. (See Stiglitz (1981).)l

       There have been several other contexts in which utilitarianism

implies horzontal inequity:
                                                 Mirrlees (1975) and Stiglitz
        (a) The efficiency wage hypothesiS

(1976b) have analyzed the optimal distribution of income in a family

he receivas (the amount of food he consumes), as in Figure 6.1.

        A(w) gives the number of efficiency uns supplied by an individual

 receiving a wage U     Optimality   in general entails some individuals

receiving a low wage, some a high wage. Indeed, introducing
                                                                 inequality
may be ex post Pareto optimal. When everyone receives the same wage,

 they are all unproductive, and output is low. Giving a few

individuals a lot more enables them to work so hard that not only

do they produce enough to provide the extra food that they consum.,

but they have some left over to give to the remaining low wage

individuals.

        (b) The optimal town: Mirrlees (1972) has shown that in the optimal

town the utilitarian solution entails inequality: individuals who
are randomly assigned to live further from the center enjoy more
land and have a higher level of utility. By crowding individuals

near the center, the transport costs of all those further out are

reduced, and this gain in efficiency more than offsets the inequality

generated thereby.

        (c) Fixed training costs:1 Assume everyone is ex ante the

same,   and there are two types of jobs to be performed. One requires
training   costs T (denominated in say the labor numeraire). Thus, some

individuals are (randomly) assigned to the high training cost industry,

others to the low training cost industry. It can be shown that those individuals

who are (randomly) assigned to the industry requiring training will,

in the utilitarian optimum, work harder and have a lower level of utility.

By making these individuals work harder, expenditures on training

costs are reduced; in effect, net national product can be increased,

at the cost of some increase in inequality. Unless society has infinite

inequality   averin (using the   Atkinson .neasurc o lnequ1lty),   it always
pays to introduce some inequality.

 This problem was discussed in Stiglitz (1973).        ornia1 derivation
 of this result is contained in Stiglitz (l976a)
                                       —30—




     These examples have one feature in common: they lack, in one

way or another, the concavity property which is required for utili-

tarianism to imply horizontal equity. In the first ("efficiency wage")

problem, inequality in income raises net national product by increasing

average productivity; in the third (training cost) probleffi, inequality
                                                    raises net national

                                                             land raise

net national product by   reducing   total expenditure on transport costs.

     In some situations, lifetime equality may be attained, even though

there is, at any moment, inequality. Thus, in the optimal town problem,

if it were costless to move individuals, we could rotate individuals

among plots of land so lifetime utilities were identical. But this

is not possible for the training cost problem. In the optimal tax problem,

if individuals can save, then again randomization may       entail   lifetime inequality.

      In all of the situations examined, randomization is Pareto optimal:

ex ante expected utility is maximized by this kind of inequality.




7.   Markets   and Inequality
                                                        such as those discussed
      It is thus not surprising that in situations
                                                    there will be a tendency
in this paper but arising in market contexts,

for the market to introduce randomization.
                                                  For instance, consider the

                                              costs. The efficient way for the
problem of financing specific training

 firm to recover those training costs is to impose, in effect, a lump sum
                                         be desirable; if individuals do not
 tax on all workers, but this may not
know their ability prior to training, they would piefer an "income tax,"

i.e. a piece rate less than the value added.1 Assume for administra-

tive reasons that the piece rate cannot be made a function of the number

of items produced (i.e. we must have a linear income tax.)2 Then

equilibrium may entail a random piece rate. Perhaps this provides

part of the explanation of random promotion policies (equivalent to

random wages) used by some universities.

       Note that so long as individuals have a free choice of occupations,

the wage contract must entail individuals who are ex ante identical

receiving the same level of expected utility.

       (Similarly, a developer developing a new residential town and selling

off the plots of land, could he better off (i.e. increase his profits)

by having a fixed fee for a plot, having the plots of different sizes,

and randomly assigning individuals to a plot.)

       In the kind of situations we have depicted, the market allocation

may not be Pareto efficient for two reasons. First, it may be difficult

to enforce random contracts; in the example described earlier, with fixed

training   costs, the worker who receives training works harder, but receives
the same   wage, as the one who does not receive training. In such a situation,

there is obviously an incentive for some other firm to bid the worker away.

If it is not possible to restrict labor mobility, then the market equilibrium




    The parallel between "income taxes" and "piece rates" is discussed at
    greater length in Stiglitz (1975).

    This assumption *3 not essential, it is made only to convert the problem

    More generally, £t would appear chat even if non—linear piece rates were
    admissible, raneomization may be desirable, but we have not analyzed the
    conditions under which this will be true.
                                       —L




will   require that all (ex ante identical) individuals receive the same

level of utility (ex post); the market, in these situations, entails

excessive egalitarianism.

       Second,   in the training cost problem presently under consideration,

the optimal resource allocation requires, in effect, subsidies from the

trained workers to the untrained, or conversely.    As we noted earlier,

if there were a single government—controlled firm, it would pay equal

wages to all workers, but randomly assign some workers to the plant not

requiring training and some to the plant requiring training. It would

require that the latter workers work harder (longer). Although the workers

so assigned might well complain, the cx ante expected utility of all workers

is maximized by this randomization. But the utilitarian allocation is not, in

general, viable under competition. For in general, the revenues

raised from the sale of one commodity will not be equal to the

expenditures on wages plus training costs: there will be a subsidy

in one direction or the other. It is obvious, then, that the equili-

brium cannot be sustained by a laissez—faire competitive equilibrium.1


8. Random Pricing by Regulated and Non—Regulated Monopolies

       It is by now well recognized that there is a close relationship

between the analysis of optimal tax structures (Ramsey and his

descendants) and the analysis of optimal pricing of public utilities

(Boiteux and his descendants). Thus, our remarks about the desirability

of random taxes apply directly to the problem of pricing of regulated

utilities.



1
    For proof, see Stigiicz (1976a).
                                          -33..




         But our analysis also shows that there are conditions under which

    an unregulated monopolist may find randomization desirable. We noted

    earlier, for instance, that the maximiztion of government revenue may

    entail randomization of prices (tax rates). Thus, if production were

    controlled by a single monopolist, he would, in these circumstances,

randomize his prices.

        Similarly, the optimal entry deterring strategy for a monopolisc
                                      1
may entail randomizing its prices.

         Consider a monopolistic firm wishing to maximize its revenue;

    assume it has a long term contract with its customers; the contract

    specifies the "price distribution" which it will charge (the commodity

    is assumed not to be storable).   The customer has a reservation

    expected utility level, i.e. at any contract yielding a lower level of

expected utility, he purchases a substitute for the given commodity.2

        Then the problem of the monopolist is maximizing revenue subject

    to this expected utility constraint as opposed to our problem,

maximizing expected utility, subject to a revenue constraint. Formally

    the two problems are simply dual to each other. Thus under perfectly

analogous conditions to those presented here, the monopolist will find

it desirable to randomize his prices.

9. Implications of our Analysis for the Theory_ps Optimal Taxation

      and the Usefulness of the Concept of Horizontal Equity

      Most of the literature in the theory of optimal taxation (surveyed

in Atkinson and Stiglitz (1980)) has focused on characterizing first

order conditions for the maximization of social welfare. Our analysis

has made it clear that this may be insufficient: under not unreasonable

circumstances these may characterize a local minimum rather than a

maximum.

       Although we have formulated the problem in terms of two absolutely identical

individuals, the issues we have raised arose, in slightly disguised form,

in the standard opta1 tax problem. Consider, for instance, two

individuals one of wh2m.likes brown ice cream (but obtains zero

utility from white), the other of whom likes white ice cream. Assume

they have identical demand functions. Assume moreover that the costs

of production of white and brown ice creams are identical. Thus, if

 T     is the tax rate on brown ice cream, T         that on white ice
  b
cream, then in the conventional optimal tax problem, there may be three

critical points, at     Tb =   T   ,   at Tb > T •   and at T b< T i.    One


might well consider solutions with Tb T horizontally inequitable,
but such a solution may be a local utilitarian maximum.         The optimal

tax structure is, in any reasonable sense, horizontally inequitable.

       Many economists would, accordingly, reject the asymmetric

solution in which the two colors of ice cream are treated differently.

Presumably, a true beliaver in utilitarianism would not.

       But let us now assume that there are, within the population, two

groups of indiiduals distinguished, say, only by hair color. Recall

that we showed earlier then there were two alternative interpretations
                                      —35—




of our results. We focused on the situation where we treated all

individuals ex ante identically, and thus randomization was (cx ante)

Pareto optimal; but even if type A individuals always were taxed at

a higher rate, and type B individuals always were taxed at a lower

rate, social welfare (using the utilitarian ctiterion) was increased

as a result of taxing them at different rates. A strict utilitarian

would thus have no way of choosing between a tax system which randomized

taxes (resulting in identical ex ante expected utility) and one which

always taxed light haired individuals at a lower rate than dark haired

individuals; moreover, under the conditions provided in the earlier

analysis, he would argue that a tax system which differentiated

between light haired and dark haired individuals is preferable to

one which did not.

     Is there a difference between the analysis of the tax treatment

of "brown" and "white" ice cream lovers, and the fair haired and dark

haired individuals with identical labor supply functions? The question,

seeiAngly, hinges on what are admissible distinctions. But there is,

within the utilitarian framework as it has customarily been applied

to the analysis of tax structures, no way of determining what are

and are not admissible distinctions. If hair color or sex is not

admissible, why should a seemingly equally capricious aspect of an

individual, the color which he likes his ice cream, be the basis of

differentiation? If the preferred color is not an admissible basis,

should the preferred flavor ——   chocolate   versus vanilla —— be admissible?

And if the choice among ice creams is not admissible, should the

choice between ice cream and cheese be an admissible1 basis, or the

 for differentiation.
                                       —36—




choice between goods and leisure? These issues have always been lurking

quietly in the background in the analytical discussions of the structure

of taxation; the point of the simple models presented in the first

two sections of the paper is to examine a context in which they cannot

be avoided, to present them in as pristine a form as possible.

     There are, at this juncture, three approaches that can be taken.

     (1) One   can   argue that any distinction is admissible; disriminatiofl

may well be optimal.

     (2) Alternatively, one can define a set of admissible distinctions.

This unfortunately removes one of the great advantages of the utilitarian

approach to the analysis of tax structures; it presumes the existence

of a prior principle for the determination of the set of admissible

bases of differentiation.     How are we to know, then, that this prior

principle should not, at the same time, be reflected in the design

of the tax structure itself?

     The same criticism can, of course, be levied against the principle

of horizontal equity itself. This is usually put as requiring that
                                                        ."     (Musgrave,
"people in equal positions should be treated equally. .
                                                    are chocolate and
1959). But what is meant by "equal positions":

vanilla ice cream lovers in equal positions?     Again, it would appear

                                           admissible distinctions; the
that the critical question is, what are

principle of horizontal equity seems to provide little guidance. As
                                               'equal positions' are defined
Rosen has pointed out (1978), "Customarily,

in terms of some observable index of ability to pay such as income,

expenditure, or wealth." But to choose say income or wealth as the

basis is virtually equivalent to defining
                                              income as tiiC   horizontal
equitable tox; differential coundity taxes are, by defintior1, then

horjzontallY inequitable.
                                    -.37—




     This approach attempts to define "equal positions" in terms of
some opportunity sets (income or wealth are used as surrogates for

"ability to pay.") In contrast, Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976) and

Feldstein (1976) have taken a "welfare approach": As Feldstein has

put it,

          "If two individuals would be equally well off
          (have the same utility level) in the absence
          of taxation, they should be equally well off
          if there is taxation.

          [Furthermore,] taxes should not alter the
          utility ordering."

     But this formulation too is not completely persuasive: first,

it requires a higher level of cardinality in the utility assessment

even than that required by the utilitarian approach. We must be able

to compare levels of utility as well as differences. Second,

let us consider what this definition implies for our chocolate—

vanilla ice cream example. If initially, the chocolate and vanilla

ice cream sell at the same price, then differential taxation is

horizontally inequitable. But now, assume that the cost of chocolate

is increased slightly. The chocolate lover is "disadvantaged." The

Feldstein formulation suggests not only that we could not use the tax

system to attempt to restore "equality" but that any taxes we impose

must result (if it is to be horizontally equitable) in chocolate

lovers being worse off than vanilla lovers. For example, assume that

the supply elasticity of chocolate is greater than that of vanilla.
                                     —38—




A uniform lump sum tax might therefore result, in the new general

equilibrium, in the price of chocolate being below that of vanilla.

In the Feldstein definition, the uniform lump sum tax (which, given

that all individuals have the same endowments, would in the conventional

formulation be horizontally equitable) is thus horizontally inequitable.

       In either formulation, virtually any tax system will have some

degree of horizontal inequity; one needs, then, to trade off horizontal

equity with other desiderata of a good tax system. One needs, then,

a Meta—principle for evaluating tax systems.1

       3) Finally, we can attempt to retain the utilitarian approach,

but argue that the particular formulation in the current optimal tax

literature is inadequate. The governments ——    the   individuals who are

in the possession of the power to exercise the power to tax ——    are

not likely to impose a truly random tax. The existence of differential

treatment means that there will be incentives to bribe (in one way

or another) those in the power to determine who is to be treated

favorably. It is this belief in the corruptability of power which

may have provided the motivation for the restriction on differential

treatment in the American constitution. These considerations are,

I think, relevant in assessing alternative tax codes, e.g. in the

desirability of taxing different commodities at the same or different

rates.



1
    There are ad hoc approaches defining an index of horizontal inequity
    and an index of vertical equity, and positing a social welfare function
    giving tradeoffs between the two. This seems close to assuming what
    is to be analyzed. The index used by King (1980) seems     open to
    the objections made above.
                                         —39—




      The dangers of differentiation lie not Only in the favorable

 treatment that may be —— and have been ——      obtained by special interest
 groups. Admitting the possibility that some commodity may be taxed

 at a higher rate opens up the possibility of using the tax system as

an instrument for the (possibly mistaken) public wrath against one

industry or another.

      Thus a utilitarian, assessing the advantages and disadvantages of

alternative tax systems, should take into account how such systems

would actually be implemented. It is within such a broader perspective

that some fonn of the principle of horizontal equity may well be consistent with
                  1
utilitarianism.


io. Rawis and Horizontal Equity

     Some readers have suggested that there is a close relationship

between the principle of horizontal equity and Rawis' principle of justice.

And just as Rawis argues that justice takes precedence over other social

principles, so too should horizontal equity. Thus, one should not trade—

of f horizontal equity with other social objectives.

     But our analysis has shown that each individual's expected utility

may be higher if he is confronted with a random tax structure. Thus,

behind the veil of ignorance, each would favor random taxation, if he

could be assured that the tax would be truly levied in a random way.




 If this view is correct, then the kind of analysis of horizontal
 equity contained in Feldstein, Rosen and King may not be focusing on
 the critical issues. Within a general equilibrium context, changes
 in taxes —- like changes in technology            affect different individuals
 very differently. Welfare rankings            if they could he defined ——
 may well be reversed. But there is notriing sacred about the pre-
 tax ranking. What we are concerned with is some notion of arbitrary
 distinctions.
                                           —40—


     But the individual may      not   believe that the tax would be levied in

a truly random way. Indeed, aware of the corruptability of government,

he might reason that if the Constitution allows differential taxation

(of commodities, individuals, etc.) then the political process will

result in some individual        being advantaged relative to others, Simply

because of their ability to exercise political power. Thus differentiation

would clearly violate the principle of justice. And because it may not be

possible to write the Constitution in such a way that it would allow just

differentiation, but that it     would not allow unjust differentiation, it

may be preferable simply    to   restrict the ability of the government to

impose differential taxation.'



11. Concluding Remarks

     This paper has established that, far from being able to derive

the principle of horizontal equity from utilitarianism, the principle

is actually inconsistent with utilitarianism in a variety of circumstances;

most notably, we have derived conditions under which random taxation is

optimal. Indeed, there are potentially important economic situations

where Pareto optimality and horizontal equity are inconsistent (in        both

an ex ante and ex post sense). Such inconsistencies force us to re-
evaluate our ethical principles: either utilitarianism or the principle




  This still leaves a number of questions unresolved: is non—differentiation
  consistent with all consumption being taxed at the same rate, or with
  all income being taxed at the same rate; the former is equivalent to a
  wage tax, and thus implies that interest is exempt from taxation, while
  the latter is equivalent to a tax on future consumption at a higher rate
  than on a tax on present consumption.
                                       —41—




of horizontal equity ——   at   least in the conventional forms —— must be

abandoned. We have suggested a more general utilitarian approach,

within which the two principles may be consistent, but which, at the

same time, casts considerable doubt on the optiniality of the kinds of

tax structures which have been derived within the conventional utilitarian

framework.

                                          APPENDIX B



Analysis of Ex Post Randomization

        The first order condition corresponding to the maximization

problem (4.1) is


                       + A— t)L,L]((Aj   + A —       t)      +     —   A   —   t)L,L1(w   — A   —   t)
(B.l)                                                2

                                                             +   = 0


Differentiating W with respect to A , we obtain


             dW    =
                              + A —   t)L,LJL            -       —A —      t)L,L]L        W dL
(B.2)        dA                                      2

                        U1 [(w + A— t)L,L]L + U1 [(w - A -                 t)L,LJL
                   -
                                                 2



To evaluate this, we need to calculate




            dt     -      R   dL
(B.3)              ——--- .
                   R



Since


(B.4)         L L dt
            dL —
            dAA3t dA
                                                 —44.-

                               L
(B.5)        dA



Since the denominator is positive for efficient levels of taxation,
dt
        is of opposite sign to -

             BL
To calculate BA— , we differentiate the first order condition (B.l):


             — BL   = {UL(W    + A—     t)   —            - A   - t)   +         +A—    t)L,L)
(B.6)                                            U11L(W

                                                                             —          —A —
                    —         —A   —
                                       t)L,L     +         + A -   t)L,LIL

                                             + U11(W — A -t)2 + 2U21(W + A -            t)   + 2U21(W
                                                                                                        —   — t)
                     {u11(w
                              +A —     t)2
                                             + 2E1J29}
                    = 0 when A = 0.




At       A = 0    the first term of (B.2) is obviously zero, the second

term is zero, since utility maximization implies



 (B.7)           - =0
                                                                           dt
and the third term is zero since, from(B.5) and (B.6) ,                          = 0.

The second and fifth terms are zero at A =                            0;       the third term is zero because

eighth and eleventh are zero because at A =                                0,        = 0 (from (B.5)
