                                               ABSTRACT

We conduct a laboratory experiment to examine how third-party ratings impact charity choice and
donative behavior, particularly in regards to preferences for local charities. Subjects are given a menu
of ten charities, with a mix of local and non-local organizations included. We vary whether third-party
ratings are displayed on this menu. Subjects perform an effort task to earn money and can choose to
donate to their selected charity. We find evidence that subjects' choice of charity is impacted by third-party
evaluations but, somewhat surprisingly, there are no obvious preferences for local charities. These
third-party assessments have some impact on the percent of earnings that subjects allocate to their
selected charity; local charities also accrue more donations, though these results are somewhat imprecise.

1         Introduction
Third-party charity ratings are an increasingly popular approach for potential donors
to select charities. A recent New York Times article argued selecting a worthwhile
charity has never been more challenging (Wasik, 2013). This difficulty is due, in
part, to the presence of numerous charities, many with closely-related missions; in-
deed, a recent survey found that only 35 percent of donors do any research before
giving (Hope Consulting, 2010). It is not surprising that donors often use a charity’s
prominence as a heuristic for its quality, but this approach may be in conflict with
preferences for more local charities (DellaVigna et al., 2012; Meer, Forthcoming),
which are likely to be less well-known.
    We conduct an experiment in which we vary the information about charities and
ask subjects to choose a charity to which they may donate. Subjects are presented
with a menu of charities with both local and non-local charities serving the same
causes; in some treatments, third-party ratings are presented.1 To our surprise, we
find that subjects do not exhibit strong preferences for local charities. Third-party
evaluations of the charities tend to have an impact on the selection of a charity;
there is some impact on donative behavior, but it is difficult to ascribe a causal
interpretation to these results.


2         Literature Review
It is a commonly-held belief that individuals prefer to give to local charities, much as
“buy local” movements have become increasingly common. For example, Kentucky,
among other states, has a day dedicated fundraising for local charities. Kentucky
Gives Day raised over $440,000 in one day for local charities in 2014 (Stacy, 2014).
Social identity theory, which is formalized in economics by Akerlof (1997) and Ak-
    1
        Throughout the paper, we use “non-local” and “national” interchangeably.
erlof and Kranton (2000), suggests that individuals will treat in-group members more
generously than others. Chen and Li (2009) provide an extensive review of the early
literature. In recent work, Agrawal et al. (2013) show that social distance may not
be as large of a concern in internet crowdfunding, finding that the average donor is
roughly 3,000 miles from the artist to which she donates. Similarly, Meer and Rigbi
(2013) find that lenders of micro-loans are impacted on the margin by the transaction
costs of language translation, but not location of the borrower; though Meer (Forth-
coming) shows that donors who live in the same area as a teacher requesting funds
at DonorsChoose.org are less sensitive to the price of giving, suggesting a preference
for local projects. Similarly, in an experiment with door-to-door solicitation of char-
itable gifts, DellaVigna et al. (2012) find that there are preferences for less-distant
recipients of philanthropy.
    Quality metrics may also influence the behavior of potential donors. There are
many papers which highlight that consumers respond to ratings and reputation (or
lack thereof) of sellers (e.g., Reinstein and Snyder (2005); Jin and Sorensen (2006);
Luca (2011); Varkevisser et al. (2012); Brown et al. (2012, 2013a)). For charities in
particular, Chhaochhari and Ghosh (2008) find that charities with the highest ratings
received sixteen percent more charitable donations than those with the lowest ratings.
Similarly, Gordon et al. (2009) find that increases in the number of stars awarded
by Charity Navigator leads to an increase contributions to the charity. Yoruk (2013)
illustrates that the impact on donor contributions of an additional star in Charity
Navigator’s rating system is a function of charity size and current rating; for small
charities, a one star increase from two to three or three to four stars leads to a
roughly twenty-eight percent increase in the amount of donations received by the
charity. Conversely, Grant (2010) finds that donors over-rate charities and that,
once rated, donors decrease their giving — especially for lower rated charities. Szper
and Prakash (2011) use charities within Washington state and find no relationship
between charity ratings and contributions from donors. Related work by Butera and
Horn (2014) illustrates that image conscience donors may treat quality information
and the size of their gift as substitutes and that when giving is private, individual
donors largely ignore bad news about the charity.

3       Experimental Procedures
All experiments took place at the Economic Science Laboratory in the Department
of Economics at Texas A&M University. 414 undergraduates were recruited from
econdollars.tamu.edu, an ORSEE (Greiner, 2004) website database.
    Subjects performed the same effort task over identical lengths of time and faced
the same list of charities with the order randomized for each subject. Subjects earned
all money they donated to charity rather than receiving it as an endowment; this
design choice is closer to conditions outside the laboratory where individuals are
likely donating from their earned income.2


3.1     Charity Selection
Subjects were informed they would have to select one charity from a menu of ten
charities and corresponding descriptions. The ten charities are listed in Table 1.
Charities were randomly sorted on the screen into one of two different menu styles,
organized either by location (local vs. national) or by type of charity (e.g. food
security, special needs, etc.). The order of the relevant categories was randomized,
as was the order of charities within each category. This random sorting was done
to help assuage any concerns of anchoring effects from specific menus. An example
menu can be seen in Figure 1. The description of the charities activities is taken
directly from the charities’ homepages with minor changes.3 Subjects were given up
to four minutes to review the options available to them and select their charity.4
Each subject knew that her choice was finalized once selected and understood that
selection of a charity did not require compulsory contribution to it. After all subjects
selected a charity, the experiment would proceed.
    A central question in this paper concerns how individuals may react to third-
    2
     Reinstein and Riener (2012) show there are large differences in donation behavior when subjects
are endowed with money rather than earning their endowment in the laboratory; they find that
those subjects who earned their compensation choose to donate less to charity.
   3
     We removed pronouns which might be considered loaded language so that all descriptions were
neutral.
   4
     This process rarely took more than two minutes.

party assessments of the charities. Therefore, during the charity selection process,
some subjects were given information detailing which charities were approved to be a
member of the State Employee Charitable Campaign of Texas and, separately, which
charities received a three or four star rating from CharityNavigator.5

3.1.1     Baseline – No 3rd Party Ratings

In this treatment, subjects viewed the standard charity menu depicted in Figure 1.
The instructions and menu do not mention information about third party metrics
or ratings. This information serves as a baseline for charity selection and donation
behavior.
   5
     An “ideal” experiment would randomly generate both positive and negative ratings for each
subject and local and non-local categories for each charity, providing much more variation. How-
ever, this would constitute deception; we use information from multiple agencies to generate the
differences that identify the effect of ratings, but it is not possible to identify both individual charity
effects and location effects.

3.1.2      Charity Navigator Ratings

In this treatment, subjects see a menu like that in Figure 2. A column is added to
indicate if the charity was given a three of four star rating from Charity Navigator;
the statement describing the charities’ objectives were unchanged. Subjects were
informed that all charities rated by Charity Navigator were evaluated on Financial
Health and Accountability and Transparency.

3.1.3      State Employee Charitable Campaign Membership

Similar to the Charity Navigator treatment, the State Employee Charitable Cam-
paign (SECC) information treatment informed subjects which charities were ap-
proved members of this campaign. As with the Charity Navigator treatment, sub-
jects were informed the criteria by which charities were approved by the SECC.6

3.2       Effort Task and Payment Schedule
The effort task began after all subjects had selected their charity. Subjects had 75
minutes to move as many “sliders” from one position on the screen to a specific
randomized target (see Figure 3) as they could.7 In all conditions they would be
paid a fixed amount per slider completed in addition to a participation award of
$5.00.8
   Subjects moved their slider markers along the line to a randomly generated target
number (an integer in the set [1, 99]), with the slider beginning at the far left at the
point corresponding to 0. In Figure 3, the target position is located at 73 and the
subject’s current position is at 63. Once the subjects aligned their markers, they
were credited the appropriate wage and they were able to move to another slider.
   Subjects saw thirty sliders (ten rows of three) on the screen and could complete

        accepted auditing standards.

the sliders in any order; once all thirty sliders were finished, the page reset with
thirty more sliders and newly randomized target numbers for each slider. This pro-
cess repeated throughout the experiment until the time expired, providing no upper
bound on the amount of money subjects could earn. Subjects who did not wish to
participate in this task for the full length of time were allowed to browse the inter-
net. An earnings summary and the time remaining were displayed at the top of the
screen, and subjects were given a verbal notification both when two minutes and
thirty seconds remained.
    Within this framework, we varied the methods of donation available to the sub-
jects; in some treatments subjects were able to donate money they earned whereas
in others subjects were able to complete slider bars which earned money directly for
the charity (giving effort). We find a strong preference for gifts of time and effort
over those of money (Brown et al., 2013b). Importantly, the charity choice portion of
the experiment was randomized separately from the method-of-donation portion; we
control for the treatments discussed in (Brown et al., 2013b) in all our specifications.
    Subjects were paid individually and discretely in cash at the conclusion of the
experiment to avoid any social stigma from their earnings and donation selection.
Subjects were presented two envelopes; one envelope was unlabeled and contained
their personal earnings while the second was labeled with the charity’s name. If a
subject chose to donate money to charity, the second envelope would contain that
amount of money. Each subject was asked to confirm that these amounts were
correct and sign a form stating that they wished to contribute their charity total
to the charity whose name was on the envelope. The experimenter then collected
the charitable envelope from the subject, taped it shut, and placed the envelope in
a box labeled donations. Subjects were informed that all donations would be made


                                           7
within 90 days and were given contact information for the experimenter making the
donation. Donation totals for each charity were calculated, and a donation in that
amount was given to each charity at the conclusion of the sessions.


4     Results
4.1     Charity Selection
Subjects were presented the list of charities in a menu. In Figure 4, we show the
charities chosen by subjects; the second panel of Figure 4 shows the position on
the menu of the chosen charity, which indicates that subjects appear to have gone
through the entire list before selecting. Almost exactly half of charities selected
across all information treatments were local (48.7%).
    Table 2 displays the results of an OLS regression where the dependent variable is
a binary variable equaling one if the chosen charity is a local one (results are similar
when using a probit model); we pool the two information treatments (results are
similar if they are entered separately). Only the type of charity had a statistically
significant influence on subjects’ choice of the local charity; none of the other cate-
gories have any individually or jointly significant variables. Surprisingly, a subject
being from the state of Texas does not influence her to select a local charity, with a
coefficient that is both small and statistically insignificant.9
    To gauge the impact of quality information and, in particular, how it interacts
with the choice of charity, we create a panel in which each observation is an individ-
ual’s decision of whether or not to select a particular charity; thus, each subject has
ten observations, one for each charity. The dependent variable is an indicator that
equals one when that charity is selected by the subject. Each observation also in-
cludes the quality information seen by that subject regarding that charity, as well as
the charity’s type. We include individual subject fixed effects in an OLS regression,
which subsume the treatment that the subject faced, as well as any other factors
  9
    21 observations are lost due to ambiguous survey responses about where the subjects lived.
Omitting the Texas variable and including this 21 observations does not significantly alter results.

that are invariant within a subject.
   Column (1) of Table 3 shows the effects of a charity being positively rated, as
well as whether it is a local charity. Note that if subjects are choosing charities at
random, each charity has a 10% chance of being chosen. Therefore, the effect of a
positive rating is quite large at 3.4 percentage points; it is statistically significant at
p = 0.008.10 However, there is no “local charity” effect – that indicator is small and
  10
    Since the quality indicators are not truly randomly assigned, it is possible that better-known
charities are more highly rated and that the effects seen in Table 3 reflect, in essence, a “brand” effect
rather than a true effect of ratings. Including controls for the actual charity makes it impossible to
examine location effects. However, when we examine the effects of ratings including charity effects,
the coefficient is positive and relatively large at 0.021, but is significant only at p = 0.15. The small
amount of variation within each charity is the likely driver of this relative lack of precision.

statistically insignificant. We next include an indicator for whether the subject had
experience with that particular charity.11 The effect of experience with the charity is
large and significant and reduces the size of the rating effect to 0.023 (s.e. = 0.012),
which is still statistically significant at p = 0.063. This indicator controls in part for
the general prominence of the charity; to the extent that this is correlated with its
rating, including the experience variable yields a more accurate estimate of ratings.
    Finally, in Column (3), we add an interaction between charity rating and local
charity to determine if preferences for a local charity are revealed when that charity
is positively rated. This interaction is quite small and statistically insignificant,
suggesting that the addition of ratings do not reveal preferences for local charities.
The overall marginal effect of charity rating in this specification is 0.023 (s.e. =
0.012), significant at p = 0.060; the overall marginal effect for a local charity is 0.015

     Subjects were asked after the experiment if they had no knowledge of the charity; had heard
of it but were unfamiliar with it; were very familiar but had never donated or volunteered; or had
donated to or volunteered for that charity. The indicator equals one if subjects were very familiar
or had donated to the charity. Results using the full set of categories are similar, with greater
familiarity exerting a stronger effect on choice.

4.2     Donative Behavior
Understanding which charity a subject selects is only part of understanding the re-
lationship between social distance, third-party information, and donor behavior. As
illustrated above, third-party quality information does affect charity choice, while so-
cial distance does not; however, they may affect contribution behavior differently. It
is important to note that charity choice is endogenous in this framework. An “ideal”
experiment might randomly assign the charities to each subject (along with ratings)
and then investigate the effects of rating and location on giving. We recognize that
charity choice is endogenous and that these results may reflect the behavior of the
type of individual who selects a highly-rated or local charity. Investigating these
effects, with the appropriate caveats, is still instructive.
    In Table 4, we present the results on the percent of earnings given. 62.6% of
subjects make a donation. Conditional on donating, the mean percent of earnings
donated is 23.0% (the unconditional median is 3.7% and the conditional median
is 15.5%). Each specification includes controls for the treatment, both in terms of
  12
     Separately, an interaction for rating with the experience dummy is small at -0.007 and statis-
tically insignificant.

whether quality information is provided and the method of donation as described in
Section 3 and Brown et al. (2013b). We employ a two-part hurdle model (Meer, 2011;
Huck and Rasul, 2011) in which the decision of whether or not to give is modeled with
a probit. Column (1) of Table 4 shows the marginal effects from this specification,
including controls for the treatment and charity type. Neither the rating of the chosen
charity nor whether it is local is statistically significant, though the effects are fairly
large for each variable – nearly nine percentage points on a baseline of about 63%.
Turning to Column (2), we examine the effects on the percent donated conditional on
making a donation, using OLS on the observations with positive giving. Again, the
effects are statistically insignificant but fairly large, with the coefficient on charity
rating increasing the percentage given by about one-quarter relative to the baseline.
    Given these results, it is straightforward to compute the marginal effects on the
unconditional percent given, which we show in Column (3). The combination of the
effects from the extensive and intensive margins yields an overall effect of choosing
a rated charity of 6.4 percentage points on percent given, statistically significant at
p = 0.106.13 Choosing a local charity increases the percent given by 4.5 percentage
points, statistically significant at p = 0.101.14
    Overall, we take these results as suggestive that charity ratings increase donative
behavior. Nevertheless, we urge caution in their interpretation, as the choice of
charity is endogenous.
  13
      As discussed in Section 4.1, it is not possible to include charity effects and examine the effect
of location. However, in specifications similar to those in Table 4, but including a full set of charity
effects and excluding the indicator for local charity, the general pattern of results is similar. Some
precision is lost, though. Controlling for the actual charity selected may come closer to the causal
impact of ratings, since the identification is arising from whether the subject was randomly assigned
to receive rating information or not; however, their choice of charity may still be affected by these
ratings.
   14
      Similar to Table 3, we also test specifications that include the experience indicator, as well as
an interaction between rated charity and local charity, being careful to account for the nonlinearity
of the model. In each case, the results are similar: both charity rating and local charity have large
effects. The interaction term is imprecisely estimated, but positive.

5     Discussion
Selecting a charity can be a difficult decision; there are numerous charities which
provide similar services. In our laboratory experiment, subjects choose from a list of
ten charities knowing that they will have the option to donate some of their earnings
to this charity. In this selection stage, we vary the information about the charities.
Specifically, we have a baseline where there are no third-party assessments of the
charities and treatments where these quality metrics are freely given.
    Our results suggest that these ratings matter in selecting a charity. While ratings
seem to increase giving, the effects are less precise and, since the choice of charity is
endogenous, difficult to interpret causally. We also examine whether subjects have
a preference for local charities. We find no strong preferences for local charities
over non-local ones, and these preferences are not affected by ratings. This result
provides evidence against the explanation that individuals prefer local charities but
give nationally because those charities are more reputable.
    A related question regarding social distance that has yet to be assessed concerns
the distinction between local provision of goods and local providers of goods. Would
donors rather give to an institution based non-locally but which provided services
in the area instead of a local charity run by members of the community that helped
those outside the community? Our future work will focus on this question.
