                                              ABSTRACT

This paper incorporates two empirically-grounded insights into a dynamic life cycle portfolio choice
model: the fact that investors forego the opportunity to accumulate job-specific skills when they spend
time managing their own money, and the observation that efficiency in financial decision making varies
with age. Our calibrated model demonstrates that both factors generate sensible portfolio inactivity
patterns consistent with empirical evidence. We also analyze how people optimally choose between
actively managing their assets versus delegating the task to financial advisors. Delegation proves valuable
to both the young and the old. Our calibrated model quantifies welfare gains from including investment
time and money costs as well as delegation in a life cycle setting.

                   Time is Money: Rational Life Cycle Inertia
                 and the Delegation of Investment Management

1.   Introduction

        Investor inertia, or the tendency to maintain one’s investment portfolio for long periods of

time without changing it, has been interpreted as evidence of irrationality or financial illiteracy.1

In the present paper, by contrast, we incorporate the opportunity cost of time associated with

investment management and show that such inertia can be consistent with optimal behavior.

Additionally, we explain why some investors rationally delegate the responsibility to make their

investment decisions to a financial advisor. To this end, we develop a life cycle model with

rational agents that generates household portfolio inertia patterns consistent with much empirical

evidence.2 In a dynamic consumption and portfolio framework with endogenous labor supply,

we account for time costs devoted to portfolio management. This time becomes particularly

valuable when the individual has the opportunity to accumulate job-specific human capital via

learning by doing. Our structure for financial decision making costs also posits an age-related

time efficiency pattern for financial decision making, in keeping with empirical evidence in

Agarwal et al. (2009), Gamble et al. (2014), and Horn and Cattell (1967). We also evaluate the

role of financial advisors who, for a fee, help investors manage their financial portfolios. This

possibility enables individuals to invest in their job-related human capital and thus to enhance

lifetime earnings.

        Several prior studies on portfolio choice have shown that people rarely alter their

financial portfolios. For instance, Bilias et al. (2009) analyzed investor trading behavior in the

Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and found that most of stock account owners (up to

70%) exhibited portfolio inertia. They also showed that portfolio inertia followed a U-shaped

profile over the life cycle because younger workers owned almost no stock, while older persons

who did have assets traded them infrequently. Ameriks and Zeldes (2004) studied TIAA-CREF

accountholders over a dozen years, and they noted that 73% of investors never changed their

asset allocation at all, and another 14% rebalanced only once. Agnew et al. (2003) also reported

substantial inertia among investors, particularly in their retirement accounts with close to 90%

never altering their portfolios. Similarly a 2008 survey commissioned by the SEC Office of

Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA) asked investors how often they traded stocks, bonds,

or mutual funds (outside employer-sponsored retirement accounts), and they found that over 70%

of investors changed their investment allocations at most once a year. In other words, inertia is

the norm for a wide range of investors.3

        Notwithstanding this evidence, a large body of research on household finance has focused

on optimal dynamic portfolio allocation patterns selected by rational forward-looking consumers

who decide on their own how to allocate their wealth between stocks and bonds.4 This approach

has been extended to include flexible labor supply decisions.5 Building on these prior studies, we

focus on how the opportunity cost of time devoted to investment management influences

portfolio choice, in the context of endogenous human capital accumulation. This allows us to

diagnose reasons for portfolio inertia and the demand for financial advisors over the life cycle.

at a large discount brokerage company in 1996, yet their unusual sample is not characteristic of typical investors.

          When investors cannot delegate, young and old investors optimally exhibit inertia, while

middle-aged investors are more active. This is because the young workers have little job-specific

human capital and have the longest time horizon, so they prefer to invest in work skills and

exhibit portfolio inertia. Accordingly, they optimally stay out of the stock market and exhibit

inertia in non-participation. Middle-aged investors with more job-specific human capital have

lower opportunity costs of financial investment. Newly-retired individuals are more active in

managing their portfolios because they no longer forego learning on the job, and they must also

optimally withdraw from their financial accounts before rising inefficiency in portfolio

management and growing mortality risk set in. Later in retirement, older persons are less

involved in trading their financial assets, because growing mortality risk and falling decision

making efficiency render active management costly. Accordingly, different portfolio

management approaches are optimally chosen over the life cycle depending on the investor’s

financial and labor market status. We also find that the average equity share of liquid assets is

hump-shaped with age, consistent with empirical evidence.6

          When households have an opportunity to delegate money management, results are rather

different. Overall, we see that access to delegation reduces both inertia and active

self-management. The delegation option is attractive for both young and old investors.

Approximately one-quarter (25%) of investors younger than age 30, 20% of middle-aged

investors (age 30-65), and around 40% of retirees now optimally delegate to financial advisors.

Moreover, access to delegation substantially reduces active management, especially among the

youngest and oldest investors. Active management is adopted by only a small fraction (less than

1%) of the youngest and oldest investors, but by many more of the middle-aged (around 30%)

and early retirees (~50%). Early retirees are the most active investor group because they have no

opportunity cost of forgone labor supply and must optimally withdraw from their financial

accounts to cover consumption. Rather than paying a delegation fee, they instead actively

manage their finances by withdrawing on their own. Later in life, retirees are more likely to

delegate and become less active due to increased mortality risk and decision making inefficiency.

        One of our primary research contributions is to model portfolio inertia of individuals who

have free access to the stock market yet still do not touch their portfolios over long periods of

time.7 That is, unlike studies on equity market participation (e.g., Gomes and Michaelides 2005;

Vissing-Jorgensen 2003), we show that, while most individuals (57% in our model) rationally

elect inertia unconditional on stock ownership, many (47%) of stock investors also elect portfolio

inertia. In comparative statics analysis, we also evaluate how initial market participation costs

influence portfolio inertia patterns, and we show such an initial cost need not produce portfolio

inertia among equity owners.

        To assess welfare gains of having access to a finanical advisor, we compute the change in

the certainty-equivalent (CE) consumption stream when investors do versus do not have access to

delegation. Using our baseline fee structure, investors having access to financial advice enjoy

greater lifetime welfare by the equivalent of a 1.2% improvement in their annual consumption

streams. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis for different costs of financial advice, to evaluate

investors’ potential welfare gains from lowering entry barriers to financial advisory services. We

conclude that eliminating a minimum fee for advisory services would enhance welfare by 1.43%,

compared to the case where no delegation is available. Overall, lowering the entry barriers to

 This is consistent with a wide range of empirical findings; see Agnew et al.(2003); Ameriks and Zeldes (2004);

access financial advisors can help people of all ages (and particularly the young and the old) to

better manage their finances and save their scarcest asset, time for accumulating more

job-specific skills or enjoying leisure. Our findings have implications for research and policy

regarding investment management and financial advice.

        In what follows, Section 2 describes our specification of the investor’s portfolio problem

when the primary opportunity cost of financial management is the time that could otherwise be

used for job-related human capital accumulation. Section 3 describes the dynamic portfolio

choice problem when invetors have an option to hire financial advisors. Section 4 presents our

calibration of parameters and approach to numerical solution of the model. Section 5 illustrates

results of investors’ portfolio choice problems, first without delegation, and then with the option

of hiring a financial advisor. Section 6 provides sensitivity analysis and evaluates the welfare

impact of delegation. We conclude with a discussion of implications of our findings for investors,

the financial advisory industry, retirement plan sponsors, and policymakers.



2.    Dynamic Portfolio Choice with Inertia

        In this section we specify the investor’s problem when allocating his portfolio, on the

assumption that active management of financial assets requires individuals to devote time to the

process.

2.1    Financial Decision Making Efficiency and Time Budgets over the Life Cycle

        We posit a consumer dynamically determining his equity share and labor supply over the

life cycle, both of which influence his current and future labor income as well as his financial

wealth. The individual is endowed with a per-period time available (normalized to 1). Before

retirement, he can allocate his time to work in the paid labor market        to generate income, or

to leisure     . His decision period        0, 1, … ,   is measured in years; at       0 he begins
                                                                                                                  6


his work life at age 20. He also faces mortality risk over the course of his (uncertain) lifetime,

with the maximum age (here set to 100,                80 .

        An individual who is not a financial expert will need to devote both time and mental

resources to the task of financial management (Abel et al. 2013; Campbell et al. 2011). This can

be costly, inasmuch as managing financial assets requires collecting and processing information

about market conditions (Christelis et al. 2010), analyzing financial products’ risk/return

characteristics, and evaluating product fee structures (Anagol and Kim 2012). And while there

may be a one-time initial entry cost of equity participation (Vissing-Jorgensen 2002), it will still

be necessary each period for investors to expend resources to evaluate changing financial market

conditions and understand new products (Carlin 2009, Carlin and Manso 2011). This imposes on

individuals an opportunity cost each period, inasmuch as labor earnings depend on job-specific

skills derived from work experience.8

        We capture the explicit opportunity cost of adjusting one’s portfolio by the fraction of

time         that is devoted to financial decision making. Someone who is not well-informed

about financial markets will need to allocate more time to acquire and process information about

his portfolio. Accordingly, the investor faces the following time budget constraint:

                                                                      1,                                  (1)

where       is a variable taking the value of 1 if he actively manages, and 0 otherwise. This time

constraint implies that the investor can make use of his time to either work or enjoy leisure, if he

elects not to actively manage his financial portfolio.

8
  There is a vast literature on on-the-job skill acquisition; see for instance Arrow (1962), Becker (1964), Lucas
(1988), and Levitt et al. (2013) among others. Some people may enjoy self-management or believe they can
outperform the market as well as professional investors, though few actually do so in practice: their performance is
often worse than average (Barber and Odean 2000, Lusardi and Mitchell 2007, Mitchell et al. 2009). Additionally,
peoples’ portfolio allocations across mutual funds often produces lower returns due to infrequent rebalancing
(Frazzini and Lamont 2008).
                                                                                                                7


        We also posit that the time cost of making an efficient financial decision                     can vary

with age. Consistent with the economics and neuroscience literatures on decision making (Horn

and Cattell 1967; Agarwal et al. 2009), we suppose that middle-aged investors are more efficient

in managing their wealth than are younger or older individuals. Accordingly, we model the

age-dependent time cost of financial management as a U-shaped function over the life cycle with

the highest efficiency (i.e., lowest        ) in middle age.9 This reflects the fact that the young are

cognitively able but inexperienced in the labor force; also older workers have job experience but

may have diminished cognitive ability. Middle-aged investors tend to be at their best, having

gained job experience and not yet experienced cognitive decline. Nevertheless, as investors incur

time costs period when they manage their financial portfolios actively,10 there is no assumed

value of experience in financial management (Chiang et al. 2011).

2.2   The Human Capital Accumulation Process

        We posit that job-specific human capital is accumulated through learning by doing. In

keeping with Arrow (1962) and Becker (1964), we denote with                         and    , respectively, as the

time devoted to developing job-specific human capital and work time each period. The law of

motion for job-specific human capital is:

                                             1                     ,           ,                        (2)

where          ,     is an experience formulation function and                     is a depreciation rate 11 for

job-specific human capital. An idiosyncratic temporary shock (                 also affects the accumulation

level of human capital in the next period.

9
   Technically, this inefficiency arises from the complexity that the typical investor faces when implementing his
choices in a dynamic programming problem; see Johnson et al. (2001).
10
    In our model the agent must re-solve his life cycle model and implement new choices each period, so he incurs
new time costs every time he engages in active management.
11
    This can also be interpreted as a rate of skill obsolescence; that is, some knowledge becomes outdated by the
advent of new technology.
                                                                                                                   8


           This formulation makes clear that work in the current period                        not only generates

current labor income but also raises the stock of human capital resulting in higher future labor

income. Previous research on endogenous labor supply in a dynamic portfolio choice model has

incorporated uncertain wage rates as an important source of risk (Bodie et al. 1992, Gomes et al.

2008, Chai et al. 2011), but there the decision to work was assumed to affect only current

income. Since in prior models life cycle wage profiles were assumed to be determined only by

age and exogenous labor market shocks, those studies implicitly assumed that work time

substituted for current leisure time, so the price of leisure was simply the current wage. By

contrast, in what follows, we model investors who know that taking time away from work today

influences their human capital accumulation and hence future labor earnings. Specifically, we

specify the experience acquisition function as follows, following Ben-Porath (1967):

                                                    ,                                                       (3)

where a is a parameter that represents an individual’s efficiency for accumulating human

capital.12 The elasticity of human capital accumulation                     is assumed to display decreasing

returns to scale         ∈ 0,1 .

2.3     Labor Income and Asset Returns

           Disposable yearly labor income ( ) is determined by the individual’s job-specific human

capital level          , wage shock          , and labor supply ( ):

                                                1           1                 ,                             (4)

where          and τ represent housing expenditures and labor income tax, respectively. The level

of human capital or job-specific skill                  plays a role similar to the age-specific deterministic

wage trend in the life cycle literature (Cocco et al. 2005, Gomes et al. 2008, Hubener 2013 et

12
     Our notion of human capital is informed by job-specific skills accumulated by working, as in Becker (1964).
                                                                                                                  9


al.).13 In the present case, however,            is endogenously accumulated over time (i.e., learning by

doing) when the individual works, as per equation (2). The permanent wage shock                           ≡ log

follows a random walk process and is influenced by an idiosyncratic shock (Carroll 1997, Cocco

et al. 2005)                     where       ~           0.5       ,       . The transitory wage shock (        ) is

log normally distributed with                    ~          0.5        ,         . After the (exogenous) age-65

retirement age (       45 , the individual stops working (                      0 and receives a lifelong pension

benefit equal to a fraction of his final labor earnings.

        Two asset classes are available for the consumer’s investment portfolio: riskless bonds

and risky stocks. Bonds have a constant annual real gross return of                        in all periods. The real

stock gross return           is assumed to be serially independent and identically log normally

distributed with parameters           and     , implying that log                  ~       ,     .14 The correlation

between the stock log return and the innovation to the permanent wage shock is denoted by                          .

We denote            as the stock gross return from time                   to       1, so that the fraction of the

individual’s wealth invested in stocks is determined in period , and returns are realized in

1. Following Gomes et al. (2003), we consider a proportional rate τ applied to all asset returns

the household receives. Therefore the after-tax bond return is given by                              1      1 1

τ    and the after-tax stock return is given by                1                     1 1       τ .

2.4 Preferences

        As in Gomes et al. (2008), we suppose the investor has a standard time-separable power

utility function defined over a composite good consisting of current consumption                           and time

13
   Indeed below we estimate the parameters of a human capital accumulation process by matching the
model-generated moments with that of the age-specific deterministic wage profile in Hubener et al. (2013).
14
   Tang et al. (2010) report that people receive lower returns when they manage their own portfolios, compared to
having professionals manage them. For simplicity, we assume that equity returns are the same for all portfolio
management methods (inertia, active management, and delegation).

devoted to leisure          , which is given in period by                ,                         . Here           0

captures the investor’s preference for leisure relative to consumption. The parameter                    measures

relative risk aversion.

2.5   Wealth Dynamics and Portfolio Inertia vs. Active Management

          The investor is assumed to have a stock market account and a bond market account.15 In

each period , the investor needs to decide how much to consume ( ) from his available total

wealth (or cash on hand,           ), and how much to invest in the stock market for the next period

(        0). The remaining wealth is invested in bonds (                               ). Let      be the balance

of his stock market account at time . The dynamic budget constraint and evolution of wealth

can then be formulated as follows:

                                                                                                            (5)

                                                                                                            (6)

                                                                                                            (7)

          The stock balance               in period        1 is determined by his previous period’s stock

investment choice ( ) and stock market return (                  ). The next period’s total wealth (              ) is

the sum of realized financial investment (stock account plus bond account balances) and labor

earnings ( ). Depending on how the investor elects next period’s stock investment, we have two

cases.



15
   We could have considered three accounts, namely a brokerage account for stock investment, a savings account for
bond investments, and a checking account for consumption as in Abel et. al (2013). In our study, however, the focus
is not on the transaction costs of transferring between checking and investment accounts (i.e., stock and bond
investment accounts). Moreover, evidence on investor inertia also suggests that investors are not greatly affected by
transactions costs (Brunnermeier and Nagel 2008). Additionally, most banks provide free transfers between savings
and checking accounts, and money market funds provide bond returns while allowing frequent withdrawals. Thus,
here we focus on a case where investors can consume from their total liquid assets (stock+bond+labor earnings) and
incur time costs when collecting or processing information to manage their stock/bond portfolios.
                                                                                                                   11


Inertia (           ): The investor exhibits portfolio inertia in period            when he retains his current

stock balance for the next period. This is equivalent to passively electing the current stock

balance as his new investment choice (                      ), i.e. there are no withdrawals from or new

investments into the stock account. In so doing, he incurs no time cost for financial decision

making            0 that he would otherwise devote to collecting and analyzing new financial

information to implement the change. Accordingly, someone electing portfolio inertia has the

following budget and time constraints:

                                                                                                            (8)

                                                                1                                           (9)

                                                                                                           (10)

Also, when electing inertia, the investor does not finance his current consumption by liquidating

part of his stock account, which makes the consumption constraint more binding (C                                 Z ).

Of course his next-period balance in the stock account (                   ) may differ from that of the prior

period ( ) because of uncertain investment returns                     .

Active management                      : The investor exhibits active portfolio management in period

when he explicitly chooses an investment amount in stocks; that is, he makes additional

investments into or takes withdrawals from his stock account based on his investment decisions.

Accordingly, the amount invested in stocks for the next period can differ from the current stock

balance               . 16 In return, the investor must incur (age-dependent) time costs                       0 in

this period.17 The wealth and time budget constraints evolve as follows:


16
   Conceptually it would be possible for an active investor to choose to buy and sell exactly the same amount as his
current stock balance, but this case is not interesting from a modeling perspective and eliminated in the optimization
process of investors.
17
   The recurring time cost (or cognitive attention/resources) for gathering and processing information for financial
management is also consistent with a recent literature on optimal inattention and economic decision making (e.g.,
                                                                                                                    12


                                                                                                             (11)

                                                                        1                                    (12)

                                                                                                             (13)

Optimization: By defining inertia as a situation where the investor does not alter his

stockholdings, we treat the stock account balance ( ) as a state variable within a dynamic

optimization framework. This is because it is necessary for the investor to know his current stock

balance before deciding whether to leave it as is (i.e.,                          ), or to actively evaluate some

different allocation. Other state variables include total wealth                         , accumulated human capital

      , and the wage shock                    . There are also four choice variables: the portfolio management

method (i.e., portfolio inertia or active management), labor supply                        , stock holdings going into

the next period         , and consumption                .

            Because the portfolio management method is a discrete choice variable, we formulate the

investors’ problem in a dynamic discrete choice model (Adda and Cooper 2000). We define

        ,     ,   ,    as the investor’s discounted lifetime utility when he actively manages his

portfolio; similarly,             ,       ,     ,    denotes his discounted lifetime utility when he elects

portfolio inertia. Then the value function at time                is specified as:

                          ,   ,       ,        ≡              ,    ,    ,    ,       ,     ,   ,   .         (14)

Let          1 be the investor’s time preference and                   the probability that he survives to the next

period. Then the value function for active management is as follows:18




Abel et al., 2013, Sims 2003), learning (Sargent 1993, Evans and Honkapohja 2001), and robust control (e.g.,
Giannoni 1999, Hansen and Sargent 2001, Onatski and Stock 1999).
18
   We could introduce a direct transaction cost      ,     for portfolio adjustment, in which case the equation for
total wealth would be W                                      ,                 . Nevertheless, we do not focus here
on direct monetary costs; see Bonaparte and Cooper (2009) and Campanale et al. (2012) for more on that approach.

                                                       1                     ,



                                                                        1.

The value function for portfolio inertia is as follows:

                     ,       ,       ,   max               ,                     ,       ,         ,
                                          ,


                                                 . .

                                                                                                              (16)

                                                       1                     ,



                                                                   1.

When an investor elects portfolio inertia, he does not need to re-maximize the value function with

respect to stock holdings; instead, he takes his current stock balance                           as his next period’s

stock investment (S ). If                     , the investor opts for active management                    ; otherwise,

he opts for portfolio inertia.

        The two value functions differ due to their different time constraints and next period’s

portfolio choice. The appeal of portfolio inertia is that the time saved can then be used either to

work and accumulate more human capital, thereby raising future earnings, or to enjoy more

leisure. During retirement, the investor does not work, so if he decides to actively manage his
                                                                                                                14


portfolio, he sacrifices only his leisure time. Later in retirement, decreasing financial decision

making efficiency and rising mortality risk make inertia more appealing.19



3. The Role of Financial Advisors and Dynamic Portfolio Choice with Delegation

        Next we extend the model to examine how introducing financial advisors can add value to

life cycle decision makers. Reasons for delegating portfolio management can include time costs,

efficiency gains due to lower transaction costs, and beliefs regarding professional managers’

skills. In what follows, we focus mainly on the investor’s forgone opportunity to accumulate

more human capital associated with active management during the work life.

        When an investor elects to delegate his portfolio management to an advisor, he must pay a

management fee from his wealth (                ). In the financial advisory service industry, the fee

generally consists of a minimum fixed fee                      plus a percentage fee            charged on total

assets under management.20 Formally, this structure may be expressed as follows:

                                               max         ,           .                                 (17)


The financial advisor not only selects the individual’s investment portfolio, but he also proposes

optimal levels of consumption and labor supply that are in the client’s best interest.21 The value

function for the delegated portfolio management method is then:

                ,   ,   ,       max     , ,           ,                             ,     ,      ,

                                         . .                                                             (18)




19
   Sufficient conditions for the selection of portfolio inertia are discussed in Appendix B.
20
   See Appendix A for a dicussion of the fee structures usedby SEC-registered investment advisors (RIA) in the U.S.
21
   We do not model a possible conflict of interest between clients and financial advisors, which was analyzed by
Sharpe (1985), Stoughton et al. (2011), Ou-Yang (2003), and Mullainathan et al. (2012), among others.
                                                                                                                  15


                                                        1                 ,



                                                                  1


Note that the investor pays the management fee                   out of his total wealth, but he does not incur

any time cost      . The advantage of hiring the financial advisor is either more leisure or the saved

time which can then be used to work and accumulate more job-specific knowledge.

        Accordingly, the investor’s optimization problem of finding the best portfolio

management method can be summarized as:




                       ,     ,     ,

                                                ,                                 ,    ,    ,
                           , , ,


                                          . .                                                              (19)




                                                        1                 ,

                                                                              1

                                                                      0

where           0 denotes portfolio inertia,                    1 active management, and                 2 hiring a

financial advisor.            ≡                     ,       ,   where                 is the value function for the

portfolio inertia case,                is the value function for active management, and                 is the value

function for delegating portfolio management.
                                                                                                             16


4    Model Calibration and Solution

4.1 Numerical Procedure for the Model Solution

        In our model, there is no simple Euler equation linking the marginal benefit of today’s

portfolio adjustment with future marginal benefits, inasmuch as the investor is unsure about

which portfolio management method he will select at each point in the future. For this reason, it

is intractable to solve the model in a closed form. We therefore solve the model numerically via

backward induction, multi-linear interpolation, and Monte-Carlo integration (see Appendix C for

details).

4.2 Parameter Calibration

        We calibrate the model using a reasonable set of base case parameters, setting the

discount factor       to 0.96, the coefficient of relative risk aversion to               3, and the leisure

preference parameter to            1.0, as is conventional in other life cycle studies (see Gomes et al.

2008; Chai et al. 2011; and Cocco and Gomes 2012). One-period survival rates                     in the utility

function are calculated from the 2009 US Social Security Administration Trustees Report cohort

mortality table for males born in 1990 (Bell and Miller 2012).

        An important element of the model is the human capital accumulation process (                 ), which

generates the opportunity cost of time when an investor elects to actively manage his financial

assets. As noted above, accumulated human capital serves a similar role as the age-dependent

wage profile in prior studies. To this end, we calibrate the human capital accumulation process by

matching the model-generated moments with those of an age-dependent wage rate profile for

male high school graduates derived from PSID data (as in Hubener et al. 2013).22 Based on this


22
   Technically, we implement a simulated method of moment procedure (SMM) by numerically minimizing the
distance of various moments (i.e., mean, standard deviation, median, skewness, kurtois, max, min and the age of
maximum wage) of the simulated human capital accumulation process given in equations (2) and (3) relative to the
                                                                                                               17


moment-matching process, we find that human capital                      depreciates at an annual rate of

      0.16%      0.023595              ; the elasticity parameter in the experience accumulation

function is set to          0.0462; and the accumulation rate to                  0.7596. The idiosyncratic

shocks to human capital follow an iid lognormal distribution                      ~      0.5·0.0434 , 0.0434 .

The standard deviation of the permanent wage shock is 0.0710 and the pre-retirement transitory

wage shock standard deviation is 0.1726; in retirement it is 0.28 (as in Love 2010). The

post-retirement shocks may be interpreted as income or consumption surprises due to unexpected

out-of-pocket medical expenses or long-term care expenses.

         Retirement benefits are assumed to replace 50% of the individual’s last labor income

      0.2         (     45, 46, … ,    . This formulation generates higher (lower) replacement rates

for workers with lower (higher) average career earnings, consistent with the progressive benefit

rules of the U.S. Social Security system (Chai et al. 2011). The riskless asset return is set to 1.01%

and the risk premium for stocks is 4% with a standard deviation of 20.5% (Cocco et al. 2005).

Labor income is taxed at 30% during working period and 15% after retirement. Capital gains are

taxed at 20%. These rates reflect effective tax rates typical household faces in U.S. (Gomes et al.

2008).

         So that the calibration embodies relatively realistic delegation fees, we have collected and

analyzed advisory charges of registered investment advisors (RIAs) reporting to the US. Security

and Exchange Commissions (SEC).23 We focus on retail-oriented advisors charging a percent of

total assets under management (AUM), as this is the most common form of fee (see Appendix A



(deterministic) age-dependent wage profile used in the literature (Gomes et al. 2008; Hubener et al. 2013). A more
detailed explanation of this procedure appears in Appendix D.
23
   Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) in the U.S. must file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
before they can provide advice on financial investments including stocks, bond, and mutual funds. They can also
help implement clients’ optimal portfolio choices; see Mitchell and Smetters (2013). See also Appendix A..
                                                                                                            18


for more detail). Since these fees average 1.41% per year, our baseline calibration uses this level

(         1.41% . To cover fixed costs of advisory service, financial advisors often stipulate a

minimum balance they require if they are to take on the client for a percentage fee. Below that

level, they charge a fixed fee calculated as a set percentage times the minimum required account

balance. For retail-oriented advisors, the minimum required account balances average about

$240,000, which translates into a fixed fee level of $3,400. Such a high threshold for delegation

will discourage most consumers from delegation in the real world and in our model. 24

Accordingly, for the baseline case below, we explore investors’ choice of a delegation option by

setting the minimum fee at                $2,115 (commensurate with a minimum required account

balance of $150,000         1.41%). In sensitivity analysis, we also analyze how different fixed fees

affect investor behavior and welfare.

        The efficiency function for financial decision making is assumed to be convex, as

discussed above. Investors around age 50 are assumed to be most financially savvy with

        0.03; that is, they sacrifice only 3% of their normalized time to manage their own

portfolios. Our time cost estimate of 3% is based on the American Time Use Survey (ATUS

2012), where people spend an average of 0.35 hours a day on financial management, or around 3%

of the 13 hours of daily discretionary time (calculated by deducting time spent on necessary

activity such as sleeping, eating/drinking, essential household activities, and caring for household

members). Young investors are assumed to be less efficient (                   0.09) than the middle-aged.
                                                                      .    .
The functional form for efficiency is assumed to be                                     30       0.03, where

the 4th power generates modest efficiency pattern changes around middle-age. In a later section,


24
   This is one reason that our baseline model without a delegation option appears realistic for the majority of
real-world investors.
                                                                                                 19


we also conduct sensitivity analysis assuming different levels and shapes for the active

management inefficiency function. Baseline parameters are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1 here



5. Results and Discussion

       We next describe investor behavior when no delegation option is available, and after that,

we report results when individuals can elect and delegate money matters to a financial advisor.

We use the optimal controls of the baseline parameterization to generate 2,000 simulated

lifetimes reflecting realizations of stock returns and labor income shocks. All investors begin

with a zero stock account balance (i.e., no inheritance,   ,   0).

5.1 Profiles for Consumption, Wealth, Earnings, Stock Holdings, and Labor Supply: No

Delegation Option

       Figure 1 summarizes our baseline results for the key choice variables (consumption,

wealth, labor supply, and earnings) when delegation is not an option. Panel A indicates that the

model generates hump-shaped wealth, earnings, and consumption profiles over the life cycle,

consistent with those reported in other studies (e.g., Gomes et al. 2008). Consumption drops

sharply at age 66 when households retire and begin to consume more leisure. Such a profile is in

line with other life cycle models with endogenous work hours (Chai et al., 2011); it is also in line

with empirical studies documenting a substantial decline in spending around the retirement date

(Battistin et al. 2009). Panel B illustrates the average stock balance which also traces out a

hump-shaped pattern over the life cycle. Starting with no stock balance, individuals then invest

more in the stock market until they retire, after which they gradually decrease their exposure to

stocks. This result is consistent with empirical findings of a hump-shaped equity share profile

along with a hump-shaped wealth profile over the life cycle (Ameriks and Zeldes 2004). Panel C
                                                                                                  20


traces the labor supply pattern which is slightly hump-shaped over time. Average lifetime labor

supply equals 0.35, which corresponds to about 1,820 work hours per year (assuming a time

endowment of 100 waking hours per week). This is similar to prior work (see Gomes et al. 2003

and 2008, Chai et al. 2011) and it is also in line with empirical evidence for U.S. workers.25. On

average, the stock of human capital rises with age, but at a decreasing rate.

Figure 1 here

5.2 Portfolio Inertia and Equity Choices: No Delegation Option

       Figure 2 shows optimal choice patterns of portfolio management method and equity

holdings over the life cycle when delegation is unavailable. Panel A illustrates how people

optimally manage their portfolios depending on whether inertia or active management dominates.

As is evident, inertia is the dominant strategy for young investors to about age 30; thereafter,

active management becomes more prevalent until retirement, whereupon even more switch to

active management early in retirement (the fraction of active managing investors rises from

around half at age 64 to about 60% at age 65). Later in life, people again revert to inertia.

Figure 2 here

       The reason for this pattern is that the young have little financial wealth, but they will need

forgo much human capital investment when they devote time to manage their meager financial

assets. They also have a longer horizon over which they can use their human capital to generate

labor earnings. Conversely, later in life, people have more wealth and a smaller opportunity cost

of time. This is because they have a shorter work lives remaining and have already accumulated

substantial human capital. Accordingly, sacrificing a small amount of time to manage their

25
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS Economic releases Table B-2) report average weekly working
hours of 34.6 hours. The OECD documents about 1,800 annual working hours for U.S. workers
("http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=ANHRS"), which is similar value reported by Low
(2005) using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey.
                                                                                                        21


finances has only a modest impact on their wages. Still, however, almost half of the middle-aged

group does not change portfolio allocations; such a high level of inactivity is consistent with

several empirical studies (Ameriks and Zeldes 2004; Bilias et al. 2009; Calvet et al. 2009a;

Mitchell et al. 2007; and Vissing-Jorgensen 2003). Among the older group with lower wealth,

their reduced decision making efficiency and increased mortality risk somewhat depresses their

interest in active management. Early in retirement, older people are much more likely to switch

to active management to rebalance their portfolios, now that they have more free time. The

fraction of actively managing investors thus jumps from 50% at age 64 to about 60% at age 65.

As time goes by, however, reduced wealth and income shrink the budget constraint for

consumption, which in turn reduces utility from actively managing financial assets. Additionally,

rising mortality risk boosts their preference for current consumption and leisure. These factors all

lead to more inertia later in life.

        Our U-shaped pattern of portfolio inertia is compatible with available empirical evidence.

For instance, in our model, young investors who start with a zero stock account balance remain

out of the stock market (i.e. S       Z    0). This is consistent with results in the PSI from Bilias et

al. (2009). Our model also implies that middle-aged and older investors are more likely to

particpate in the market, but older investors exhibit more inertia. This conforms to evidence from

Bilias et al. (2009) who showed that the conditional probability of inertia is lower for the middle

aged, whereas older investors are less likely to trade than the middle-aged even when they hold

stocks.26   In sum, our baseline settings appear to be in line with empirically-observed U-shaped




26
    In an untabulated analysis of our simulated data, we find that young investors, conditional on holding
stocks, are more likely to trade compared to middle-aged investors consistent with the PSID data (Bilias et
al. 2009).
                                                                                                     22


inertia patterns. Young investors tend not to hold stocks, and older investors do but tend not to

trade.

          It is also of interest to note that our overall inertia levels are comparable to the empirical

findings reported by Bilias et al. (2009). For instance, across all age groups, they find 40-70%

inertia among stock owners (depending on the survey year); our model generates 47% inertia

among those who own stocks (and 57% unconditional on stock ownership). If we were to use a

the narrower definition of inertia meaning no trading in a five-year time span, our model

generates 33% inertia conditional on stock holding, close to the 39-56% fraction over a five-year

period in the data.

          Panel B of Figure 2 illustrates the fraction of financial wealth invested in equity changes

over the life cycle when no delegation option is available.27 The solid line reflects the average

fraction in equities for the subgroup of inertia investors. The dotted line refers to the

corresponding equity share for active investors (the overall average is indicated by the dashed

line). Consistent with most prior life cycle models with uncertain labor income, active investors

hold almost 100% of their savings in equity early in life, and glide down to lower shares as they

age. The explanation is that future labor income can be thought of as a implicit bond position, so

workers will seek to diversify their overall wealth position consisting of human capital and

financial wealth. Conditional on becoming active, they follow the traditional investment strategy

recommended by previous life cycle studies (as in Cocco et al. 2005; and Merton 1971). By

contrast, inertia investors allocate less to equity when young and invest more in equity when old.

This is because young investors start with a zero stock balance and little wealth, so they are more

likely to choose inertia and hence invest nothing in equity. As they accumulate wealth, they begin


27
     In our notation, the equity share of each investor is defined as   ⁄    .
                                                                                                      23


to manage more actively and accumulate equity. Between age 30 and 60, the equity fraction of

the inertia investor is rather flat, at around 60%. Interestingly, at retirement there is a sharp drop

of the equity fraction for inertia investors. The reason is that early retirees reallocate substantial

amounts of equities once toward bonds before they start to draw down during retirement. This, in

turn, can be explained by the fact that older investors facing rising mortality risk and more

inefficiency in financial decision making understand that active financial management implies

rising opportunity costs.28 Because inertia-investors gradually deplete their wealth from their

bond accounts and defer selling off their equity accounts, their equity share increases over time in

later years.

        Overall, combining the cases of inertia and active-management investors, we observe that

the average equity share (the dashed line in Figure 2, Panel B) rises for younger individuals and

declines steadily afterwards. Although those electing active management at older ages optimally

choose lower equity shares, the fact that older inertia investors retain a high equity share implies

that stock holdings do not decline sharply with age. In sum, in our model people optimally do not

invest in stocks early in their life, but in middle age they gradually move into stock, and then they

curtail stockholdings later in life, while still retaining a reasonable share.

        Figure 3 displays scatter plots of stock account balances for active and inertia investors;

the solid line indicates average stock balances in each case. It is clear that those active managers

hold more in equities than do inertia investors. Individuals having greater equity exposure find it

optimal to allocate more time to portfolio management and become active investors. Nevertheless,

the average does not imply that all inertia investors eschew equities. In fact, as the right panel in

Figure 3 illustrates, a large group of those who are inactive still hold substantial stock positions.

28
   The gradual decumuation of assets from the bond account is not due to time costs, in contrast to
transactions from the stock account.
                                                                                                   24


If an investor expects he will end up choosing a similar consumption/labor supply pair next

period, a small change in his portfolio will be costly without enhancing his discounted lifetime

utility. In such a case, it will then be optimal for him not to alter his portfolio (Appendix B

discusses a sufficient condition for inertia choice).

Figure 3 here

       Table 2 illustrates how portfolio inertia and equity trading patterns vary over the life cycle.

We also show how patterns differ by wealth level (above and below $150,000), to illustrate how

wealth is related to portfolio management choice and subsequent trading patterns. Some

two-thirds (67%) of the lower wealth middle-aged investors elect inertia, while only one-fifth

(20%) of the same age group with more than $150,000 elect inertia. This pattern confirms to our

model of the opportunity costs of active financial management: low-wealth investors do not

sacrifice time to manage their accounts, while wealthier individuals do. Table 2 also shows that

the factors driving active management vary over the work life. Active investors buy stocks while

young and sell their stocks while old. In the 20-35 age range, almost two-thirds (62%) of wealthy

investors buy equities seeking to capture the equity premium; in their 60s and 70s, almost 60%

actively sell stocks to finance consumption.

Table 2 here

       Table 3 presents summary statistics concerning the dynamics of portfolio management

methods when no delegation option is feasible. On average, the first time that people elect active

management is about nine years after entering the labor force. They elect inertia for 46 years and

manage their own portfolios for 34 years, altering their management strategies 12 times over their

lifetimes. Some 12% of people (=1-[1,767/2,000]) never elect active management and remain

inactive throughout their entire lifetimes.

Table 3 here
                                                                                               25


5.3 Portfolio Management: With a Delegation Option

       Next we turn to an evaluation of how portfolio management methods change optimally

when a financial advisor is available. Table 4 summarizes results. On average, investors now

change their portfolio management approach much more often, almost 19 times over their lives

(18.82, versus 11.55 in Table 3), and they elect inertia for a shorter period (44.94 years, versus

45.97 in Table 2). Of most interest is the fact that people devote about half as many years to

active management (17.69 versus 34.03 previously), and they engage advisors for just under

one-quarter of their adult lives (=17.36 years/80). Investors begin to delegate relatively soon,

only 8.39 years from starting work, and about 80% of people elect to delegate at some point

(79%=1,581/2,000). Additionally, when delegation is an option, fewer choose active

management and those who do, begin later, 14.31 years after starting work (versus 8.95 in Table

3).

Table 4 here

       Table 5 shows what happens when investors can delegate their investment management to

a financial advisor. Panel A illustrates patterns of portfolio managment methods by age, where

we see that access to delegation reduces inertia and active-management, compared to the findings

in Figure 2. Delegation is attractive for investors of all ages: approximately 19% of investors

younger than age 35, 2% of middle-aged investors (age 30-65), and around 37% of old retirees

(age 80+) now optimally delegate to a financial advisor. Access to delegation substantially

reduces active management, especially among the youngest and oldest investors. Active

management is adopted by only a small fraction of the youngest (8%) and oldest investors (2%),

but by many more (around 30%) middle-aged and early retirees (about 50%). Early retires

become the most active investor group because they have no opportunity cost of forgone labor

supply and must optimally withdraw from their stock accounts to meet retirement consumption
                                                                                                  26


needs. Rather than paying a delegation fee, they instead actively manage their stock accounts by

withdrawing before mortality risk rises, and prior to a decline in decision making efficiency.

Table 5 here

        Panel B of Table 5 decomposes portfolio management methods when the delegation

option is available. Among those initially electing inertia or active management, younger and

older investors are more likely to switch to delegation. Among middle-aged individuals (36-65),

active investors are more likely to continue with active management. This pattern is related to the

opportunity cost of time. Young investors, who have the longest horizon to earn human capital

returns, find it optimal to elect the delegation option. Older investors facing high mortality risk

and inefficiency of financial management also favor financial advisors, to save them leisure time.

By contrast, middle-aged investors with high wealth and human capital face a lower opportunity

cost of time, and hence they will manage their portfolios themselves and avoid paying the

delegation fee. Early retirees are more likely to engage in active management as they need not

worry about accumulating job-specific skills any more. It should be noted that the decision to

delegate among the young and old investors is affected by the assumption regarding a required

minimum fixed fee: some inertia investors cannot gain access to financial advisors, as they have

insufficient wealth. Below we discuss how lowering the minimum fixed fee shapes investors’

decisions to hire an advisor.

        Panel C of Table 5 represents the average fraction of savings invested in equities,

depending on whether the investor elected inertia, active management, or delegation. For

investors choosing active management, the fraction of savings invested in equity follows an

age-related glide path consistent with the traditional portfolio choice literature. Inertia investors

hold little equity when young and more equity when old, similar to the no delegation case.
                                                                                                   27


Interestingly, the delegated portfolio also follows a downward-sloping glide path, but the slope is

flatter.

           Table 6 summarizes changes in behavior when a delegation option is available for wealth,

equity share, labor income, labor supply, human capital, and consumption by age. All are

expressed as a percent of the no-delegation base case. Results show that having access to an

advisor increases wealth by 0.5-1.7% across age groups. This is due to the higher equity share

noted above, and also to spending more time on the job which builds human capital. Having

access to an advisor also increases leisure around 2-4% during the work and about 7% in

retirement, and raises consumption considerably among the young.

Table 6 here

5.4 Determinants of Portfolio Management Methods

           Next we use descriptive multinomial Logit regressions to summarize the factors

associated with investors’ portfolio management methods in our simulated data. Tables 7 and 8

show how the probability of choosing inertia over active management when a delegation option

is (or is not) available, is associated to lagged wealth, stock market shocks, and wage shocks.

Tables 7 and 8 here

           When no delegation is feasible, wealthier investors are less likely to engage in inertia as

indicated in the first column of Table 7 and consistent with empirical findings (Agnew et al. 2003,

Bilias et al. 2008, and Calvet et al. 2009). This is because sticking to a non-optimal level of

equity exposure is more costly for them, compared to the less wealthy. The second column

indicates that investors experiencing negative stock market shocks and positive wage shocks are

more likely to elect portfolio inertia, due to their need to invest more in human capital and avoid

risky equity. Investors experiencing good labor market shocks elect inertia rather than actively

managing their assets, as their opportunity costs of active management are higher. Having a
                                                                                                  28


lagged negative stock market shock reduces investor overall wealth, which subsequently

decreases their interest in actively managing their portfolios. The third column includes all

regressors, and results are similar.

       A similar analysis but now allowing delegation is provided in Table 8. Panel A uses

active management as the reference group; as before, wealthier individuals are less likely to

engage in inertia. Comparing delegation and active management, people with additional wealth

would like to choose active management. Although wealthy investors have more need to delegate,

they also must pay higher delegation fees; in our model, the cost outweighs the benefits. Negative

stock market shocks make inertia more attractive than active management, as before, but they

also enhance the appeal of delegation over active management because people find it optimal to

pay a delegation fee given their lower wealth rather than incurring the opportunity time cost.

       Positive wage shocks lead investors to choose inertia over active management, but they

have two offsetting effects on the delegation versus active management decision. A positive wage

shock increases the opportunity cost of active management, but it also increases the advisory fee

due to higher wealth levels. Our analysis shows that the opportunity cost saving is more

influential than the wealth effect. In sum, negative wealth or stock return shocks, or positive labor

earnings surprises, lead investors to select inertia or delegation, and to avoid active management.

       Panel C of Table 8 uses inertia as the reference group, where we now see that wealthy

investors are more likely to choose delegation rather than inertia because suboptimal portfolio

choice is more costly to them, compared to their poorer counterparts. Positive stock market

surprises increase wealth so the cost of inertia rises, boosting demand for delegation. At the same

time, however, this also means they will pay more in fees, due to their greater wealth. In our

analysis, these costs and benefits offset each other, so positive stock surprises do not provide an
                                                                                                                       29


unambiguous prediction about the choice between delegation vs. inertia. Investors experiencing a

positive labor earnings shock are more likely to choose inertia over delegation.

           Comparing Panels A and B of Table 8, we can highlight what drives investors’

preferences for the three portfolio management methods given shocks. Favorable wealth shocks

lead to an overall preferred ordering of active management, delegation, and inertia. Positive stock

surprises make active management more attractive than delegation or inertia, without a clear

ranking of the latter two methods. In response to a favorable labor earnings development,

investors order the options as inertia, delegation, and active management.



6. Sensitivity Analysis and Welfare Gains from Access to Financial Advice

6.1 Examining the Impact of Learning by Doing

           To more clearly illustrate the importance of learning by doing in our model, we next

conduct a sensitivity analysis by building and solving a model without the learning by doing

mechanism used in our base case above. To do so, we restate the human capital function as

follows:

                                               1                                              .                 (20)

The experience accumulation part                   ,    in our original human capital accumulation process

is now replaced by a deterministic function of age with parameters (                                  ,   ,   ). We then

re-estimate parameters of this new human capital process (δ ,                         ,   ,       ,       , ) along with

parameters of wage rate shocks (transitory and permanent wage shock) by matching the model’s

moment conditions with the moments of empirically-observed wage profiles of male high school

graduates derived using the PSID (Hubener et al. 2013).29


29
     The estimated values are -0.0125 (δ ), -0.00012542 (δ ), 0.0011 (a ), -0.0080 (a ), 0.000081419 (a ), 6.49 % (λ),
                                                                                                                   30


         Having turned off learning by doing, we next re-solve the model and compare results with

our benchmark case (see Table 9). Before discussing findings, it is useful to note that there are

two competing forces driving inertia when there is no learning by doing. The first is the reduced

opportunity cost of active management which boosts active management (i.e., decreases inertia):

an investor managing his own assets must sacrifice only current leisure time or earnings, but not

future human capital. The second results from the reduced attractiveness of work given that

employment no longer enhances future wages. This reduces labor supply and earnings as well as

wealth, which in turn makes active management less profitable; the result is to discourage active

management (i.e., increase inertia).

Table 9 here

          Column 2 of Table 9 show that the latter effect dominates, with an overall increase in

inertia. Compared to the baseline (Column 1), the inertia fraction rises, on average, by 12.1%,

11.3%, and 9.7% for ages 20-45, 45-60, and 65+, respectively. Additionally, labor supply falls by

about 39% for those age 20-45 and 23% for those age 45-60. As anticipated, young investors

respond to the attractiveness of future labor market prospect more sensitively.

6.2 The Impact of the Initial Stock Market Participation Cost

         Next we extend our model to include a fixed initial cost of stock market participation (as

in Cocco 2005, Gomes and Michaelides 2005). Because our model already has a stock account

balance (Z ) as a state variable, we can define initial stock market participation as the case when

the investor’s current period’s stock balance (Z              is zero, but his chosen stock investment (S

out of savings is positive. This permits us to avoid creating an additional state variable.30



30.78% (transitory wage shock), 6.87% (permanent wage shock).

   This specification cannot rule out the possibility that an investor would need to incur participation costs again
when he returns to stock market after liquidating his entire equity position. However our simulation results show that
                                                                                                            31


         We model the fixed market participation cost as a fraction of the permanent wage shock

(as in Gomes and Michaelides 2005). Given an initial fixed cost of stock market participation,

wealth evolves as follows:

                                                                                       ,    ,
                                                                                                     (21)

where      ,   is a permanent wage shock and             ,   is an indicator variable for initial stock market

participation having 1 when Z               0 and S          0. As in Gomes and Michaelides (2005), the

fixed cost       is set at 2.5% of the permanent wage shock. Column 3 of Table 9 presents the

result of portfolio management methods with initial participation cost. The new solution shows

that overall pattern of inertia over the life cycle is same as before and the proportion of inertia

managers increases only marginally in the early years. In the first 20 years, initial participation

costs increases inertia only by 1.8%; after that the impact becomes minimal. In other words, an

initial participation cost cannot fully explain observed inertia patterns in the data.

         We also conduct a test to determine whether the U-shaped time cost is responsible for the

the U-shaped pattern of inertia over the life cycle. Our analysis shows that this is not the case. For

instance, when we set the time cost at 3% for all ages, column 4 of Table 9 shows that 70% of

young investors (age 20-35) choose inertia, 49% of middle-aged investors (ages 50-65), 40% of

early retirees (age 65-80), and 55 % of old investors (age 80+). The ratio of inertia investors is

slightly lower for the youngest and oldest investors, compared to the baseline case, but the

U-shaped pattern is still clearly evident.

         Column 5 of Table 9 presents a sensitivity analysis for college graduates, to evaluate how

wage/age profiles influences results. We re-estimate parameters of the human capital process

with the observed wage trend for college graduates in the PSID and re-solve the model.


the fraction of returning stock investors is minimal to none (zero in 2,000 simulations).
                                                                                                                      32


Compared to the baseline case of high school graduates, college graduates earn higher labor

income, have higher wealth, work more, and invest more in equity. Compared to the baseline

case, the inertia level for college grads is modestly less than for the high school educated: 73% vs

76% for ages 20-35, 46% vs. 50% for ages 50-65, and 40% vs. 44% for ages 80+). The U-shaped

pattern of inertia again persists.

6.3 Welfare Analysis of a Delegation Option and Sensitivity Analysis

          To assess how consumers value access to a delegation option, we next compare donsumer

welfare in a delegation regime versus that in a no-delegation world. We measure this in terms of

a certainty equivalent (CE) consumption stream change, or the stream of consumption that would

afford the investor the same level of expected lifetime utility if he lacked access to the delegation
                                                                   31
option, versus having it (Cocco et al. 2005).                           Table 10, Panel A, shows for our baseline

specification (Column 1) that providing investors with access to a financial advisor increases

lifetime welfare by the equivalent of a 1.2% enhancement in their annual consumption streams.

This is similar in magnitude to that reported in Cocco et al. (2005), who compared welfare levels

in two worlds, one with a fixed and the other with a flexible equity share.

Table 10 here

          We also conduct a sensitivity analysis for different costs of financial advice, to evaluate

investors’ potential welfare gains from lowering entry barriers to financial advisory services. As

noted above, current industry practice is to set a minimum fixed fee commensurate with a
31
     The certainty equivalent constant consumption stream                 is defined as:
                                                       1                                             1
             ,   ,   ,                                                                                       ∗
                                                   1                                             1
where ∗ is a fixed level of leisure and                ,   ,   ,        is a pair of state variables. With some algebraic
manipulation, we get:
                                                            1
                                                   ∑        ∏         ∗
In calculating this measure, we set leisure   ∗   as time deducted from mean labor hours over working years.
                                                                                                33


required minimum asset balance of about $240,000, which is high compared to average investors’

asset levels. Column 2 of Panel A shows that eliminating the minimum fee for advisory services

would raise welfare by 1.43%, compared to the case where no delegation is available. This

welfare improvement results from the fact that less-wealthy investors gain access to cheapter

financial advice, allowing them to use their time for leisure or work. Column 2 of Panel B shows

that, compared to the baseline case, eliminating the minimum fee leads younger investors (age

20-35) to increase their usage of a financial advisor by 15% percentage points, and in retirement,

financial advice utilization rises by about 8%. At the same time, both inertia and active

management decline. Conversely, as seen in Column 3, Panel A, a higher minimum fee

commensurate with the industry’s average required minimum balance of around $250,000 cuts

the welfare gains by about 20%, compared to the case of no minimum fee (Column 2). In Panel B,

Column 3, we see that very few people, mainly those at the top of the wealth distribution, access

the servce at this higher cost. Only about 1.8% of young investors (aged 20~35) select the

delegation option and during retirement, only about 15% seek financial advice.32 Compared to

the no minimum fee case (Column 2), a higher minimum fee induces the young (age 20-35) and

older (age 65+) investors to choose more inertia than middle-aged investors. In this case, when

portfolio adjustment becomes necessary, most people find it optimal to manage their money

themselves (i.e., actively manage), rather than to pay the high advisory fee (i.e., delegation). In

other words, lowering the entry barrier to financial advisory services can help people of all ages

(especially the young and the old) manage their financial assets optimally, and thereby save their

scarcest resource, time for accumulating more job-specific skills or enjoying leisure.




   32
        With this level of minium fee, retirees (aged +65) become the main customer group.

7.     Conclusion

           Though individuals are increasingly expected to manage their own finances with

ever-more complex financial products, most people in fact exhibit investor inertia, devoting only

sparse attention to their financial portfolios and fail to actively manage their finances. To

understand what might seem to be puzzling behavior, we build and solve a realistically-calibrated

life cycle model where the time cost required to manage one’s portfolio is traded off with the

opporutnity to accumulate job-specific knowledge. Using reasonable parameters, we show that

our model implies sensible patterns of portfolio inertia across age groups. Investors who can

accumulate job-specific knowledge by working tend to devote less time to managing their money

when young. Middle-age individuals have more assets to invest and suffer less from the

opportunity costs of active portfolio management, though many still elect inertia. Declining

decision making efficiency and rising mortality risk later in life prompts many older investors to

elect portfolio inertia. When investors can delegate portfolio management to a financial advisor,

this enables many to avoid portfolio inertia. In general, our model predicts that younger and older

investors will find financial advisors most attractive. Finally, we find important welfare gains

result from having a delegation option.

           This research contributes to a growing body of research on decision making over the life

cycle,33 an area of substantial policy interest in the wake of the global financial crisis. In the US

for instance, the White House recently convened a multi-agency meeting of behavioral

economists and psychologists to better understand how decision making changes with age (NIA

2013). Our work adds to the discussion by developing and simulating a life cycle model to

illustrate optimal portfolio management methods selected by finitely-lived investors who face


33
     For instance, see Agarwal et al. (2009); Korniotis and Kumar (2011); and Samanez-Larkin and Knutson (2014).
                                                                                                         35


portfolio management costs and an age-dependent inefficiency pattern for financial decision

making.

           One topic we do not take up here is the possibility of a conflict of interest between an

investor seeking to maximize his utility, and his financial advisor seeking to maximize his own

income.34 For example, if an advisor’s compensation is commission-based, he may be more

likely to encourage return-chasing or high-fee actively managed mutual funds (Mullainathan et al.

2012). The present paper considers only fee-based advice, which is less susceptible to such

conflicts, but future work could consider the potential for moral hazard if investors are

uninfomed. Additional extensions might also extend our model with parameter uncertainty and

learning (Brennan 1998; Xia 2001). Nevertheless our key insight linking job-specific human

capital and portfolio inertia will still be relevant, as long as a time cost of financial management

has negative consequences for labor market earnings.

           Our findings should be of interest to a variety of stakeholders including individual

investors, financial advisors, retirement plan sponsors, and policymakers. In particular, we show

that those who most value financial advisory services are the young and the older age groups, so

making such services available can enhance their well-being. Also of interest is the prediction

that some middle-aged clients will wish to continue actively manage their own financial assets,

even when a delegation option is available. Policymakers could do more to enhance welfare gains

by improving investor access to financial advisory services. When financial advisors with

fiduciary responsibility can help investors manage their financial wealth optimally, this will

enable more people to accrue job-specific skills, thus contributing to the economy as a whole.

Notes: This table shows the proportion of investors by total wealth and age who exhibited inertia (i.e., no
stock purchase), purchased additional stock, or sold stock. Results tabulated from 2,000 independent
simulation runs of base case model without a delegation option. The cut-off point for total wealth (see
equation 8) is based on the medium level of wealth for middle-aged investors.

Notes: Results tabulated from 2,000 simulation runs of base case model. No. of switches refers to the
number of times someone changed portfolio management method (from active-managed to inertia or vice
versa) between age 20 and 100, conditional on survival. Years of inertia refers to the total length of the
inertia period for specific simulated life cycle paths, and years of active mgmt refers to the total length of
the active management period over specific simulated life cycle paths. First year of active mgmt refers to
the first year when an individual changes from inertia to active management. Some people never elect
active management and remain inactive throughout their entire lifetimes which is why the total number of
observations of first year of active mgmt is less than the total number of simulations.

Notes: For definitions, see Table 3. Also Years of delegation refers to the length of the delegated
management period for the specified simulated life cycle paths. First year delegation refers to the first
year when people change to delegation from inertia or from active management. Results tabulated from
2,000 simulation runs of base case model. Some people never elect active management or delegation
which is why the total number of observations of first year of active mgmt and first year delegation is less
than the total number of simulations.

Notes: This table illustrates life cycle patterns of portfolio management methods and equity share when
delegation is feasible. Panel A shows the fraction of investors selecting inertia, active management, or
delegation by age. Panel B traces trasitions across portfolio management methods, given a delegation
option. Panel C depicts the average fraction of saving invested in equities depending on whether the
investor elects inertia, active management, or delegation. Savings is the total wealth minus consumption.
Averages are generated from 2,000 independent simulations for individuals based on optimal feedback
controls from the baseline specification of the life cycle model.

Notes: The numbers represent the percentage increase in key variables for all individuals summed over
those in the age group having access to a delegation option versus not having access to a delegation
option. Equity share is a fraction of equity investment in savings ( ⁄      ). Averages for total wealth
are value-weighted. See text.

Notes: Each column reports the estimated impact of variables from separate Multinomial Logit
regressions where the dependent variable: 0 = inertia, 1= active, and 2 = delegation. Individual fixed
effects are controlled. Observations of active management account for 22.13% of the sample; inertia for
55.54%; and 22.33% for delegation respectively. Standard errors in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate
statistical significance at 10%, 5%, and 1% respectively. See text.

Notes: This table shows life cycle patterns of key variables for different model specifications. Column 1
uses baseline parameters as in Table 1. Columnn 2 shows results when human capital is deterministic over
the life cycle, without learning by doing. Column 3 shows results when an investor must pay a fixed initial
stock market participation cost in addition to recurring time cost. Column 4 provides results when the time
cost of active management is set at 3% for all ages. Column 5 shows results when the endogenous human
capital process is matched with the wage trend s for of college graduates in the PSID.

Note: Panel A presents welfare gain/loss of having a delegation option versus a no-delegation base case,
for alternative model specifications on minimum fixed delegation fees. Welfare Gain is the percentage
increase in certainty-equivalent consumption stream compared to the no-delegation (baseline) case. Panel
B describes the proportion of investors electing each portflio management method under different
specifications on minimum fixed delegation. Delegation, Inertia,and Active mgmt refer to the proportions
of investors choosing delegation, inertia, and active management, respectively. Column 1 shows baseline
results with minimum fee of $2,115 (commensumrate with a minimum balance of $150,000). Column 2
provides results from having no minimum fee for delegation. Column 3 reports results from imposing a
minimum fee commensurate with a higher required minimum balance ($243,360), consistent with the
industry average.

Notes: This figure shows life cycle patterns of portfolio management method and equity shares selected
with no delegation option. Panel A shows the fraction of investors selecting inertia versus active

Appendix A: Derivation of Financial Advisor Fees

        To evaluate fees charged by registered investment advisors (RIAs) in the U.S., we have
tallied information from disclosure documents (Form ADV) filed with the U.S. Securities and
Commissions (SEC) offic as of July 1, 2014. As is clear from Table A1, the percentage fee of
total asset under management is the most common fee type used by financial advisors, though
other charge structures are also found (percentages do not add to 100% as advisors use more than
one fee structure).
        We also explored who these advisors’ clients were, and we found that most catered to
individual investors. As we wished to get realistic fees for individual investors, we focused on
advisors where individual clients comprised most (>three-quarters) of their practice of at least
100 clients. For our subsanple, the average percentage fee of total assets under management was
1.410% per year.
        It is also worth noting that, for these advisors, minimum required account balances
averaged around $240,000. In our model, this threshold for adopting delegation would discourage
almost all investors. Accordingly, we explore sensitivity to this choice by setting a lower account
balance for delegation of $150,000 in Section 6.

QED

Discussion:
If next period’s labor and consumption levels resulting from porfolio active management are very
similar to those resulting from inertia, there will be a ‘dominant boundary of portfolio inertia’
where inertia will be preferred to active management. In other words, if an investor expects he
will end up choosing a similar consumption/labor supply pair next period, a small change in his
portfolio will be costly without enhancing his discounted lifetime utility. In such a case, it will
then be optimal for him not to alter his portfolio.

Appendix C. Numerical Solution Procedure35

Here we describe our procedure for obtaining the numerical solution to the investor’s problem. In
the last period of life T, assuming            0 and          0 (inertia), the investor maximizes his
utility by consuming his available liquid assets (               ) for every pair of state variables
      , , ,      . In period T−1, we calculate         ,       ,       using their definitions and the
Monte Carlo integration (based on 50 runs) of                             , , ,         , as well as
Nelder-Mead optimization over              ,    ,       . Of course,                    in calculating
       . We approxiate value functions using multi-linear interpolation for state variables not
contained in the discretized set of grids (see Brandt et al. 2005).

Accordingly, we get                   ,      ,     ,         max         ,    ,       . When
        max        ,     ,     , portfolio inertia is optimal. Different choices of management
method are derived similarly. Iterating these steps until the first period, we get the value
functions         which completely characterize the solution to the investor’s problem. Last, we
generate 2,000 sample paths for individual investors using variations of the wage shock and
uncertain stock market returns

For multi-linear interpolation, we extend a one-variable linear interpolation to a multivariable
setting. Given a current state (               , , ,        ), the next period’s realized state
(      ,     ,     ,      ) is determined by the current period’s choices (portfolio management
method:       , labor supply: l , equity investment amount: S , and consumption: C ) and
exogenous shocks (stock return: , shock to human capital: λ and persistent/transitory wage
shock). It is possible that the realized state variable set (     ,      ,     ,     ) does not belong
to a set of discretized state variables        ,     ,     ,      , , ,
                                                                        in the next period. To address
this issue, we find adjacent two state variables for each realized state variable. For example, for
a potential wealth level (         ) in the next period, we find nearest two grid points,       and
        among discretized wealth grids              such that                      . For a realized
set of state variables (       ,       ,    ,     ), there will be 16 sets of close state variables
         ,     ,      ,      ,         ,      ,     ,       for which we know the value of value
functions                 ,      ,       ,      ,…,           ,    ,      ,         by preceding
backward value function iterations.

The value of V            ,     ,     ,       will be determined by a weighted sum of value
functions of nearest state variables. We use the inverse of distance between realized state
variables and each set of close state variables as a weight for the corresponding value function.
Denote D , , , as the distance from             ,    ,    ,         to       ,     ,    ,       ,
which is defined as the ordinary Euclidean distance:

 D,    , ,                                                                                   .

 The corresponding weight (        , , ,   ) is constructed as

     This numerical procedure is implemented with FORTRAN90 and the GNU Gfortran compiler.

                                                              1
                                                             D, ,   ,
                                 , , ,   ≡
                                                                             1
                                                 ∑       ∑   ∑          ∑
                                                                            D,   , ,


Thus, the further distant the nearby state variables are from the realized state, the less weight will
be assigned to its value function. And of course, the sum of weights is equal to one by
construction (∑ , , ,      1).

        The value of V            ,          ,       ,           is estimated as a weighted sum of adjacent
value functions:
  V          ,     ,     ,                                                   , , ,      ,    ,     ,


      The above interpolation method is implemented both in VFI and simulations finding the
maximized future continuous values and corresponding maximal choice variables (i.e., portfolio
management method, labor supply, equity investment, consumption). In the course of
implementation, we impose a restriction that the equity balance cannot exceed total wealth
(            ).

Appendix D. Calibrating the Learning by Doing Mechanism

This Appendix explains how we calibrate the parameters in the learning by doing mechanism.
We first estimated the parameters by matching wage profiles generated by a learning by doing
mechanism with the conventional wage profile in the life cycle portfolio choice literature (e.g.,
Gomes and Michaelides 2005; Cocco et al. 2005). To be precise, we generated 3,000 life cycle
wage paths based on age-dependent wage trend for male high school graduates, assuming an
idiosyncratic wage shock and a permanent wage shock with the parameters reported in Hubener
et al. (2013). We also generate 3,000 life cycle paths of wages based on our learning by doing
mechanism (formula (2)), allowing varying levels of skill formation uncertainty (λ), the
depreciation rate for human capital, learning efficiency (a), returns to scale (θ), and idiosyncratic
and permanent wage shocks with an assumed level of average labor supply level (0.35).

For each potential candidate set of parameters, we calculated moment conditions by year of age
including average and standard deviation of wages, skewness and kurtosis of mean wages, and
maximum and minimum average wages. Then we estimated these parameters by minimizing the
numerical distance between moment conditions generated by learning by doing mechanism with
labor market shocks and moment conditions generated by the conventional wage profile as in
Hubener et al. (2013). An illustration of the match is presented below.

Note: This figure shows patterns of average wage profiles generated by the human capital accumulation
process with labor market shocks (dotted line) and the empirical data from the PSID (solid line). The wage
path is normalized by the first year’s wage.
