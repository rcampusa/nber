The Distribution of Payroll and Income Tax Burdens, 1979-1999
Andrew Mitrusi and James Poterba
NBER Working Paper No. 7707
May 2000
JEL No. H2



                                           ABSTRACT

       This paper presents new evidence on the level and distribution of income and payroll tax
burdens for U.S. families over the 1979-1999 period. During this period, payroll taxes have become
an increasingly important component of the tax burden for many low- and middle-income families.
This paper uses a new and expanded version of the NBER TAXSIM program to analyze the impact
of legislative changes in income and payroll taxes. Averaged over all families, the combined 1999
payroll and income tax burden was quite similar to what it would have been if the 1979 income and
payroll tax laws had remained in force for the last two decades, with only inflation-based
adjustments to tax brackets. The mix of income and payroll taxes has changed, however. As a result
of the expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as well as other
changes in the federal personal income tax, payroll tax liabilities now exceed income tax liabilities
for nearly two thirds of families. In 1979, payroll taxes exceeded income taxes for 44 percent of
families.

        The relative importance of income taxes and payroll taxes in the federal fiscal system has shifted

dramatically in the last four decades. Until 1963, federal receipts from the individual income tax were

more than twice as great as federal payroll tax revenues. In 1995, payroll tax receipts were approximately

equal to income tax receipts. While income tax revenues rose more sharply than payroll taxes in the late

1990s, the long-term projections of growing outlays for Social Security and Medicare suggest that the

payroll taxes used to finance these programs will remain a central component of the fiscal landscape.

        The importance of considering the tax burden from both income and payroll taxes is evident in

earlier studies that combine payroll and income taxes, such as those by the Joint Committee on Taxation

(1993) or the Congressional Budget Office (1998). The expansion of the Earned Income Credit during

the 1990s has reduced and in some cases eliminated personal income tax liability for many low-income

families. Payroll taxes nevertheless remain significant for most of these families. Recent changes in the

payroll tax, notably elimination of the taxable earnings maximum for the Hospital Insurance tax, have

also affected the magnitude of payroll tax liabilities for many upper income families.

        This paper investigates the relative importance of income and payroll tax burdens for families at

different points in the income distribution. The analysis focuses on the period 1979 to 1999, and it

includes an investigation of how the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (TRA97) affected the distribution of

personal income tax burdens in the late 1990s. The analysis relies on an expanded and updated version of

the National Bureau of Economic Research's TAXSIM model. We extend this model, which has

historically been used to study only changes in the distribution of income tax burdens, to include payroll

taxes as well.

        The paper is divided into four sections. The first summarizes the key legislative changes in both

the payroll tax and the income tax over the 1979-1999 period. It describes the Taxpayer Relief Act of

1997 in particular detail, since that reform receives special emphasis in our analysis. Section two presents

summary information on the distribution of income and payroll tax liabilities over the 1979-1999 period.

It considers the average income and payroll tax burden on families in various income categories, as well

as the fraction of families for which payroll taxes exceed income taxes. The analysis highlights the role


                                                                                                             1
of the Earned Income Tax Credit in affecting family tax burdens. We compare tax burdens under

different tax regimes using two baseline distributions of family income, one based on income tax returns

and other data from 1995, and the other based on similar data from 1979. Section three presents a

detailed summary of how the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 affected income tax burdens for families in

different income categories. A brief concluding section outlines several issues that remain for future

research. A substantial appendix describes the TAXSIM payroll tax calculator. It also explains the

algorithms that we use to identify families that do not file income tax returns, to allocate labor income

between spouses in married couples, and to impute eligibility for various tax credits that were enacted in

the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.



1. Federal Income and Payroll Tax Changes, 1979-1999

        There have been four major legislative changes in the federal personal income tax code in the last

two decades. The payroll tax has also been changed several times, but the changes have been less

dramatic than those in the income tax code. This section summarizes these legislative changes.

1.1 Federal Income Tax Changes, 1979-1999

        There were four major federal income tax reforms during the 1979-1999 period. These were the

Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA), the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA86), the Omnibus

Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA93), and the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (TRA97). These

reforms are described in detail elsewhere, for example Steuerle (1992), so with the exception of TRA97,

we will not provide an in-depth summary.

        ERTA significantly reduced personal income taxes across-the-board. It incorporated a three-year

period of tax reduction, with marginal rates on all but the highest income taxpayers declining substantially

during the 1981-1984 period. The top marginal tax rate on earned income was 50 percent before as well

as after ERTA, but the legislation reduced the top marginal rate on unearned income from 70 percent to

50 percent beginning in 1981. This reform also reduced the top statutory marginal tax rate on long-term




                                                                                                             2
capital gains from 28 percent to 20 percent. We consider tax burdens in 1984 in our analysis below,

because by 1984 the ERTA reforms were fully effective.

        TRA86 continued the reduction in top marginal tax rates that had been part of ERTA, but it also

eliminated the capital gains tax preference for most taxpayers. For taxpayers at the highest income levels,

TRA86 reduced marginal tax rates from 50 percent in 1986, to 39 percent in 1987 and to 28 percent in 1988.

TRA86 introduced a hump-shaped pattern in marginal tax rates, with some taxpayers below the highest

income groups facing a 33 percent marginal tax rate. It also eliminated the tax preference for capital gains,

although the tax rate on such gains was capped at 28 percent. This change increased the statutory tax rate on

gains for many high-income taxpayers. TRA86 raised the standard deduction and the personal exemption,

thereby reducing the number of low-income families that needed to file income tax returns. It also

expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit, which reduced income tax liabilities for low-income families with

earned income. Because some provisions in TRA86 phased in over two years, we consider tax liabilities in

1989 as an illustration of tax burdens under the TRA86 regime.

        OBRA93 partially reversed the changes in the top marginal tax rate that had been enacted in 1986.

In many ways it extended and amplified changes that were enacted as part of the Omnibus Budget

Reconciliation Act of 1990. The 1990 Act eliminated the "hump shaped" distribution of marginal tax rates

that was embodied in the 1986 law and replaced it with a top marginal tax rate of 31 percent. This led to a

three-bracket income tax rate schedule, with rates of 15, 28, and 31 percent. OBRA93 raised the top

marginal tax rate to 36% for joint filers with incomes above $140,000 ($115,000 for single filers). In

addition, it raised the marginal tax rate to 39.6% (36% plus a 10% surtax) for individual or married

taxpayers with taxable incomes of more than $250,000. Many high-income taxpayers face tax rates above

this statutory maximum of 39.6% as a result of the phase-out provisions governing various deductions.

OBRA93 also raised the share of Social Security benefits that could be taxed from 50 to 85 percent.

1.2 The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997

        TRA97 included a number of new tax credits and once again altered the tax rate on long-term

capital gains. The first such credit is the Child Tax Credit, which provides a $500 credit ($400 for 1998)


                                                                                                                3
for each qualified child of a taxpayer. To qualify, a child must be under the age of 17. This credit was

fully available to married joint filers with modified adjusted gross income (AGI) of less than $110,000,

and to single taxpayers or heads of household with modified AGI of less than $75,000. For each $1,000

of modified AGI in excess of these thresholds, the Child Tax Credit is reduced by $50 per child until the

credit is exhausted.

        The Child Tax Credit is not refundable, and it is only available for dependent children who are

under the age of 17. It does not generate any benefit for low-income families with no federal income tax

liabilities. Our estimates, which are described in more detail in the appendix, suggest that the Child Tax

Credit reduced family income tax liability for only 69.4 percent of under-17 dependents in 1999. (We

estimate that 76.3 percent of all dependents claimed on tax returns in 1995 were under the age of 17.)

Although some low-income families cannot use the Child Tax Credit to reduce their income tax liability,

a large fraction of the tax benefits associated with the Child Tax Credit accrue to low- and modest-income

families. We estimate that 35 percent of the under-17 dependents whose families benefit from the Child

Tax Credit have family incomes of less than $40,000.

        TRA97 also reduced the maximum tax rate on long-term capital gains from 28 percent to 20

percent, effective May 7, 1997. For taxpayers in the 15-percent income tax bracket, the maximum long-

term capital gains tax rate became 10 percent. TRA97 also introduced an "intermediate" capital gains tax

rate that applied to gains held from twelve to thirty months, but this rate was eliminated in 1998. Because

we consider tax liabilities for families facing the 1999 tax law, we do not consider the impact of the

intermediate capital gains tax rate.

        Finally, TRA97 included a number of new tax incentives for college attendance. The two most

significant are the HOPE Credit and the Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC). The HOPE credit is a non-

refundable credit of up to $1500 per student. It can be used to offset educational expenses in a student’s

first two years of post-secondary education. It is a 100 percent credit on the first $1000 of tuition and

fees, and a 50 percent credit on the next $1000 of such fees. The full value of the credit is available to

married joint filers with modified AGI of less than $80,000. The credit is completely phased out for


                                                                                                             4
married joint filers with modified AGI of more than $100,000. For heads of household and single filers,

the HOPE Credit phases out between $40,000 and $50,000 of modified AGI. The HOPE Credit can be

claimed by the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, or on behalf of any of the taxpayer's dependents.

        For families with a single HOPE Credit recipient, the phase-out of the credit raises marginal

income tax rates by 7.5 percent in the relevant AGI range. Some tax returns might have more than one

beneficiary, and for such returns, the marginal tax rate effects can be very large. To illustrate this,

consider a family with two children, ages 19 and 20, who are attending college. Assume that the family

has an adjusted gross income of $90,000. Before TRA97, this family faced a marginal federal income tax

rate of 28 percent. The HOPE phase-out raises this tax rate to 43 (28 + 2*7.5) percent. For a single-

parent family, the effect is even more dramatic, since the phase-out occurs over the $40-50,000 income

range. A single parent household with two HOPE credit recipients could therefore face a 30 percent

increase in marginal income tax rates as a result of the phase-out provisions.

        One important feature of the HOPE Credit, emphasized in Cronin (1997) and Dynarski (1999), is

that it applies to net tuition and fees. Federal Pell grants and other financial aid that post-secondary

schools provide to low-income enrollees can reduce the value of the HOPE Credit, and for some students,

they may render the HOPE credit worthless. (This fact has led to interesting discussions, summarized in

Dynarski (1999), about the ultimate incidence of the HOPE credit and the extent to which it benefits

students attending college or is offset by increases in the net price charged by post-secondary institutions.)

        The Lifetime Learning Credit provides taxpayers with a credit equal to 20 percent of net

educational expenditures, up to a maximum credit of $1,000. Like the HOPE Credit, the LLC is phased

out for married joint filers over the $80,000-$100,000 modified AGI range, and for single filers over the

$40-50,000 modified AGI range. The LLC is available to anyone enrolled in a post-secondary

educational institution. The phase-out raises marginal tax rates by up to 5 percentage points for families

in the phase-out income range. The LLC is computed on a per-return basis, rather than a per-student

basis, and it is not possible to claim both a HOPE Credit and a Lifetime Learning Credit for the same

eligible student. Because the HOPE Credit offers a 100 percent or a 50 percent credit, depending on the


                                                                                                             5
amount of tuition outlays, and the LLC offers only a 20 percent credit, those who can use the HOPE

Credit will presumably choose to use it before utilizing the Lifetime Learning Credit. The LLC is not

restricted to two years of higher education spending, as the HOPE Credit is.

        We estimate the distributional effects of the tax credits embodied in TRA97 by "aging" tax

returns from 1995 to 1999, and then imputing information on whether families are likely to have

dependents who are eligible for these credits. While detailed information on individual income tax

returns filed for the 1998 tax year will not be available for some time, the IRS has released preliminary

data on the use of education tax credits in 1998, and we compare our estimates with these actual data.

1.3 Changes in Payroll Tax Rates and the Payroll Tax Base, 1979-1999

        The payroll taxes that are used to finance the Social Security and Hospital Insurance (Medicare)

programs have not changed as dramatically as federal income taxes during the last twenty years. In 1979,

the combined employer and employee payroll tax rate was 12.26 percent. In 1999, this rate was 15.3

percent. Table 1 shows the changes in the combined employer and employee tax rate over the last two

decades, as well as in the taxable maximum level of earnings for both payroll taxes. For high-earning

taxpayers, the most significant payroll tax changes during the last two decades were the increase in the

Hospital Insurance maximum taxable earnings from $51,300 to $125,000 in 1991, and the subsequent

elimination of the upper limit on taxable earnings in 1994. The payroll tax rates have been 12.4 percent

for Social Security, and 2.9 percent for Hospital Insurance, since 1990.



2. The Distribution of Income and Payroll Tax Liabilities, 1979-1999

        The NBER TAXSIM model is a computer program that calculates federal income tax and payroll

tax liabilities for a representative sample of U.S. families. The program analyzes data from the Statistics

of Income (SOI) Public Use File, which is a stratified random sample of U.S. taxpayers that oversamples

high-income tax returns. Feenberg and Coutts (1993) describe this program in some detail. TAXSIM

currently offers detailed federal tax calculators for the 1960-1999 period. While it has traditionally




                                                                                                            6
focused on federal income tax liability, we extend its capacity to include payroll taxes as well. We focus

our analysis on the 1979-1999 period.

        We do not consider excise taxes at either the federal or state-local level, estate taxes, or corporate

income taxes, in our analysis of tax burdens. Some other studies of household tax burdens, such as the

ITEP model described by Ettlinger and O'Hare (1998) or some of the models analyzed by the

Congressional Budget Office, also include taxes besides income and payroll taxes. Our limited analysis

avoids a number of difficult incidence issues, discussed for example in Bradford (1995) and Joint

Committee on Taxation (1993), associated with taxes other than income and payroll taxes. We focus our

efforts on describing two taxes that have traditionally been assumed to fall on the families that pay them,

namely the individual income tax and the payroll tax (including the employer's share of this tax).

        The most recent SOI Public Use File contains tax returns for the 1995 tax year. Because we are

interested in family tax liabilities under the most recent federal tax law, we "age" the information from

1995 to 1999. We do this using an algorithm described in the appendix that relies on aggregate

information on tax returns as reported by the Internal Revenue Service, along with data from the National

Income and Product Accounts. We also augment the data from the SOI Public Use File with data from

the Current Population Survey (CPS) on families that do not file tax returns. Our non-filer imputation

procedure is also described in the appendix.

        Throughout our analysis, we focus on families as our basic unit of observation, and calendar

years as the basic unit of time. We follow the tax code in defining "families" by excluding dependent tax

filers from family units. When we stratify families according to their income, we focus on an "Adjusted

AGI" measure. This is defined as Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) as reported on tax returns, plus

employer-paid Social Security and Medicare taxes, plus the portion of Social Security benefits that are

excluded from AGI, plus tax exempt bond interest, plus contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts

and Keoghs. Some other studies of the distribution of income or payroll tax burdens, such as Ettlinger

and O'Hare (1996), use even more expansive definitions of family income that include estimates of




                                                                                                            7
transfer payments and other resource flows. We restrict our analysis to an income measure that can be

constructed from data on tax returns. The appendix describes how we impute each family's payroll taxes.

        There are several ways to summarize the distribution of income and payroll tax liabilities for the

1979-1999 period. We first describe the distribution of both types of taxes across families in different

income categories in 1999. We then consider how the level of income and payroll taxes has varied over

time, and also present information on the relative importance of the two taxes for families at different

points in the income distribution. We finally isolate the effect of the Earned Income Tax Credit in

affecting tax liabilities over the period that we study.

2.1 Income Taxes and Payroll Taxes, 1999

        Table 2 presents our estimate of the distribution of income and payroll tax liabilities across

families in calendar year 1999. Table 2 includes entries for the mean personal income tax and the mean

payroll tax for families in different adjusted AGI categories. Our measure of the payroll tax burden

combines both the employer and employee share of this tax, just as our measure of family income is

defined before payment of either employer or employee payroll taxes. Table 2 also shows the fraction of

families for whom the payroll tax is greater than the income tax, and for the fraction of families for whom

the income tax is greater than the payroll tax, again stratified by adjusted AGI. A substantial group of

families have zero payroll and income tax liabilities, so in some adjusted AGI categories, the sum of the

percent of families with payroll taxes greater than income taxes, and the percent with income taxes

greater than payroll taxes, adds up to less than 100 percent.

        Table 2 shows that for most families in income classes below $100,000, the average payroll tax

burden exceeds the average personal income tax burden. The disparities are particularly clear at lower

income levels. For families with between $20,000 and $30,000 in adjusted AGI, for example, mean

payroll taxes are roughly three times as great as mean income taxes. For families in lower adjusted AGI

categories, mean federal income taxes are negative. This reflects the refundable portion of the Earned

Income Tax Credit generating negative income tax payments. The average federal income tax burden

does not approximate the average payroll tax burden until the $75-100,000 adjusted AGI category. At


                                                                                                             8
higher adjusted AGI levels, income tax payments are substantially larger than payroll tax payments. This

reflects both the capped base for the Social Security payroll tax, and the low rate for the Hospital

Insurance payroll tax (relative to income tax rates).

        Payroll taxes exceed income taxes for 62 percent of families. At income levels below $50,000,

more than three-quarters of families have payroll tax bills that exceed their income taxes. At adjusted

AGI levels above $200,000, income taxes exceed payroll taxes for virtually all families. At the lowest

income levels, there are a substantial number of families with no income or payroll tax liability. Nearly

half of families with adjusted AGI of less than $10,000 have neither payroll nor income tax liabilities.

These families are not classified as having payroll taxes greater than income taxes, or vice versa.

        The results on income versus payroll taxes in Table 2 are broadly consistent with findings

reported by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) (1998). For example, CBO (1998) reports that at

family income between $40,000 and $50,000, 78 percent of families pay combined employer and

employee payroll taxes that exceed their income tax. Our estimate is 74.5 percent. At lower income

levels there are greater disparities between our calculations and those in CBO (1998), and there are also

some significant differences at higher income levels. For families with incomes between $100,000 and

$200,000, for example, we estimate that 84 percent face income taxes greater than their payroll taxes,

while the CBO (1998) estimate is 66 percent.

        Several factors could account for differences between our results and those in CBO (1998). One

is that we use a less expansive income definition than CBO, since we do not impute any information such

as transfer payments that is not reported on tax returns. A second possibility is different assumptions

about the recent time path of various income components, particularly capital gain realizations, that

represent a large share of income for the highest-income families. Any analysis of post-1995 tax

distributional patterns requires making a forecast of how the income distribution has evolved since 1995

(the last year for which the SOI Public Use File is available). We describe in the appendix our algorithm

for "aging" the 1995 income distribution to 1999, which differs from that used by CBO. We use more

disaggregate information on the aggregate value of income flows to "age" the 1995 income distribution to


                                                                                                            9
1999 than the CBO algorithm does. Finally, our approach to identifying nonfiler families may differ from

that used by the CBO. In future work, we hope to explore the source of these differences.

        We have not made detailed comparisons of our findings and those from other models, such as the

ITEP model described by Ettlinger and O'Hare (1998). We suspect, however, that what differences arise

are likely to stem from factors similar to those that may cause divergence between our results and CBO's.

2.2 Income Taxes and Payroll Taxes: The 1979-1999 Experience

        Table 2 provides information on the pattern of income tax and payroll tax liabilities in 1999, but it

does not place these liabilities in historical context. Table 3 develops a longer-term perspective on the

relative magnitude of tax liabilities. It shows the results of applying income and payroll tax rules from

five years -- 1979, 1984, 1989, 1994, and 1999 -- to the set of families whose 1999 income and payroll

taxes we analyzed in Table 2. Recall that this "1999 family income distribution" was constructed by

"aging" families from the 1995 SOI Public Use File and the 1995 Current Population Survey to 1999.

When we apply the tax laws from other years to this set of families, we re-define the income thresholds in

each year's tax laws to correspond to 1999 price levels. We make these adjustments using price changes

as reflected in the Consumer Price Index. Thus, if the Consumer Price Level for 1999 was double that for

an earlier year, we would double all of the nominal magnitudes in the income tax law for the earlier year,

and then apply the resulting tax code to our data set of 1999 families.

        The calculations in Table 3, and in several subsequent tables, indicate what would have happened

if the bracket amounts in tax codes from earlier years had been indexed for inflation but not for other

changes in the economy. They assume that the U.S. economy would have evolved precisely as it did over

the last twenty years despite this difference in the tax code. By holding the pre-tax distribution of family

income constant, we are able to focus on the impact of tax law changes alone. Our assumption that the

tax law does not affect the pretax distribution of income is an important over-simplification, however.

Many studies, such as Feldstein (1995), Gruber and Saez (2000), and others surveyed in the latter study,

suggest that there may be important links between the distribution of marginal tax rates and reported

family income.


                                                                                                            10
        Table 3 shows the percentage of families for whom the payroll tax would have exceeded the

personal income tax if the tax laws from various years had applied in 1999. The table shows significant

change in the relative importance of the income and the payroll tax over the 1979-1999 period. The upper

panel of the table reports percentages as a share of all families in various adjusted AGI ranges. If the

1979 and 1984 tax laws had applied in 1999, only 19.1 and 28.8 percent of families with adjusted AGI

between $50,000 and $75,000 ($1999) would have faced payroll taxes that were greater than their income

tax liabilities. Under the 1999 tax law, two thirds of the families in this group faced greater payroll taxes

than income taxes. Between 1984 and 1989, the percentage of families in this income group with payroll

taxes greater than income taxes rose from 28.8 to 63.4 percent, highlighting the importance of the Tax

Reform Act of 1986 in affecting the relative importance of income and payroll taxes.

        The last two decades have also seen some changes in the relative importance of payroll and

income taxes for families at the top of the income distribution. In 1999, nearly one family in six with

AGI between $100,000 and $200,000 paid more in payroll taxes than in income taxes. In years before the

Tax Reform Act of 1986, this fraction was negligible. In 1989, less than one family in ten in this adjusted

AGI category paid more in payroll than in income taxes. The increase in the number of high-income

families with payroll taxes greater than income taxes thus appears to be due to both the changes in the

Tax Reform Act of 1986, and the changes in the payroll tax cap in the early 1990s.

        The lower panel of Table 3 presents information on only those families who paid positive income

or payroll tax in each year. While restricting the sample to this group has very little effect on our results

for families with income of more than $40,000 in 1999, it has substantial effects at lower income levels.

For families with 1999 adjusted AGI between $10,000 and $20,000, for example, 71.5 percent of all

families but 87.1 percent of families who paid some taxes had 1999 payroll taxes in excess of personal

income taxes. In general, the share of families with payroll taxes greater than income taxes is larger when

we restrict the families we are considering to those with positive tax liability of some type. We find that

just over 70 percent of families with positive taxes face payroll taxes that are larger than income taxes.




                                                                                                             11
CBO (1998) reports an even larger value, 80 percent. In our data, the effect of conditioning on positive

tax liability is similar in 1979, 1984, 1989, 1994, and 1999.

        Table 3 presents information on the relative magnitude of income and payroll tax liabilities, but it

does not consider the absolute magnitude of either tax liability. Tables 4 and 5 present summary

information on tax levels. The tables use two different family income distributions to compare the level

of payroll taxes (Table 4) and personal income taxes (Table 5) for families at different income levels.

The first is the 1999 family income distribution that was used to develop the summary statistics in Tables

2 and 3. As explained above, this income distribution is based on data from 1995 income tax returns,

augmented with data from the 1995 Current Population Survey, and then "aged" to 1999. The second

income distribution that we consider is the 1979 family income distribution. We construct this income

distribution from the 1979 SOI Public Use File, augmented with data from the 1979 Current Population

Survey. Nominal magnitudes in this 1979 family income distribution are then converted to 1999

quantities using the change in the Consumer Price Index between 1979 and 1999.

        We consider two income distributions to explore the robustness of our findings to shifts in the

underlying characteristics of the families whose taxes we are studying. The 1979 family income

distribution differs in various ways from the 1999 distribution. The share of wage income amongst the

highest income families is lower, for example (see Feenberg and Poterba (2000)). There are differences

in the relative importance of married couples and single filers at different family income levels. The

average real income level of families in 1979 is also lower than that of families in 1999, since wages and

other incomes have grown faster than the price level over the intervening two decades. Tables 4 and 5

reflect this in showing lower average payroll and income tax burdens when we use the 1979 family

income distribution rather than the 1999 family income distribution.

        Table 4 reports information on the change in real payroll tax burdens over the 1979-1999 period.

The table shows that payroll taxes have increased modestly for middle-income families during this time

period. The most striking change between two adjacent years in the table is that for high-income families




                                                                                                           12
between 1989 and 1994. This is the result of the "uncapping" of the Hospital Insurance payroll tax for

years after 1993. For some high-earning families, this change more than doubled payroll taxes.

        The upper and lower panels of Table 4 show similar broad trends in the average payroll tax

burden for families in various adjusted AGI categories. This suggests that the changes in family structure

and in family income composition between 1979 and 1999 have not significantly affected the family

attributes that determine the relationship between payroll tax liability and adjusted AGI.

        Table 5 is similar to Table 4, except that it reports information on income taxes. It also presents

summary statistics based on the 1999 family income distribution, as well as based on the 1979 family

income distribution. The table shows that average income tax burdens have declined in the last two

decades across all income classes. Consider the results in the upper panel, which relates to the 1999

family income distribution. In 1999, the average family's income tax liability would have been 33 percent

greater if the 1979 income tax code (with bracket break-points adjusted for changes in the Consumer

Price Index) was still in force than it was with the actual 1999 tax code.

        There is significant variation in the pattern of tax liabilities across income categories. For

families with adjusted AGI in the $75-100,000 range for 1999, income taxes under the 1979 law would

have been 24 percent greater than they actually were. For those in the $20-30,000 adjusted AGI class,

taxes under the 1979 law would have been 57 percent greater than 1999 taxes. Taxes for families in the

highest income category, with more than $1 million in 1999 adjusted AGI, would have been 39 percent

higher under 1979 rather than 1999 law. For the lowest income families (with adjusted AGI of less than

$10,000), net tax liability would have been less negative ($-74) under the 1979 law than under the

prevailing 1999 law ($-247). The entries for the highest income families show the sharp impact of the

1986 Tax Reform Act in reducing tax burdens, and the impact of the 1993 Omnibus Budget

Reconciliation Act (which raised top marginal rates) in raising tax burdens.

        Table 5 shows that the most significant change in average income tax liability occurs between

1984 and 1989, the years that bracket the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The average family's income tax

liability declines by 22 percent as a consequence of this reform. In evaluating this statistic, it is important


                                                                                                            13
to remember that this is a "no behavioral response" measure, so it does not incorporate changes in the

amount of income reported, and hence the amount of tax paid, as a result of reductions in marginal tax

rates. Taxpayer responses would partly offset the decline in average tax burdens shown in the table.

Such offsets would be particularly important if we were disaggregating the various components of income

tax liability, and considering for example the contribution of income taxes on realized capital gains.

Capital gains realizations are an aspect of taxpayer behavior that appears to be particularly sensitive to

marginal tax rates (see Poterba (2000) for a summary of recent research).

        The lower panel of Table 5 presents information on tax burdens in various years using the 1979

family income distribution rather than the 1999 income distribution. As in Table 4, the results in the

upper and lower panels show the same broad trends in the effect of tax legislation on family tax burdens.

There are some differences, however, that are attributable to differences in the composition of income for

families in various adjusted AGI categories in 1999 and 1979. For example, for the highest income

category, families with $1 million or more in adjusted AGI, the 1979 income distribution suggests that

taxes would have averaged 29 percent greater under the 1979 tax law than under the 1999 law. Data

from the 1999 family income distribution suggest a 39 percent larger effect; this reflects the growing

importance of wage income amongst these families during the last two decades. Because the 1979 family

income distribution has a lower mean income than the 1999 family income distribution, the average tax

burden is lower when we use the 1979 than the 1999 income distribution. Using the 1999 family income

distribution, we estimate that the average family's income tax burden was $6220. Using the 1979 family

income distribution and the 1999 tax law, we estimate an average income tax burden of $3810. This is

only 61 percent of the estimate using the 1999 family income distribution.

        Table 6 combines the information in Tables 4 and 5, and shows the total payroll and income tax

burden for families in various adjusted AGI categories. At the highest income levels, the entries in the

table are very similar to those in Table 5, since the income tax is the primary tax on families in this

income range. At lower income ranges, however, the table highlights the interplay between income and

payroll tax liabilities. For families with 1999 adjusted AGI below $10,000, the table shows a decline of


                                                                                                             14
roughly one third of total tax liabilities between 1979 and 1999. There is a reversal of trend during this

time period, with average tax burdens rising from $225 to $307 (measured in 1999 dollars) between 1979

and 1984, and then declining to $153 by 1999.

        The entries in Table 6 show that for families with adjusted AGI between $10,000 and $200,000,

using the 1999 distribution of family income, combined tax burdens in 1979 and 1999 were very similar.

The table again shows an increase in tax burdens between 1979 and 1984, followed by decline in

subsequent years. For the small set of families with adjusted AGI in excess of $200,000, the table shows

a decline in tax burdens between 1979 and 1999. The year with the lowest tax burden for these families is

1989, when the Tax Reform Act of 1986 had been fully phased in.

        The lower panel of Table 6 repeats the calculations in the upper panel using the 1979 family

income distribution rather than the 1999 family income distribution. There are some differences between

the results in the two panels. The lower panel shows more evidence of rising total tax burdens between

1979 and 1999. While the increase in tax burdens from 1979 to 1999 is modest for families with adjusted

AGI below $40,000, at income levels between $40,000 and $200,000 a clear pattern of rising tax burdens

emerges. For families with adjusted AGI between $75,000 and $100,000 in 1999, based on the 1979

family income distribution, combined income and payroll taxes were 7.4 percent higher in 1999 than in

1979. At income levels above $200,000, even the data based on the 1979 family income distribution

show a decline in tax liability between 1979 and 1999.

        The difference between the results in the upper and lower panels of Table 6 is probably

attributable to differences in the composition of income between families at given income ranges in the

two income distributions. We "age" the 1979 families to 1999 using the rate of price inflation, not the

rate of real income growth. Families in a given income range based on the 1979 family income

distribution represent families with a higher standing in the overall income distribution than families at

the same income level based on the 1999 family income distribution. The differences may also be due to

differences in demographic structure between the set of 1979 and 1999 families. In 1999, for example,

there are many more single-person families than in 1979, and a higher percentage of dependents are in


                                                                                                             15
families without two adults. There is also a higher fraction of two earner couples amongst married joint

filers. The sensitivity of findings like those in Table 6 to differences in the baseline income distribution is

an issue that requires further study.

        Table 7 provides further information on the changing pattern of tax liabilities. It shows the

fraction of families in different strata of the 1999 income distribution that paid less taxes in 1999 than

they would have paid if the 1979 tax law had still been in effect. For all families, the table shows that

62.6 percent experienced a decline in personal income tax liabilities, while only 36.4 percent experienced

a decline in combined payroll and income tax liabilities. If we restrict the analysis to families that paid

either payroll or income taxes, as in the upper panel of the table, the data show that 70.2 percent of

families faced lower income taxes in 1999, but that only 37.5 percent faced lower income and payroll

taxes. At low family income levels, most families experienced a tax increase between 1979 and 1999.

We need to focus on families in income strata above $50,000 before the probability of paying lower

combined taxes in 1999 than in 1979 rises above 50 percent. The results in Table 7 provide a stark

demonstration of the importance of combining income and payroll taxes when considering recent changes

in tax burdens.

2.3 The Role of the Earned Income Tax Credit

        Having shown the combined income and payroll tax burden over time, we now return to explore

the income tax in more detail. The average income tax burdens shown in Table 5 reflect changes in the

structure of marginal income tax rates over time, changes in the level of deductions and exemptions, and

changes in the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Because the EITC expanded substantially during the

two decades that we consider, it is informative to distinguish its effect from that of other changes in the

tax code. Table 8 separates the EITC from other factors that affect personal income tax liability. (Unlike

other tax credits, the EITC is refundable. This reflects in part its historical origins as an income tax

"offset" to payroll taxes (see the discussion in Liebman (1998)). Families that have a negative personal

income tax liability inclusive of the EITC also have payroll tax liabilities, since the EITC is equal to a




                                                                                                              16
percentage of wage and/or self-employment income. At current levels, however, the EITC exceeds

income and payroll tax liabilities for some low-income wage-earning families.

        Because families with adjusted AGI of more than $50,000 in 1999 were unaffected by changes in

the EITC, the table focuses on families with incomes below this level. The summary statistics in Table 8

are based on the 1999 family income distribution, so the results are consistent with those in the upper

panels of Tables 4 and 5.

        The first panel of Table 8 shows the change in personal income tax liabilities, excluding any

refunds associated with the EITC. For the lowest income families, those with adjusted AGI of less than

$20,000, there is virtually no change in this measure of tax liability between 1979 and 1999. There is an

increase in tax liability in the early 1980s, but this is undone by the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The middle

panel of Table 8 shows the EITC for families in different adjusted AGI ranges. It demonstrates that the

expansion of the EITC has been a critical factor in reducing personal income tax liabilities over the period

we study. The largest change takes place between 1989 and 1994, when the average EITC for families

with incomes below $20,000 roughly doubles. There is an even larger percentage increase for the average

EITC received by families with incomes in the $20-30,000 range.

        The bottom panel of Table 8 shows payroll taxes net of the EITC for low-income families. The

results suggest that payroll taxes net of the EITC have declined for the average family with an adjusted

AGI of below $20,000, while they have increased for families with incomes above this range. The entries

in the bottom panel of Table 8 can be compared with those in the upper panel of Table 4 to gauge the

impact of EITC expansion as an offset to rising payroll tax burdens. For families with adjusted AGI

between $10,000 and $20,000, for example, the data in Table 4 suggest an increase of 29 percent in real

payroll taxes between 1979 and 1999. Net of the expansion of the EITC, however, there was a net

decrease of 13 percent in payroll tax payments over this period.

        Table 8 further underscores the need, in at least some contexts, to consider the income tax and the

payroll tax in tandem. When changes in one tax instrument are designed, at least in part, to offset changes

in another, it is useful to construct distribution tables that combine the two sets of taxes.


                                                                                                           17
3. The Distributional Effects of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997

        The summary statistics in the foregoing tables do not attempt to decompose changes in tax

burdens from one year to the next into components that are attributable to particular legislative reforms.

Rather, they simply summarize the total tax burden, for either the income tax or the payroll tax, which

results from all of the tax legislation in force in each year. Because the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997

introduced a number of new tax credits that may substantially affect the distribution of tax burdens, and

because this is the most recent substantial change in the income tax code, there is particular interest in

analyzing the distributional impact of these new credits. We do this by analyzing the source of the

changes in income tax liability between 1994 and 1999 that we summarized in earlier tables.

        Table 8 reports on the effect of three key components of TRA97: the enactment of the Child Tax

Credit, the reduction of tax rates on capital gains, and the enactment of the HOPE and Lifetime Learning

Credits. The table does not present an exhaustive decomposition of the changes in tax revenue; there are

other, less important, factors that also contribute to changing personal income tax liabilities between 1994

and 1999. The effect of these other factors is summarized in the last column of Table 8.

        The first column in Table 9 shows the change in the average personal income tax liability for

families in various adjusted AGI categories. This entry is the difference between the entries in the 1994

column, and the entries in the 1999 column, of the upper panel of Table 5. The next three columns in

Table 8 show the effects of each of the three most significant components of TRA97.

        The entries in Table 9 show that for high-income families, TRA97 had a substantial effect in

reducing tax liabilities through the reduction in capital gains tax rates. In evaluating these findings,

however, it is important to recall our "no behavioral response" assumption. We will understate the

change in taxes paid if, as is very likely, the reduction in capital gains tax rates increased gain realizations

and hence taxable income.

        For lower and middle-income taxpayers, the new credits were more important than the capital

gains tax changes in affecting tax burdens. For the typical taxpaying family with an adjusted AGI of


                                                                                                             18
between $50,000 and $75,000 in 1999, for example, the net effect of the HOPE and Lifetime Learning

Credits was a reduction of $58 in tax liabilities, compared to $50 due to capital gains tax changes. The

distribution of credit-eligible dependents across adjusted AGI categories implies that most of the benefits

of the HOPE and LLC accrue to middle income families. The average value of the tax reduction

associated with these credits was greatest for families with adjusted AGI between $50,000 and $100,000.

At lower incomes, many families have too little income to be able to take full advantage of the tax credits.

        The distributional pattern for the Child Tax Credit is similar to that for the HOPE and LLC, but

the average benefits are substantially greater. The average income tax reduction from the credit for

families with adjusted AGI in the $50-75,000 range, for example, is $325. Since only families with

dependent children can receive this credit, there are many families that do not receive any benefits from

the credit, and thus many others that receive benefits substantially greater than Table 8 suggests.

        Our estimate of the revenue cost of the Child Credit, $21.5 billion, is substantially greater than

the estimate of $15.7 billion reported in the Congressional Budget Office (2000). This may reflect

differences between the distribution of dependents across families that results from our imputation

procedure for dependents who are eligible for the credit, and the actual distribution of such dependents.

The Joint Tax Committee (1998) estimated that at 1998 income tax rates and 1998 income levels, the

Child Credit would reduce income tax revenue by $17.5 billion. Since the credit was $400 in 1998, and

$500 in 1999, this estimate is much closer to our results than is the more recent CBO (2000) estimate.

        The last column in Table 9 shows the change in average tax liability within adjusted AGI cells

that cannot be attributed to the three legislative changes that we have highlighted. There are both positive

and negative entries in this "residual" column, which suggests that there are a number of other factors

influencing tax liability. These include changes in the mean income of families within each AGI cell, due

to differences between the rate at which tax bracket "break points" change and the rate at which various

income aggregates grow. Other legislative changes can also contribute to the "residual" change in tax

liability in this category. The interaction between various tax changes also contributes to this residual




                                                                                                             19
entry. When one provision affects a family's tax liability, it may affect the tax change associated with

other tax reform provisions.



4. Conclusions and Future Directions

           This paper describes the changing level of income and payroll tax burdens over the last two

decades, and it presents summary information on the cross-family distribution of these tax burdens. The

results suggest that legislative changes have reduced average income tax liabilities relative to what they

would be if pre-1980 tax laws were still in effect, but that increases in payroll taxes have largely offset

these tax reductions on average. These findings complement the results in Burman, Gale, and Weiner

(1998) on reductions in marginal income tax rates over a roughly similar period, as well as Stephenson's

(1998) finding that marginal payroll tax rate changes have offset marginal income tax rate changes in the

post-1981 period.

           The payroll tax increase of the early 1980s, coupled with the expansion of the Earned Income Tax

Credit in the mid-1980s and the early 1990s, has made the payroll tax a more significant tax than the

income tax for a very substantial fraction of U.S. families. In 1999, families needed Adjusted Gross

Income in excess of $100,000 before their expected income tax liability was greater than their expected

payroll tax liability. Nearly two thirds of families in 1999 paid more in payroll taxes than they did in

federal income taxes. This reflects a substantial change from two decades earlier, when this share was 42

percent.

           The results in this study describe income tax payments by families, and payroll tax contributions

by families and their employers. A natural next step in this line of research would involve augmenting

the current tax liability calculations by including corporate income taxes, estate taxes, and excise taxes at

both the federal and sub-federal level. Taking such a step would require some assumptions about the

incidence of these taxes, and in particular the extent to which they are ultimately borne by the families

that face legal liability for them.




                                                                                                              20
        Another important extension of the current project would involve linking our calculations of

payroll tax liability with imputations of social insurance benefits that may be associated with such tax

payments. For some taxpayers, Social Security benefits are an increasing function of their earned income.

Feldstein and Samwick (1992) examine this "tax benefit linkage" and they present estimates of the

distribution of marginal benefit paybacks associated with the Social Security payroll tax. Earlier studies

in a similar vein include Browning (1985) and Burkhauser and Turner (1985). There is no "tax benefit

linkage effect" for the hospital insurance payroll tax; all Americans over the age of 65 are eligible for

Medicare, regardless of their earnings histories. Including an estimate of the present discounted value of

the benefits that families at different points in the income distribution receive when they pay payroll taxes

would nevertheless represent a substantial, and interesting, direction for future work. Doing such analysis

requires information on the earnings histories of the individuals who are in different current family

income categories, as well as projections of future earnings and labor market behavior, such as retirement

dates, for these workers. The results of such an analysis would necessarily be even more sensitive to

assumptions about data construction and imputation than results like those in the current study.

                            Appendix: Updating the NBER TAXSIM Model

        In this appendix, we first describe how we identify families that do not file federal income tax

returns, and add them to each year's SOI Public Use File. We then describe our algorithm for estimating

payroll taxes for each family. We next explain our imputation procedures for identifying families that are

likely to claim various tax credits that were enacted as part of TRA97. Finally, we summarize how we

"age" tax returns filed in one year to permit analysis of tax rules and tax rates in a different year.

A.1 Adding Nonfilers to the SOI Public Use File

        Some families have no federal personal income tax liability and do not need to file for a refund of

income tax withheld, so they do not appear in the SOI Public Use File. In 1995, for example, single

persons with adjusted gross income of less than $6400 ($7350 if the person were 65 years or older), and

married joint filers with AGI of less than $11500 ($13000 if both taxpayers were 65 or older), were not

required to file federal income tax returns. Such families may nevertheless have earnings and pay payroll

taxes. To analyze the distribution of payroll tax burdens, it is essential to augment the Public Use File

with information on non-filer families.

        For the 1995 data set, we identify nonfiler families using data that the Census Bureau includes in

the Current Population Survey data files. Recent March CPS data sets include an imputation, based on

the CPS respondent's income and probable income tax withholding, for whether or not the responding

family is likely to have filed a tax return. The Census has access to the IRS master file, and it can

therefore test the quality of its imputation using actual tax filing data. This imputation recognizes that

many families with no income tax liability and no legal requirement to file a federal income tax return

may file to obtain a refund of wage withholding. It relies on self-employment income in excess of $400

($1992), interest, dividends, and other types of capital income in excess of $1,000, and wage income in

excess of $1,000, to impute "filing" as a taxpayer's status. The Census imputation, reflecting the number,

incomes, ages, and demographic structure of actual filers and non-filer families, is likely to be much more

accurate than imputations based solely on publicly-available data sets.




                                                                                                             32
        The most recently available SOI Public Use File is that for the 1995 tax year. We therefore use

the March 1996 Current Population Survey, which reports information that relates to the 1995 tax filing

year, to identify nonfiler families for the 1995 tax year. We begin by identifying all families, whether

single individuals or multi-person families, which are headed by a person over the age of 18 and which

are identified as nonfilers in the CPS file. We then add these families to the Public Use File, using each

family's March CPS Supplemental Final Weight as the analogue to the tax model sampling weight. This

procedure yields 17.9 million nonfiler families in 1995. We use information reported in the CPS to

construct core variables from the Public Use File, such as wages and salaries, interest and dividend

income, and the family's number of dependents. We then construct each nonfiler family's adjusted AGI.

        Table A-1 shows the distribution of nonfiler families across adjusted AGI categories in 1995. It

also shows the percentage of families in each adjusted AGI class that does not file federal income tax

returns. Our results suggest that roughly half of those with positive incomes of less than $10,000 are

nonfilers. The fraction is lower, roughly twenty-five percent, among those who have negative incomes,

because negative income is often associated with activities that require filing tax returns or that produce

tax benefits. Feenberg, Mitrusi, and Poterba (1997) report similar findings for 1992 nonfiler families.

        We also construct a non-filer augmented data file for 1979. Since the CPS does not include a

non-filer imputation in 1979, we construct our own estimate of the set of families that might not file tax

returns using information on wage, interest, and dividend income. We assume that any family with less

than $1000 of wage income (measured in $1992, for consistency with the Census Bureau imputation that

underlies the 1995 nonfiler imputation) and with less than $500 ($1992) in combined interest and

dividend income did not file a tax return.

A.2 Payroll Tax Imputation: Dividing Labor Income Between Members of Married Couple

        The payroll tax applies at a flat rate on earned income up to a threshold level, and there are no

deductions or special definitions of income categories as there are in the income tax. The payroll tax is

levied on both employees and their employers. We follow many previous studies, including Pechman

(1985), in assuming that the employer share of the payroll tax is ultimately born by the employee in the


                                                                                                            33
form of lower wages. We therefore use the combined employer and employee tax rate as "the" payroll

tax rate throughout our analysis. This also accounts for our inclusion of employer-paid payroll taxes in

our measure of family adjusted AGI.

        The data contained in the SOI Public Use file do not provide enough information for us to

calculate payroll tax liability for all married couples. On the income tax returns of married joint filers, the

wage and salary income of both spouses is aggregated. A couple with earnings of $100,000 would pay

more in payroll taxes if the earnings were equally divided between the husband and wife than if the one

spouse was the only earner. (If a couple's combined wage income is below the maximum amount of

taxable earnings for the Social Security payroll tax, we would not need to know the earnings division,

since all earnings would be subject to the payroll tax.) In general, however, to estimate payroll taxes we

must estimate the division of labor income between members of each pair of married joint filers.

        To estimate this earnings division, we construct a "synthetic match" between married couples in

the SOI Public Use File and couples in the Federal Reserve Board's Survey of Consumer Finances. One

could also use the publicly-available data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), as in Feldstein and

Feenberg (1996) and Feenberg, Mitrusi, and Poterba (1997), to divide family earnings. However, the

CPS data on earnings are top-coded, which makes it impossible to allocate earnings for some high-income

families. In 1994, the CPS variable for total wage income was topcoded for one spouse in 3.7 percent of

married couples, and for both spouses in 0.12 percent of couples. Combining CPS data with the Public

Use File thus would undercut one of the Public Use File's most important strengths of the SOI data,

namely its detailed information on high-income families.

        The Federal Reserve Board's Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), like the Public Use File, over-

samples high-income families and thereby provides a reasonable sample for allocating the earnings of

high-earning couples. The difficulties with the SCF are that it is only conducted every three years and

that it is only available since 1983. However, the distribution of earnings between members of married

couples is relatively stable across years. We therefore rely on the various SCF data sets, interpolated

where necessary, to divide wage income for married couples.


                                                                                                            34
        Table A-2 presents information on the division of labor earnings based on the 1995 Survey of

Consumer Finances. The table shows, for the $1995 AGI category (not the adjusted AGI category)

indicated in each row, the ratio of the average earnings of the lower-earning spouse in each couple to the

couple's average total earnings. Total earnings include both W-2 and Schedule C income.

        The table shows a clear pattern in the share of earnings that is due to the lower-earning spouse.

This share rises at low values of family AGI. At roughly $40,000 of AGI, the average earnings share of

the lower-earning spouse enters a relatively narrow range, from 20 to 25 percent, and it remains in this

range until family AGI reaches roughly $130,000. At family AGI levels above this range, the average

earnings share of the lower-earning spouse declines, and it reaches relatively low levels at very high AGI

ranges. This distributional pattern seems plausible, since two earner couples are likely to reach moderate

to high income levels by combining wages, while secondary earners in couples with one very high earner

are not likely to seek work. Based on distributional tables that are not shown, the share of couples in

which the second earner accounts for between 25 and 50 percent of the total earnings peaks at family

income between $50,000 and $115,000. The share of married couples with a zero-earning lower income

spouse is U-shaped, with relatively high values at both low and high AGI levels.

        We were fortunate to be able to compare the SCF tabulations with similar tabulations based on

the U.S. Treasury's income tax masterfile. This data file, which is not available to researchers outside the

Treasury, merges W-2 filings with individual income tax returns (1040s). Table A-2 shows the earnings

division based on the Treasury masterfile as well as the SCF, and it demonstrates that the patterns in the

SCF and the Treasury masterfile are similar. This supports our use of the SCF to allocate family labor

earnings for earlier years. There are, nevertheless, some differences between the SCF and the Treasury

data. There are more low-income families in the Treasury masterfile than in the SCF. Fortunately, this

discrepancy only appears in an income range over which the division of wage earnings between two

members of a couple does not affect the couple's total payroll tax liability.

        Figures 1, 2, and 3 present more detailed information on the pattern of earnings divisions in the

1995 SCF. The first figure shows the fraction of married couples in which the lower-earning spouse


                                                                                                            35
earns zero, the second the fraction with the lower-earner between 1 and 25 percent of the total earnings,

and the third the fraction with the lower earner between 25 and 50 percent of total earnings. In each

figure we show these earnings distributions for different income categories, and for families with "low,"

"middle," and "high" levels of capital income. "Low" capital income families report zero capital income,

"middle" capital income families report capital income between 0 and 33 percent of the families total

income, and "high" capital income indicates more than 33 percent of family income comes from capital.

Conditioning on the share of family income from capital income is important, because the pattern of

earnings division differs across capital income groups.

        We use the information in Figures 1 through 3 to apportion the wage and salary income of 1995

joint filers to the two members of the married couple. We allocate 1995 labor earnings using three

probabilities: that the lower earner reports zero earnings, that the lower earner reports between 1 and 25

percent of total earnings, and that the lower earner reports between 25 and 50 percent of total earnings.

We also assume that a uniform distribution of earnings splits within the 1-25 and 25-50 percent intervals.

We follow a similar procedure using the 1983, 1986, 1989, 1992, and 1995 Surveys of Consumer

Finances. For years between these surveys, we interpolate the information from survey years to develop

estimates of individual earnings within married couples.

A.3 Imputations Relating to the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act

        To study the distribution of the benefits of the Child Tax Credit and of the HOPE and LLC, we

need to estimate which families are eligible for each of these credits. The information in the 1995 SOI

Public Use File does not permit us to make such estimates, although data in Public Use Files beginning

with 1998 will include the necessary information. The Joint Committee on Taxation (1997a, 1997b)

presents revenue estimates and distributional analysis that embody information available as of the time

when the legislation was enacted.

        With respect to the Child Tax Credit, we assume that each dependent reported on a tax return has

a probability of .763 of being eligible for the credit. This probability corresponds to the number of

children under the age of 17 divided by the total number of dependents claimed on tax returns. Table A-3


                                                                                                            36
presents information on the distribution of under-17 dependents across 1999 adjusted AGI categories.

The table shows that 51.5 percent of the under-17 dependents are in families with adjusted AGI of less

than $40,000. Only 10.5 percent of these dependents live in families with adjusted AGI of more than

$100,000. These are families that are likely to be affected by the Child Tax Credit phase-out provisions.

        Our procedure for imputing potential eligibility for the HOPE credit and for the Lifetime

Learning Credit involves several steps. First, we use the March 1995 Current Population Survey to

impute ages of all family members in the nonfiler-augmented SOI Public Use File. For tax filers who

claim dependents, we know the number of dependents reported on the taxpayer's tax return, as well as the

taxpayer's income. We randomly match each tax filer in the Public Use File to a family in the CPS with

the same number of dependents and in the same income class. (We use broad income categories: <

$25,000, 25-50,000, 50-75,000, 75-100,000, and > $100,000.) We assign each family a number of

dependents aged 17 or less, a number of dependents aged 18-24, and a number of dependents who are

over the age of 24. We follow a similar procedure, using age and the number of persons in the CPS

family, to impute the total number of individuals between the ages of 18-24, 25-29, 30-34, and > 35 for

each family. This imputation yields a data file based on both tax returns (filers) and CPS records

(nonfilers) with information on the age structure of each family.

        Next, we use data on age-specific rates of college attendance in 1995 (drawn from the U.S.

Department of Education (1997) for those over 23, and from the March CPS for those under 24) to impute

"college attendance status" for each person over the age of 17. Many persons over the age of 24 attend

college. For the 25-29 age group, for example, the 1995 college enrollment rate was 11.2 percent. This

drops to 5.7 percent for the 30-34 age group, and 2.1 percent for those over the age of 35. The U.S.

Department of Education (1997) reports that in 1995, there were 14.3 million students enrolled in colleges

and other institutions of higher education. By expanding the population in various age groups to 1999

levels, but assuming that the age-specific college enrollment rates remain at 1995 levels, we estimate that

there would be 14.6 million students at these institutions.




                                                                                                          37
        Third, to determine whether someone who is attending college is eligible for the HOPE or the

LLC, we assume that any 18-23-year-old who is in school is at an institution of higher learning that would

qualify for the LLC or HOPE Credit. Since HOPE is more generous than LLC, we assume that anyone

who is eligible for both credits will claim the HOPE Credit. We further assume that individuals aged 18,

19, 20, and 21 who are in college have a 50 percent chance of being eligible for the HOPE Credit. This is

a crude assumption designed to approximate the fraction of college students at each of these ages who are

in their first or second year of post-secondary education. We assume that college students who are not

eligible for the HOPE Credit receive the LLC instead.

        Finally, we need to address the amount of the HOPE credit and the LLC. The U.S. Department of

Education, National Center for Education Statistics (1998) reports that average tuition and fees net of

grants for undergraduates attending public two- and four-year colleges in 1995-96 was $1641 for students

who were dependents, and $562 for students who were independent. This suggests that distinguishing

between dependents and independents is potentially important for assessing the amount of HOPE and

LLC tax benefits. For those attending private colleges, the average cost net of grants was $7259 for

dependent students, and $3473 for independent students. These average values are net of Pell grants and

other federal and state or local government grants, and they are also net of financial aid provided by the

post-secondary school. Amongst those attending post-secondary institutions, 76 percent of dependent

students, and 80 percent of independent students, were at public colleges and universities, while 24

percent and 20 percent, respectively, were at private institutions. We therefore assume that any dependent

student who is eligible for the HOPE Credit or the LLC has a probability of .76 of being enrolled at a

public institution, and .24 of being at a private institution. For independent students, we use probabilities

of .80 and .20 for public and private institutions, respectively.

        We assume that anyone who is eligible for the HOPE Credit and who attends a private institution

claims the maximum amount of this credit ($1500), while anyone at a public institution claims $1321 if

he or she is a dependent student, and $562 if he or she is independent. (Future work might refine this

analysis to recognize that the probability of attending a public versus a private institution varies with


                                                                                                             38
family income level.) For the Lifetime Learning Credit, we assume that students claim 20 percent of the

mean net tuition for their imputed institution type (public or private) and dependency status. While any

individual public college student will claim less than the maximum LLC, since the LLC is claimed on a

family basis, in rare cases a family with five students who were imputed to public college enrollment

could nevertheless reach the LLC maximum.

        Table A-4 shows our estimates of the number of families eligible to claim the HOPE or the

Lifetime Learning Credit in 1999. We stratify these families by adjusted AGI. The table shows the

number of dependent students as well as the number of independent students (persons over the age of 23,

or 18-23 year olds living independently) at institutions of higher education. Approximately eighty

percent of dependents who attend college are in families with adjusted AGI of less than $100,000, while

95 percent of non-dependents attending college are in families with incomes below this threshold.

        The last column of Table A-4 shows our estimate of the number of HOPE and LLC claimants

whose taxes are reduced by the availability of these credits. Only a fraction of those who are eligible for

the credit can claim it. For example, we estimate that there are 2.28 million college enrollees in families

with adjusted AGI of between $10,000 and $20,000. However, only 1.27 million (56 percent) of these

students benefit from the HOPE and LLC. The others are in families with no federal income tax liability

before they claim the HOPE or LLC. The fraction of potentially eligible families that receives an actual

tax reduction rises with income. Ninety-two percent of the college enrollees in families with adjusted

AGI between $40,000 and $50,000, for example, experience some reduction in family tax liability as a

result of these credits.

        We have received preliminary data from the Internal Revenue Service on the number of families

that claimed either HOPE of Lifetime Learning Credits in 1998, the first year when these credits were

available. These data suggest that our imputations overstate the total number of tax returns that claim

education credits, although the aggregate amount of tax reduction due to these credits is close to our

estimate. In 1999, we estimate that 8.4 million families should claim HOPE or LLC, but IRS data suggest

that only 4.8 million tax returns claimed one of these credits in 1998. Our estimate of the reduction in


                                                                                                           39
1999 tax revenue that resulted from these credits is $3.53 billion, while the IRS estimate for 1998 is $3.50

billion. Further analysis of the differences between our imputations and actual claims requires data on

individual tax returns for 1998 or 1999; these data will not be available for several years.

A.4 "Aging" Data From the 1995 Public Use File to 1999

        Much of our analysis focuses on tax burdens in 1999. To construct a family income distribution

for 1999, we "age" the nonfiler-augmented SOI Public Use File for 1995. Our approach follows that in

Lindsey (1987). First, we expand the total number of families in the 1995 filer and non-filer universe

based on the expected increase in tax returns from 1995 to 1999. Second, to extrapolate income

components and other dollar values from 1995 to 1999, we divide AGI into three components: realized

capital gains, wages, and other items. We project non-gain AGI growth from 1995 to 1999 using the

growth of wages and other personal income in the national income accounts. We project realized capital

gains, which have been extremely volatile in recent years, using actual realizations for 1996 and 1997 to

"scale up" 1995 realizations. We project realizations for 1998 and 1999 using the fitted values of a

regression equation that relates the level of aggregate realizations over the 1991-1997 period to the

average value of the Standard and Poor's 500 Index for the year. This simple equation yields a coefficient

of 0.967 (0.027) on the stock market variable, and it generates a projected increase in realizations of 26

percent between 1997 and 1998, and 17.5 percent between 1998 and 1999. McKinnon and Hube (2000)

report a taxable capital gain increase of at least 14 percent between 1998 and 1999.

        "Aging" algorithms such as this one track variation in the aggregate amounts of different types of

income, but they do not capture changes in the distribution of various types of income across families in

different income classes. While the distribution of AGI across different income strata was relatively

stable in the early 1990s, as Feenberg and Poterba (2000) report, there is some evidence in Bakija and

Slemrod (2000) that income reported on tax returns became more concentrated in tax years 1996 and

1997. This raises the possibility that the foregoing algorithm for "aging" the set of filers and non-filers

from 1995 to 1999 may perform poorly over this period. This issue can only be resolved with data from

the 1996 through 1999 SOI Public Use Files that will not be available for several years.
