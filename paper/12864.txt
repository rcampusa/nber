                                            ABSTRACT

The effect of new health information on individuals' expectations about their longevity is examined
using a Bayesian learning model. Using two-period panel-structured survey data from Taiwan, we
find that subjective probabilities of living to age 75 and 85 are significantly smaller for respondents
with more abnormal medical test outcomes and for those receiving more extensive advice on health
behavior from their physicians. The subjective probability of survival declines with health shocks
such as developing heart disease. Using pooled cross-sectional data, we find that males and married
persons are more optimistic about their longevity expectations than females and single persons, and
that income is strongly correlated with the subjective probability of living to age 75. Consistent with
previous studies, the longevity of the same-sex parent is strongly associated with an individuals own
expectation of living to age 75.

1. Introduction

       The quality of individuals’ decisions about health care, savings and investment, and other

topics depends on the accuracy of their expectations about how long they are likely to live. In an

early study, Hamermesh (1985) found that subjective longevity perceptions did not accurately

correspond to actuarial distributions. The subjective distributions were flatter, exhibiting greater

uncertainty about longevity than is experienced. Moreover, the respondents tended to

disproportionately base their subjective life expectancies on the longevity of their older relatives.

       Recent studies have examined the evolution of subjective longevity expectations using

US panel data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the Asset and Health Dynamics

among the Oldest-Old (AHEAD) Study. The HRS provides a nationally-representative sample of

individuals ranging in age from 51 to 61 years, while the AHEAD study focuses on the oldest

segment of the population, those aged 70 and above. Using these data, Hurd and his colleagues

have provided consistent evidence of the predictive validity of subjective probabilities on actual

mortality. Hurd and McGarry (1995) found that the subjective probabilities of living to age 75

and 85 were reasonably consistent with life-table probabilities, and that variations in these

probabilities were correlated with risk factors and other individual characteristics. Individuals

with higher socioeconomic status (measured by income, wealth, and education) reported higher

probabilities of survival and smokers reported lower probabilities. Using two waves of the HRS,

Hurd and McGarry (2002) concluded that individuals modified their survival probabilities in

response to new information, with survival probability declining on the death of a parent and the

arrival of a new health shock (a diagnosis of cancer).

       Using the panel-structured data of the AHEAD study, Hurd et al. (1998) and Hurd et al.

(1999) found that a significant proportion of the more unrealistic subjective survival probabilities
                                                                                                    2


stated by the respondents – focal-point responses and non-responses – were associated with low

cognitive performance. After controlling for selection bias, Hurd et al. (1998) found a generally

strong relationship between personal survival probabilities and covariates, with males, blacks,

and married persons being more optimistic than females, whites, and unmarried persons.

Furthermore, survival expectations were positively correlated with self-rated health status and

the longevity of the same-sex parent. Hurd et al. (1999) also confirmed that subjective beliefs

responded to the onset of adverse health conditions, such as cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes

or depression.

       Following the framework for updating risk estimates proposed by Viscusi and O’Connor

(1984) and Viscusi (1985), Sloan et al. (1999) and Smith et al. (2001) analyzed panel data from

the HRS to evaluate how exogenous health shocks affect longevity expectations. Their findings

revealed that the process of risk perception was quite different for smokers, whose expectations

were sensitive only to smoking-related illnesses, than for former smokers and never smokers

who reacted to a wider range of health signals. Using three waves of the HRS to test the

Bayesian updating model, Sloan et al. (1999) found that smokers perceived that they were more

likely to experience diseases associated with smoking, and thus tended to be more pessimistic

about their chances of living to age 75. Using four waves of the HRS, Smith et al. (2001) found

that serious health shocks and limitations on new activities significantly reduced expected

longevity.

       This study addresses two issues. First, we use pooled cross-sectional data to investigate the

determinants of the subjective probability of living to age 75 or 85. Second, using panel-structured

data, we explore how longevity expectations respond to new health information obtained by

physical examination. We use a simple Bayesian learning model (Viscusi and O’Connor, 1984;
                                                                                                       3


Viscusi, 1985) to describe how individuals adjust their expectations in response to new

information.

       Using three surveys of Taiwanese between the ages of 40 and 64 years, we find that men

tend to significantly overestimate their chances of living to 75 or 85, compared with life-table

rates. In contrast, women tend to underestimate the probability of living to 75 and overestimate

the chance of living to 85. Overall, the longevity expectations of males and married persons are

more optimistic than those of females and single persons. We also find that income is positively

correlated with the subjective probability of living to age 75, but education appears to have little

association with survival expectations. Consistent with the previous literature, longevity of the

same-sex parent is strongly associated with an individual’s perceived probability of living to 75.

Consistent with actuarial data, the subjective probability of living to age 75 or 85 increases at an

increasing rate with age.

       Our results suggest that individuals who acquire new adverse health information from

their physical examination revise downwards their chances of survival. A diagnosis of heart

disease is found to have a strong negative effect on longevity expectations. Survival probabilities

are also significantly reduced for individuals with a larger number of abnormal test outcomes and

those receiving more extensive advice on health behavior from their physicians.

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data sources

and provides a descriptive analysis, including comparison of subjective survival probabilities

with actuarial estimates. Section 3 presents the empirical model specifications for the

cross-sectional and panel analyses. Empirical results are reported in Section 4, and the

conclusions are in Section 5.

2. Data and Descriptive Analysis

     The National Health Insurance (NHI) program in Taiwan was implemented in March 1995.

The program is characterized by universal coverage, low premiums, comprehensive scope of

benefits, easy access to medical treatment, proper care for disadvantaged groups, and high public

satisfaction. As of the end of 2005, more than 20 millions individuals were enrolled in the NHI

with a coverage rate of 99 percent.

       This study incorporates data from three surveys conducted at the Mackay Memorial

Hospital in Taipei, Taiwan, which is one of the hospitals contracted to the NHI program. The first

two surveys (waves 1 and 2 of the 2001 survey) can be combined to provide a panel-structured

dataset, while the final survey (the 2002 survey) provides cross-sectional data. The sample was

restricted to individuals between 40 and 64 years old participating in the voluntary physical

examination which is provided free of charge to adults of these ages by the Bureau of National

Health Insurance (BNHI). The majority of our sample resides in Taipei City or Taipei County,

near the hospital.

       Our analysis is based on individuals’ subjective perceptions of longevity before and after

their physical examinations, as well as their medical diagnoses and advice on health behavior

provided by their physicians. Wave 1 of the 2001 survey was administered by in-person

interview between July and December 2001. The questionnaire covered socio-demographic

characteristics, subjective health status, health behaviors, and longevity expectations. Wave 2

consisted of follow-up telephone interviews between two and three months later, after the

respondents had received their physical examination reports from the hospital. Wave 2 interviews

included information on the participants’ understanding of the diagnosed diseases from which

they were suffering, their health behaviors, and their longevity expectations. The physical

examination reports provided information on the outcomes of test items, diagnosed diseases and
                                                                                                   5


the extent of the advice on health behaviors provided by their physicians. Our measures of new

health information are constructed as the incidence of newly diagnosed health conditions, test

results, and physician advice recorded on the medical examination reports. The 2002 survey was

similar to wave 1 of the 2001 survey. It was administered at the same hospital between July and

December 2002. Funding limitations precluded a second wave of this survey.

       Seven hundred respondents participated in waves 1 and 2 of the 2001 survey, and an

additional 930 respondents participated in the 2002 survey. After discarding observations with

incomplete information on key variables, a total of 1,390 observations remain for analysis (620

from the 2001 survey and 770 from the 2002 survey).

       Our panel data (from the two waves of the 2001 survey) have several limitations. First,

females are over-represented compared with their share of the national population. Second, there

is a potential selection issue because those participating in the physical examinations may be

more health-conscious than non-participants, which might influence their longevity expectations.

Third, the interval between the two waves was between two and three months, which does not

allow us to examine the evolution of longevity expectations over a longer period.

       The variables of greatest interest to this study are the measures of subjective survival

probability. Longevity expectations were elicited from the participants’ responses to the

following questions: “Using any number from 0 to 100, where ‘0’ means absolutely no chance

and ‘100’ means absolute certainty, what do you think are the chances of you living to be 75 (or

85)?” After rescaling the responses to the zero-one interval we treat them as measures of the

subjective probabilities of surviving to ages 75 and 85, denoted P75 and P85, respectively.1

Previous studies (e.g., Hurd and McGarry, 1995) have used a similar question format. Viscusi

 To reduce potential cognition and response errors, interviewers were asked to explain the
meaning of the 0-100 point scale to each respondent prior to asking the survival questions.
                                                                                                        6


and Hakes (2003) found that HRS responses to a similar question (which required respondents to

provide a value between 0 and 10) may not be interpretable as probabilities since they do not

respond to changes in age and other characteristics in a consistent fashion.

        Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the frequency distributions of the subjective probabilities of

surviving to age 75 (P75) and 85 (P85), respectively. The figures are for the pooled

cross-sectional data comprised of wave 1 of the 2001 survey and the 2002 survey. Many

respondents gave focal-point responses. For P75, 32 percent reported ‘1.0’, 17 percent reported

‘0.5’, and 11 percent reported ‘0’. For P85, 15 percent reported ‘1.0’, 18 percent reported ‘0.5’,

and 27 percent reported ‘0’. One interpretation of these results is that many respondents chose

one of these three points according to whether they are rather confident, uncertain, or not at all

confident of reaching ages 75 and 85. Alternatively, the spikes may reveal cognition error or

misunderstanding. Hurd and McGarry (1995) obtained a similar distribution with spikes at these

focal values for US respondents. Compared with their results, we find about 10 percent more

respondents who reported they are absolutely certain (‘1.0’) to live to age 75 and about 10

percent more who reported absolutely no chance (‘0’) of surviving to age 85.

        Table 1 reports the average values of P75 and P85 by age and Table 2 reports the frequency

distributions of survival expectations by age. In all groups, the average probabilities satisfy basic

logical requirements: the average probability of living to 75 is (substantially) larger than that of

living to 85 and the average probabilities of living to 75 and 85 increase with age (except for

women aged 55-59). Consistent with prior studies, women report smaller average probabilities

than men, despite their larger actuarial probabilities. Compared with Taiwanese life-tables, men

substantially overestimate their probabilities of living to age 75 and 85. Women also overestimate

the probability of living to 85 but underestimate the probability of living to 75. In the US, Viscusi

and Hakes (2003) found that white males and females both underestimate the probabilities of
                                                                                                       7


living to 75. In contrast, white males overestimate their probability of living to 85 while white

females appear to overestimate this probability at younger ages and underestimate it at older ages.

       Following the approach proposed by Viscusi and Hakes (2003), we test the validity of the

responses in Table 3. The first two columns report results of estimating a regression of subjective

probability on actuarial probability of survival (P75 and P85) and the last column reports the

results of estimating a regression of the spread in subjective probability of survival against the

actual survival probability spread (P75 – P85). The estimated slopes are well below one and

close to zero. All three slopes are significantly different from one and none are significantly

different from zero. These results imply that people are poorly informed about their survival

chances or that the question format does not yield a good probability estimate, consistent with

Viscusi’s and Hakes’ (2003) findings.

       Since current health status can influence survival probability, we report the average values

of P75 and P85 by self-assessed health status in Table 4. Respondents were asked to assess their

health as compared with others of the same age. As in the US (Hurd and McGarry, 2002),

respondents with better self-reported health report higher survival probabilities. Within health

categories, survival probabilities are again higher among men than women. Differences in

self-reported health status are associated with large variations in survival expectations. As health

ranges between excellent and poor, P75 ranges from 0.94 to 0.33 for men and from 0.83 to 0.28 for

women. A similar pattern exists for P85.

       Table 5 provides information about how survival expectations change in response to new

health information obtained through the medical examinations that occurred between waves 1

and 2 of the 2001 survey. As most of the new information is adverse, more respondents reported

a decline in survival probabilities than an increase. For the probability of living to age 75, about

65 percent reported a smaller value in wave 2 than in wave 1 while 25 percent reported a higher
                                                                                                   8


value and 10 percent reported exactly the same value. A similar pattern prevails for the

probability of living to 85.


3. Econometric Models

       This section describes the models used for a cross-sectional analysis of how longevity

expectations vary with respondent characteristics and a panel analysis of how longevity

expectations respond to new information obtained through the physical examination.

3.1 Cross-Sectional Analysis

       In the cross-sectional analysis, we examine the relationships between subjective survival

probabilities and socio-demographic characteristics, self-reported health status and diseases,

health conditions, and health behavior using multiple regression. The regression function can be

written as:

               P = f (X, S, H1, H2, e)                                                      (1)

where the dependent variable P is the subjective probability of living to age 75 (P75) or 85 (P85).

The socio-demographic variables, represented by X, include age, gender, martial status,

educational level, income, parental mortality, and whether the respondent lives with children.

Subjective health status, S, is a vector of self-reported diseases and two measures of self-reported

health status (current health compared with others of the same age and compared with the

respondent’s own health a year earlier). The vector H1 measures health conditions, including

number of hospital admissions, number of visits to outpatient clinics, insomnia, unhappiness, and

obesity. Health behaviors, represented by H2, include exercise, smoking, drinking, and the habit

of eating breakfast. Finally, the residual e represents unobservable determinants of the subjective

survival probability.
                                                                                                    9


Socio-demographic characteristics

       Socio-demographic characteristics include age, gender, marital status, educational level,

personal disposable income, and family background. With the exception of age and income, all

are categorical. Age and age squared are included to test for a non-linear relationship between

age and longevity expectations.

       We create three binary variables for educational level, describing the number of years of

schooling completed. They are Junior high school, Senior high school, and College (or above);

the reference group is respondents with elementary-school education or less. Personal disposable

income is measured as the logarithm of personal monthly income (or monthly retirement

payments and income provided by family members).2

       We include information on respondents’ social background, such as parental mortality

and whether they live with their children. Prior studies have found that individuals’ subjective

probabilities of survival increase with the longevity of their parents (Feinstein, 1993; Hurd and

McGarry, 1995). We measure Parental mortality as 1 if the either of the respondent’s parents has

died, 0 otherwise. Since men may be more influenced by the experience of their father’s

mortality, and women more by the experience of their mother’s mortality, we include four

interaction variables describing the mortality experience of the parents by the gender of the

respondent: male×father died, male×mother died, female×father died, and female×mother died.3




2
  For retired workers, housewives, and unemployed respondents, we use either monthly
retirement payments received or income provided by family members as a proxy for personal
income. Income is measured in thousands of NT dollars. The approximate exchange rate is 35
NT$ to 1 US$.
3
  The effect of a parent’s death on longevity expectations may operate through both biological
and psychological mechanisms.
                                                                                                  10


       As living with children may increase an individual’s emotional well-being, such

respondents may adopt a more optimistic attitude towards longevity. Children is defined as 1 if

the respondent lives with his or her children, and 0 otherwise.

Self-reported health status and diseases

       Psychological studies note that people’s self-evaluations are generally formed by

comparison with their peers (Gibbons, 1999; Mallinson, 2002). For perceived general health, we

use two measures of health status. The first is defined by comparison with other people of the

same age (Subjective health status - compared with others), while the second is defined as an

internal comparison, with respondents being asked to compare their health now with their health

a year earlier (Subjective health status - compared with oneself)). The answers to these questions

were coded using a standard five-point scale: (1) ‘excellent’, (2) ‘very good’, (3) ‘good’, (4)

‘fair’, and (5) ‘poor’. The two measures of subjective health status were defined as 1 if the

respondent’s answer was ‘excellent’ and 0 otherwise.

       Survey participants were asked if they suffered from any of twelve diseases over the

previous year. The diseases were gastric or duodenal ulcer, hepatitis, hypertension,

hyperlipidemia, heart disease, asthma, diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, gout, bladder or

urethral disease, lumbago or spondylosis, and cancer or malignant tumors. Self-reported diseases

was defined as a count of these diseases from which the respondent reported suffering.

Health conditions

       Five measures of physical and mental health conditions were constructed. Hospital was

defined as 1 if the respondent had been admitted to a hospital during the previous year and Clinic

was defined as the number of visits to an outpatient clinic in the previous month. Insomnia was

defined as 1 if the respondent’s answer to the question: “How often have you suffered from

insomnia this year?” was ‘quite often’ or ‘every day’, and 0 if his answer was ‘never’ or
                                                                                                  11


‘occasionally’. The indicator of depressed mood, Unhappy , was defined as 1 if the respondent

answered the question: “In general, do you feel happy with your present life?” with ‘unhappy’ or

‘very unhappy’, and 0 if he answered ‘OK’; ‘happy’; or ‘very happy’.

         We also included a variable to measure obesity, as much evidence shows that obesity

impairs health and longevity (e.g., Himes, 2000; Philipson, 2001). Obesity is defined as 1 if the

respondent’s body mass index (BMI) is more than 27 kg/m2, and 0 otherwise. BMI is calculated

using measured height and weight from clinical records (not self reports), and the cutoff is based

on guidelines provided by the Taiwan Department of Health.4

Health behaviors

         Four types of health behaviors are examined, based on respondents’ self reports. Exercise

was defined as 1 if the respondent reported exercising more than three times during the previous

week, and 0 otherwise. Smoke was defined as 1 if the respondent is a current smoker and 0

otherwise. Drink was measured as 1 if the respondent occasionally or regularly drinks alcoholic

beverages and 0 otherwise. Breakfast was measured as 1 if the respondent eats breakfast every

day, and 0 otherwise.

         Definitions of variables and summary statistics for the cross-sectional data are reported in

Table 6.

3.2 Risk-updating Model

         Following the risk-updating approach developed by Viscusi and O’Connor (1984) and

Viscusi (1985) and used by Sloan et al. (1999), Smith et al. (2001), and Viscusi and Hakes (2003),

we evaluate how new health information, acquired from a physical examination, affects an

individual’s longevity expectations. The individual’s perceived survival probability posterior to

receipt of the results of a physical examination, Pt, is hypothesized to be a weighted average of

his longevity assessment prior to the physical examination, Pt-1, and the unobserved risk

equivalent, St, of any new health information provided by the examination. The posterior

assessment of an individual’s probability of living to age 75 or 85, Pt, is modeled as a weighted

average of prior beliefs, weighted by the precision of the prior beliefs, θ/(θ + γ), and the risk

equivalent of the new information, St, weighted by its relative precision, γ/(θ + γ):
                       θ Pt − 1 + γ St
                Pt =                   .                                                      (2)
                          θ +γ
Note that the risk equivalent of the new information, St, is measured as a probability and is

bounded to the zero-one interval.

       Our primary hypothesis is that the physical examination report provides new information

which induces a revision of the individual’s subjective probability of survival. The physical

examination report contains information on the outcomes of seven test items, five areas of

health-behavior advice provided by physicians, and six diagnosed diseases.

       We described information provided by the physical examination using a set of binary

variables associated with medical tests, physician advice, and health shocks. Test information (T)

includes the outcomes of the seven test items – urinalysis, complete blood count, blood sugar,

liver function, renal function, lipids, and uric acid. Physician advice (D) includes advice on

‘quitting smoking’, ‘quitting drinking’, ‘oral hygiene’, ‘weight control’, and ‘diet and nutrition’.

Health shocks or the onset of new health conditions (H) experienced between waves 1 and 2 of

the 2001 survey are defined to occur when an individual is diagnosed with one of six diseases

(hypertension, thyroid disease, heart disease, hepatitis, hyperlipidemia, gout) that were not

self-reported in wave 1 of the 2001 survey.
                                                                                                      13


       In addition to these binary variables, we constructed three aggregate measures of health

information, defined as the number of abnormal test outcomes, the number of areas of advice

provided by physicians, and the number of health shocks. These variables are based on the

assumption that abnormal test outcomes, greater amounts of advice by physicians, and any new

health shocks all represent adverse information. Our unobservable indicator of the risk equivalent of

new health information, St, is hypothesized to be a function of these measures,

               St = f (T, P, H, X, u).                                                        (3)

Socio-demographic characteristics (X), such as age, gender, marital status, and level of education

are included to account for the possibility that either the significance of the information or the

individual’s response to it may differ among individuals, and u is a residual. Substituting

equation (3) into (2) and using a linear approximation for the function f(•) yields our empirical

model relating the posterior and prior longevity expectations,

where the vector Z represents the factors in equation (3), including an intercept.

       Given estimates of Pt and Pt-1, it is possible to estimate the risk equivalent of new health

information, St, and the relative informational value of the new information,ψ = γ/θ, as

4. Empirical Results

       The results of the cross-sectional analysis of subjective survival probabilities and the

panel analysis of risk-updating analyses are reported in this section.

4.1 Cross-Sectional Analysis

       Our analysis begins with an examination of the determinants of survival probabilities

using the pooled cross-sectional data (wave 1 of the 2001 survey and the 2002 survey).

Parameter estimates for OLS regressions describing the subjective probability of surviving to

ages 75 and 85 are presented in Table 8. Since the survival probabilities are restricted to the

interval between 0 and 1, we also report maximum likelihood estimates using a two-limit Tobit

model in the Appendix (Table A1).5 The basic results are similar to those in Table 7.

       As shown in Table 8, men and married persons tend to be more optimistic than females

and single persons. Those who live with their children tend to report a higher perceived

probability of living to age 75. Income has a significantly positive correlation with P75, but not

with P85, while education has a weak positive association with subjective survival probabilities.

All the measures of health behavior are insignificantly negative, reflecting little association with

longevity expectations. We also find evidence of a convex (U-shaped) relationship between

longevity expectations and age.6

       The subjective probability of survival is highly correlated with self-assessed health

measures. Respondents who describe their own health as ‘excellent’ compared with their own

health a year earlier, and especially compared with other people of the same age, have higher


5
   Smith and Desvousges (1988) used the two-limit Tobit model to investigate the ways in which
risk perceptions are updated in response to information about risks from radon.
6
   Using age classes rather than age and age squared, we find that, compared with respondents
aged 40-44, those aged 60-64 report significantly higher probability of living to 75 but only
marginally significantly higher probability of living to 85.
                                                                                                     15


subjective survival probabilities. In contrast, respondents with more self-reported diseases tend

to report smaller perceived survival probabilities.7 Moreover, respondents who are obese, less

happy, suffering from insomnia, or who visit outpatient clinics more frequently also have more

pessimistic longevity expectations.

        The mortality experience of the respondent’s parents has an important and predictable

relationship with both P75 and P85. As shown in columns 1 and 3 of Table 8, the coefficients of

parental mortality are statistically significant and negative, suggesting that the death of a parent

reduces an individual’s subjective survival probability. In columns 2 and 4, we include

interactions between the respondents’ gender and dummy variables indicating whether his

mother or father has died. The results suggest that the decrease in the subjective probability of

living to 75 from the death of a same-sex parent is larger than that from the death of an

opposite-sex parent. If a male respondent’s father has died, the estimated reduction in P75 is 0.03

more than if his mother has died. If a female respondent’s mother has died, the estimated effect is

0.04 larger than if her father has died (these effects are not statistically significant for P85). The

larger effect of the death of a same-sex parent is consistent with the results of Hamermesh (1985)

and Hurd et al. (1999) for the US.

        To investigate the effects of non-response or focal-point-response bias, we estimate the

model including a sample-selection correction using an inverse Mills ratio. The probit selection

equation is specified as a function of age, gender, marital status, level of education, employment

status, subjective health status, and health knowledge.8 We find that respondents who are older,



7
   Self-reported asthma is found to significantly reduce the subjective probability of living to 75,
while hyperlipidemia and heart disease are found to significantly decrease the probability of
living to 85.
8
   The measure of health knowledge is based on the number of correct responses to whether each
of ten health problems are associated with obesity, and ranges from 0 to 10.
                                                                                                    16


less-educated, less knowledgeable about health, unemployed, and with lower incomes have a

higher propensity toward either not responding or providing a focal-point response (i.e., 0, 0.5, or

1). The insignificant coefficient of the inverse Mills ratio indicates that the sample selection bias

should not be regarded as a significant influence.9

       Table 9 uses the difference between the subjective and actuarial survival probabilities as

an alternative dependent variable for the models in Table 8. The results suggest that respondents

who are male, have higher income, better perceived health status, live with their children, and

whose parents are both alive have subjective survival probabilities that are significantly larger

than their actuarial survival probabilities, whereas those who are less happy, suffering from

insomnia, or who report more self-reported diseases have subjective probabilities that are

significantly smaller than their actuarial probabilities.

4.2 Risk-Updating Model

       In this section, we use the Bayesian updating model to describe how respondents update

their longevity expectations between the two periods of the panel data (waves 1 and 2 of the

2001 survey).10 We explore how new information on test outcomes, advice provided by

physicians, and health shocks affect the subjective probabilities of living to 75 or 85. To save

space, we report only the estimated coefficients for prior subjective probability and the aggregate

measures of new health information. The OLS estimates are reported in Table 10 and two-limit

Tobit maximum-likelihood estimates in the Appendix (Table A2).11 The coefficient estimates

from the two approaches are very similar and we focus our discussion on the OLS results.



9
   To save space, we do not report estimates of the sample-selection model.
10
    We find that respondents who are older, less-educated, and report fair or poor health compared
with other people of the same age are more likely to refuse to participate in the wave 2 survey.
11
    The dependent variable of the two-limit Tobit model in Table A2 is the difference between
two probabilities and is bounded by -1 and 1.
                                                                                                      17


       As shown in Table 10, the coefficients of P75 and P85 in wave 1 are significantly greater

than zero, suggesting that prior beliefs play an important role in shaping posterior survival

expectations. An F test allows us to reject the hypothesis that all of the coefficients are jointly

zero. In the case of P75, the estimated risk-equivalent value of new health information, St, is 0.52,

about three-quarters as large as the respondents’ prior survival probability, 0.71 (reported in

Table 6). The estimate of ψ, calculated at the sample mean, implies that the new health

information is slightly more than three times as influential as the respondents’ prior beliefs in

forming the posterior subjective probability. For P85, the risk-equivalent measure of new health

information, St, is 0.24, about half as large as the respondents’ prior value of 0.47 (reported in

Table 6). The estimated value of ψ is slightly more than 10, implying that respondents view the

new information as more than ten times as informative as their prior information.12 These

findings offer support for a connection between prior and posterior longevity expectations, which

is consistent with the Bayesian learning model.

       The models reported in columns (1) – (4) of Table 10, including alternative aggregate

measures of new health information (i.e., the numbers of adverse test results, topics on which

physicians provided advice, and new diagnoses) yield virtually identical estimates of the

risk-equivalent measure of new information and the relative precision of the new and prior health

information. The estimated coefficients on the number of adverse test outcomes and the number

of topics on which physicians provided advice are statistically significant predictors of the

posterior survival estimate, for both P75 and P85. Although the estimated coefficients on the

number of newly diagnosed diseases are not statistically significant, the estimated values of these


12
   Uncertainty about the estimates of St and ψ is characterized using a parametric bootstrap
assuming the estimate of the coefficient of the prior subjective probability is normally distributed.
Because the distribution of ψ = 1/a – 1 (eqn. (5b)) is highly skewed and poorly estimated for P85
we report the 0.1 and 0.9 fractiles of the bootstrap distribution.
                                                                                                    18


coefficients are larger than for the other aggregate measures, which is consistent with the notion

that diagnosis of disease causes a larger reduction in subjective survival probability than does an

adverse test result or receiving advice about health behavior from a physician.

       In auxiliary models similar to those reported in Table 10, we include variables describing

specific test outcomes, types of physician advice, and disease diagnoses, to determine which

types of information were most influential. Of the test outcomes, abnormalities of lipid and liver

function have a significant negative effect on subjective expectations of longevity. A

recommendation about weight control is the only type of physician advice which significantly

reduces subjective survival probabilities. Among the health shocks, a diagnosis of heart disease

has the strongest influence on subjective survival probabilities. It is associated with a reduction

of 0.19 in the subjective probability of living to age 75 and a reduction of 0.16 in the probability

of living to age 85. A diagnosis of hepatitis decreases the subjective probability of living to age

75 while a diagnosis of thyroid disease decreases the subjective probability of living to age 85.


5. Conclusions

       We examine the determinants of subjective survival probabilities and explore how

individuals’ longevity expectations respond to new health information. Our analysis is based on

Taiwanese individuals’ subjective assessments of their perceived longevity before and after

physical examinations, which provided new information in the form of medical diagnoses,

advice from physicians to modify behavior, and results of medical tests. Using pooled

cross-sectional data, we find that males and married persons are more optimistic about their

longevity expectations than females and single persons. We find the expected increasing convex

relationship between subjective survival probabilities and age. Income is positively correlated

with the probability of living to age 75 but education has little association with survival
                                                                                                   19


expectations. Consistent with previous studies, the longevity of a same-sex parent has a strong

influence on an individual’s own survival expectations.

       Our findings using panel data support the Bayesian learning model, which describes how

individuals use new health information to revise their longevity expectations. We find that

individuals with more abnormal test outcomes and those receiving more extensive advice on health

behavior from their physicians significantly reduce their subjective probabilities of living to 75 or

85. The subjective probability of survival also declines with health shocks such as the diagnosis

of heart disease. Our results support the belief that individuals who acquire more adverse health

information revise downwards their perceived chances of survival.
