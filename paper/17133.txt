In this research, we provide new empirical evidence on the importance of time-varying uncertainty
for the exchange rate and the excess return in currency markets. Following an increase in monetary
policy uncertainty, the dollar exchange rate appreciates in the medium run, while an increase in the
volatility of productivity leads to a dollar depreciation. We propose a general-equilibrium theory of
exchange rate determination based on the interaction between monetary policy and time-varying uncertainty
aimed at understanding these regularities. In the model, the behaviour of the exchange rate following
nominal and real volatility shocks is consistent with the empirical evidence. Furthermore we show
that risk factors and interest-rate smoothing are important in accounting for the negative coefficient
in the UIP regression.

1     Introduction
One of the main features of the recent financial crisis has been the increase in financial and
macroeconomic volatility. Currency markets have not been an exception: foreign exchange
rate volatility has surged and large swings in the dollar exchange rate have occurred. How do
changes in volatility affect exchange rates? Is the source of volatility, nominal or real, relevant
for determining exchange rate fluctuations?
    These are the questions that we address in this research by providing an empirical and
theoretical analysis on the link between uncertainty and the exchange rate. The focus on uncer-
tainty belongs to the tradition in international finance that has emphasized how variations in
risk over time are essential for understanding the exchange rate. In fact, the large biases in the
foreign-exchange forward premium that have been documented since Bilson (1981) and Fama
(1984) constitute a compelling evidence of variations in risk premia as a rational-expectations
explanation of the link between exchange rates and interest rates. Evidence of a time-varying
risk component of the excess return in foreign-exchange market is further documented by the
recent work of Menkhoff, Sarno, Schmeling and Schrimpf (2010), who show that deviations from
Uncovered Interest-rate Parity (UIP) can be accounted for in terms of compensation for risk.1
They identify global foreign exchange volatility as a key factor.
    We propose a theory of exchange rate determination based on exogenous risk factors in which
the link between risk and the nominal exchange rate is guided by monetary policy through
interest-rate rules.2 The aim is to understand the role of exogenous risk factors in explaining
the main regularities that we observe in international finance. To this purpose, we depart from
most of the existing models of exchange rate determination, which study the impact of the first
moments of exogenous variables on the nominal exchange rate, and examine the exchange rate’s
response to changes in the volatility of nominal and real shocks.3 Moreover, the structure upon
which we build our analysis between risk factors and exchange rates is a theory of nominal
exchange rate determination based on interest rate rules (Benigno and Benigno, 2008).4
    This research contributes to the literature from an empirical and a theoretical perspective.
In our empirical analysis we provide new evidence that justifies our focus on risk factors: the
novelty of our contribution is to examine the role of nominal and real stochastic volatilities
for the behavior of exchange rates in an otherwise standard open-economy VAR. We find that
volatility shocks do matter for the equilibrium level of interest and exchange rates and that the
exchange rate tends to appreciate in response to an increase in nominal volatility (both of the
discretionary shock to monetary policy and of the inflation target) and to depreciate following
   1
     Engel (2010) provides further evidence on this even by looking at the real version of the UIP and shows that
the expected appreciation of high-yield currencies is combined with a relatively stronger currency.
   2
     In what follows we refer to risk, uncertainty and stochastic volatility in an interchangeable way.
   3
     Hodrick (1989) and Obstfeld and Rogoff (2001) in a flexible- and sticky-price environment, respectively, relate
the nominal exchange rate to monetary uncertainty through alternative specifications of money demand.
   4
     This implies that the parameters of the policy rules (as opposed to preferences to money demand) become
crucial in shaping exchange rate dynamics and in determining to what extent nominal or real disturbances matter
for the nominal (and real) exchange rate.


                                                         1
an increase in real volatility (of the productivity shock). Moreover, the stylized facts reported
by Eichenbaum and Evans (1995) about the response of interest and exchange rates to a shock
to the level of the monetary policy instrument are not affected by the explicit consideration of
time-varying volatility elements in the VAR.
       In our theoretical model, the key channel through which exchange rates and uncertainty are
related is a simple hedging motive. An increase in uncertainty does not necessarily lead to a
depreciation of the currency: what matters is whether the currency is relatively safer when there
are bad news. In this respect, uncertainty may improve the hedging properties of the currency
leading to an increase in its demand and thereby an appreciation.
       We develop a two-country open-economy model along the lines of Benigno and Benigno
(2008), extended in two dimensions. As in Benigno and Benigno (2008), we assume differentiated
home and foreign produced goods, international market completeness, nominal price rigidities
and interest rate rules; here, however, we allow for a more general specification of preferences
as in Epstein and Zin (1989) and for stochastic volatility in the exogenous processes driving the
economy.
       In this direction, our contribution to the literature is to provide a general-equilibrium per-
spective on the ability of currently used models with stochastic volatility to explain international
macro-finance facts.5 From a modelling point of view, the general equilibrium analysis is crucial
for examining the transmission mechanism of risk factors and generating a non-trivial interac-
tion between shocks and the variables of interests. From an empirical point of view, the general
equilibrium analysis allows us to compare the model’s performance with the shocks and factors
highlighted in the VAR.
       The assumption of time-varying exogenous uncertainty entails non-trivial issues in the so-
lution of the model. To this end, we apply a new method that we have recently developed for
general dynamic stochastic models with time-varying uncertainty (Benigno, Benigno and Nis-
ticò, 2010). The main result of our previous work is that a second-order approximation of the
model is sufficient to account for a distinct and direct role of time-varying uncertainty on the
endogenous variables, provided that the structural shocks are conditionally linear. In contrast,
recent works have emphasized the need of relying on a third-order approximation (see Fernandez-
Villaverde and Rubio-Ramirez, 2010).6 Our method has several advantages: it simplifies the
computational burden, it reduces the degree of freedom that a third-order approximation would
generate when evaluating the model performance through a calibration exercise and, finally, it
allows to evaluate time-varying risk premia, which in our case are second-order terms, through
just a first-order approximation of the equilibrium conditions.
       For a special case of our general model we are able to obtain analytical results. When
purchasing power parity holds, prices are flexible and monetary policy is specified as a Taylor
   5
     As we will discuss below, most of the models that have been developed recently specify exogenous process for
consumption and/or output.
   6
     The key difference is that our first-order approximation still displays heteroskedasticity and is the best ap-
proximation in the class of conditionally-linear processes.



                                                        2
rule that reacts to either PPI or CPI inflation, we obtain that an increase in the domestic
volatilities of the nominal shocks appreciate the nominal exchange rate consistently with our
empirical findings. Theoretically the excess return on home currency bonds decreases with an
increase in nominal risk factors.
   While this simple model is partly successful in capturing the link between nominal risk factors
and the exchange rate, it fails in replicating other key international finance regularities. In fact
the implied slope coefficient from a UIP regression would still be positive. We then consider the
case in which policy authorities smooth interest rates over time and find that, conditional on
shocks to the monetary policy instrument, it is possible to obtain a negative coefficient in the
UIP regression which becomes more negative as the smoothing coefficient increases.
   From a theoretical point of view we then explore the role of Epstein-Zin preferences. First,
in an open economy, cross-country surprises in utility influence the international distribution of
wealth so that equilibrium quantities are also affected by the preference specification, unlike in
the closed-economy case. Second, if we focus on the case in which the subjective discount factor
is very close to the unitary value, then the surprises to utility depend, up to a first order, only
on the stochastic trend in world productivity. The implication is that, in this case, nominal
stochastic discount factors are highly correlated across countries, an aspect that is consistent
with a global explanation for risk premia.
   We then evaluate quantitatively the properties of our model by calibrating it following the
recent empirical literature (see, e.g. Lubik and Schorfeide, 2005). We focus on a small set of facts
that are related to exchange rates. The response of exchange rates and excess returns to volatility
shocks is consistent with our empirical findings. Moreover, we show that the specification of
monetary policy and the presence of stochastic volatility terms is crucial for obtaining a negative
coefficient in the UIP regression (as discussed in Backus, Gavazzoni, Telmer and Zin, 2010).

   Related Literature

   This paper is related to different strands of literature. From an empirical point of view,
we build on the early analysis of Clarida and Gali (1994) and Eichenbaum and Evans (1995),
which have examined the effects of monetary shocks on the exchange rate. Our contribution is
to assess the role of real and nominal uncertainty on the exchange rate whereas their focus is on
the innovation in real and nominal shocks.
   From a theoretical perspective there are two key elements in our analysis: stochastic volatil-
ity and monetary policy. The emphasis on exogenous risk factors is not novel in exchange rate
economics: early contributions by Frankel and Meese (1987) in a partial equilibrium setting,
and Hodrick (1989) in general equilibrium, have pointed out the role of uncertainty in explain-
ing exchange rate determination. More recently Obstfeld and Rogoff (2002) have studied the
role of risk factors in a general equilibrium model when nominal prices are sticky, focusing on
money supply as the monetary-policy instrument. Our paper follows this tradition in inter-
national finance and it is also connected to a more recent macroeconomic literature that has


                                                 3
examined the role and the effects that risk or uncertainty have on macroeconomic variables
(see for example Bloom, 2009, Bloom, Floetotto and Jaimovich, 2009 and Fernandez-Villaverde,
Guerron-Quintana, Rubio-Ramirez and Uribe, 2010).
        The importance of monetary policy using interest-rate rules in exchange rate determina-
tion has been analyzed in Benigno and Benigno (2008) while its role for the understanding of
the uncovered interest rate parity puzzle has been first highlighted by McCallum (1994) and
more recently by Backus, Gavazzoni, Telmer and Zin (2010). The latter authors have recasted
McCallum’s insight in a microfounded setting endogenizing the currency risk premium that is
exogenous in McCallum’s model.
        Our work is also related to a fast-growing literature in international macro-finance that has
developed models of the risk premium based on specifications of the stochastic discount factors
derived from alternative preferences. Bansal and Shaliastovich (2009) relies on Epstein-Zin pref-
erences combined with long-run risk, Backus et al. (2010) emphasizes the role of monetary policy
for addressing the uncovered interest rate parity puzzle in nominal terms, Gavazzoni (2009) re-
lies on Epstein-Zin preferences combined with stochastic volatility, Moore and Roche (2010) and
Verdelhan (2010) propose models based on external habit with preferences à la Campbell and
Cochrane (1999). While we share some of the features of these studies, our analysis follows a
general equilibrium approach by combining macro and financial market equilibrium and builds
upon a theory of nominal exchange rate determination based on interest rate rules. The latter
aspect is important insofar as we want to address, from a model perspective, the UIP puzzle in
nominal rather then in real terms as most of these models do.


2        Empirical evidence
In this section, we provide new empirical evidence on the importance of time-varying uncer-
tainty in open economies through a simple VAR analysis, along the lines of Eichenbaum and
Evans (1995), which we take as our empirical benchmark. We aim at providing a quantita-
tive assessment on the effects that innovations to the volatility of underlying disturbances may
have on the level of macro variables of interest. In particular we focus on the conditional
time-varying volatilities of three specific shocks, that are going to play a relevant role in the the-
oretical model of the next sections: the conditional volatility of the monetary-policy shock, of
the inflation-target shock and of the productivity shock.7 Our focus will be mainly to study how
these shocks affect the nominal (and real) exchange rate and the foreign currency risk premium
which captures the deviations from UIP. However, we will also look at the responses of output,
inflation and the yield curve. Moreover, we will evaluate whether the results of Eichenbaum
and Evans (1995), and investigated by a large body of subsequent literature, are robust to the
inclusion of time-varying volatility into the picture.
    7
    In our model, the monetary policy shock represents a shock to the systematic component of the interest rate
rule. The inflation target is also part of the interest rate rule and represents the target with respect to which any
deviation of actual inflation triggers the policy response.

       We use monthly data for the G7 countries on the sample period ranging from March 1971
through September 2010, and estimate a VAR with six lags for each pair of countries that
includes the US.8 We consider a benchmark specification with seven macroeconomic variables,
in the spirit of Eichenbaum and Evans (1995). To this set of macro “level” variables, we then
add three time series describing the time-varying volatilities of the monetary-policy shock (uξ,t ),
the inflation-target shock (uπ,t ) and the productivity shock (ua,t ). The “level” variables that we
consider are the US nominal Federal Funds Rate (i) indicating the stance of monetary policy,
the US and foreign Industrial Production Indexes (y, y ∗ ) measuring the domestic and foreign
real activity, the US CPI Index (p) capturing the domestic price level, the foreign short-term
nominal interest rate measured by the 3-month Treasury Bill rate (i∗ ), the slope of the US term
structure computed as the difference between the 10-year Treasury Constant Maturities rate
and the 3-month Treasury Bill rate (isl ≡ i10y − i3m ) and the real exchange rate, defined as
q ≡ s + p∗ − p where s denotes the nominal exchange rate, expressed in terms of units of USD
needed to buy one unit of foreign currency.9 As such, an increase in q (or s) denotes a US Dollar
real (nominal) depreciation. All variables are in logs, except for the interest rates which are
monthly percentage points.

2.1      Measuring Time-varying Volatility
We now explain how we build the three conditional volatilities of interest. For the conditional
volatility of the monetary-policy shock we use daily data from the Federal Funds futures markets,
following Kuttner (2001), among others.
                                     0 the spot-month futures rate on day d for a contract with
       In particular, denoting with ft,d
                                                                        0 as the conditional
delivery in month t (with day d belonging to month t) we can interpret ft,d
time−d expectation of the average funds rate in month t, plus a stochastic risk premium µ:

                                           0          1 X
                                          ft,d = Ed       i1,j + µ0t,d ,
                                                      mt
                                                          j∈t


where mt is the number of days in month t and i1 is the daily interest rate. To extract information
about revisions in time−d expectations about future monetary policy actions from data on f ,
Kuttner (2001) suggests to use the daily change in the futures rate, scaled up to account for the
                                                                             mt     0        0
number of days in month t that are affected by the surprise:                mt −d (ft,d   − ft,d−1 ). This measure
seems particularly appealing because it reduces the distortions associated with the time variation
in the risk premium µ.
                                                                                           1 ,
       As to our case, we use data on 1-month futures rates rather than spot-month rates, ft,d
   8
     Many specifications of our empirical analysis, like the lag-order of the main VAR, the use of a price-level index
instead of inflation, and the choice to display one-standard deviation bands in the impulse-response analysis, are
borrowed from our empirical benchmark, Eichenbaum and Evans (1995), to which we seek to relate our results.
   9
     We depart from Eichenbaum and Evans (1995), besides by including three volatility measures, by considering
the slope of the US yield curve isl,t , on the one hand, while disregarding the measure of non-borrowed reserves,
on the other hand.



                                                          5
where day d belongs to month t − 1 rather than t. As a consequence, any revision in policy
expectations reflected in a daily change of the futures rate is related to the full month t, rather
than a fraction of it. Therefore, in our case we can measure day−d revisions in expectations
about next-month monetary policy actions using the simple daily change in the futures rate:
  1 − f1
(ft,d                                                2
       t,d−1 ). In what follows we will denote with uξ,t the variance of the monetary policy
surprise in month t + 1 conditionally on information available in month t and we use, as an
approximate measure of such conditional variance, the empirical second moment, within month
t, of daily revisions in expectations of time-t + 1 monetary policy actions:
                                                v
                                                u    mt
                                                u 1 X
                                        uξ,t   ≈t         1 − f1
                                                        (ft,d         2
                                                  mt           t,d−1 ) .
                                                       d=2


      Since data for the Fed funds futures rates are only available starting October 1988, we
complete the time series with realized volatilities, within the month, computed using daily data
on the effective federal funds rate – net of settlement Wednesdays – standardized to the mean
and variance of the measure coming from the futures market, for the period where the two
measures overlap (correlation over that period is about .6)
      For the inflation-target shock, we measure the conditional volatility with the Merrill Lynch
Option Volatility Estimate (MOVE). Movements in the inflation target can produce parallel
shifts in the yield curve.10 Indeed the MOVE Index can capture the volatility of this level factor
since it is a yield curve weighted index of the normalized implied volatility on 1-month Treasury
options, which are weighted on the 5, 10, and 30 year contracts. Since this index starts only
in 1989, we complete the time series with the realized volatility, within the month, computed
using daily data on US 10-year Treasury bonds; since the MOVE is an index, moreover, we
standardize it to the mean and variance of the realized volatility, for the period where the two
measures overlap (correlation over that period is about .8).
      Finally, we build an approximate measure of the volatility of the productivity shock using the
stock market option-based implied volatility, the VIX index (monthly averages of daily data).
However, since data for the VIX are only available starting January 1990, we follow the approach
of Bloom (2009) and complete the time series with within-month realized volatilities computed
using daily returns on the S&P500, standardized to the mean and variance of the VIX, for the
period where the two measures overlap (correlation over that period is about .9).
      As a last step, since all above measures are based on implied and realized volatilities, we
construct the conditional volatilities considering the fitted values of an AR(1) regression for each
indicator, similarly to Bekaert and Engstrom (2009). Figure 1 displays the dynamic properties
of the obtained indicators.
 10
      This is true in the theoretical model presented later in the paper but we leave the details for future work.

                                               yt = A(L)yt−1 + et ,                                                 (1)

where the data vector is defined as yt ≡ [uξ,t , ua,t , uπ,t , yt , pt , it , isl,t , i∗t , qt , yt∗ , ]0 , and the lag-
order is six. This ordering allows for a contemporaneous response of the interest rate to domestic
output and the price level, consistently with a Taylor-type monetary policy rule and with our
empirical benchmark (see Eichenbaum and Evans, 1995). As to the order in which the volatility
measures enter the VAR, our choice is driven by how volatility is modelled in the theoretical
framework of the next sections. Indeed, we build a model in which volatility shocks are allowed
to have contemporaneous effects on the endogenous variables; however, in order to apply the
approximation methods developed by Benigno, Benigno and Nisticò (2010), we restrict our
attention to conditionally-linear stochastic processes for the underlying structural disturbances
of our theoretical model, implying contemporaneous orthogonality between “level” shocks and
volatility measures. In order to be consistent with these features of our theoretical approach,
therefore, in the VAR we place the volatility measures before all the other variables. As to the
volatility measures, since the MOVE index might also be affected by the volatility of monetary
policy or productivity shocks, we place it last among the three volatility indexes. On the other
hand, since the monetary-policy volatility measure is built directly from data on the Federal

Figure 2: Dynamic responses to an orthogonalized innovation to the Federal Funds Rate. Each column reports,
for each country pair, the responses of the US Federal Funds rate (i), the Real Exchange Rate (q), the foreign

points. Country pairs are, respectively, US-Canada, US-France, US-Germany, US-Italy, US-Japan, US-UK.


Funds Market, we see it as very tightly related to monetary policy: we therefore assume that it
is not affected contemporaneously by any other volatility measure and thus place it first.
       Figures 2 through 5 display the dynamic response of selected variables to, respectively, a
“classic” monetary-policy shock (the orthogonalized innovation to the level of the Federal funds
rate), an innovation to the volatility of the monetary-policy shock, an innovation to the volatility
of the shock to the inflation target and an innovation to the volatility of the productivity shock.
Each panel reports the point estimate of the impulse response function – the solid line – and the
associated one-standard-deviation confidence intervals – the dashed lines. In each figure, the first
row displays the dynamic response of the US Federal Funds Rate, the second row the response
of the real exchange rate, the third the response of the excess return on foreign currency, and
the last one shows the response of the slope of the yield curve.11 In particular, the excess return
on foreign currency is defined as

                                                      exrt ≡ i∗1,t − i1,t + Et ∆st+1 ,

and measures deviations from the UIP condition.
       Figure 2 addresses the robustness of the findings of Eichenbaum and Evans (1995). The
responses to a contractionary shock to monetary policy seem virtually unaffected by the explicit

     We do not report the responses of the nominal exchange rate, since they are very similar to those of the real
exchange rate.

Figure 3: Dynamic responses to an orthogonalized innovation to the volatility of the monetary-policy shock.
Each column reports, for each country pair, the responses of the US Federal Funds Rate (i), the Real Exchange
Rate (q), the foreign currency risk premium (exr), the slope of the US term structure (isl ). x-axes: months, y-

consideration of the interplay between time-varying volatility and the “level” variables. In par-
ticular, a positive innovation to the Federal Funds Rate implies a significant appreciation of the
USD, on impact. Moreover, the exchange rate keeps appreciating also in the transition, and
does not start depreciating but in the medium run. Second, the spread between foreign and do-
mestic short-term interest rates decreases gradually through the implied, less-than-proportional,
increase in the foreign one (not shown). Finally, the two results above drive the persistent devi-
ations from UIP shown in the third row, in the form of positive excess returns on US securities.
Additionally, Figure 2 also shows the negative response of the slope of the yield curve.
       Figures 3, 4 and 5 present our new evidence on the importance of volatility shocks. The
first result, common to all three figures, is that shocks to volatility indeed do affect the level of
the other macro variables, although with different magnitudes and significance across variables
and shocks. Hence volatility does have a distinct and direct effect which will be important in
characterizing our theoretical model.
       In particular, Figure 3 shows the responses to an orthogonalized innovation to the volatility
of the monetary-policy shock. The response of the exchange rate (second row) is ambiguous.
The point estimate indicates that an increase in the volatility of the monetary-policy shock
strengthens the US dollar. However, this is not particularly significant (except for the case
of the UK and, marginally, Germany). Later, we are going to evaluate if results change by
exploiting the panel dimension of our dataset. The third row shows that an increase in the

Figure 4: Dynamic responses to an orthogonalized innovation to the volatility of the inflation-target shock.
Each column reports, for each country pair, the responses of the US Federal Funds Rate (i), the Real Exchange
Rate (q), the foreign currency risk premium (exr), the slope of the US term structure (isl ). x-axes: months, y-
axes: annual percentage points. Country pairs are, respectively, US-Canada, US-France, US-Germany, US-Italy,
US-Japan, US-UK.


volatility of the monetary-policy shock induces significant and persistent deviations from UIP,
in the form of positive excess returns on foreign securities. This result is mainly driven by the
response of the spread in the short-term interest rate: the domestic rate falls significantly, and
proportionately more than the foreign one, implying an increase in the spread by a magnitude
of 5-10 basis points (not shown). The estimated response of the slope of the US yield curve, is
positive on impact and keeps rising for a few months before reverting back to mean; it remains,
however, significantly above the steady-state level for quite some time, regardless of the pair
considered (except for the case of Germany, for which the effect dies out within six months).
       Figure 4 shows the response to an orthogonalized innovation to the volatility of the inflation-
target shock. Here, the implications for the exchange rate are very interesting. Indeed, while
the response is weak on impact and not always significant, the point estimates indicate that
an increase in the volatility of the inflation-target shock tends to appreciate the exchange rate
(with the notable exception of Japan) in the medium run. This is a particularly appealing
result considering the specific nature of the shock, which is indeed related to the medium-run
target level for the inflation rate. This pattern is also reflected in the dynamic response of
the foreign-currency risk premium: while the short-term response is ambiguous, the estimated
impulse-response functions indicate that in the medium run a higher volatility of the inflation-
target shock produces a lower foreign currency risk premium, consistently with the appreciation
of the domestic currency. Finally, the estimated responses of the nominal interest rate and the

Figure 5: Dynamic responses to an orthogonalized innovation to the volatility of productivity shocks. Each

slope of the yield curve are not very precise. However, the point estimates suggest a positive
response of both the domestic short-term interest rate and the term spread. Again, we will look
further into this evidence by exploring the panel dimension of the data.
       Figure 5 studies the responses to the conditional volatility of the productivity shock. In
particular, the response of the exchange rate is quite clear: although with different timing and
magnitude across country pairs, an increase in the volatility of the productivity shock tends
to depreciate the exchange rate, mostly on impact. No significant deviation from UIP arises
with the notable exception of Japan. Finally, the estimated response of the slope of the yield
curve is muted on impact, but it becomes substantially and significantly positive after about six
months and stays significantly positive until about two years after the shock, peaking at about
10-15 basis points after about one year. This response is virtually identical across all considered
country pairs.

2.3        Exploring the Panel Dimension of the Dataset
The empirical evidence of the last section points toward an interesting and non-trivial role of
stochastic volatility for macro-financial variables, both domestic (like the short-term interest
rate or the term spread) and international (like the exchange rate and deviations from the
UIP). Although the point estimates in the pair-wise analysis suggest clear trends in the impulse
responses of key variables, such trends are sometimes polluted by sampling uncertainty. In order

to isolate more effectively the common components across countries, here we exploit the panel
dimension of our dataset using three methods.12
       The first approach is to define a Two-Country version of our empirical model. We take
the home country as describing the US economy, while the foreign country is a GDP-weighted
average of the other G7 countries, Japan excluded.13 The relevant exchange rate is therefore
a multilateral exchange rate, while the foreign currency risk premium is actually the expected
excess return on a portfolio of several foreign currencies, with the portfolio share of each currency
being proportional to the respective country size. The dynamic responses of the four variables
of interest are displayed in the first column of Figures 6 through 8, labeled “Two-Country”.14
       The second approach is a Panel VAR Mean-Group estimation, in the spirit of Pesaran and
Smith (1995): we estimate a separate VAR model for each country-pair and then evaluate the
  12
     For a thorough discussion of these and other empirical approaches for the analysis of dynamic macro panels,
see Canova (2007, Ch. 8).
  13
     As shown in the previous section, Japan is often an outlier with respect to the dynamic responses of the
exchange rate and the foreign currency risk premium. These differences suggest that the Japanese currency
behaves in a somewhat peculiar way vis-à-vis the USD, for which the enormous and persistent positions in the
yen carry-trade strategy might possibly play a key role. For this reason, we disregard Japan for the remaining of
the section.
  14
     This corresponds to the Aggregate Time Series estimator, as defined by Canova (2007), which we slightly
modify by aggregating the time series using a GDP-weighted average (rather than a simple average) as in Benigno
and Nisticò (2011), among others.

mean of the estimated statistics of interest (namely the impulse-response function) across groups.
Our dataset is sufficiently long, along the time-series dimension, to support consistency of the
Mean-Group estimator. The impulse-responses of interest are displayed in the second column
of Figures 6–8. In this case, the exchange-rate response measures the average response that the
dollar bilateral exchange rate displays after a (domestic) level or volatility shock. Similarly, the
third panel of the column shows the average response of the foreign currency risk premium with
respect to the US dollar.
       The third and final approach that we consider is the traditional Panel VAR Pooled estima-
tion: we pool cross section and (demeaned) time series, and estimate and analyze a VAR(p)
using the pooled series. This estimator, by construction, imposes the same dynamic structure
to all countries, vis-à-vis the US. Accordingly, also in this case the impulse-response functions
show an “average” response, capturing the common component across countries, of the bilateral
USD exchange rate and foreign risk premium.
       Figures 6 through 8 display the dynamic response of selected variables to the three volatility
shocks that we analyze, for each method used. The variables are the US Federal Funds Rate
(i), the US Dollar Real Exchange Rate (q), the expected excess return on foreign currency with
respect to the US Dollar (exr) and the slope of the US yield curve (isl ). In particular, the
“Pooled” approach, displayed in the third column of each figure, seems quite useful in order to

derive more precise impulse responses.
       By looking at Figures 6 through 8, the overall picture shows that the main results, made
in the previous section, are in fact reinforced considering the panel dimension of our data. In
particular, in response to an unexpected increase in the volatility of the monetary-policy shock,
Figure 6 shows that the US Dollar tends to appreciate while the foreign-currency risk premium
increases. The latter result is driven by the domestic short-term interest rate falling more
than the foreign one (not shown), which more than offsets the negative effect coming from the
appreciation of the exchange rate. The yield curve, moreover, becomes significantly steeper.
       Following an increase in the volatility of the inflation-target shock, the real exchange rate
tends to appreciate in the medium term while the currency premium decreases, mainly as a
result of the significant increase in the Federal Funds Rate. The slope of the yield curve, as also
implied by the pair-wise analysis, does not seem to display any systematic response.
       Finally, and again consistently with the evidence suggested by the pair-wise analysis of the
previous section, an increase in the volatility of the productivity shock depreciates the US dollar
and makes the yield curve significantly steeper. No clear effect is displayed by the foreign
currency risk premium, regardless of the significant decrease in the domestic interest rate.
       The important conclusion that we can draw from this analysis is that indeed volatility does
matter. And it does matter also for traditional macro variables like real activity and the price
level, as Figure 9 shows. In response to an increase in volatility of the monetary-policy shock

Figure 9: Dynamic responses of the domestic industrial production index (first row) and the domestic CPI
(second row) to, respectively, a shock to the volatility of the monetary-policy instrument (uξ ) (first column), of
the productivity shock (ua ) (second column) and of the inflation-target shock (uπ ) (third column).


or to productivity, real activity substantially contracts and the price level falls, while a rise in
volatility of the inflation-target shock tends to bring CPI inflation to a permanently higher level
in the long-run and implies a temporary increase in real output. Finally, not displayed, the
impulse responses to an increase in the level of the monetary-policy shock are standard as in
the literature, with output falling and the prices rising in the short-run, consistently with the
standard “price puzzle”.15


3         International finance regularities
In the previous section, we have provided evidence that volatility shocks have important effects
on open-economy macro variables. In the next section, we are going to build a model in which
indeed time-varying uncertainty plays a role. To nail down the desiderata that our model should
meet, here we summarize the implications of our findings and report other empirical regularities
along which we would like our model to perform well. The sense in which we refer to these
facts (or puzzles) as international finance regularities relates to our focus on the joint behavior
of interest rates and exchange rates.
         The empirical evidence on the importance of volatility shocks can be summarized along two
facts related respectively to the effects that volatility shocks have on the nominal (and real)
exchange rate and the deviations from UIP.
         Fact 1 : An increase in the volatilities of the US monetary-policy and inflation-target shocks
appreciates the dollar exchange rate, especially in the medium run. On the other hand, an
increase in the volatility of the productivity shock depreciates the dollar exchange rate.

                                                            15
    Fact 2 : An increase in the volatilities of both the monetary-policy and the inflation-target
shocks generates significant and persistent deviations from UIP; in particular an increase in the
excess return of foreign-versus-domestic short-term bonds in the case of the monetary-policy
volatility shock and a decrease in the case of the inflation-target volatility shock.
    The next fact is in common between our empirical analysis and the evidence reported by
Eichenbaum and Evans (1995).
    Fact 3 : A positive innovation to the level of the monetary-policy shock (contractionary
policy shock) produces a persistent appreciation in both the real and nominal exchange rates
and a persistent deviations from the UIP in the form of positive excess returns on US securities.
    To this list, we add another well-know fact, or puzzle, that we would like to address. While
our previous facts are conditional statements about how excess returns and exchange rate co-
move following different innovations (level or volatility shocks), another relevant empirical regu-
larity is related to the joint behavior of exchange and interest rates as captured by the negative
regression coefficient that arises from the UIP regression.
    Fact 4 : The regression coefficient between exchange rate changes and the nominal interest
rate differential (UIP regression) is negative.
    Related to the UIP puzzle, there is another one, recently discussed by Engel (2010), who
documents that high real interest rate countries tend to have currencies that are strong in real
terms and stronger than what can be explained by the real UIP. In particular, the puzzle comes
from the fact that while current international-finance models struggle to account for the negative
covariance between interest-rate differentials and exchange rate changes, those that succeed
invariably miss the negative covariance between the interest-rate differential and the level of
the exchange rate. Moreover, while the real interest-rate differential is negatively correlated
with the real one-step-ahead excess return on foreign-versus-domestic currency, such correlation
turns positive if we instead consider the “prospective excess return”, i.e. the expected cumulative
excess return over the infinite future.
    Finally, we would like our model to be also consistent with the responses of output and prices
to the volatility shocks documented in Figure 9.


4    A two-country open economy model
To study the relationships between time-varying volatility and the exchange rate, we present a
two-country open-economy model along the lines of Benigno and Benigno (2008). In particular
we consider two extensions, whose relevance will be discussed later, which are important for the
model to be able to match the empirical facts discussed above: i) we allow for more general
recursive preferences as in the work of Epstein and Zin (1989, 1991) and Weil (1990) and ii)
we consider stochastic volatility for the exogenous processes driving the economy. The latter
addition, in particular, implies a careful treatment of the solution. To this end, we expound
the method developed by Benigno, Benigno and Nisticò (2010) to show how we can handle in


                                                  16
a relatively easy way approximations of dynamic general equilibrium models with time-varying
uncertainty and at the same time characterize the effect of uncertainty on the variables of
interest.

4.1       Households
The world economy consists of two countries, Home and Foreign, and is populated by a con-
tinuum of agents of measure one: Home households lie on the interval [0, n], while Foreign
households on (n, 1] where n ∈ (0, 1). The population size is set equal to the range of goods
produced so that Home firms produce goods on [0, n], Foreign firms produce on (n, 1]. Home
households are indexed by j, Foreign households by i. Ctj denotes the level of consumption for
household j in period t and Ljt denotes its supply of working hours.
       Preferences are recursive as in the framework of Epstein and Zin(1989, 1991) and Weil (1990).
In particular, we assume that for a generic household of type j recursive utility can be written
as                                                                           1

where ρ is a measure of the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution over the utility
flow, U (·), γ represents the risk aversion towards static wealth gambles, and β ∈ (0, 1) is the
household’s subjective discount factor. The classical expected utility model is nested under the
assumption ρ = γ.
       The utility flow is a Cobb-Douglas index of aggregate consumption, C, and leisure, 1 − L

where ψ ∈ (0, 1) reflects the preference for consumption versus leisure. As it is well known, this
specification of preferences allows to disentangle the elasticity of substitution, 1/ρ, from the

where CH and CF are the two consumption sub-indexes that refer, respectively, to the con-
sumption of Home-produced and Foreign-produced goods; θ, with θ > 0, is the elasticity of
intratemporal substitution and v ∈ (0, 1) represents the weight given to home-produced goods
in the aggregator C. Home bias in consumption arises when the weight given to Home goods is
higher than the size of the country, i.e. when v > n.

where p (h) and p∗ (h) are the prices of the generic good h produced by the Home country in the
currencies of the Home and Foreign country respectively; while p (f ) and p∗ (f ) are the prices of
the generic good f produced by the Foreign country in the currencies of the Home and Foreign
country respectively. The law of one price holds across all individual goods: p(h) = Sp∗ (h) and
p(f ) = Sp∗ (f ), where S is the nominal exchange rate (the price of foreign currency in terms of
domestic currency). Therefore, equations (11) and (12), imply that PH = SPH∗ and PF = SPF∗ .
However, equations (9) and (10) show that, since Home and Foreign agents’ preferences are not
necessarily identical, there can be deviations from purchasing power parity unless v = v ∗ , that
is, P 6= SP ∗ . Appropriately we measure the deviations from PPP through the real exchange rate
given by Q ≡ SP ∗ /P. We also define the terms of trade in the Home country as T ≡ PF /PH.
Notice the following useful relationships between relative prices, the real exchange rate and
terms of trade                         "                        #

We assume that asset markets are complete both at the domestic and international levels. In
particular households can trade in a set of state-contingent nominal securities denominated
in the Home currency which span all the uncertainty from one period to another.17 Each

of these securities pays respectively only in one of the possible states of nature in the next
             j
period. Let Bt+1 the state-contingent payoff at time t + 1 of the portfolio of state-contingent
nominal securities held by household in the Home country at the end of period t. The value of
                                             j
this portfolio can be written as Et [Mt,t+1 Bt+1 ] where Mt,t+1 represents the nominal stochastic
discount factor for discounting units of Home-currency wealth from a state of nature at time
t + 1 back to time t. This stochastic discount factor is unique, because of the complete-market
assumption, and equivalent to the price of a state-contingent security standardized by the time-t
conditional probability of occurrence of the state of nature at time t + 1 in which the security
pays. We can write the flow budget constraint that the Home households face as

                                       j
                           Et [Mt,t+1 Bt+1 ] ≤ Btj + Wt Ljt + Dtj − Pt Ctj ,

for each j, where Wt is the nominal wage in the Home country, determined in a common labor
market; Dtj are nominal profits. Each household holds equal shares of all firms (domestic firms
are located on the interval [0, n] and the size of the Home population is normalized to n); there
is no trade in firms’ shares. Households are subject to a standard limit on their borrowing
possibilities.
    Households in the Foreign country can also trade in the state-contingent securities denom-
                                          i
inated in the currency of country H. Let Bt+1 the state-contingent payoff at time t + 1 of
the portfolio of state-contingent nominal securities held by Foreign household at the end of pe-
               i
riod t. Since Bt+1 is denominated in units of Home currency, the payoff in Foreign currency
             ∗i
is given by Bt+1    i /S
                 = Bt+1  t+1 and the value of the portfolio in Foreign currency is simply
            i ]/S = E [M
Et [Mt,t+1 Bt+1                ∗i
                 t   t  t,t+1 Bt+1 St+1 ]/St . We can appropriately define the nominal stochas-
tic discount factor for discounting units of Foreign-currency wealth across time

                                        ∗         St+1
                                       Mt,t+1 =        Mt,t+1                               (19)
                                                   St

which is uniquely defined given that Mt,t+1 is unique. Therefore, the flow budget constraint for
the Foreign households can be written as

                              ∗      ∗i
                         Et [Mt,t+1 Bt+1 ] ≤ Bt∗i + Wt∗ L∗i   ∗i   ∗ ∗i

for each i where the definition of the variables follows from before with the appropriate modifi-
cations. A standard borrowing-limit condition applies also here.
    Households maximize utility subject to the sequence of the flow budget constraints and the
borrowing-limit constraints by choosing aggregate consumption, labor and asset holdings in
terms of the state contingent securities.
    At optimum the marginal rate of substitution between labor and consumption is equal to
the real wage

under the assumption ρ = γ. In this case, they depend on the ratio between the marginal

      Given the assumption that a common labor market exists in each country and that each firm employs all the
workers, as it will be discussed later, we can impose symmetry in labor supply and set Lj = L for each j. It
follows from (20) that C j = C for each j. Therefore also V j = V .

utilities of nominal income across the two periods. With Epstein-Zin preferences, there is an
additional term reflecting the preference for an early, in the case ρ < γ, or late, in the case
ρ > γ, resolution of intertemporal uncertainty. This intertemporal uncertainty is captured by
the ratio of the utility at time t + 1 with respect to its risk-adjusted expected value, where
the risk-adjustment occurs through the factor 1 − γ. When agents prefer an early resolution
of uncertainty (ρ < γ) bad realizations of the utility at time t + 1 with respect to its risk-
adjusted expected value increase the stochastic discount factor and therefore the appetite for
state-contingent wealth in that state of nature.
       The above nominal stochastic discount factor can be used to price any security in arbitrage-
free markets and in particular they imply that the short-term nominal interest rates satisfy

To close the assumption of complete markets, we need to specify initial conditions for the holdings
of the state-contingent securities. A standard assumption in the literature is to choose initial
state-contingent wealth in a way to equalize the ratio between the marginal utilities of nominal
income across countries, converted in the same currency. Let Gt denote this ratio at time t, it
follows that we can write it as

                                       ∂Vt1−ρ 1                               1−ρ

We set Gt0 = 1 and therefore assume that initial state-contingent wealth equalizes the ratio
of the marginal utilities of nominal income across countries in the initial period. Notice that,
under the expected-utility model (γ = ρ), this assumption implies equalization of the ratio at
all times and contingencies. With Epstein-Zin preferences, instead, this ratio evolves over time
depending on cross-country realizations of utility with respect to their risk-adjusted expected
values.

4.2       Firms
The Home country produces goods on the interval [0, n] while the Foreign country on (n, 1]. At
first pass we abstract from investment and capital accumulation.20 A generic firm h producing
in the Home country uses the following technology

                                                   yt (h) = At (Lt (h))ϕ                                    (31)

where At is a productivity shifter common to all the firms in the Home country, ϕ with ϕ ∈ (0, 1]
measures decreasing return to scale in the labor input Lt (h), which is a composite of all the
differentiated labor supplied by households j according to
                                                                 Z    n

                                                 Lt (h) =                 Ljt (h)dj

where Ljt (h) denotes the demand of household j 0 s labor by firm h.
       We assume that there are frictions in the price adjustment. In particular, we model price
rigidity as in the Calvo’s (1983) model, but with indexation. In each period, in the Home
country, only a fraction (1 − α) of firms, with 0 ≤ α < 1, can reset their prices independently
of the last time they had reset them. In this case, the price is chosen to maximize the expected
discounted value of the profits under the circumstances that the price, appropriately indexed,
still applies. These firms choose prices to maximize the following objective

4.3       Monetary policy rules
We close the model by specifying the monetary policy rules. A broad class of policy rules that
we consider can be written as

for the Home monetary policymaker where the short-term interest rate reacts to its past value, to
the deviation of the gross producer inflation from a target, to domestic output growth and to the
changes in the exchange rate;21 φi , φπ , φy φs are non-negative parameters, β̃ is an appropriately-
defined parameter, ξt is the policy shock and Π̄t represent the inflation target followed by the
Home monetary policymaker which is generally different from the target to which prices are
indexed. The link between the two inflation targets could be expressed as

                                                                     Π̄H,t = Π̄κt Π1−κ

with a weight κ ∈ [0, 1] which can be interpreted as a measure of the credibility of monetary
policy in the Home country. When κ = 1 producer prices are indexed to the inflation target
used by the monetary policymaker, otherwise prices are indexed to a weighted average of past
realized producer inflation and the current policy target.
       In a similar way we assume that in the Foreign country the short-term nominal interest rate
follows

with a weight κ∗ ∈ [0, 1] measuring the credibility of Foreign monetary policy.

4.4       Equilibrium
We now define the equilibrium of the above model. Given processes for the exogenous state
variables (ln At , ln ξt , ln Π̄H,t , ln A∗t , ln ξt∗ , ln Π̄∗F,t ) an equilibrium is an allocation (Vt , Vt∗ , Ct ,
  21
       We will also consider a target in terms of CPI inflation instead of PPI inflation.

(43), (44) given the two policy rules (45) and (46) and the relationships between the inflation
targets of the firms and of the monetary policymaker.
       We assume that the vector of exogenous variables follows conditionally-linear processes with
time-varying volatility. In particular we assume a general specification of the stochastic produc-
tivity processes to take into account the possibility of a trend in productivity. We model the
productivity shock in country H as At = AW,t Ãt and that in country F as A∗t = AW,t Ã∗t where
AW,t has a stochastic trend and can be interpreted as a global common productivity shock while
Ãt and Ã∗t are log-stationary processes that are country-specific.22
       The stochastic processes of the shocks are:

                                   ln AW,t+1 = ln a + ln AW,t + uaw,t εaw,t+1

                                          ln Ãt+1 = δa ln Ãt + ua,t εa,t+1

                                           ln Π̄t+1 = ln Π̄t + uπ,t επ,t+1

                                                  ξt+1 = uξ,t εξ,t+1

where a is a parameter measuring the deterministic trend in productivity growth and 0 ≤ δa ≤ 1.
In what follows, all the ε shocks are iid white-noise processes.
       Time-varying volatility is modelled through linear processes for the variances:

                               u2aw,t+1 = (1 − ρaw )σu2 + ρaw u2aw,t + σζ2 ζaw,t+1

                                    u2a,t+1 = (1 − ρa )σu2 + ρa u2a,t + σζ2 ζa,t+1

                                   u2π,t+1 = (1 − ρπ )σu2 + ρπ u2π,t + σζ2 ζπ,t+1

                                    u2ξ,t+1 = (1 − ρξ )σu2 + ρξ u2ξ,t + σζ2 ζξ,t+1

in which all the ζ are iid white-noise processes and 0 ≤ ρaw , ρa , ρπ , ρξ , ≤ 1 with σu2 , σζ2 > 0. The
processes for the stochastic disturbances hitting the Foreign economy behave similarly:

                                 u2a∗ ,t+1 = (1 − ρa∗ )σu2 + ρa∗ u2a∗ ,t + σζ2 ζa∗ ,t+1

                                u2π∗ ,t+1 = (1 − ρπ∗ )σu2 + ρπ∗ u2π∗ ,t + σζ2 ζπ∗ ,t+1

                                 u2ξ∗ ,t+1 = (1 − ρξ∗ )σu2 + ρξ∗ u2ξ∗ ,t + σζ2 ζξ∗ ,t+1

       In what follows we will refer to the shocks to the inflation target and the shock to the policy
  22
    In this way our model will allow for a balanced-growth path. As we will show in the next section, the stochastic
trend is in particular important for the relevance of the Epstein-Zin assumption.

instruments as monetary or nominal shocks while the productivity shock will be the real shock.

4.5    Solution
Given the above specification for the processes of the exogenous state variable, we can write
them more compactly as
                                               zt+1 = Λz zt + ηt+1                                             (47)

where the vector zt is defined as zt ≡ [(∆ ln AW,t − ln a), ln Ãt , ξt , ln Π̄H,t , ln Ã∗t , ξt∗ , ln Π̄∗F,t ]0 and
Λz is an appropriately-defined square matrix. The vector ηt+1 is given by

                                                 ηt+1 = Ut εz,t+1                                              (48)

where εz,t+1 collects the innovations, which are assumed to have a bounded support and to
be independently and identically distributed with mean zero and variance/covariance matrix
Iz , where Iz is an identity matrix of the same dimension of the vector z; Ut is a diagonal
matrix whose elements on the diagonal are collected into a vector ut . In particular ut follows
the exogenous stochastic linear process given by

                                u2t+1 = σu2 (Iz − Λu )ū2 + Λu u2t + σζ2 Zζu,t+1 .                             (49)

Each element of u2t is the corresponding squared value of each element of ut , which still cor-
responds to the diagonal of matrix Ut as in (48); ū2 is a vector of steady-state variances, Z
and Λu are appropriately defined square matrices; ζu,t+1 is a vector of innovation collecting the
above ζ which are assumed to have a bounded support and to be independently and identi-
cally distributed with mean zero and variance/covariance matrix Iz ; σu and σζ are scalars with
σu , σζ ≥ 0.
    Noticing that (47) with (48) and (49) defines a conditionally-linear process, we can write the
set of equilibrium conditions of the model together with the conditional expectation of (47) in
a more compact form
                                        Et {f (yt+1 , xt+1 , yt , xt )} = 0,                                   (50)

for an appropriately defined vector of function f (·) where yt identifies the non-predetermined
variables while the vector xt of state variables contains also the vector of exogenous predeter-
mined variables zt . Given the processes (47), with (48) and (49), an equilibrium of our model is a
sequence for the vector of endogenous non-predetermined variables yt and for the state variables
xt that satisfies (50), given the initial conditions.
    Benigno et al. (2010) characterize the solution of the above model and show that a first-order
approximation of the solution can be written as

                                                    ỹt = ḡx x̃t ,



                                                         28
                                          x̃t+1 = h̄x x̃t + h̄η ηt+1 ,

for appropriately-defined matrices ḡx , h̄x and h̄η . This approximation does not correspond to a
fully linear solution since ηt+1 , defined, in (48) is non-linear. However, it is the best condition-
ally linear approximation and, in particular, the matrices ḡx and h̄x coincide with those of a
fully linear approximation. Our first-order approximation maintains heteroskedastic shocks but
time-varying volatility does not play a distinct role, meaning that the impulse response of the
endogenous variables with respect to the shock to volatility, ζu,t+1 , is always zero. The advan-
tage of performing a conditionally-linear approximation instead of a fully-linear approximation,
in which ηt+1 is also linearized, is clear when we look at a second-order approximation of the
solution. Benigno et al. (2010) show that this takes the form

                                         1                      1          1
                          ỹt = ḡx x̃t + (Iy ⊗ x̃0t )ḡxx x̃t + ḡuu u2t + ḡzz σu2 ,                 (51)
                                         2                      2          2
                                    1                      1          1
                   x̃t+1 = h̄x x̃t + (Ix ⊗ x̃0t )h̄xx x̃t + h̄uu u2t + h̄zz σu2 + h̄η ηt+1 ,           (52)
                                    2                      2          2
for appropriately defined matrices ḡxx , ḡzz , ḡuu and h̄xx , h̄zz , h̄uu . In this second-order approxi-
mation, the volatility of the exogenous state variables now plays a distinct and direct role through
the matrices ḡuu and h̄uu . Indeed the endogenous variables are now in a linear relationship with
the vector of volatilities, u2t . Other methods discussed in the literature, as Fernandez-Villaverde
et al. (2010), need instead to rely at least on a third-order approximation to get such a distinct
role for volatilities in influencing the endogenous variables.
    The second advantage of our conditionally-linear approximation is that risk premia, evaluated
using a first-order approximation of the model, will be also time-varying. This feature enables
the model to characterize some stylized facts on the role of volatility on international data in a
simple way.


5    Exchange rates and risk: a simple example
In this section, before we turn to the solution of our general model, we present a simplified
framework to study whether we can already account for some of the facts that we have under-
lined in the empirical analysis. The framework of this section, with its analytical solutions, will
be also helpful to explain how our solution method works and represent a useful benchmark
through which we can later evaluate the effects of relaxing the assumptions of this section. The
simplifying assumptions are: 1) monetary policy in each country is modeled through Taylor
rules reacting only to the domestic CPI inflation rate with the same coefficients across coun-
tries, later in the section we allow for interest-rate smoothing; 2) purchasing power parity holds
(v = v ∗ = n) 3) flexible prices (α = α∗ = 0) and constant real rates which make real shocks
irrelevant for the analysis of this section. Therefore, we will abstract completely from produc-
tivity shocks and give just a monetary explanation of the facts related to the nominal exchange


                                                      29
rate and the UIP deviations.
    The starting points are the standard arbitrage-free conditions (26) and (27). As discussed
more generally in Benigno et al. (2010), we rely on approximation methods to solve our model.
In particular we show that it is sufficient to use a second-order approximation of the model to
characterize how risk influences the variables of interest and in particular the exchange rate.
    By taking a second-order approximation of (26) and (27), we obtain

                                                         1

where hats denote log-deviations with respect to the steady state, in which we assume i = i∗ =
1/β − 1, and Et and V art are conditional expectation and variance operators, respectively.23 In
logs, the complete-market assumption (19) implies

                                                     ∗

We can combine (53), (54) and (55) to write the short-term excess return of investing in the
currency of country F with respect to investing in the currency of country H as

                                                                 ϑ∗t   ϑt
                                       ı̂∗t + Et ∆st+1 − ı̂t =       −                                       (56)
                                                                 2     2

where
                   ϑt = covt (M̂t+1 , ∆st+1 )                  ϑ∗t = covt (M̂t+1
                                                                             ∗
                                                                                 , −∆st+1 ).                 (57)

The intuition for why there can be or cannot be an excess return on foreign currency with
respect to domestic currency depends on whether foreign currency is or is not a bad hedge with
respect to risk relatively to domestic currency. The standard principle is that an asset is ”risky”
when it does not pay well when money is really needed. In this case, investors command a
premium to hold it which shows up in an excess return relatively to other assets. In our context,
the stochastic discount factors measure the agents’ appetites for state contingent wealth and
                                                        ∗
therefore when money is needed or not. When M̂t+1 and M̂t+1 are high in some contingencies,
the appetites for wealth of the Home and Foreign agents are also high in those contingencies.
An asset that pays well under this case is a good asset and represents a good hedge with respect
to risk. If, for example, the currency of country H depreciates (the nominal exchange rate
depreciates, i.e. ∆st+1 > 0) then having invested in the currency of country F is indeed a good
   23
      Notice that (53) and (54) do not hold exactly but up to residuals which are of third-order in an appropriate
norm on the stochastic disturbances. Under the assumption of log-normality, as in Backus et al. (2010), they
would hold exactly.Our analysis is a local analysis and their is a global analysis. Therefore, their approach
is limited to the possibility of a closed-form solution. Moreover, the two frameworks will also deliver subtle
differences in terms of the conditions needed for the determinancy of the equilibrium.



                                                       30
investment since it delivers more money when it is really needed. In this case ϑt is positive and
ϑ∗t is negative. In general, the expected short-term excess return of investing in the currency of
country F with respect to that of investing in the currency of country H is negative because
simply the currency of country H is not a good hedge with respect to the appetite for wealth of
both agents. In general, to have a negative expected excess return on the Foreign-versus-Home
currency it is not necessary that ϑt should be positive and ϑ∗t negative, but just ϑt > ϑ∗t .
       Finally, it is worth stressing that the right-hand side of equation (56) captures the deviations
from uncovered interest parity in any model in which no-arbitrage restrictions apply. Indeed, so
far, none of the simplifying assumptions 1), 2) and 3) has been used.

5.1       Simple Taylor Rules
By making assumption 1) (φi = φ∗i = φy = φ∗y = φs = φ∗s = 0, φπ = φ∗π with interest
rate reacting to CPI inflation into (45) and (46)), we can further use (56) to determine the
equilibrium nominal exchange rate. In particular, the short-term nominal interest rates follow
simple Taylor rules in which
                                         ı̂t = π̄t + φπ (πt − π̄t ) + ξt                                   (58)

                                        ı̂∗t = π̄t∗ + φπ (πt∗ − π̄t∗ ) + ξt∗                               (59)

where π̄t and π̄t∗ represent the logs of Home and Foreign inflation-target shocks and ξt and ξt∗
are the Home and Foreign policy shocks as in (45) and (46).
       We now use the simplifying assumption 2), that there is no home bias in consumption
implying that purchasing power parity holds, i.e. πt = πt∗ + ∆st .

5.1.1      Exchange rate determination

Using PPP and rules (58) and (59) into (56) we obtain a first-order stochastic difference equation
in ∆st

under the requirement, for determinacy, that the Taylor’s principle holds, i.e. φπ > 1.24
       There are several implications of the above simple model for nominal exchange rate determi-
nation. First, the design of the monetary policy rules is important. Indeed, equation (60) holds
  24
    Necessary and sufficient conditions for the local determinancy of equilibrium are discussed more extensively
in Benigno and Benigno (2008), for two-country open-economy models.

only under the special policy rules (58) and (59).25 Within this class of rules, variation in the
policy parameter φπ can also change in an important way the relationship between exchange
rate and fundamentals. But, which are the fundamentals for exchange rate determination under
this simple model? Shocks and risk. Given that φπ > 1 is needed for equilibrium determinacy,
a shock that increases the inflation target in a country depreciates its currency, whereas a con-
tractionary policy shock in a country appreciate its own currency (the sign of the response to
the policy shock is consistent with the empirical findings that we reported in section 2). In par-
ticular, a (temporary) contractionary policy shock appreciates permanently the exchange rate,
but without producing the hump-shaped curve found in the data.
    Current and future shocks matter, but also current and future risk premia. If the currency
of country F has relatively good hedge properties with respect to the currency of country H
(ϑt > ϑ∗t ) then currency F strengthens and current nominal exchange rate st rises.
    Equation (60) represents a second-order approximation for the solution of the equilibrium
nominal exchange rate which depends on first-order terms {π̄t , π̄t∗ , ξt , ξt∗ } and second-order terms
{ϑt , ϑ∗t } . However, to get an explicit solution for the exchange rate in terms of the state variables,
we need to solve the second-order terms. The simplification comes by observing that these
second-order terms can be just evaluated using a first-order approximation.26 In particular,
given (57), to evaluate ϑt and ϑ∗t we need a first-order approximation of the stochastic discount
                    ∗
factors M̂t+1 and M̂t+1 and also a first-order approximation of ∆st , which we already have in
                                                                                                ∗
(60). In the general model of the previous section, the stochastic discount factors M̂t+1 and M̂t+1
are complex linear function, in a first-order approximation, of the shocks of the model. In our
simple illustrative example, we assume flexible prices and constant real interest rate (assumption
3). In this case, the stochastic discount factors are just exact linear functions of the inflation
rates
                                                                     ∗       ∗

Moreover we assume that the inflation-target shocks behave as random walks with stochastic
volatility

where επ,t and ε∗π,t are iid white-noise processes. For the policy shocks we assume

the equilibrium in the money market becomes also relevant for the determination of the exchange rate.

In this solution, the time-varying volatilities of the monetary shocks matter for the determination
of the nominal exchange rate.28 This is the important consequence of the solution method
in the literature is that of white-noise processes.

     Notice that the terms in σu2 cancel out because of the symmetry assumed.

proposed by Benigno et al. (2010) in which a second-order approximation of the model is
sufficient to get a distinct role for time-varying uncertainty in affecting the determination of
variables of interest. In (64), the higher the variance of the inflation-target and of the policy
shocks in country H, the stronger the currency of country H is. And specularly for the volatility
of the monetary shocks in country F . These theoretical findings are in part consistent with the
empirical results of Section 2: there, we reported that an increase in both volatilities leads to
an appreciation of the currency (at least in the medium-run with the exception of the USD/Yen
bilateral).
   The model is then consistent with the view that more uncertainty can be good for the nominal
exchange rate, meaning that the exchange rate can even appreciate when volatility rises. The
intuition insists on the good or bad hedging properties of the currency. If a currency is a good
hedge with respect to a particular risk and this risk increases, then there is more demand of
the currency and its exchange rate appreciates. For example, when the Home inflation target
shock falls the appetite for wealth for the Home consumers rises. At the same time the nominal
exchange rate appreciates, therefore Home currency delivers more money when needed, relatively
to foreign currency. This is good for hedging purposes. When the variance of the Home inflation-
target shock rises, the good hedging properties of Home currency are enhanced and therefore
the higher demand of Home currency leads to an appreciation.
   The magnitude of the effects on the exchange rate depends obviously on the magnitude of
the shock but also on the persistence. The higher the persistence the higher the response. It
is further influenced by the policy parameter of the Taylor rule, the higher φπ the muted the
response of the exchange rate. In this symmetric example, as for the primitive shocks, what
matters for the determination of the equilibrium exchange rate is the relative strength between
the volatilities of the monetary shocks across countries. However, while a positive inflation-
target shock and a positive policy shock produce responses of opposite sign on the equilibrium
nominal exchange rate, an increase in the volatility of the inflation-target shock or of the policy
shock impacts in the same direction.

   The expected excess return of investing in the currency of country F with respect to that
of country H rises with the increase in the volatilities of the monetary shocks in country H.
Consistently with the discussion of the previous section, a rise in the volatility of both the
monetary shocks in country H enhance the hedging properties of currency H and reduces those
of currency F. Currency F requires a premium to be held. While the response of the foreign
excess return to an increase in volatility of monetary-policy shock (u2ξ,t ) is, at first pass, consistent
with the empirical findings in Section 2, an increase in the volatility of the inflation-target shock
(u2π,t ) goes in the opposite direction with what we found in the data.


                                                      34
   This is not the only counterfactual result of this section. As discussed in Backus et al.
(2010), this stylized framework cannot account for the negative slope coefficient in the UIP
regression: the regression of the one-period changes in the nominal exchange rate on the interest
rate differential. Using (64), and analogous solutions for the interest rates in the two countries,
the coefficient of the UIP regression implied by our model would be

                                                         Cov(∆st+1 , ı̂t − ı̂∗t )

where the assumption of a unit-root processes for the inflation-target shocks blows up numerator
and denominator, in large samples, to produce a unitary coefficient. However, abstracting from
this issue or focusing on small samples, the only possibility for β̂ uip to be negative is that ρξ /φπ
be negative, as shown in Backus et al. (2010). Since assuming ρξ < 0 is not plausible, then in
our simplified framework β̂ uip is positive and decreasing with φπ , the inflation’s coefficient in
the Taylor rule.

5.2   Taylor rules with interest rate smoothing
One natural extension to the previous setting is to consider a model in which the interest rate set
by the policy authority moves gradually (interest rates are smoothed over time as in McCallum,
1994, and Backus et al., 2010) so that interest rates depend also on their past value. The
modified Taylor’s rules take the form

                                   ı̂t = φi ı̂t−1 + (1 − φi )[π̄t + φπ (πt − π̄t )] + ξt ,

                                  ı̂∗t = φi ı̂∗t−1 + (1 − φi )[π̄t∗ + φπ (πt∗ − π̄t∗ )] + ξt∗ ,

to replace (58) and (59). Following the same steps as before, it is possible to show that the
equilibrium exchange rate is given by

                                   φi                           λ                  1

                                                                                                ξ,t ).       (65)

where we are restricting φi to be 0 < φi < 1 and where λ ≡ φπ (1 − φi ) + φi with the requirement
λ > 1 for equilibrium determinacy implying again φπ > 1. In general allowing for interest-rate
smoothing changes also the short-run responses to the shocks and the volatilities but does not
change the sign of the response. Responses are obviously changed at longer horizons given the
lagged reaction to the interest rate.

dence on lagged interest rates can be such to reduce the coefficient of the UIP regression and
eventually to turn it negative, as discussed in Backus et al. (2010). However, it does not change
the sign of the responses of the expected excess return on foreign-versus-domestic currency to
the volatilities of the monetary shocks.


6         Exchange rates and risk: the general case
We now turn to the implications of the more general framework with sticky prices presented in
Section 4. First, we investigate the properties of the nominal stochastic discount factor which,
as shown in the previous section, is critical to understand the relationship between exchange
rate and risk, and to evaluate the risk premia embedded in asset prices.
         In our general framework the stochastic discount factor depends on the Epstein-Zin prefer-
ence specification. Our first result shows a peculiarity of Epstein-Zin preferences in an interna-
tional context. In closed economy, a standard finding is the irrelevance of Epstein-Zin preferences
for quantities and the importance for asset pricing.29 The irrelevance result can be understood
by observing that up to a first-order approximation, Epstein-Zin preferences do not matter for
the equilibrium allocation. In contrast, we will show that Epstein-Zin preferences might be also
important for quantities, in our two-country open-economy model, since, as shown in equation
(30), the cross-country surprises in utility affect the international distribution of wealth. Indeed
in a first-order approximation, we obtain

                                                                            ∗          ∗
                            Ĝt+1 = Ĝt + (γ − ρ)[(V̂t+1 − Et V̂t+1 ) − (V̂t+1 − Et V̂t+1 )].

where hats denote log-deviations with respect to the steady state. Under expected utility,
ρ = γ, Ĝt will be constant across time, implying the standard risk-sharing condition which links
marginal utilities of nominal income across countries. Instead, with the Epstein-Zin preferences,
the cross-country differences in the realization of utility matter for the distribution of wealth.
This might have interesting consequences for the equilibrium allocation of quantities.30
         However, the general-equilibrium flavor of our analysis makes it difficult to keep track of all
the effects through analytical solutions. To get further insights and to study the contribution
of the Epstein-Zin preferences to the evaluation of risk premia, we now discuss more deeply
the properties of the stochastic discount factor. In a first order approximation of (22), the
Home-country nominal discount factor can be written as

M̂t,t+1 = −(γ −ρ)(V̂t+1 −Et V̂t+1 )+(1−ρ)(1−ψ)∆L̂t+1 −[1−ψ(1−ρ)](∆Ĉt+1 +∆ÂW,t+1 )−πt+1 ,
                                                                                                                   (66)
where we have defined L̂t = ln(1−Lt )/ ln(1−L) while Ĉt denotes the deviations of detrended con-
    29
         See among others Rudebush and Swanson (2009).
    30
         Notice however that in this first-order approximation Et Ĝt+1 = Ĝt and therefore Ĝt is a local martingale.




                                                             36
sumption with respect to the steady state, Ĉt ≡ ln Ct /AW,t − ln(C/AW ).31 Under the expected-
utility model, γ = ρ, the stochastic discount factor is a function of consumption growth, which
can be decomposed in the growth of detrended consumption and in the growth of world produc-
tivity, a function of the CPI inflation rate and of the growth in hours worked. An increase in
consumption lowers the stochastic discount factor and the appetite for wealth, for realistic val-
ues of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, ρ. The impact of the growth in hours worked
depends on ρ ≶ 1 while an increase in the inflation rate reduces instead unambiguously the
appetite for wealth. On top of affecting the equilibrium allocation and therefore the allocation
of consumption and labor, as discussed above, Epstein-Zin preferences bring the novelty that
also surprises in the indirect utility matter through the term (V̂t+1 − Et V̂t+1 ). To get further
insights on this component, we take a first-order approximation of the indirect utility (2) and
show that we can relate it to the present discounted value of the surprises in consumption and
labor

                                          T =t+1

where we have defined ∆Et+1 (·) = Et+1 (·) − Et (·). In general equilibrium, interaction terms
will be quite complex. However, at the cost of losing generality, we can get further insights by
looking at a limiting case in which the discount factor, β, is close to the unitary value. In this
case, indeed, we show that Epstein-Zin preferences do not matter for the equilibrium allocation
of quantities, up to a first-order approximation. Under the assumption β −→ 1 we can write

                         V̂t+1 − Et V̂t+1 ≈ ∆Et+1 (ψ(Ĉ∞ + ÂW,∞ ) + (1 − ψ)L̂∞ ),

which shows that only the stochastic trend in the respective variables influences the current
surprises in utility. However, since Ĉ and L̂ are respectively a detrended and a stationary
variable, their stochastic trends are zero. The surprises to indirect utility will therefore only
depend on the stochastic trend in world productivity

                             V̂t+1 − Et V̂t+1 ≈ ψ∆Et+1 (ÂW,∞ ) = ψua,t εa,t+1 ,

which displays also time-varying risk. The importance of this factor in (66) will be higher,
the larger the difference between γ and ρ. Under this particular case, the ability of Epstein-
Zin preferences to explain risk premia hinges upon the comovements between returns and the
nominal stochastic discount factor. In particular when agents have a preference for an early
resolution of uncertainty, i.e. γ > ρ, a negative shock to world productivity εa,t implies bad
news with respect to long-run consumption which are reflected in bad news on utility. In this
case, the stochastic discount factor rises and the appetite for state contingent wealth too. This
mechanism would apply also to the country F . Indeed, it is also true that the surprise in
the utility of the foreign country depends on the shifts in the long-run component of world
 31
      The balance growth path of the model is defined with respect to the common trend in productivity, AW .

       Under the case β −→ 1, Epstein-Zin preferences might therefore contribute to imply highly
correlated discount factors across countries and deliver a global explanation for the risk premia,
which will be time-varying and driven by the shocks to the common technological process. The
consequence of this result is indeed that, up to a first-order approximation, general equilibrium
effects will be shut down. Since surprises in the utility of the Home and Foreign country are
highly correlated then, using (29) and (30), Gt is approximately constant over time32

                                                                     ∗          ∗

                             ≈ Ĝt .

This is true up to a first-order approximation, but not in a second-order approximation where
it might be possible that EZ preferences have sizeable effects also on quantities.

6.1      Quantitative Evaluation
We now move to a quantitative evaluation of the model implications. In particular, a second-
order approximation of the model will be relevant to study the relationship between risk and
the exchange rate, and provide a quantitative assessment of such links. This will be implicit in
the general solution of the nominal and real exchange rate

6.1.1      Calibration

In this section we describe our baseline calibration for the general model. The strategy that we
adopt for the calibration exercise is to rely as much as possible on a standard values for the
parameters and conduct a sensitivity analysis on those for which there are divergences in the
literature. We assume that the Home and Foreign economy are of equal size and are calibrated
in a symmetric fashion. In this calibration section we think about our two-country world as
U.S. versus the Euro area abstracting then from asymmetries that might be important for
  32
   The statement is true under the assumption that β is close to the unitary value, up to a first-order approxi-
mation and independently of the values assumed by the parameters γ and ρ.

understanding some empirical regularities when it comes to small open economies.33
       In choosing the parameters of utility function, we set β to 0.994 consistent with other studies
with Epstein-Zin preferences (e.g. Fernandez-Villaverde et al., 2010). We set the inverse of the
intertemporal elasticity of substitution ρ to 2, implying an intertemporal elasticity of substitution
(IES) in consumption of 0.5, which is consistent with estimates in the micro literature (e.g.,
Vissing-Jorgensen, 2002) and used also in the international real business cycle literature as in
Stockman and Tesar (1995). We set the coefficient of relative risk aversion γ to 5 as in Backus
et al. (2010). We set the share of consumption in the utility bundle, ψ, to 1/3 as in Cooley and
Prescott (1995) in order to imply that in the steady state households devote one-third of their
time to work.
       We calibrate the parameters pertaining to the consumption basket in the following way. The
share of home goods in tradable consumption, ν, is set to 0.87. The elasticity of substitution
between home and foreign traded goods, θ, is assumed equal to 1.5 which is in the range of the
plausible values.
       We set the firms’ output elasticity with respect to labor, ϕ, to 2/3, and the elasticity of
substitution among differentiated goods, σ, to 6 (implying a steady state markup of 20%) and
α = 0.66 and α∗ = 0.75 implying an average length of price contracts equal to 3 and 4 quarters,
respectively; all these are standard in the literature and consistent with the posterior estimates
for the U.S. and Euro area by Lubik and Schorfeide (2005).
       Regarding the policy rules we assume φi = 0.76 , φπ = 1.41, φs = 0.03 and φy = .66 for
the U.S. economy and φ∗i = 0.84, φ∗π = 1.37, φ∗s = 0.03 and φ∗y = 1.27 for the Euro area that
corresponds to the posterior estimates that Lubik and Schorfeide (2005) have found for the U.S.
and Euro area respectively.34
       We now turn to the calibration of the stochastic processes. For the productivity shocks we
use the posterior estimates of Lubik and Schorfeide (2005) for the U.S. and Euro-area: δA = 0.83,
 ∗ = 0.85 with σ = 1.66 and σ ∗ = 2.71 as the values through which we scale the individual
δA              A            A
standard deviation for the home and foreign shocks respectively. We assume no persistence for
the policy shocks and we scale its standard deviation by σξ = 0.18 for both countries based
on the estimates of Lubik and Schorfeide (2005). For the inflation-target shocks we follow
Ireland (2007) and set it to σπ = 0.1. For the persistence of the volatility shocks, we calibrate
the autocorrelation coefficients at the values implied by fitting an AR(1) process for each of the
three time-series employed in the empirical part. As a consequence, we set ρaw = ρa = ρa∗ = .71,
ρπ = ρπ∗ = .67 and ρξ = ρξ∗ = .53.
  33
     Relevant asymmetries could be in terms of a policy rule that reacts to exchange rate for small open economies
or different degree of openess that affect critically the international transmission mechanism of shocks.
  34
     Although we specified a theoretical model in which monetary-policy credibility might possibly play a role, we
disregard this role in the present work, and accordingly parameterize κ = κ∗ = 1.

6.1.2      Results

In this Section we evaluate to what extent our two-country model with recursive preferences and
stochastic volatility can replicate the dynamic properties of the data found in Sections 2 and 3.
Our analysis is mainly qualitative as we compare our model-based impulse response with the
ones generated by the VAR. In what follows, we plot impulse response of the main variables of
interest: real exchange rate (RER), real interest rate differential (r − r∗ ), deviations from real
uncovered interest-rate parity (Real UIP), nominal exchange rate (NEX), nominal interest rate
differential (i − i∗ ), nominal uncovered interest-rate parity (Nominal UIP), and domestic output
(YH ), producer inflation (πH ) and Home nominal interest rate (i).35
       In particular, we identified two main regularities on the relationship between exchange rate
and risk: (i ) an increase in the volatility of both monetary-policy and inflation-target shocks
appreciates the exchange rate, while an increase in the volatility of the productivity shock
induces an exchange rate depreciation; (ii ) an increase in the volatility of the monetary-policy
shock leads to deviations from UIP in the form of an increase in the excess return on foreign-
versus-domestic currency while an increase in the volatility of the inflation-target shock leads to
a fall in the excess return.
       An additional regularity, originally documented by Eichenbaum and Evans (1995) and that
we also confirm by controlling for the effects of time-varying volatility, is that a contractionary
monetary-policy shock produces a persistent appreciation of the exchange rate and persistent
deviations from the UIP in the form of positive excess returns on domestic securities.
       Figures 10 and 11 display the dynamic response of our variables of interest to volatility
  35
    For ease of comparison with the empirical analysis, we normalize the size of each shock to the one featured
in the VAR analysis.

target). The panels show: real exchange rate (RER), real interest rate differential (r − r∗ ), deviations from Real

shocks hitting the monetary-policy instrument and the inflation target, respectively. The figures
show that the model is indeed able to imply an appreciation of the real exchange rate and
deviations from the UIP in the form of positive excess returns from investing in foreign-currency
denominated bonds, consistently with our empirical findings both in real and in nominal terms.
A rise in home nominal volatility tends also to reduce domestic output and increase domestic
producer inflation while the domestic nominal interest rate declines, proportionately more than
the foreign one. An interesting difference among the two nominal shocks arises in the response
of the real interest rate differential. In the case of the shock to volatility of the inflation target,
the real interest rate differential is positive on impact and increasing in the short run while
it is negative on impact following a shock to the volatility of the monetary instrument. This
difference arises because the volatility shock to the monetary instrument generates more inflation
than the shock to the inflation target.
    Figure 12, similarly shows the dynamic response of Real Exchange Rate and the deviation
from UIP to a volatility shock hitting global productivity. The asymmetries in the degrees of
price stickiness and the response coefficients of the policy rules imply that innovations in the
level and/or volatility of the global productivity shocks are able to produce a non-zero response
on international variables. In particular, in response to an increase in the volatility of the global
productivity shock, the RER depreciates and we observe positive deviations from nominal UIP
consistent with the sign of the response that we observe in our empirical findings. However, the
nominal exchange rate appreciates on impact. Therefore, the movements in the real exchange
rate are mainly driven by changes in domestic CPI inflation.
    All these results are qualitatively consistent with the empirical regularities Fact 1 and 2, and
also show that our approximation method is effective to study the link between time-varying

volatility and the endogenous variables, like the exchange rate.
    As to Fact 3, related to the effects of monetary-policy level shocks on the exchange rate and
UIP deviations, Figure 13 shows that a contractionary monetary-policy shock indeed implies an
appreciation of the RER but it is unable to generate the hump-shaped response that we observe
in the data, nor deviations from the UIP.
    In order to look deeper into this result, we next explore which element of the theoretical
model is responsible for this behavior and whether a different calibration would lead to the

persistent appreciation observed in the data.
    Figures 14 through 16 perform this task by displaying the dynamic responses of the variables
of interest to a monetary-policy shock (level shock) and to volatility shocks, respectively, and
for different degrees of monetary policy inertia, as measured by the smoothing parameter φi in
equation (45).
    Specifically, Figure 14 displays the dynamic response of the economy to a monetary-policy
level shock, which raises the interest rate differential, and it shows that for high enough degrees of
interest-rate smoothing, the model is indeed able to imply a substantial degree of persistence in
the real appreciation. On the other hand, increasing the inertia in the monetary-policy rules does
not imply significant deviations from the UIP. This result, however, is not at all surprising, as it
is common to any rational-expectations open-economy model with no financial frictions, where
the Uncovered Interest Rate parity holds up to a first-order approximation. As a consequence,
the increase in the interest rate differential implied by the domestic monetary-policy shock is
offset by the nominal depreciation which follows the initial appreciation: UIP holds and the
model fails to reproduce the hump-shaped response of the nominal exchange rate.
    With respect to this latter point, however, we know that in our model deviations from
the UIP can be implied by second-order terms and in particular by stochastic volatility, as
shown analytically in the simple case of Section 5. Figures 15 and 16, then, show the role of
interest-rate smoothing in shaping the response of deviations from the UIP following volatility
shocks on the monetary policy instrument and target. As the graphs clearly document, for both
cases of volatility shocks, the response of the excess return on foreign-versus-domestic currency
monotonically increases with the coefficient of interest-rate smoothing, as expected. A higher
policy inertia, moreover, is also able to amplify the nominal and real exchange rate appreciation.
    An additional test for our model would be to see how it performs in terms of the UIP puzzle:

      In Figures 15–16, we show that the interaction between interest-rate smoothing and stochas-
tic volatility is able to produce persistent deviations from the UIP. The natural next step is to
see to what extent such deviations are consistent with a negative slope in the UIP regression,
and what are the theoretical factors that, within the model, can have an effect on it. We study
this issue by simulating the theoretical model and computing the moments of interest from the
simulated time series.

Figure 17: The slope of the UIP regression: the role of interest-rate smoothing (top panels) and price stickiness
(bottom panels).


                         Figure 17 studies the slope of the UIP regression under different parametrizations. The top
panels display the interaction among stochastic volatility, interest-rate smoothing and Epstein-
Zin preferences, in a flexible-price economy. The bottom panels instead studies the role of price
stickiness and its interaction with stochastic volatility and Epstein-Zin preferences, for a given
degree of interest-rate smoothing (φi = 0.95). The other parameters are calibrated as discussed
earlier.
                         Three main implications arise from Figure 17:
                         i ) the interaction between stochastic volatility and interest-rate smoothing can drive the
negative covariance between nominal exchange-rate changes and interest-rate differential that
is observed in the data. For this result, stochastic volatility is a necessary ingredient of the
model. The effect of interest-rate smoothing on the slope of the UIP regression, however, can
vary quite a bit depending on the specific type of shock to which we condition the simulation of
the model: in particular, the effects of raising monetary-policy inertia on the covariance between
nominal-exchange-rate depreciations and interest-rate differentials are stronger conditional on
monetary policy and global productivity shocks, while smaller impact is implied by conditioning
on inflation-target shocks or idiosyncratic productivity shocks. The result on monetary-policy
and inflation-target shocks are qualitatively consistent with the simple case discussed in section
5: the unit root in the process for the inflation target tends to drive the slope toward unity in
large samples, regardless of the degree of interest-rate smoothing, while a negative correlation
between exchange-rate changes and interest-rate differentials arises following monetary-policy
shocks. The asymmetric calibration of the policy rules implies that even a global productivity
shock can have implications for international relative variables. The degree of interest-rate


                                                                           45
smoothing in the policy rules can again play a key role in driving the slope of the UIP regression.
   ii ) high degrees of price stickiness, on the contrary, tend to drive the slope of the UIP
regression toward the unitary value, even for a high degree of interest-rate smoothing (calibrated
at 0.95). Moderate degrees of price stickiness, however, are still consistent with a negative
covariance between nominal exchange-rate changes and interest-rate differential, provided that
the degree of monetary policy inertia is sufficiently strong. This result holds conditional on
monetary and global productivity shocks, and fades instead away if we condition on inflation-
target and idiosyncratic productivity shocks, consistently with implication i );
   iii ) deviating from Expected Utility has little but beneficial effects on both respects: the effect
of monetary-policy inertia becomes stronger also conditional on idiosyncratic productivity shocks
and even on inflation-target shocks, while moderate degrees of price stickiness are now consistent
with a negative slope in the UIP regression also conditional on country-specific productivity
shocks.
   It is worth noticing, that none of the above results would arise in a model without stochastic
volatility, in which case the slope of the UIP would always be one: stochastic volatility is
therefore a necessary ingredient to understand these regularities.
   Another relevant empirical regularity that is connected to the UIP puzzle has been recently
pointed out by Engel (2010) and is related to the behavior of the level of the real exchange
rate: Engel (2010) shows that when a country real interest rate is high (relative to the foreign
one), then its currency tends to be stronger in real terms than what would be implied by the real
uncovered interest rate parity. As discussed in Engel (2010) this observation poses a challenge for
the models that have been designed to address the UIP puzzle in nominal terms. Indeed, while
matching the empirical co-movement between real interest-rate differentials and real-exchange-
rate expected one-period changes, most of the existing models fail to capture the sign of the
covariance between real interest-rate differentials and the level of the real exchange rate.
   We focus on the impulse response to volatility shocks, since these are the shocks that in
our model can generate deviations from nominal or real UIP. Our impulse response analysis
suggests that, conditionally on a shock to the volatility of the inflation target, the real exchange
rate appreciates on impact while the real interest rate differential is positive (see Figure 11): this
pattern is consistent with Engel’s evidence. However, conditional on the same shock, the ex-
change rate would depreciate in its adjustment path, contradicting the evidence in Engel (2010).
Moreover, the current real interest-rate differential, following a shock to the volatility of the in-
flation target, is positively related to both current and future deviations from UIP, while in
Engel’s findings it covaries negatively with the short-run deviations from UIP.
   There are three main caveats that are important to keep in mind when looking at our model-
based impulse responses to assess our model’s ability to replicate Engel’s findings. First, Engel’s
finding in terms of the behavior of the real exchange rate are based on a VAR-estimate of real
interest rates, where the VAR model considers only a subset of the variables involved in our
theoretical model (Qt , it − i∗t and πt − πt∗ ). Second, the estimates in Engel (2010) are based on


                                                 46
a linear projection while our approach emphasizes the importance of second-order moments for
exchange rate determination. Third, and most important, the puzzle discussed in Engel (2010)
is related to unconditional covariances – the linear-regression coefficients of the real exchange
rate on the interest-rate differential at various time-horizons – while our model-based impulse-
response functions only reflect co-movements conditional on specific shocks.
    Therefore, while looking at the model-implied impulse-response functions is useful at first
pass, a proper analysis of the evidence discussed by Engel would require to use our theoretical
model to simulate the relevant time series, and then estimate the same VAR and construct the
same statistics that are presented and discussed in Engel (2010), and that are at the heart of
the puzzle. Also, it would be interesting to check the robustness of Engel’s findings from an
empirical point of view by augmenting his VAR specification with volatility measures, to make
it consistent with the implications of our approach to exchange rate determination. We plan on
pursuing this research avenue in future works.


7    Conclusion
Time-variation in uncertainty and risk can be an important source of fluctuations for macroeco-
nomic variables and in particular for the exchange rate. Using a standard open-economy VAR,
we have provided new evidence on the importance of both real and nominal volatility shocks for
the behavior of the nominal and real exchange rate. These findings complement the well-know
evidence, documented by several studies, based on the UIP regression. Under rational expecta-
tions, the negative regression coefficients found in these works can be interpreted as variation
over time in risk premia. Time-variation in uncertainty can be also an important source of the
variation over time in risk premia.
    Our VAR analysis shows that a rise in the volatilities of the nominal shocks appreciates
the dollar exchange rate especially in the medium run. On the other hand, an increase in
the volatility of the real shock (productivity) has the opposite effect. Moreover, a rise in the
volatilities of the nominal shocks generates significant and persistent deviations from UIP and
in particular an increase in the excess returns of foreign short-term bonds. We also investigate
the response of the slope of the term structure to volatility shocks and find that both real and
nominal shocks steepen the term structure. Finally, we also confirm the evidence reported by
Eichenbaum and Evans (1995) that a positive innovation to the level of the monetary-policy
shock (contractionary policy shock) produces a persistent appreciation in both the real and
nominal exchange rates and persistent deviations from the UIP in the form of positive excess
returns on US securities.
    We propose a New-Keynesian open-economy model as a unifying framework for reconciling
these findings in a general equilibrium model with time-varying uncertainty.
    Our model is successful along some dimensions. The key element is the specification of
monetary policy through interest rate rules and in particular the smoothing coefficient relating


                                                 47
current to past interest rates in the rule. The smoothing coefficient together with price stickiness
is important to produce an hump-shaped response of the real exchange rate to the level interest-
rate shock and combined with time-varying uncertainty can capture a negative coefficient in
the UIP regression. Among the other factors that affect critically the coefficient in the UIP
regression, higher nominal rigidities do not help while an increase in risk aversion improves
the results. In this sense, allowing for Epstein-Zin preferences that disentangle intertemporal
elasticity of substitution and risk aversion is an important feature of our framework. However,
at a first look, it is not clear that Epstein-Zin preferences, in a general equilibrium, maintain
their appeal to explain some puzzles in asset pricing as in other partial equilibrium analysis.
This is an issue that needs further investigation.
   We consider this work as a primal approach for the analysis of time-varying uncertainty in
open economies because of the methodology that we use for its solution and the general features
that we allow for in the model. However, there are several limitations. First, our model, as
any framework in which UIP holds up to a first-order approximation, cannot produce an hump-
shaped response of the nominal exchange rate to a policy shock, but only of the real exchange
rate. Directions to explore could be in the form of financial frictions or departures from rational
expectations. Second, there are several tensions between the parameter values of the model
relevant to match one fact or another. We cannot claim a complete success on all directions
simultaneously nor we did analyze a full match of the model with the data. Finally, related
to the latter point, we have calibrated the parameters of our model based on empirical studies
building on first-order approximations of the model. This is in contrast with the message of our
work that second-order terms are important. Therefore, the estimation of the model is really
needed to evaluate its fit. To this purpose, an appropriate methodology should be elaborated to
handle the features of our general second-order approximated solutions. We leave this research
for future work.
