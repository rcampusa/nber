                                             ABSTRACT

This paper treats taxation in kind (IKT) as an example of price regulation, emphasizing IKT-avoidance
behavior, and its interactions with the other costs of price controls. This emphasis fundamentally changes
efficiency conclusions, and adds new ones. IKTs do not in fact randomly sample suppliers. Large-
scale IKTs, and not small-scale ones, may have especially large average efficiency costs. Ransoms
or “commutation fees” are an IKT policy option, but are only efficiency enhancing in specific situations:
more heterogeneity among suppliers, and avoidance technologies that result in avoidance behaviors
that are poor signals of a supplier’s opportunity cost. Avoidance behaviors are one reason why the
social costs of wars and other public projects involving IKTs may have been underestimated.

   I.       Introduction

        In-kind taxes – obligations of citizens owed in goods or services, rather than money – are

some of the most important taxes in human history, and even in recent times are used in

significant ways. For example, according to The Military Balance, 59 percent of countries in the

world in 1995 obtained military manpower by conscription: forcing citizens into military service.

More than six dozen countries, including the United States, have constitutional provisions for

taking private land using the power of eminent domain. Eminent domain is also used to

redistribute intellectual property, and may be employed more frequently in the future as that type

of property becomes more valuable.          In-kind “public service” labor payments to local

governments can be a major part of the tax burden faced by the poor in developing countries.

Another example: two dozen countries compel their citizens to participate in civic elections. 1

        In-kind taxes are administered with a price ceiling: otherwise the supply of goods and

services would be voluntary. This is not to say that all price ceilings are in-kind taxes, but in-

kind taxes might naturally result from price regulation as regulators become frustrated with a low

level of supply. New York, Brookline, and Cambridge, for example, are among cities and towns

that amended their rent control laws to prevent landlords from converting rental units to

constitutional property clauses. See Miceli (2011, p. 61) for a famous example and McClure

market.

       Although public finance deals extensively with the question of cash versus in-kind

transfers, in-kind taxes are almost completely neglected. For example, neither of the public

finance textbooks by Stiglitz (2000) and Rosen (2001) mentions in-kind taxes in general, or labor

conscription in particular. The purpose of this paper is to examine the efficiency properties of

in-kind taxation (hereafter, IKT), with special emphasis on avoidance behaviors.

       Behaviors for avoiding the Vietnam War draft are still famous today. They include entry

into protected occupations, obtaining political favors, moving to Canada, or embellishing

medical conditions. Quantitative work on avoidance behaviors has shown that the Vietnam War

draft induced a significant increase in college enrollments (Baskir and Strauss 1978, Card and

Lemieux 2001). Desertion by conscripts can be rampant, and draftees are less likely than

volunteers to reenlist when their required tour is finished. 3 Leon Friedman (1969, pp. 1545-6)

describes evasion of the Union Army’s draft, “enrolling officers … were frequently lied to,

avoided, and even physically attacked… new towns sprang up just across the northern borders in

Canada … some men maimed themselves in order to fail the physical requirements for the

army.” Landowners are known to modify their property in order to avoid being targeted for

condemnation or other limits on land rights. Stroup (1997, p. 57) describes how landowners

have reacted to the Endangered Species Act by “managing their land … in a way that almost

low and moderate incomes,” see City of Cambridge (2015) and Cavellini (2001).

assures that it will not be suitable for listed species.”4

        Avoidance activities like these serve to restrict the quality and quantity of supply of

resources to be taken. Nevertheless, the small literature on the economics of eminent domain

and military conscription typically takes the supply as given, emphasizing instead the purported

tendency of in-kind taxation to distort comparative advantage (i.e., that the public project fails to

be supplied by those most suited to do it), even though many times it is technically feasible to

have IKT without any such distortions.5 This paper treats IKT as a price-regulation phenomenon

– the public recruiter is a buyer who has coercive power over its suppliers – and explicitly

models the social costs, and private benefits, of suppliers’ avoidance behaviors. Comparative

advantage distortions are a result, not an assumption.

        In-kind taxation has been implemented in a variety of ways. Supplier compensation is

one variable. Another is the granting of an option (if any) for suppliers to substitute a monetary

tax payment for their obligation to supply under the IKT. The price-control framework readily

addresses various implementation options, offers new conclusions, and changes some old ones.

Under some conditions, “fairer” IKTs – those that do not accept monetary payments and thereby

widely distribute the IKT obligation – are more efficient than less fair IKTs. These results may

help explain where and when various implementation options are exercised.

        The IKT implementation options present a tradeoff between avoidance costs and

        5
          Some of the eminent domain literature addresses land investment incentives, which
have many of the economic characteristics of eminent domain evasion. See Miceli and Segerson
(2007, Section 5) for a discussion and citations. Part of the model in Turner, Haughwout and
Van der Klaaw (2014) includes an effect of land regulation (a policy that effects the value of
land to its owner: perhaps a metaphor for condemnation) on the supply of land to be regulated.
They find that land regulation has a modest and statistically significant negative effect on the
supply of land in a municipality. That supply effect is an important part of their overall welfare
analysis of land regulation.
                                                                                                   3
opportunity costs. IKT’s are capable of realizing many of the gains from comparative advantage,

even while controlling prices.     This implication appears to match the reality in which the

resources obtained through IKT are far from random. Even among men born 1950-53 whose

military draft eligibility was chosen by a random draft lottery, military enlistment was by no

means random. Angrist (1990, p. 315) refers to “the fact that armed forces selection criteria

were not random ...” and reports that more than three-quarters of draft-eligible men in these

cohorts did not serve in the military. 6 At the same time, roughly ten percent of those not draft

eligible did serve. Although IKTs distort comparative advantage to some degree, the price-

control framework suggests that comparative advantage distortions might enhance efficiency

because they can alleviate incentives to avoid the tax.

       Previous work on conscription has debated the nature of the relationship between

monetary taxes and in-kind taxes. Lee and McKenzie (1992), Ross (1994), and Warner and

Asch (1996) claim that economizing on treasury revenue, as in-kind taxation is supposed to do,

is socially valuable because of the deadweight costs of collecting monetary taxes. However,

these papers do not model the social costs of effort to avoid IKTs; real-world IKTs interact with

income taxes, and the former may generate more deadweight costs because they are more

concentrated. Birchenall and Koch (2014) use a mechanism-design framework to look at the two

types of taxes simultaneously, and conclude that IKTs may reduce overall efficiency by raising

the marginal deadweight cost of income taxes. This paper does not contribute to the money-

         The U.S. Selective Service System’s draft lottery assigned random sequence numbers to
each birthday of the year. Angrist defines a young man to be draft eligible if his random
sequence number fell below the draft-eligible ceiling set by the Defense Department according to
its manpower needs. According to the Selective Service System, it was these draft-eligible men
who “were called to report for possible induction” unless they were classified otherwise because
of deferments for occupation, medical reasons, etc.
                                                                                                 4
versus-IKT debate, and just assumes that in-kind taxation reacts not only to the efficiency

considerations noted above, but also to social or political preferences to regulate prices paid to

suppliers.7

         Section II begins with the paper’s conceptual point of departure: a model of avoidance

behavior as a Tullock-style rent-seeking contest. A simple, but critical, result is that the social

costs of avoidance are convex in the amount of avoidance. It then lays out the other dimensions

of IKT policies, relates them to empirical observations of military recruitment schemes, and

interprets them in an equilibrium context. Section III uses the model to offer a new reason why

IKTs might reduce efficiency. Section IV looks at policy options for the mix of social costs, and

suggests that comparative advantage distortions may not be the primary social cost of IKTs.

Section V presents data on military conscription to begin to measure the importance of avoidance

behaviors, the degree of selection under IKTs, and the magnitude of conscript pay. Section VI

concludes.




   II.        The selection of suppliers

         A public recruiter is to obtain a specific amount M of a good or service. The goods and

services may be obtained in a market, where i  [0,1] indexes potential suppliers in order of their

opportunity cost. A policy option is to put a binding ceiling on the price w paid by the recruiter,

but in these cases at least some of the suppliers will have to be forced to supply.



         7
         The paper does, in the spirit of Birchendall and Koch (2014), include features of the IKT
that can be interpreted as income-tax consequences of the choices made by citizens potentially
subject to IKTs.
                                                                                                 5
II.A. A Tullock contest represented as a cost function

       Suppliers are selected by a compound lottery. The first lottery is a Tullock-style contest

(Tullock 1980) that determines their eligibility to supply. Potential supplier i’s probability ai

being classified as ineligible is a function of the resources xi  0 that he spends avoiding

selection and the resources spent by the other potential suppliers:
                                                   𝜌
                                                 𝑥𝑖
                                      𝑎𝑖 =        1    𝜌                                         (1)
                                             1 + ∫0 𝑥𝑗 𝑑𝑗




with the constant   [0,1). Note that (1) is a bit different than a Tullock (1980) contest because

it is not entirely a zero-sum game.       More aggregate avoidance effort by all will increase

aggregate avoidance.

       An individual’s avoidance probability can be written as:



                                                           𝜌
                                       𝑎𝑖 = (1 − 𝑎̅)𝑥𝑖                                           (2)



where 𝑎̅ is the average ineligibility or “avoidance” rate.

       An individual’s cost of attaining an avoidance probability a is therefore:



                                                               1
                                                     𝑎 𝜌
                                     𝑐 (𝑎, 𝑎̅) = (        )                                      (3)
                                                   1 − 𝑎̅



The more that the other suppliers avoid, the more likely supplier i is to be deemed eligible for

selection. The other suppliers’ avoidance also raises i’s marginal cost of avoiding, which is:

                                                                                                  6
                                                     1 1−𝜌
                                                 −
                                        (1 − 𝑎̅) 𝜌 𝑎    𝜌        𝑐(𝑎, 𝑎̅)                          (4)
                               (     )
                             𝑐1 𝑎, 𝑎̅ =                      =
                                               𝜌                   𝜌𝑎



As a result, the marginal private and social costs of evasion are convex in the amount of evasion.

The convexity of costs drives a number of the results. 8




II.B. The policy lottery

       The second lottery is a matter of policy, with 1 of the eligibles selected to supply (or

pay a ransom; more on the ransom below).                Suppliers may opt to skip this lottery by

“volunteering,” with all eligible volunteers enlisted (that is, supplying the good or service to the

public recruiter). It is also a policy option to forgo this lottery altogether, in the sense that  can

be set to zero. This option permits us to examine whether and how policy lotteries might affect

efficiency.

       The constant   [0,1] is the same for all non-volunteering suppliers and thereby

independent of their avoidance efforts at the eligibility stage.            Let pi denote supplier i’s

compound probability of being selected to supply, which is the joint probability of being deemed

eligible and having “bad” luck in the policy lottery:




       8
          Warner and Negrusa (2005) assume a constant marginal cost of evasion and find that
draft evasion has a lot in common with a commutation fee. As shown below, the results are quite
different with convex evasion costs.
                                                                                              7
                                    1 − 𝑎𝑖           𝑖𝑓 𝑖 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑒𝑟𝑠
                          𝑝𝑖 = {                                                                    (5)
                                (1 − 𝜆)(1 − 𝑎𝑖 )       𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒



Hereafter I refer to pi as “the selection probability.” As shown below, the two sources of

avoidance have different efficiency properties, because  has no direct resource cost, whereas ai

may help to reveal supplier-specific information. Both sources have been used in practice, as

with U.S. military conscription in the Vietnam War where (after 1969) young men were selected

by lottery and then enlisted based on their location, activities, and medical situations.

       The lotteries represented by a,  and p can be taken literally, with each supplier either

fully (to his capacity) supplying the public recruiter, or not supplying at all, as determined by

chance. Given that my model is static, p can also be interpreted as a fraction of a supplier’s

capacity that is dedicated to production for the public recruiter.          In the case of military

conscription, a low value for p could represent time until desertion, or until failure to re-enlist. It

could also represent short-duration service obligations imposed on a broad population, as some

of the Western European countries did as they reduced the size of their militaries after the fall of

the Soviet Union.9




II.C. Supplier costs
       A variety of IKT schemes are actually used. Table 1 illustrates with the case of military

conscription.   In 1995, a non-trivial number of countries allowed draftees to substitute a




       9
          Take Portugal, which required 20 months of service from draftees in 1985, and less than
12 months in 2000. Over that time frame, the size of the conscripted force fell from 48,900 to
less than 10,000 (International Institute for Strategic Studies various issues).
                                                                                                8
monetary payment for their service in the military. 10 More than half of countries with a draft

allowed young men to reduce or avoid their service by, among other things, enrolling in college.

       In order to represent much of this variety, my model presents suppliers with three IKT

policy parameters: a policy lottery rate   [0,1], a conscript compensation rate w (assumed to be

no greater than the rate that would yield M suppliers as volunteers), and a ransom rate b  0. A

supplier’s decision is made in three stages. First, avoidance effort x, if any, is made. Second, the

supplier decides whether to volunteer. Third, if not volunteering, supplier i responds to its

selection by either (i) supplying one unit of the good at cost ri and receiving compensation w or

(ii) paying the designated ransom b, whichever is cheaper.11

       Because avoidance effort often works by degrading the value of the property sought by

the public recruiter, the avoidance effort potentially serves two purposes: (probabilistically)

evading the in-kind tax according to equation (1), or reducing monetary tax obligations. Supplier

i’s expected net cost is therefore:



                𝑧𝑖 = (1 − 𝜆 + 𝜆𝑣𝑖 )(1 − 𝑎𝑖 ) min{𝑏, 𝑟𝑖 − 𝑤} + 𝑐(𝑎𝑖 , 𝑎̅) − 𝛼𝑎𝑖                   (6)



where vi is an indicator variable for volunteering and   0 is a constant. The first term on the

right-hand side denotes the expected losses from being selected. The parentheses terms therein

       10
            Olken and Singhal (2011) find that Vietnamese taxpayers may hire a substitute to
satisfy their public service obligations, but do not mention ransom-like options in any of the
other nine countries they studied. According to War Resisters’ International (1998), four of
those nine countries (Albania, Guatemala, Indonesia, Philippines) had a military draft circa 1996.
Among the four, provisions for substituting a monetary payment for military service were legal
in Albania and commonplace in Guatemala.
         11
            In practice, the ransom is typically referred to as a penalty for non-compliance or, in
the military recruitment context, a “commutation fee” or a “purchase of a false medical
certificate.”
                                                                                                    9
are the components of the compound lottery probability and the min term is the cost conditional

on being selected. The c term denotes the avoidance costs shown previously. The final term is

shorthand for net private benefits of avoidance in terms of avoiding monetary taxes. Presumably

the benefit coefficient  is increasing in the rate of monetary taxation and the degree to which

the two types of avoidance can be jointly produced.12

        M  (0,1) is the amount of supply to be obtained by the public recruiter. Given in-kind

tax policy parameters b, w, and M, and a profile of opportunity costs {ri}, an equilibrium is four

scalars V  [0,M], B  [0,1M],   [0,1] and 𝑎̅ ∈ [0,1], and an avoidance probability profile

{ai}, such that:13

        (i)     each ai minimizes the cost (6) on the domain [0,1] given , b, ri, w, c(), , and 𝑎̅;

                                                                    1
        (ii)    𝑎̅ is consistent with the avoidance profile: 𝑎̅ = ∫0 𝑎𝑖 𝑑𝑖 ∈ [0,1];

        (iii)   V is the fraction of potential suppliers for whom volunteering minimizes (6);

        (iv)    B is the fraction of potential suppliers for whom 𝑟𝑖 > 𝑏 + 𝑤; and

        (v)     total supply equals the amount M required:



                               𝑉                          1−𝐵
                       𝑀 = ∫ (1 − 𝑎𝑖 )𝑑𝑖 + (1 − 𝜆) ∫            (1 − 𝑎𝑖 )𝑑𝑖                        (7)
                              0                          𝑉




        For some of the policy parameters, an equilibrium does not exist because more than 1M

suppliers are ineligible. For example, b = 0 means that only volunteers can be enlisted, and w <

        12
          The formulation (6) assumes that both types of avoidance are subject to the same
congestion effects. If, say, monetary tax avoidance were without congestion effects, then the ai
term should be replaced by 𝛼𝑎𝑖 /(1 − 𝑎̅).
       13

rm means that the number of volunteers would be insufficient. Below I further describe the

boundaries of the set of parameters for which an equilibrium exists.

          w and b are transfers. The equilibrium aggregate cost of recruitment, SC, is therefore just

the aggregate costs of avoidance plus the aggregate opportunity cost of the enlisted suppliers:



                           1                 𝑉                         1−𝐵
      𝑆𝐶 (𝑏, 𝑤, 𝑀) ≡ ∫ 𝑐(𝑎𝑖 , 𝑎̅)𝑑𝑖 + [∫ (1 − 𝑎𝑖 )𝑟𝑖 𝑑𝑖 + (1 − 𝜆) ∫          (1 − 𝑎𝑖 )𝑟𝑖 𝑑𝑖 ]     (8)

The square bracket term is the aggregate opportunity costs. I refer to “comparative advantage

distortions” as the degree that this term exceeds what it would be under an all-volunteer system

(b = 0 and w set large enough that  = 1).

          The Appendix to this paper displays the general algebraic representation of the

equilibrium conditions. The main text of the paper discusses results in the context of specific

examples.




   III.      Another efficiency argument against in-kind taxation

          If a very large fraction of the young men of the relevant age groups are required …

          the advantages of a voluntary army become very small. (Friedman 1967, p. 5)



          The small literature on in-kind taxation, dealing especially with military recruitment by

conscription and land procurement by eminent domain, does not model avoidance behaviors and



                                                                                                  11
therefore considers only the square-bracketed term in equation (8).14        Many of the studies

conclude that the primary extra social cost of in-kind taxation is its failure to fully select

suppliers according to comparative advantage and thereby its failure to minimize the square-

bracketed term. Friedman’s quote is describing the M = 1 instance of the IKT that might not

significantly distort comparative advantage because all of the young men are presumed to be

engaged in the same activity: serving in the military.

       At the same time, it is claimed that, regardless of the amount M to be enlisted by the

public recruiter, IKTs do not have to distort comparative advantage because, in theory, the

ransom rate can be set low enough to induce suppliers to sort themselves. 15 The fact that IKTs

often fail to include a low ransom rate suggests that the claim needs to be qualified, or that IKTs

have significant costs beyond comparative-advantage distortions, or both.16 Perhaps it is simply

that ransoms have an “unfairness” cost. But, to the degree that avoidance makes ransoms a

costly policy option, modeling the use of that option a result rather than an assumption

contradicts Friedman’s assertion and changes other conclusions.17



       14
            See Amacher et al (1973), Hermalin (1995), Friedman (1967), and Warner and Asch
(2001). Oi (1967) has estimates of aggregate opportunity costs for U.S. enlistment circa 1965,
assuming little effect of the recruitment method on comparative advantage. Amacher et al.
(1973) and Munch (1976) model opportunity costs without avoidance costs, but do mention a
variety of avoidance activities. Warner and Asch (2001, p. 174) note that “individuals expend
resources to avoid the draft” but claim that such resources are socially well spent from the
perspective of reducing opportunity costs (Warner and Negrusa (2005) formally derive a result
like this).
         15
            See Warner and Asch (2001, pp. 172-3).
         16
            At first glance, it might seem that a system of substitutes would fully eliminate
comparative advantage distortions, but a substitutes system depresses the private return to
suppliers (compared to an all-volunteer system) and the Tullock eligibility contest drives a
wedge between private and social incentives. As a result, the substitutes system has too few
eligible low-cost suppliers who might take the place of high-cost suppliers.
         17
            See also Mulligan and Shliefer (2005), who emphasize yet another type of costs:
political and administrative costs of setting up, enforcing, and maintaining complex recruitment
                                                                                               12
        These two results are seen most easily by assuming, as in this section, that all suppliers

are identical ri = r. In this special case, social cost is:



                                𝑆𝐶 (𝑏, 𝑤, 𝑀 )|𝑟𝑖=𝑟 = 𝑐(𝑎̅, 𝑎̅) + 𝑀𝑟                               (9)



where the product Mr is the same opportunity cost as the all-volunteer system.

        Although it is no surprise that in-kind taxation might be less efficient due to avoidance

costs, the efficiency costs of in-kind taxation are first order, even in the neighborhood of the all-

volunteer system. Take any w  [0,r) and, for the moment, b > r + w so that B = 0 suppliers pay

the ransom. From (6) and (7), we get the equilibrium condition:



                                                              1−𝜌
                        (𝑟 − 𝑤)𝑀 + (1 − 𝑎̅)𝛼 1   𝑎̅            𝜌      1
                                            = (       )                                         (10)
                               1 − 𝑎̅        𝜌 1 − 𝑎̅               1 − 𝑎̅



The right-hand side is the equilibrium marginal cost of avoidance and is increasing in avoidance

𝑎̅ – the social costs of avoidance are convex. Raising the volunteer wage therefore has a first-

order effect on avoidance.

        It matters how much the supplier-compensation rate w is depressed below the all-

volunteer case. The social costs (9) are convex in (rw): a lot of efficiency would be lost by

setting w all the way to the zero. Unless the gains (whatever they are) from depressing w are

even more convex, the convexity of avoidance costs helps explain why, even in the absence of

significant gains from trade among suppliers, actual IKTs are usually paying rates that are


systems.
                                                                                                  13
attractive to a significant fraction of the suppliers.

        The left-hand side of (10) is the marginal benefit of avoidance. It includes the term

(rw)M, which is the expected value of the amount extracted by the IKT. The all-volunteer

system sets this term to zero, regardless of the amount M of supply to be enlisted.           The

equilibrium avoidance costs under the all-volunteer system are independent of M, and less than

they would be with IKTs (r > w), especially if M is large. We therefore have an example in

which the opposite of Friedman’s conclusion holds.18

        The left-hand side of (10) also includes an  term.  > 0 represents the assumption that

monetary taxes by themselves discourage suppliers from maximizing the social value of their

product, and instead encourage them to engage in avoidance behaviors. Avoidance therefore has

a first-order effect on social cost even in the all-volunteer limit w = r.

        Equation (10) is derived under the assumption that b > r + w. If instead b = w + m, each

supplier is indifferent between paying the ransom and supplying the public recruiter. This case

does not have a unique equilibrium  or B. The possible range for  goes from zero – with the

maximum number of ransom payers – to the value of  consistent with B = 0 (see above). In all

of the cases with B > 0, equilibrium avoidance and social cost is greater than the case considered

above because each supplier’s expected payment is (rw)[M+(1a)B] > (rw)M. We at least

have an example in which, given w, B = 0 is efficient because ransom payments add to avoidance

costs and do not sufficiently reduce comparative-advantage distortions.

        Another reason that low ransom rates might not add much, if anything, to efficiency, is


        18
          See Birchenall and Koch (2014) for another example. In their model, large M makes it
especially important to keep high earners in the civilian sector, where they pay lots of income
tax, and (without avoidance or ransoms in the model) an all-volunteer system is the only way to
do so.
                                                                                                14
that avoidance behaviors by themselves can signal information about a supplier’s comparative

advantage, albeit imperfectly. As shown in the next section, the sum of the two comparative

advantage terms in (8) may not be as low as it would be with all-volunteer enlistment, but is still

far from its level under pure random selection, and perhaps too low from a constrained efficiency

perspective.




   IV.        Mechanisms for realizing gains from comparative advantage


V.A. Policy options for the mix of costs

         In the case of identical suppliers the existence of ransom payers B > 0 can only increase

social cost by encouraging suppliers to avoid enlistment and ransom payments, rather than just

avoiding enlistment (recall that B denotes the fraction of potential suppliers that would prefer the

ransom to supplying with compensation w).               In the more general case with supplier

heterogeneity, the social costs are of two types: avoidance and forgone gains from comparative

advantage.19 For some values of the model parameters {,,w,r()}, is possible that setting B > 0

can reduce both comparative advantage distortions and avoidance costs by giving the highest-

cost suppliers an alternative to supplying at their high cost. To see this, take cases with zero

volunteers and  = ½. This case has a couple of intuitive properties: (i) avoidance costs are

quadratic in avoidance, (ii) average avoidance costs depend only on the cross-section average

and variance of avoidance rates, and (iii) equilibrium average avoidance depends on the average

burden that the in-kind tax places on the population:

         19
          By comparative advantage distortions, I mean the excess of the square-bracketed term
in equation (8) as compared to what it would be under the all-volunteer system.
                                                                                              15

                         2             = (1 − 𝜆) min{𝑏, 𝑟𝑖 − 𝑤} + 𝛼                               (11)
                             (1 − 𝑎̅)2



where the average burden is the cross-section average of the first term on the right-hand side.

       Setting B > 0 can both reduce average avoidance and its variance. With B = 0, the min

part of the average burden is just the amount that the price w is fixed below the average

opportunity cost. By allowing ransom payments (that is, reducing b enough that b+w is within

the support of the opportunity cost distribution), the average min term is reduced, but the ex

poste fraction 1 of the population paying the in-kind tax is increased (the enlistment constraint

requires that somebody else supply in the place of each ransom payer), with an ambiguous

overall affect on average avoidance. The size of the first effect increases with the gap between

the highest-cost suppliers and the average supplier. The size of the second effect increases with

the size of the opportunity cost of suppliers that do not pay ransom, and would be essentially

zero if the suppliers not paying ransom were on the margin of volunteering. B > 0 also reduces

the cross-section variance of the min term – it reduces the burden for the suppliers with the

greatest burden – and can thereby reduce the average (quadratic) costs of avoidance.

       Other values for the model parameters {,,w,r()} feature a policy tradeoff between

opportunity and avoidance, as shown in Figure 1.        The chart’s horizontal axis measures the

avoidance cost term c from equation (8) (copied below for the reader’s convenience), net of what

the costs are under an all-volunteer system.       The vertical axis measures the comparative

advantage distortion term, which is the square bracket term net of what it would be under an all-

volunteer system. The all-volunteer system is at the origin in Figure 1.


                                                                                                   16
                         1                 𝑉                           1−𝐵
      𝑆𝐶 (𝑏, 𝑤, 𝑀) ≡ ∫ 𝑐(𝑎𝑖 , 𝑎̅)𝑑𝑖 + [∫ (1 − 𝑎𝑖 )𝑟𝑖 𝑑𝑖 + (1 − 𝜆) ∫          (1 − 𝑎𝑖 )𝑟𝑖 𝑑𝑖 ]      (8)
                        0                 0                           𝑉




       For the values of the model parameters {,,w,r()} that feature a policy tradeoff between

the two types of costs, the B = 0 policy has the least avoidance cost because there are no ransom

payers and only M suppliers ultimately pay an IKT (apart from the avoidance costs). The policy

lottery  is permitting the most avoidance at this point, but comparative advantage distortions are

at their maximum because the policy lottery does not discriminate on the basis of comparative

advantage. The other extreme of the frontier has  = 0 and the maximum number of ransom

payers consistent with enlisting M. Here avoidance costs are at their maximum, but comparative

advantage distortions at their minimum.




V.B. “Fairness” is sometimes efficient

       Depending on the values of the model parameters {,,w,r()}, the magnitude of the

slope of the (potentially nonlinear) frontier can be greater or less than one. A steep (flat) frontier

means that the IKT policy maximizing (minimizing) B, respectively, has the minimum total

social cost at a given w. If we describe B = 0 as the most “fair” policy option among the various

ways to regulate supplier compensation w, then fairness can be efficient. One determinant of the

frontier’s slope is the scope for gains from trade among suppliers, measured perhaps as the cross-

section variance of opportunity costs. When the scope is low, as in the identical-suppliers case

examined in Section IV, it is efficient to be fair. If instead some of the suppliers have a

particularly high cost, the policy that encourages ransom payments may minimize total costs
                                                                                        17
because its reduction of comparative advantage distortions is not sufficiently offset (if at all) by

added avoidance costs.

       The technology for avoidance, as parameterized by the constant , is also relevant for

determining whether the fair IKT is also more efficient than other IKTs. Figure 2 displays two

equilibrium cross-section profiles for avoidance for the B = 0 case. The profiles achieve the

minimum of each supplier’s net cost (6):



                                                             0                   𝑖𝑓 𝑟𝑖 ≤ 𝑤 − 𝛼
    𝑎𝑖 = 𝜌   𝜌/(1−𝜌) (
                         1 − 𝑎̅   )1/(1−𝜌) {        [𝑟𝑖 − 𝑤 + 𝛼 ]𝜌/(1−𝜌)       𝑖𝑓 𝑟𝑖 ∈ (𝑤 − 𝛼, 𝑤]   (12)
                                               [(1 − 𝜆)(𝑟𝑖 − 𝑤) + 𝛼 ]𝜌/(1−𝜌)        𝑖𝑓 𝑟𝑖 > 𝑤



Both profiles correspond to the same values for the model parameters {,w,r()} except that they

have different ’s.         As  approaches 1, a supplier’s avoidance is more sensitive to his

opportunity cost. In effect, avoidance alone achieves some of the gains from comparative

advantage and thereby reduces the potential for ransoms, which increase the overall level of

avoidance, to reduce comparative-advantage distortions.

       An equilibrium, of course, has too much avoidance on average, but it also has an

avoidance profile that is too steep among the non-volunteers. Note that high-cost suppliers are

not avoiding the IKT with the purpose of achieving gains from trade. The private benefit when

supplier i avoids depends on ri  w. The social benefit is ri minus the opportunity cost of the

supplier who replaces him, and is less than the private benefit because the IKT is by definition

not compensating suppliers according to their opportunity cost.

       For example, take  = 0 and w > 0 and consider perturbing the equilibrium avoidance for


                                                                                                     18
a supplier with opportunity cost rh and using the extra enlistment by increasing avoidance for a

supplier with opportunity cost rL < rh. The perturbation reduces aggregate avoidance costs

according to the ratio (rhw)/(rLw) because the high-cost supplier had been avoiding more. But

the perturbation reduces aggregate opportunity costs by only rh/rL < (rhw)/(rLw). This is

another reason why the no-ransom-payers policy might be more efficient than IKTs with ransom

payers: the former has more of the avoidance in the policy lottery that is independent of

opportunity cost.   The equilibrium already has an inefficient mix of avoidance costs and

comparative-advantage distortions, and accepting ransom payments further exacerbates this

inefficiency.




   V.        Avoidance and Selection with Military Conscription

        Above I argue that avoidance behaviors are a natural consequence of IKTs, that a side

effect of avoidance is that suppliers are selected in relation to their opportunity costs, and that

suppliers are paid enough under IKTs that much of the supply is voluntary. The case of military

conscription offers enough data to begin to measure the importance of avoidance behaviors, the

degree of selection under IKTs, and the magnitude of conscript pay.

        Table 2’s data from the Union Army shows that evasion and exemptions were common in

the American Civil War. The top line of the table shows that 776,829 men were drafted but, as

shown toward the bottom of the table, the draft only delivered 162,535 recruits. 20 41 percent of

those drafted were exempted. Many others did not report. Of those who were held to service, 81


        20
          To put these numbers in perspective, note that the U.S. population today is 14 times
greater than the population of the Union in 1861 (National Park Service 2015).
                                                                                                 19
percent made a monetary payment (a “commutation fee” or hiring a substitute) rather than

serving in person.

       Figure 3 shows the importance of exemptions in the modern U.S. wartime drafts: 1944

(World War II), 1952 (Korea), and 1970 (Vietnam). For these drafts, male civilian citizens had

to register at age 18 with the Selective Service System. The registered men were classified as

available for military service (with or without restrictions) or according to the reason for his

exemption or disqualification. 21 The figure, based on U.S. Census Bureau (2006), shows the

distribution of registrants by classification. The various exemptions and disqualifications are

combined into a single category, with the exception of those who are classified exempt because

they are serving or already served. In all three wars, exemptions were a nontrivial fraction of

those registered. In Vietnam, exemptions were a majority and exceeded the number who served.

Indeed, Card and Lemieux’s (2001) estimates for 1965-69 imply that about two men were

enrolled in college because of the draft (that is, beyond the number normally enrolled) for every

one that was inducted into the military via the draft. Sjaastad and Hansen (1970) attempted to

estimate the overall amount of draft avoidance costs circa 1969 and (as summarized by

(President's Commission on an All-Volunteer Armed Force 1970) found them to be 1.5 times the

amount that the military was saving on payroll expenses relative to an all-volunteer force, which

suggests that avoidance costs could be quite a bit larger than comparative-advantage distortions.

Table 2 and Figure 3 therefore suggest that a realistic model of suppliers must look at their

options for avoiding the IKT.

       It would be remarkable if those inducted through the draft were representative of the



       21
          Commutation fees and offering substitutes were not options for draftees in World War
II, Korea, or Vietnam.
                                                                                             20
population of registrants, especially when the former is a small fraction of the latter. For

example, we must presume that there were draftees in the Civil War who could not afford the

commutation fee or to hire a substitute. College students were allowed to defer their service

during the Vietnam War. Of course, college students are not representative of the general

population their age, with better grades in high school and higher parental incomes, among other

things.

          The results of Kriner and Shen (2010) permit some quantitative comparisons of civilian

and military populations across wars, two with a draft (Korea and Vietnam) and one with an all-

volunteer force. They obtained records on each military death during the wars, including the

place where the person had been living prior to entering the military. Using these records, they

compared the casualty rates across countries grouped in population-weighted deciles by the

median family income in the county. Figure 4 shows some of their results. 22 The vertical axes

measure the percentage of casualties in each decile and would be essentially ten for every decile

if selection into the military and selection into activities within the military were random.

Instead, each war’s chart shows a downward-sloping pattern with county income, which means

that young men in high-income counties were less likely to die in the war than young men in

low-income counties were. Some of the differences among counties occur because a greater

fraction of young men in high income counties avoid the draft. Some of them occur because of

the types of military service performed.

          Also of interest is the fact that deviations from random casualties in Iraq (fought entirely

with volunteers) are not that different from the pattern for Korea (27 percent of military



          22
          Kriner and Chen have results for World War II, but the results are not comparable
because they were unable to classify counties by income.
                                                                                                   21
personnel had been drafted) and Vietnam (20 percent; most of them were inducted prior to the

use of a random lottery).23 If county income or college attendance is positively correlated with

comparative advantage in civilian occupations, then Figure 4 suggests that the comparative

advantage distortions during Korea and Vietnam were less than they would have been with

purely random selection.

         At the same time, comparative advantage distortions were probably not zero.          The

military’s demographic composition changed after the draft ended in 1973. Drafted military

personnel were more likely white and less schooled than the military would have been if

recruited on a purely volunteer basis: see Sider and Cole (1984) and Kane (2005). Kriner and

Shen (2010, p. 75) find the Vietnam casualty-income relationship to be significantly weaker after

1969 when a random lottery became part of the selection process.

         In practice militaries recruiting with a draft simultaneously recruit large numbers of

volunteers.24 Table 1 shows that every country with the draft had a significant number of

volunteer soldiers too, and typically those volunteers are almost half of military personnel.

Figure 5 measures the prevalence of volunteers in several U.S. wars, showing that volunteers

have been a significant percentage and many times outnumbered those inducted through the

draft.

         Undoubtedly some of the so-called volunteers enlisted in order to avoid being drafted. Oi

(1967) refers to them as “reluctant volunteers.” For the Vietnam War (circa 1965), he estimated

that reluctant volunteers to be 38 percent of total volunteers, leaving about half of the force as

         23
           In Korea and Vietnam, the prevalence of draftees in combat areas was higher than the
overall percentages cited in the text.
        24
           In the eminent domain context, I expect that volunteers are common in jurisdictions
where compensation is closely tied to market value, although I do not have systematic data on
this.

“true volunteers.” His estimate is also shown in Figure 5 (black triangle). Although reluctant

volunteers were not absent from the wars before Vietnam, they were probably less prevalent

because volunteering sometimes put a person a greater risk rather than less. Whereas volunteers

during the Vietnam War were less likely than draftees to serve in the combat zone and were less

likely to die in service (Kriner and Shen 2010, p. 77, The Veterans Hour 2015), volunteering for

the Confederate Army may have been more dangerous because volunteers were targeted for

conscription after their volunteer tour of duty ended (Weigley 1984, p. 205).25

         The important conclusion is that public recruiters are often paying rates that are attractive

to a significant fraction of the suppliers. The Civil War payments are vivid examples. Table 3

shows that 24 percent of the War Department spending 1861-5, which amounted to more than

three months of the Union’s GNP, was devoted to extra bonus or “bounty” payments to

volunteers (U.S. Census Bureau 2006, Kriedberg and Henry 1955, Williamson 1974). The

model in this paper is a start at explaining why, and how much, payers of the IKT are

compensated.



   VI.        Conclusions

         This paper treats taxation in kind (IKT) as an example of price regulation. 26           The

government values possession of a particular good or service and IKTs offer a range of

alternatives to purchasing in an unregulated market. The alternatives exacerbate the social


         25
           To the extent that reluctant volunteers do serve at less cost, my model can be readily
extended to include them by adding a third “occupation” that supplies the government at lower
cost and in doing so obtains an exemption from the IKT; joining the third occupation would be
an example of the avoidance behaviors modeled in this paper.
        26
           See also Becker (2008) who treats (apartment) rent regulation and military conscription
in the same lecture about “non-price rationing.”
                                                                                                  23
problems of determining who supplies the good, and coordinating the two sides of the market.

This paper emphasizes the additional problem of limiting tax-avoidance behavior, and its

interactions with the other two.

        This emphasis fundamentally changes efficiency conclusions, and adds new ones.

Ransoms permit high-cost suppliers to opt out, but they also increase the aggregate burden

because somebody has to supply in their place. The fact that IKT policies many times do not

make use of ransom-like policy instruments that would reduce comparative advantage distortions

suggests that other costs are decisive: those other costs may be avoidance costs. If so, large-scale

IKTs, and not small-scale ones, may have especially large average costs. Indeed, because of

avoidance behaviors, large-scale recruitment may only be possible without price regulation, or at

least requires a ceiling that is pretty close to the unregulated rate.

        The other side of the coin is that some situations warrant ransoms and relatively high

supply prices that would mitigate comparative-advantage distortions. These situations include

more heterogeneity among suppliers, and avoidance technologies that result in avoidance

behaviors that are poor signals of a supplier’s opportunity cost.27

        Previous studies estimated the burden of in-kind taxes by looking only at the suppliers

actually transacting with the public recruiter, and highlighted the hidden tax they paid as a

consequence of the price control.28 In the notation of this my model, the previous studies take

the hidden burden to be (rw)M, where M is the amount of supply taken by IKT, w is the



        27
           Another consideration, not addressed in this paper, is that policymakers are not fully
aware of the social costs of recruitment and that IKTs obscure the costs, especially when the IKT
does not include monetary options. See Dougan and Thomas (2014) for an application of this
idea in another regulatory context.
        28
           See Becker (1957), Oi (1967), Amacher et al. (1973), Goldin and Lewis (1975) and,
more recently, Olken and Singhal (2011).
                                                                                                  24
compensation paid, and r is the average opportunity cost of the M suppliers transacting with the

government pursuant to the IK. This would also be the hidden burden in my model if there were

no avoidance and no ransom payments. 29 But in fact there is avoidance and sometimes ransoms

too, which are burdens for suppliers not making IKT payments. In the context of the military

draft, a number of draft-aged civilian men are not in the military precisely because they incurred

some of the various avoidance costs noted in this paper.          Inclusive of ransoms and other

avoidance costs, the total burden among suppliers exceeds (rw)M by a factor of [1 −

(1 − 𝜌)𝑎̅]/[(1 − 𝑎̅)(1 − 𝐵)] where 𝑎̅ is the average ineligibility or “avoidance” rate and  

[0,1) indicates the ratio of average avoidance costs to marginal avoidance costs. As shown in

Table 2, this factor is, depending on , between 1.5 and 4.8 for the Union Army in the Civil

War. 30 This is one reason why the costs of wars involving the draft have been underestimated. 31

       According to this paper’s definition of social cost, it is minimized with all-volunteer

recruitment. In order to explain the fact that in-kind taxes exist, one can, for the purposes of

predicting actual policymaking, put extra weight in social cost on payments to the suppliers. The

       29
            For simplicity, this paragraph takes the avoidance-benefit parameter  to be zero and
treats all suppliers as identical.
        30
            From Table 2, 1.5 and 4.8 are the ratios of 776,829 and 249,259, respectively, to
162,535. At the lower bound, all of the costs beyond (rw)M are the fees for substitutes or
commutation. For the years 1965-69 (U.S. Vietnam War prior to the draft lotteries), the upper
bound on the ratio is 10.8 because at least 15.4 million men aged 18.5-26 were both draft
registered and hadn’t served in the military but only 1.4 million of them were inducted into
military service (see also Section V).
        In the model with identical suppliers and B > 0, the marginal benefit of avoidance effort
is (1 − 𝜆)(𝑟 − 𝑤), which rationalizes average avoidance costs of (1 − 𝜆)(𝑟 − 𝑤)𝜌. Each
supplier therefore pays (1 − 𝜆)(𝑟 − 𝑤)𝜌𝑎̅ for sure and (1 − 𝜆)(𝑟 − 𝑤) with probability (1 − 𝑎̅).
The resource constraint requires that (1 − 𝜆)(1 − 𝑎̅)(1 − 𝐵) = 𝑀, and thereby gives the factor
cited in the main text.
        31
            Some of the studies of the cost of war only attempt to estimate the “direct” costs akin
to monetary tax payments, without attempting to quantify the “indirect” costs of avoiding either
monetary or in-kind taxes. Even so, the point here is that the ratio of indirect to direct costs may
have been higher for military conscription than it is for monetary taxes.
                                                                                                    25
efficiency comparative statics in this paper would be comparative statics as to IKT policy

implementation, holding fixed the “extra weight.” This is essentially the approach of Ross

(1994), Warner and Asch (1996) and others who interpret the extra weight as reflecting the

deadweight costs of monetary taxes, although Birchenall and Koch (2014) dispute the conclusion

that deadweight costs of monetary taxes are enough to justify IKT as efficiency-enhancing.

Perhaps the extra weight reflects supplier pricing distortions, as with the “hold out” phenomenon

featured in the eminent domain literature or the monopoly distortions sometimes cited as

justifications for price ceilings (Galbraith 1980). Or it may reflect political factors such as

overlaps between regional and federal tax bases, or the importance to certain parties of wielding

the power to grant exemptions. Clearly more work is needed to improve positive theories of

price controls.

unknowns (𝑎̅, 𝜆), taking as given the in-kind tax policy parameters b, w, and M, and the profile
of opportunity costs {ri}.
