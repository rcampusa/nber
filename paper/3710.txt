               DO MINIMUM WAGES REDUCE EMPLOYMENT?
               A CASE STUDY OF CALIFORNIA, 1987-89

                            ABSTRACT


     In July 1988 California's minimum wage rose from $3.35 to

$4.25. In the previous year, 11 percent of California workers
and fully one-half of its teenage workers earned less than the
new state minimum. The state-specific nature of the California
increase provides a valuable opportunity to study the effects of
minimum wage legislation. As in a conventional non-experimental
program evaluation, labor market trends in other states can be
used to infer what would have happened in California in the

absence of the law. Drawing on published labor market statistics
and microdata samples from the Current Population Survey, I apply
this strategy to estimate the effects of the rise in the minimum
wage on various groups and industries in the state. Special
attention is paid to teenage workers and employees in retail
trade. The results are striking. The increase in the minimum
raised wages of teenagers and other low wage workers by 5-10

percent. Contrary to conventional predictions, however, the
employment rate of teenage workers rose, while their school
enrollment rate fell.

                    Do Minimum Wages Reduce Employment?
                    A Case Study of California, 1987-89


    Few substantive issues generate as much agreement among economists as

the effects of minimum wage legislation. It is widely believed that the

imposition of a binding wage floor will reduce the employment of young and

less-skilled workers. While the theoretical arguments underlying this

consensus are simple and compelling, the empirical evidence is surprisingly

limited.' A major obstacle confronting most recent studies of minimum wage

laws is the near-universality of the Federally-legislated minimum. Despite

some specific exceptions in the Federal law, the vast majority of workers

are covered by the same wage floor.2 Since the Federal minimum has been

adjusted only 11 times in the post-war era, the number of independent

observations on the effect of the minimum wage is small.

    In the late 1980's, however, several States responded to the decade-

long decline in the real value of the Federal minimum wage by establishing

state wage floors above the $3.35 per hour Federal rate. These state-

specific increases provide a valuable natural experiment for evaluating the

effects of minimum wage statutes. Labor market trends in other states can

be used to infer what would have happened to employment, wages, and

unemployment in the absence of the law. The timing of the states'

legislation is also fortuitous. The late 1980's was a period of declining


     Brown, Gilroy. and I(ohen (1982) present a detailed survey of the
empirical evidence up to 1980. See also the chapters of the Minimum Wage
Study Commission (1981).
     2
      At present roughly 85 percent of workers are covered by the Federal
law. The major exclusions are employees of smaller retail trade and
service establishments, employees paid on commission, and employees who
earn tips (who are covered by a subminimum rate). Many states (including
California) have historically maintained state minimum wage rates equal to
the Federal rate for workers outside the Federal law -- see Questor (1981).
                                       2


unemployment, with modest rates of wage and price inflation. In a stable

economic environment like this the effects of minimum wage laws are more

likely to stand out from other changes in the labor market.

     Among the states that raised their minimum wages California enacted

the most notable change. In July 1988 California's minimum wage rose from

$3.35 to $4.25 per hour. In the previous year 11 percent of all workers in

the state and 50 percent of California teenagers earned between $3.35 and

$4.24 per hour. Furthermore, the California law applied very broadly,

extending even to tipped employees in the food and drink industry.

Estimates presented by Brown, Cliroy, and Kohen (1982) suggest that teenage

employment would fall by 3-8 percent in response to this rise in the

minimum wage.

    This paper uses rnicrodata from the Current Population Survey (CPS) to

measure the effects of the increase in the California minimum wage. The

available samples are large: about 20,000 individuals of working age and

1500 teenagers per year. These data, together with data for a comparison

sample of individuals drawn from other states with no change in minimum

wage laws, permit relatively precise inferences on the effects of the

increased minimum.   I tabulate the relative changes in wages, employment,

and unemployment for a variety of age-ethnic-education groups in the state

and compare the magnitude of these changes to the fraction of the group who

earned less than $4.25 in the year before the law was enacted. I also

devote special attention to two heavily affected groups: teenage workers

and employees in retail trade. Remarkably, I find no evidence that the

rise in the minimum had an adverse employment effect. Indeed, the evidence
                                      3


suggests that the increase in the minimum wage raised both wages and

employment among low-wage workers in the state.



I. A grief History

     The rise in California's minimum wage in mid-1988 followed a year-long

sequence of legislative, administrative, and judicial decisions.3 In May

1987, the State Assembly's Labor and Employment Commission voted to raise

the minimum from $3.35 to $4.25 per hour effective January 1 1988, with

further increases in 1989 and 1990. The bill was subsequently modified and

passed both houses of the legislature with the provision of a single

increase, to $4.25, effective January 1988. The governor vetoed the bill

in September 1987, citing the pending decision of the State's Industrial

Welfare Commission. Under California law, this commission is empowered to

set minimum wages for all workers in the state. The Commission had begun

hearings on a new minimum in 1986, and in December 1987 announced an

increase in the minimum wage to $4.25, effective July 1 1988.

    The Industrial Welfare Commission's ruling also established a

subminimum rate of $3.50 per hour for tipped employees. This provision was

immediately appealed by the California Labor Federation, which contended

that the lower rate violated the California Labor Code. An appellate court

panel ruled against the subminimum in June 1988. The July 1 effective date

therefore passed amid much confusion as to the appropriate minimum wage for

tipped employees. The issue was resolved on October 31 1988, when the

State Supreme Court upheld the lower court and rejected the subminimum


     3The following information is gleaned from articles in the aureau of
National Affairs' Daily Labor Report, including 1987 DLR 157: A-2, 1987 DLR
246: A-4, 1988 DLR 127: A-2, 1988 DLR 135: A-4, and 1988 DLR 215: A-4.

provision. Thus, by the end of 1988 the minimum wage was clearly

established at $4.25 per hour for all California workers, including tipped

employees. The only exemptions applied to individuals under 18 years of

age (who faced a $3.60 minimum), and to certain narrow occupations and

industries.




II. Characteristics of Low-Wage Workers in 1987

    To understand the effects of the rise in the minimum wage in California

it is important to identify the sectors of the economy and the types of

workers affected by the law. Tables 1 and 2 give the industry distribution

and demographic characteristics of low-wage workers in the state in the

year before the increase in the minimum. The data are taken from merged

files of the 12 monthly CPS surveys conducted during l987. Each month,

one-quarter of all individuals in the CPS sample are asked to report their

usual weekly hours and usual hourly or weekly earnings on their main job.

For workers who are paid on a weekly or monthly basis I have converted

their earnings to an hourly basis by dividing usual weekly earnings by

usual weekly hours.5 Individuals are then sorted into categories depending

on whether their hourly wage is below the prevailing minimum of $3.35 in

1987, equal to the minimum in 1987, or above $3.35 but less than the 1988

minimum of $4.25 per hour.

     In 1987 1.3 percent of California workers reported an hourly wage less

than $3.35 per hour (see column 2 of Table 1). The characteristics of


    4The CPS samples are described in Appendix 1.

        have not used the wage or earnings data for individuals whose wage
or earnings responses are imputed by the Census Bureau.
                                          5


these workers are reported in column 2 of Table 2. Since California law

prescribed a minimum   of   $3.35 for most workers not covered by the Federal

statute, some of these individuals were presumably working illegally for

non-complying employers.6 Others, including some 16 and 17 year olds and

some live-in household workers, legally earned less than the Federal/state

minimum.7 A third group of subminimum-wage workers consists of salaried

workers who mis-report their usual weekly earnings or usual hours.8 The

importance of this phenomenon is suggested by the fact that salaried

workers are 3 times more likely to report a subminimum wage than hourly-

rated workers, even though (on average) salaried workers have substantially

higher earnings than hourly-rated workers.

    A much larger group of individuals were paid either exactly $3.35 per

hour or between $3.36 and $4.24 per hour. For simplicity I will refer to

these workers as the "affected group", since it is precisely these workers

who would have either lost their jobs or had their wages raised if the new

minimum had taken effect in l987. Overall, 10.8 percent of California

workers were paid as much as the old minimum but less than the new minimum.


     6For example, non-compliance is a likely explanation for the
relatively large number of workers in low-wage manufacturing industries
paid less than $3.35 per hour. See Ashenfelter and Smith (1979) for an
analysis of the extent of non-compliance with Federal minimum wage
legislation in the early 1970's.

     7Under California law, meals and lodgings may be credited for part of
the minimum wage.

     8Survey measures of earnings and hours are well known to contain
substantial response errors: see Duncan and Hill (1985). In addition, I
suspect that some full-time workers (or their proxy respondents) overstate
their hours by reporting exactly 40 hours per week.

     9This ignores non-compliance and the fact that some workers who are
paid at or above the minimum are actually exempt. It also ignores the
possibility that job conditions are altered when the wage is raised.
                                         6

The size of the affected group varies substantially across industries,

ranging from less than 2 percent of workers in mining, construction,

transportation, communications and utilities, and public administration to

30 percent or more in agriculture, low-wage manufacturing, and retail

trade. The industry distribution of the affected group is presented in

column 6 of Table 1. About one-half of these workers are concentrated in

retail trade. In view of this fact, I devote special attention to this

industry in Section IV, below.

     The demographic characteristics of wage earners in the affected group

are presented in column 3 of Table 2. Relative to the overall California

workforce the affected group is younger and contains more women, Hispanics,

and school enrollees. Affected wage earners also work fewer hours per

week. The age distribution of affected workers is highly skewed: over 80

percent are between the ages of 16 and 24. Indeed, 52 percent of

California teenagers and 29 percent of those between 20 and 24 years of age

reported wages in the $3.35 -    $4.24 range in 1987.
    The family income data in Table 2 suggest that the low hourly earnings

of affected workers are associsted with low family income. The income

measure here pertains to the 12 month period ending 4 months before the CPS

interview)0 Some 44 percent of affected wage earners live in families

with annual incomes less than $15,000. By comparison, 24 percent of all


     10Family income is collected on the CPS "Control Card" when a
household first enters the CPS survey. The income information is collected
in 14 intervals and is updated at the 5th interview (which takes place 12
months after the first interview). A detailed description of the nature of
this income measure is provided in the 1987 Bureau of the Census document
"How to Enumerate CPS", pp. D3 64-67. I have constructed the average income
figures in Table 2 by assigning to each interval the mean level of family
income last year among currently employed individuals in the March 1988 CPS
who report family income in the same interval.
                                        7


Californians age 16-68 and 19 percent of employed individuals live in such

families. A more detailed contrast is presented in Figure 1, which plots

the distribution functions of family income for low-wage earners and those

making more than $4.24 per hour. Despite their relative concentration in

the lower half of the family income distribution, there are still

significant numbers of low-wage workers in high-income families. Thus, as

Craralich (1976) and other researcher have emphasized, not all the earnings

increases generated by a rise in the minimum wage accrue to the poorest

families. Relative to earlier studies, however, the correlation between
                                                          11
low wage earnings and low family income is higher here.



II. The Effects of The Minimum

8.   Effects   op the Azre2ate Wage Distribution

     California's new minimum wage took effect on July 1 1988. The first

question of interest is whether and by how much the increase in the minimum

raised wages at the low end of the earnings distribution. A partial answer

is provided by Figure 2, which plots the hourly wage distribution among

California workers earning less than $6.10 per hour in 1987 and 1989. This

cutoff captures the first quartile of the wage distribution: in both years

the 25th percentile of wages was $6.00 per hour. The figure indicates a

sharp decrease in the fraction of workers earning between $3.35 and $4.24 -

- from   10.8 percent in 1987 to 2.4 percent in 1989. The prominent spike at



     11There are a several possible explanations for this. First, I
classify workers earning between $3.35 and $4.25 as affected workers, while
some earlier studies look only at those individuals earning exactly the
minimum wage. Second, relative to the 1970's, the real level of the
Federal minimum in 1988 was much lower. Finally, the joint distribution of
individual earnings and family income may have changed.
                                          8


$3.35 per hour (with 11 percent of all workers in the first quartile of the

1987 wage distribution) is replaced by an even bigger spike at $4.25 per

hour (with 17.6 percent of all workers in the firBt quartile of the 1989

wage distribution).

     Two   aspects   of the wage data in Figure 2 warrant further discussion.

First, although the 1989 wage distribution shows a relative deficit in the

$3.35-$4.24 range, a much higher fraction of workers earned less than the

minimum wage in 1989 than in 1987 (3.5 percent versus 1.3 percent). Using

Ashenfelter and Srniths (1979) notion of a non-compliance rate, 31 percent

of all workers earning less than or equal to the minimum wage in 1987

earned less than the minimum)2 With the rise in the minimum to $4.25 the

non-compliance rate rose to 46 percent.

    One potential explanation is provided by California law, which permits

a 15 percent lower minimum wage for individuals less than 18 years of age

and for apprentices and job learners in the first 160 hours of
              13
employment.        In 1987, the incidence of subminimum pay (i.e. less than

$3.35 per hour) was 9 percent among 16 and 17 year olds: these workers

accounted for 15 percent of subminimum earners. In 1989 the incidence of

subminimum pay (less than $4.25) rose to 17 percent among 16 and 17 year

olds. Nevertheless, their share of all subminimum employment actually fell

to 10 percent. While more employers may have used the youth sub-minimum in

the later period, this by itself cannot explain the rise in the incidence



            non-compliance rate makes no allowance for measurement error or
for incomplete coverage of the law.

     13During the school year the youth subminimum is only available to
one-fourth of the workforce at any particular establishment.
                                      9


of below-minimum wages. In fact, the incidence of subminimum wages rose by

200-300 percent for most groups in the labor force.

    A second issue in the interpretation of Figure 2 is the question of

whether some change in the distribution of wages would have occurred even

in the absence of a higher minimum. The median wage for all California

workers rose 7.6 percent between 1987 and 1989. Assuming a stable relative

wage structure, and assuming that the rate of growth of the median wage was

unaffected by changes in the minimum wage, this suggests that the fraction

of workers in the $3.35-$4.24 range would have fallen. On the other hand,

the 25th percentile of the wage distribution was the same in 1987 and 1989.

As noted in other studies, relative wages have been diverging over the

1980's, with much slower growth at the low end of the wage distribution

(See Blackburn, Bloom and Freeman (1989)). Using the 25th percentile as a

benchmark, one might not have expected much change in the lower tail of the

wage distribution between 1987 and 1989.14

    A simple and more convincing way to evaluate what would have happened

in California in the absence of the new minimum is to examine comparable

wage distributions for workers in other states. To this end I have

constructed a "comparison sample" of workers from Florida, Georgia, New

Mexico. and Dallas Texas.'5 Ideally, one might have preferred to use

     14
       Nevertheless, the existence of spikes in the wage distribution
implies that relatively small changes in the wage distribution will not
necessarily affect specific percentiles, if the percentile happens to
coincide with a spike (as does the 25th percentile in this case).

     15i have only used Dallas, rather than all of Texas, for two reasons.
First, during the late 1980's economic conditions in many parts of Texas
were severely affected by the slump in oil prices. A comparison sample
that included all of Texas would thus show "too slow" economic growth
between 1987 and 1989. Second, in comparison to California, a smaller
fraction of workers in most states live in large urban areas. Thus, by
                                        10

states like Nevada, Oregon, and Washington to form a comparison group.

Following the lead of California, however, these states all raised their

minimum wage rates In late 1988 or 1989. Thus, I have drawn a comparison

sample from Southern and western states that did not change their state

minimum wage rates.

    A descriptive summary of differences between the California sample and

the comparison sample is presented in Appendix 2. Sriefly, the comparison

group had virtually the same labor force participation, employment-

population, and unemployment rates as California in 1987. The two samples

also have fairly similar sex, age, and education distributions, although

the fraction of Hispanic workers is higher in California (20 percent versus

13 percent) as is the fraction of individuals who report their race as

neither white nor black (9.5 percent versus 2.5 percent). Despite these

similarities, average wage rates in the comparison sample are 20-25 percent

lower than wages in California. Not surprisingly then, the fraction of

workers earning between $3.35 and $4.24 in 1987 was higher in the

comparison sample --   12.8 percent versus 10.8 percent in California.

    The median wage in the comparison sample rose 10 percent between 1987

and 1989. Over the same period the fraction of workers earning between

$3.35 and $4.24 fell by one-quarter, to 9.6 percent. If an equivalent

reduction had occurred in California, the fraction of workers in the $3.35-

$4.24 range would have been 8.1 percent in 1989. In fact, it was only 2.4

percent. On the basis of this comparison I conclude that the minimum wage

reduced the fraction of workers in the $3.35-$4.24 range by at least 5.7



including only workers in Dallas and Fort Worth, I increased the relative
fraction of urban workers in the comparison sample.
                                      11

percentage points. On average, workers in this range earned $3.70 per hour

in 1987 (see Table 2). Assuming that the "displaced" workers earned $4.25

in 1989, the minimum wage law raised the wage 15 percent for roughly 6

percent of California's workers. This estimate is biased upward by any

losses of employment that occurred for workers in the affected wage group

(see below). It is biased downward, however, by any effect of the

increased minimum on wages of those who remained in the $3.35-$4.24 range

in 1989, or by any effect of the increased minimum on workers who earned

more than $4.25 in 1987.16



b. Effects on Emvlovment and Unemolovment

    A first indication of the employment effects of the rise in the minimum

wage comes from a comparison of employment and unemployment trends in

California and the country as a whole after 1987. The unemployment rate in

California fell from 5.8 percent in 1987 to 5.1 percent in 1989. Over the

same period the national rate fell from 6.2 to 5.3 percent. Thus, trends

in the overall unemployment rate suggest similar or slightly slower

economic growth in California than elsewhere in the U.S. The same

conclusion emerges from an analysis of the overall employment-population

ratio, which gained 1.1 percentage points in California between 1987 and

1989 compared with 1.5 percentage points nationwide)7


     16See Grossman (1983) for an analysis of the effects of minimum wage
increases on above-minimum wage workers.

     17The standard error on the published unemployment rate for all
workers in California is about .15 percentage points, while the standard
error on the corresponding employment/population ratio is about .35 points.
Thus, the relative changes in the employment and unemployment rates for
California workers between 1987 and 1989 are not statistically significant.
                                     12

    For California teenagers, however, the pattern is quite different.

Between 1987 and 1989 teenage unemployment rates in California fell 3

percentage points (from 16.9 to 13.9 percent), while the average U.S. rate

fell only 1.9 percentage points (from 16.9 to 15.0 percent). An even

stronger relative trend is indicated by the teenage employment-population

ratio, which increased 4.1 percentage points in California (from 43.0 to

47.1 percent) compared to a 2 percentage point increase nationwide (from

45.5 to 47.5 percent).18 Since teenagers are the workers most likely

affected by an increase in the minimum wage, these responses are clearly

unexpected. Rather than an adverse employment effect, the data point

toward an increase in teenage employment in California following the rise

in the minimum wage.

    I have also used published Bureau of Labor Statistics data to evaluate

changes in the employment/population ratio of California workers relative

to workers in the comparison sample of Florida, Georgia. New Mexico, and

Dallas Texas)9 Data for 1985-1989 are presented in Table 3. The pre-1987

data allow a simple check on the validity of the comparison sample as a

"control group" for California. If the comparison sample is a legitimate

control group there should be no trend in the pre-1987 gap between

California and the comparison sample. This specification test is clearly

satisfied for both the overall employment rate and the teenage rate. It is


     18The standard error of the published annual unemployment rate for
California teenagers is approximately 1 percentage point, while the
standard error of the published teenage employment-population ratio is
approximately 1.3 percentage points.

     19An important advantage of the published data is that they are
derived from the full CPS sample in each month, rather than the 1/4 sample
used in the rest of this paper.
                                      13

also reassuring that the gap in the overall employment-population ratio

shows little change after 1987. For California teenagers, however, there

is a clear upward shift in the probability of employment after 1987.

Relative to teenagers in the comparison sample, the employment rate of

California teenagers was 4.8 percentage points higher in 1989 than in 1985-

87. Even with the relatively large sampling errors this change is

statistically significant, with a t-statistic of 2.18.

    Table 4 turns to the available inicrodata to analyze the effects of the

minimum wage on specific age-ethnic-education groups. The groups have been

selected to yield at least 400 observations in California in each year.

The first column of the table gives the fraction of workers in each group

who earned between $3.35 and $4.24 in 1987. This measure of the potential

impact of the rise in the minimum ranges from 1 percent for white college

graduates to 50 percent for the two teenage groups (white non-Hispanics and

Hispanics). The next columns contain the means of 4 labor market outcomes

in 1987: average hourly earnings, the employment/population rate, the

unemployment rate, and the enrollment rate.2° Finally, the last 4 columns

give the changes in these outcomes between 1987 and 1989. For convenience,

the change in wages is expressed as a percentage of the 1987 rate.

    Table 5 presents the differences in the labor market outcomes between

1987 and 1989 for each group in California relative to the corresponding




     20The latter should be interpreted with some caution, since an
individual is counted as enrolled only if he or she reported his or her
main activity in the survey week as "in school". In addition, since the
sample contains all 12 months of the year, enrollment is averaged over some
months when most students are out of school.
                                       14

differences for individuals in the comparison sauiple.21 These simple

"differences-in-differences" measure the excess changes that occurred in

California as a result of the rise in the minimum wage (or other

unspecified factors). Among the 15 groups in the table only white and

Hispanic teenagers and 20-24 year-old Hispanics show significantly

different relative wage growth. As might be expected, the two teenage

groups enjoyed substantial relative wage increases in California: the

difference-in-differences in wages is 9.6 percent for white teens (with a

standard error of 4.2 percent) and 23.1 percent for Hispanic teenagers

(with a standard error of 8.6 percent). What is more difficult to explain

are the relative increases in employment and relative decreases in

enrollment for the two teenage groups. Conventional models of minimum wage

floors predict that a rise in the minimum wage will reduce teenage

employment. In addition, it is often argued that a higher minimum will

lead to an increase in school enrollment.22 Both predictions are

contradicted by the California data.

    Although the differences-in-differences in Table 5 are relatively

imprecise, one can ask whether there is any systematic relation between the

fraction of a group earning $3.35-$4.24 per hour in 1987 and the relative

changes in the labor market outcomes for that group. The answer for wages

is yes: a simple (unweighted) regression of the difference-in-differences

of wages on the fraction of workers in the group earning $3.35 to $4.24 per


     21owing to the low number of Asians outside California, the sample
sizes of the "Other non-Hispanic" groups are too small for a meaningful
analysis in the comparison sample.

     22See Welch (1976) and Ehrenberg and Marcus (1980) for early
discussions.
                                      15

hour in 1987 yields a coefficient of 0.32, with a standard error of o.io.23

The magnitude of this coefficient suggests that the rise in the minimum

wage did more than simply raise the wages of those who would have earned

between $3.35 and $4.25 in the absence of the law (each of whom would

receive a 15 percent wage increase, on average, leading to a coefficient of

0.15). The pattern of wage changes in the comparison sample is for smaller

wage increases among the groups with lower wages in 1987. It is unclear

whether the sharp reversal of this pattern in California should be

attributed solely to the rise in the minimum wage.

   In contrast to conventional predictions, groups with a higher fraction

of low-wage workers do not appear to have suffered any relative losses in

employment. Indeed, the correlation between the difference-in-differences

of employment rates and the fraction of workers earning $3.34-$4.25 in 1987

is 0.3. This positive correlation is mainly driven by the large increases

in relative employment registered by the two teenage groups. These

comparisons thus confirm the conclusion from the published data in Table 3:

the rise in the minimum raised the wages of low wage workers, with no

evidence of adverse employment effects.



III. Effects of the California Minimum     Wage on Teenagers
    Given   the findings in Tables 3-5, this section presents a more detailed

analysis of the experiences of 16-19 year old workers in California and the

comparison states between 1987 and 1989. Figure 3 shows the hourly wage

distributions for teenage workers in California and the comparison group in



      23The R.squared of the regression is 0.44. The only significant
 outlier is the group of 16-24 year old blacks.
                                      16

the two years. The 1987 wage distributions are remarkably similar, with

modes at the Federal minimum wage and significant spikes at $3.50, $4.00

and $5.00 per hour. In 1989, however, the distributions are quite

different. Many teenagers in the comparison sample continue to earn $3.35,

$3.50, or $4.00 per hour. In contrast, much of the mass in the lower tail

of the California wage distribution has been pushed to the new $4.25

minimum.

   These visual impressions are confirmed by the data in Table 6. In 1987,

52 percent of teenagers in California and 55 percent of teenagers in the

comparison sample earned between $3.35 and $4.24 per hour. The fraction of

comparison teens in the same wage interval in 1989 was 48 percent. while

the fraction of California teens dropped to 8.5 percent. The difference-

in-differences, in the fifth column of the table, is 36 percentage points.

This relative change in the wage distribution was associated with a 10

percent relative increase in mean wages for California teenagers. As the

data in Tables 3 and 5 indicate, however, there was no offsetting decline

in teenage employment. Hours per week of employed teenagers increased

slightly in California relative to the comparison group, while the relative

employment-population ratio rose 5.6 percent. The increase in employment

was accompanied by an increase in labor force participation and a decrease

in enrollment, with little net change in unemployment.

    A broader perspective on the relative change in employment among

California teens is provided by Figure 4, which graphs 1989 teenage

employment-population rates for all 50 states against their corresponding

rates in 1987. For reference I have also plotted the 45 degree line:

points above the line represent states with higher employment rates in 1989
                                        17

then 1987. The (unweighted) average employment-population rate increased

1.6 percent across all states, compared with an increase of 4.1 percent in

California and a decrease of 0.4 percent in the comparison states. This

broader comparison suggests that the relative increase in the teenage

employment rate in California may be slightly overstated by a comparison to

teenagers in Florida, Georgia, New Mexico, and Dallas. Whatever the

comparison group, however, there is no evidence of a decline in employment

among California teens.

    The data in Table 6 make no distinction between individuals age 18 and

19, who are legally covered by the $4.25 minimum wage in California, and

individuals age 16 and 17, who are covered by a $3.60 youth subminimum. If

employers can hire 16 and 17 year olds for $3.60, and must pay $4.25 for

workers over age 18, it is conceivable that rise in the minimum generated a

shift in demand away from older teen workers and in favor of younger ones.

To check this possibility I computed the means for 16-17 year olds and 18-

19 year olds separately. Difference-in-differences of the main outcome

variables for the two subgroups are tabulated below:


                          16-17 Year Olds    18-19 Year Olds

  Percent Earning             -54.6             -26.3
   $3.35-$4.24                 (4.8)             (3.9)

  Mean Log Wage                0.15               0.06
                               (0.03)            (0.03)

  Employment Rate (%)           2.9               7.6
                               (3.0)             (3.2)


If anything, the data suggest a larger increase in employment for the 18-19

year olds, although the difference is statistically insignificant. The

older group of California teenagers also experienced a slightly larger
                                      18

relative increase in hours per week and a slightly larger relative

reduction in school enrollment. While these results rule out any

widespread substitution of younger for older teenage workers, it should be

noted that the youth subminimum is apparently only rarely used. There is

no evidence of a spike in the wage distribution of 16-17 year olds in

California at the subminimum, nor is the fraction of 16-17 year olds

earning less than $4.25 per hour in 1989 very much higher than the fraction

of 18-19 year olds (17 percent versus 10 percent). Despite the legal

provision of a youth subminimum, labor market participants seem to view the

adult minimum as the relevant one for all workers.24



IV. Effects on Retail Trade

  Almost one-half of California workers whose 1987 wage rates fell between

the old Federal minimum and the new state minimum were employed in retail

trade. The experiences of the retail trade industry are especially

interesting because the regulatory Commission charged with setting the new

minimum initially established a subxninimum wage for tipped employees in the

restaurant industry. This subminimum was later overruled by the State

Supreme Court, leaving the state with a 20 percent higher-than-expected

minimum in a large sector of the retail industry. One might expect the

adverse employment effects of an unintended wage floor to be larger than

the effects of a deliberately chosen rate.

    Figure 5 plots establishment-level data on overall employment in

wholesale and retail trade in California and the US from 1985 to 1989.


     24Katz and Krueger (1991) present survey evidence for the fast food
industry in Texas which suggests that only 3 percent of employers use the
subminimum provision of the Federal law.
                                     19

Data limitations preclude a separate analysis of retail trade.

Nevertheless, retail trade accounts for 80 percent of employees in the

entire trade sector, and 85 percent of those with wages in the $3.35-$4.24

range in 1987. If the California minimum generated significant employment

effects in the state's retail trade sector, they should be evident in the

overall trade figures.

    Despite the high fraction of workers earning less than $4.25 in 1987,

the data in Figure 5 give no indication of an adverse effect on employment

in the California trade sector. The growth rates of trade employment in

California and the US between 1985 and 1987 were 2.65 percent per year and

2.51 percent per year, respectively. Between 1987 and 1989 these growth

rates were 2.96 percent per year and 3.61 percent per year. Comparing the

rates before and after 1987 there was actually a small relative increase

(roughly 2 percent) in trade-sector employment in California after

enactment of the new minimum.

    Table 7 describes the wage and demographic characteristics of retail

trade employees in California and the comparison sample in 1987 and 1989.

There was a substantial relative reduction in the fraction of California

workers earning between $3.35 and $4.24 after the new minimum took effect.

This change was associated with a 5-7 percent relative increase in hourly

and weekly earnings among California workers. There were no corresponding

changes in weekly hours or in the age or sex composition of retail

employment. The one significant relative demographic change is an increase

in the fraction of Hispanic workers in California retailing. Contrary to

the usual predictions, none of these comparisons suggest a substitution

away from less-skilled workers.
                                         20

    I have also computed the same relative comparisons for employees of

eating and drinking establishments. These workers constitute 30 percent of

all employees in retail trade and 50 percent of those who earned between

$3.35 and $4.24 in California in 1987. The main relative comparisons are

shown below:

These data show a slightly bigger effect of the minimum wage on earnings of

restaurants workers, but again there is no evidence of skill-upgrading.

    The retail trade industry, and eating and drinking establishments in

particular, are characterized by a relatively high fraction of unskilled

labor input. In light of the wage increases generated by the rise in the

minimum wage it is interesting to examine some output price data. Figure 6

presents 1987 and 1989 data for 24 major cities on the cost of food away

from home. The Eureau of Labor Statistics compiles the data for 3

California cities: Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco. These are
                                          21

highlighted in the Figure, along with a point representing the all-cities

average.     I have also graphed the fitted regression line that relates the

1989 index to the 1987 index for each city. The 1989 price indexes for Los

Angeles    and San Francisco are very close to their predicted values, given

their 1981 levels and the pattern of price changes in other cities. Prices

in San Diego, however, are some 5 percent higher than predicted.

    This pattern coincides with a larger wage increase observed for San

Diego teenagers than for teenagers elsewhere in the state. Unfortunately,

the sample sizes for individual cities in the CPS are small and some city-

specific variation can be expected from the sample design of the CPS. Thus

it is very    difficult   to obtain reliable estimates of teenage wages by city.

While it may be tempting to attribute the San Diego increases to the

relatively larger wage increases there, the absence of a statewide pattern

of increases for the price of food away from home is still a puzzle.

   Some further evidence on prices in the restaurant industry is presented

in Table 8. This table gives actual price data for McDonald's Quarter-

Pound hamburgers in 7 California cities and 10 comparison cities in 1987

and 1989. The prices are collected on a quarterly basis by local

affiliates of the American Chamber of Commerce Researchers Association

(ACCRA).25 The lower panel of the Table gives the price in each city

relative to the average price for all cities in the ACCRA sample (which

changes slightly from quarter to quarter). The intercity dispersion of

prices in any quarter is fairly wide (up to 18 percent). Nevertheless,


     25Affiliates are given relatively precise instructions on sampling
procedures. Each reported price is based on a sample within the city.
Affiliates are instructed to sample the price of a "quarter-pound
hamburger, McDonald's if available". I assume that affiliates in the
cities selected in Table 8 have sampled Qj]y McDonald's prices.
                                     22

most cities tend to retain their relative price position. Among the

California cities, Riverside, Sacramento, and San Diego show systematically

higher relative prices in 1989 than 1987. The other 4 cities show little

net change. Thus, neither the LS data nor the ACCRA data give any

indication of a state-wide increase in restaurant prices.



V. Interretatton of the Findjn&s

    I find no evidence for the conventional predictions that economists

make regarding the impact of minimum wages. Although the rise in the

minimum raised the earnings of low-wage workers, its effects on employment

were, if anything, positive rather than negative. Even in the low-wage

retail trade industry I can find no evidence of an adverse employment

effect. For teenagers the effects of the rise in the minimum wage are

particularly striking: wages and weekly earnings rose by 10 percent, the

employment-population rate rose by 2-6 percent, and school enrollment rates

fell by 5 percent. The observed employment changes contrast to predictions

based on the earlier literature, which imply a 3-8 percent reduction in

teenage employment following a 27 percent increase in the minimum wage.

    These findings are clearly inconsistent with a conventional competitive

model of the low-wage labor market. An alternative model that is often

raised in theoretical discussions of the minimum wage is one in which

employers of low-wage workers have market power and act as monopsonistic

purchasers of labor (see for example Stigler (1946)). In this model the

imposition of a binding wage floor can lead to an increase in wages, an

increase in employment, an increase in industry output, and a reduction in

industry selling prices. In my opinion, the experiences surrounding the
                                         23

rise in the California minimum wage suggest that this or other alternative

models deserve more careful scrutiny.

    One   piece   of evidence which suggests that wages of California teenagers

were below their long-run equilibrium level prior to the rise in the

minimum is presented in Figure 7.      Here I have plotted the age profiles of

wages for young workers in California and the comparison sample in 1987 and

1989. The data in Figure 7 are simple averages of log wages for each age

group, although adjusted age profiles that control for differences in

education, enrollment status, race, sex, and hours of work show the same

pattern. Wages of the youngest group of workers in California in 1987 were

substantially out-of-line with wages for older workers, given the age

profiles observed in the comparison sample in 1987 and 1989. If the age

profiles in the comparison sample are assumed to represent a competitive

labor market, then wages for 16-17 year olds in California in 1987 were

artificially depressed by some 10-12 percent. This is about the amount

that the increase in the minimum wage raised teenage wage rates. Rather

than creating "above market" wages for young workers, however, the figure

suggests that the rise in the minimum wage simply restored relative wages

to their normal level.

    Whether a monopsonistic model provides the correct interpretation of

events in the labor market for California teenagers between 1987 and 1989

is of obvious importance for economists' interpretation of labor market

behavior and policy. Economists have been reluctant to admit the

possibility of market power in the labor market, owing to the mobility of

workers and to the fact that most labor markets involve large numbers of
                                      24

relatively small employers.26 It seems unlikely that a monopsonistic

outcome arises from the market power of an individual employer.

Nevertheless, when teenage workers are asked about the wage rate they would

require to move to a similar job in the same area, they report a

surprisingly high 26 percent premium over their current wage.27 This

suggests that some employers may enjoy a degree of monopsony power.

    An alternative view is that the California labor market became

"trapped" in an equilibrium with excess demand for labor   -   - perhaps
because employers had historically viewed the Federal minimum as a binding

wage floor and failed to adjust to the decline in its real value over the

1980's. Given that wage, and a general shortage of labor, no individual

employer had an incentive to offer a (marginally) higher wage to recruit

new workers.28 However, employers continued to post vacancies and

continued trying to recruit new workers without raising the wages of their

existing workforce.

    Much more research will be needed before economists embrace non-

competitive models of the labor market. In the meantime, evidence from the

study of California's experiences should temper any confident assessment of

the welfare economics of minimum wages.


     260ne exception is the market for highly specialized labor in a
particular geographic location. Sullivan (1990) examines the market for
registered nurses and finds evidence of exploitable market power at the
hospital level. Ransom (1990) examines the market for academic faculty and
interprets the negative relation between wages and length of service as a
monopsony effect.

     27Thjs estimate is derived from a sample of 1028 employed teenagers in
the 1982 wave of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth who report a
hypothetical hourly wage required to move to a similar job at a different
employer. The standard error on the estimated premium is 0.01.

     28Technically, what is required is that the supply of new recruits to
an individual firm is less than perfectly elastic at the market wage. This
is more plausible if the market wage is below its equilibrium level.

  This paper analyses extracts from the 1987 and 1989 Merged Outgoing

Rotation Group Monthly Files of the CPS. The extracts include all

individuals age 16-69 from the States of California, Florida. Georgia, and

New Mexico, as well as all those identified as living in the Dallas-Fort

Worth Texas PMSA. Individuals in the extracts who report being paid by the

hour (on their main job) are assigned their reported hourly pay as a

"wage". Individuals who report being paid by the week/month/etc. are

assigned the ratio of their reported weekly earnings to their reported

usual weekly hours as a "wage". In 1987. weekly earnings information is

provided in 2 fields: an edited field, which is censored at $999 per week,

and an unedited field, which is censored at $1923 per week. I use the

edited earnings data for individuals who are paid by the week/month/etc.

and who report edited weekly earnings less than $999.    I use the unedited

earnings data for those whose edited weekly earnings are censored.

Individuals with allocated hourly or weekly earnings are assigned a missing

wage, as are individuals whose wage (reported or constructed) is less than
