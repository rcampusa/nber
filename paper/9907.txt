Parental Medicaid Expansions and Health Insurance Coverage
Anna Aizer and Jeffrey Grogger
NBER Working Paper No. 9907
August 2003
JEL No. I1, I3

                                           ABSTRACT

During the 1990s many states extended Medicaid eligibility to low-income parents who were not
receiving welfare. We evaluate the effects of those expansions on health insurance coverage. To
account for unobservable differences between expansion states and non-expansion states that may

be correlated with both policy decisions and insurance coverage, we employ a within-state
difference-in-difference technique that makes use of data only from expansion states. We find that

the parental eligibility expansions increased Medicaid coverage of mothers with only small effects
on private coverage. The expansions also increased the coverage of children, presumably by raising
the benefit to the family of applying for coverage. We find substantial racial and ethnic differences
in the effects of the expansions. As a result, the expansions help reduce racial and ethnic gaps in

insurance coverage, particularly for adults.

I. Introduction

        A growing body of evidence indicates that health insurance promotes health

(Levy and Meltzer 2001). This seems to be particularly true among children and low-

income adults (Brook, et al. 1983; Keeler, et al. 1985; Lurie et al. 1986; Currie and

Gruber 1997). Because of the important links between health insurance and health, the

lack of insurance among 41.2 million Americans --a disproportionate number of whom

are poor--is widely regarded as a pressing public policy issue.

        One reason for low coverage among the low- income population is that low-wage

employers, who employ a disproportionate share of low- income workers, often do not

provide their workers with coverage. Even among firms that do, evidence suggests that

low wage workers often are unwilling to pay the price of insurance that they and their

employers face (Long and Marquis, 1992). Individual coverage obtained directly from

insurers is more expensive still.

        Furthermore, until recently, public coverage under Medicaid was not generally

available to working families. Historically, most families had to receive welfare in order

to be eligible for Medicaid coverage. 1 Between the mid 1980s and the mid 1990s, poor

children increasingly became eligible for Medicaid under the so-called poverty-related

eligibility expansio ns, which extended eligibility to children in non-welfare families who




1
 Exceptions are coverage through the Medicaid Medically Needy Program (MN) and the Supplemental
Security Income program (SSI). In 2000, 35 states offered a MN program which covers persons who do not
meet the applicable income or resource requirements for categorically needy eligibility but who, largely
because they have incurred considerable medical costs, may become eligible. Thirty-two states and the
District of Columbia automatically provide Medicaid coverage to the poor disabled who are eligible for SSI
benefits. Both programs, however, constitute only a small portion of total Medicaid enrollment: the former
3.6 million (8 percent) and the latter 5.3 million (12 percent).


                                                    1
met income-eligibility limits determined by state and federal governments. 2 The State

Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), which was introduced in 1997, expanded

children's eligibility further still. However, with the exception of pregnant women, adults

remained largely ineligible for Medicaid unless they received welfare or were disabled.

        Beginning in the 1990s, a number of states began expanding eligibility to low-

income parents who were not receiving welfare. The impetus for many of these

expansions was the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of

1996 (PRWORA). PRWORA is best known for replacing the Aid to Families with

Dependent Children (AFDC) program with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families

(TANF) program. However, PRWORA also required states to formally separate

Medicaid eligibility from welfare eligibility by replacing their AFDC-related eligibility

criteria with so-called "family eligibility" criteria. Although many states merely

established new family eligibility criteria for Medicaid that were identical to their old

AFDC-related eligibility criteria, several states used the new flexibility granted them

under PRWORA to raise the income-eligibility limits for adults well beyond their former

levels. Other states expanded eligibility under research and demonstration waivers.

        In this paper, we analyze how these parental-eligibility expansions affected

insurance coverage. We base the analysis on data from the March annual demographic

supplement of the Current Population Survey and focus on expansions implemented

between 1996 and 2001. We estimate first how the expansions have affected Medicaid

coverage among adults. To determine whether Medicaid coverage crowded out private



2
  As a whole, the child-eligibility expansions increased child coverage, although different components of
those expansions had different effects. See Currie and Gruber (1996), Ham and Shore-Sheppard (2000),
Card and Shore-Sheppard (2001).


                                                     2
coverage, we estimate the effect of the expansions on private coverage and the likelihood

of having any coverage.

       We also estimate whether there were spillover effects on the coverage of children.

The parental eligibility expansions did not expand eligibility for children, because

income-eligibility limits for children under the poverty-related Medicaid expansions and

SCHIP were generally higher than those under the parental-eligibility expansions.

Nevertheless, the parental-eligibility expansions may have raised the benefit to low-

income parents of applying for coverage, since both the adults and the children could

become insured. If so, the parental-eligibility expansions potentially could increase child

coverage as well as adult coverage.

       Finally, we ask whether the effect of the parental eligibility expansions varies by

race and ethnicity. Wages and occupations vary by race and ethnicity, which may affect

availability of employer-provided coverage. Marriage rates vary as well, which may

affect the likelihood of coverage under a spouse's employer-provided policy. Depending

on how the effects of the parental eligibility expansions vary by race and ethnicity, the

expansions could either reduce or exacerbate differentials in health care coverage.

       One of the key challenges in estimating the effects of the parental-eligibility

expansions is distinguishing the effects of the expansions themselves from the effects of

other, potentially unobservable factors that might simultaneously influence both health

insurance coverage on the one hand and state policy choices on the other. In the welfare

reform literature, this has been referred to as the "policy endogeneity" problem. This

issue is of particular concern in the policy environment of the 1990s, in which states not




                                             3
only expanded parental Medicaid eligibility, but reformed their welfare programs and

implemented SCHIP as well.

        Previous studies vary in the extent to which they have attempted to deal with this

problem. Some studies compare insurance coverage in expansion states to coverage in

non-expansion states. Such cross-sectional comparisons provide no controls for

unobservable influences that may result in policy endogeneity, even when they account

for observable factors by employing regression methods. Other studies compare within-

state changes over time between expansion and non-expansion states. Another uses a

difference- in-difference, or state fixed-effects approach, comparing deviations from state-

level means between expansion and non-expansion states. These latter two approaches

provide some control for policy endogeneity in that they implicitly control for state-level

unobservables that do not vary over time. However, our concern is that, in the volatile

policy environment of the 1990s, state policy choices may have been influenced by

unobservable factors that were changing over time. For this reason, we adopt an

alternative approach that controls implicitly for arbitrarily time- varying unobservables

within a state.

        To do this we focus only on the expansion states, and define two groups of

families according to states' pre- and post-expansion Medicaid-eligibility criteria. One is

the target group, defined as families whose incomes lie between the AFDC-related

income eligibility limit and 200 percent of the federal poverty line (FPL). Adults in these

families would have been income- ineligible for welfare, and thus for Medicaid, prior to

the expansion, but many of them would have become eligible for Medicaid as a result of

the expansion. The other group is the below-target group, whose incomes fall below the




                                             4
AFDC income-eligibility limit. These groups would have been income-eligible for

Medicaid both before and after the expansion. As a result, their coverage should not

change as a result of the parental-eligibility expansions. 3 We construct our estimates of

the effect of the parental eligibility expansions by comparing post-expansion changes in

coverage differentials between the target group and the below-target group. Since these

between- group coverage differentials can be computed within cells defined by state and

year, our approach implicitly controls for all arbitrarily time- varying state-specific factors

that may potentially influence both insurance coverage and state policy choices.

        In the next section of the paper, we discuss the parental eligibility expansions in

more detail and review the few previous studies that have analyzed their effects. In

section III we discuss the data. Section IV describes our empirical strategy more

formally; section V presents our results. Section VI concludes.

II. Background

        A. Parental Medicaid Expansions

        As noted above, historically most adults were eligible for Medicaid only if they

received AFDC. As such, eligibility was limited to single mothers with very low income.

Beginning in 1984, the federal government authorized a series of expansions for pregnant

women and their infants. By 1989, states were required to cover pregnant women up to

75 percent of the FPL, later increased to 133 percent under OBRA 1989. States could

optionally extend coverage to pregnant women with incomes up to 185 percent of the

FPL.

3
  Several states relaxed the so-called 100-hour rule at the same time that they expanded their parental-
eligibility thresholds. This could have made previously-ineligible married couples eligible for Medicaid in
both the target and below-target groups. If relaxing the 100-hour rule increased coverage within the below-
target group, then our estimates would understate the effects of the parental-eligibility expansions on the
target group.


                                                    5
       More general parental-eligibility expansions began in the early 1990s. In 1992,

Washington and Minnesota expanded eligibility to low- income parents (and children)

through state- funded health insurance programs. These expansions were quite broad,

including families with incomes up to 250 percent and 275 percent of the FPL,

respectively. Shortly thereafter, three states received federal waivers to extend Medicaid

eligibility to poor parents who did not receive welfare. These expansions were also broad

in scope, raising eligibility to 100 percent of the FPL in Oregon, 300 percent in Hawaii

and as high as 400 percent in Tennessee.

       For two important reasons, we do not focus on these early, broad expansions in

our analysis below. First, the fiscal burden imposed by these programs led two states to

sharply retract eligibility. Tennessee scaled back its original expansion after only one

year, and now extends eligibility only to those who meet federally mandated Medicaid

eligibility standards and dislocated workers. Hawaii also scaled back its original

expansion from 300 percent to 100 percent of the FPL in 1998. The effects of programs

that experience such retrenchment may be quite different from those of programs that can

be sustained.

       Second, the March CPS substantially changed the way it asked questions about

health coverage starting in 1995. This presents a data consistency problem which can

only be solved easily by using post-1994 data. As a result, the early, broad expansions

would contribute at most one year of pre-reform data to the analysis, limiting their

usefulness.

       Instead, we focus on the expansions that took place between 1996 and 2001 in the

24 states listed in Table 1. The table lists the state, the year in which the expansion took




                                              6
place, and the pre- and post-expansion income eligibility limits, expressed as a

percentage of the FPL in the year in which the expansion was implemented. The data on

the expansion years and income-eligibility thresholds are taken from a number of

sources, including Maloy et al. (2002), Broaddus, et al. (2002), Holohan and Pohl (2002),

Krebs-Carter and Holoha n (2000), Guyer and Mann (1999), and Centers for Medicare

and Medicaid Services (2003).

         The pre-expansion income eligibility level (IEL) is based on the AFDC net

income test, which required the family's income to be less than the AFDC payment

standard plus deductions and disregards. Monthly deductions and disregards include $90

for work expenses, $175 per child under age 6 for child care expenses, and an earnings

disregard of $30 plus 1/3 of earnings in excess of $30. The IEL in the third column of

Table 1 is equal to the sum of the state payment standard plus those deductions and

disregards, expressed relative to the FPL.

         In many states, the post-expansion IEL is expressed explicitly in terms of the

FPL. In others, it can be derived from a formula that compares income to a payment

standard plus deductions and disregards. Several states effectively raised their income-

eligibility limits by implementing more generous earnings disregards. 4

         Table 1 shows that the AFDC-based pre-expansion IEL's in these 24 states

averaged 74 percent of the FPL. Their post-expansion IEL's averaged 115 percent of the

FPL. Based on the 2001 FPL of $14,630 for a family of three, this amounts to expanding

the eligibility limit from just under $11,000 to almost $17,000.



4
 Five states (Maryland, Nebraska, North Carolina, West Virginia, and Wyoming) changed their earnings
disregards in such a way that some families' eligibility limits may have risen, whereas others actually could
have fallen. We exclude states with such ambiguous expansions from the analysis.


                                                      7
        B. Previous Research

        Four previous studies have analyzed the effects of the parental eligibility

expansions. Because some of these analyses are limited to the broad parental eligibility

expansions that took place prior to 1996, their findings may not generalize to the more

recent expansions that were generally more moderate in size. Furthermore, none of the

previous analyses present results disaggregated by race or ethnicity. Nevertheless, it may

be useful to summarize their results here.

        Ku and Broaddus (2000) compare child Medicaid coverage in Hawaii, Oregon

and Tennessee to states that did not implement any expansion. They find that the states

with broad expansions experienced a 16 percentage point increase in child coverage from

1990 to 1998, compared to three percent in states that did not implement an expansion.

For parents, the authors found that Medicaid coverage increased four percentage points in

those states with broad expansions, but declined by eight percentage points in those

without an expans ion. However, since the authors provide no controls for other policies

that could affect Medicaid coverage, many of which changed between 1990 and 1998, it

seems unlikely that this analysis truly isolates the effects of the parental-eligibility

expansions.

        Lambrew (2001) examines the impact of more recent expansions on Medicaid

coverage among children and adults. Based on a cross-state comparison of three-year

state averages calculated from the March 1998 – March 2000 CPS, the results indicate

that tho se states that extended eligibility to parents above the poverty threshold have

nearly half the child uninsured rates of those states that had not extended parental

eligibility. However, if the expansion states differ from other states in other ways that




                                               8
affect Medicaid coverage, then cross-state comparisons may not identify the effects of

parental-eligibility expansions.

        Dubay and Kenney (2001) use the 1997 and 1999 waves of the National Survey

of American Families to estimate the impact of adult Medicaid expansions on child

Medicaid coverage in eleven states. The authors conduct two analyses, one comparing

coverage rates between states, and another comparing rates within the state of

Massachusetts before and after implementation of an expansion. In their cross-state

analysis, they compare child Medicaid coverage rates for 1999 in those states that had

expanded coverage by 1999 (nine states) with participation rates in those states that had

not (two states). Estimating linear probability models, the authors find 20 percent higher

coverage rates in those states with an expansion. Of course, this analysis is subject to the

same criticism as that of Lambrew (2001), which is that underlying state differences

related to the decision to expand family coverage may be correlated with Medicaid

participation, thereby biasing the results. Likewise, in a single-state study, it is impossible

to isolate the effects of the policy change from the effects of state-specific unobservable

that are correlated with both the policy change and coverage rates.

        Most recently, Duchovny and Busch (2002) employ a state fixed-effects approach

to compare adult insurance coverage in 21 states that expanded parental eligibility to at

least 100 percent of the FPL to coverage in the remaining states. They report that such

expansions increased adult coverage by about 3 percentage points. As discussed above,

the state fixed-effects approach identifies the effects of the parental eligibility expansions

only if any unobservable influences that may be correlated with state policy choices are

time- invariant.




                                               9
III. Empirical Approach

        An important difference between the approach we adopt here and the approach

adopted by others is that we include only expansion states in our analysis. Comparing the

target and below-target groups within expansion states allows us to relax the assumption,

implicit in the state fixed-effects approach, that the unobservable determinants of state

policy choices are time- invariant. As a result, out approach provides more general

controls for potential policy endogeneity.

        Our empirical model can be written as

Cist = β1Tist + β 2 X st + β 3Tist X st + Z istγ + α st + ε ist                       (1)

The dependent variable Cist is a dummy indicating whether the ith sample member in the

sth state at time t has coverage, where coverage may mean Medicaid, private, or any

coverage, depending on the model. The variable Tist is the target-group dummy, which is

equal to one if the ith family's income exceeded the sth state's AFDC-related income

eligibility limit. In years prior to the expansion, the AFDC-related IEL is based on the

AFDC payment standard, deductions, and disregards in effect in year t. In years

following the expansion, the AFDC-related IEL is based on the value of those parameters

in the year prior to the expansion. The variable Xst is the expansion dummy, which is

equal to one in state s beginning with the year of the expansion. It is equal to zero in

years preceding the expansion. The term TistXst is an interaction between the target-group

dummy and the expansion dummy. The coefficient on this key interaction term provides

our estimate of the effect of the parental Medicaid expansions. The vector Zist represents

family characteristics, such as the mother's age, education, race, and number of children;

the age of her youngest child; and a dummy indicating whether she was recently



                                                  10
pregnant. The child regressions also include the child's age and a dummy for whether she

is an infant.

        The disturbance term consists of two components, ast and eist. The latter is an

idiosyncratic family-specific error term. The former, ast, is a term common to all families

within a particular state during year t. It represents the influence of all arbitrarily time-

varying characteristics of the state that could simultaneously affect coverage and the

timing of the state's parental-eligibility expansion. This includes other policy choices,

such as the timing and nature of the state's welfare reform plan, its Medicaid and SCHIP

eligibility rules for children, as well as other influences, such as the condition of the state

economy. Including dummy variables for each state-year cell in the regression models

provides implicit controls for all such factors. Because the estimates are based on

between- group differentials within expansion states in the context of a model that

controls for state and year effects, we refer to them as " within-state difference-in-

difference" estimates.

        In the presence of state-year dummy variables, the parameter associated with the

expansion dummy is not identified. Indeed, none of the effects of any variable that varies

only by state and year, such as welfare reform, the unemployment rate, or the generosity

of other state-sponsored health insurance programs, can be identified, since such

variables are collinear with the state-year dummies. This reveals why the state-year

dummies control for policy endogeneity: they control implicitly for all factors that vary at

the state level, regardless how they may vary over time.

        One possibility not accounted for by the model in equation (1) is that some factors

may have different effects on the target and below-target groups. Welfare reform is a




                                              11
particularly important example. Since families in the target group are generally income-

ineligible for welfare, welfare reform should have little direct effect on them. However,

given the important historical links between welfare and Medicaid coverage, one might

expect welfare reform to have important effects on the coverage of the below-target

group, whose members are income-eligible for welfare by construction.

        Failing to account for such a possibility could bias our results. To account for this

problem, we interact the target-group dummy with a welfare reform dummy as well as

the annual state unemployment rate and, in the child regressions, the income-eligibility

thresholds associated with the state's poverty-related Medicaid and SCHIP programs.

The welfare reform dummy is equal to one beginning with the year in which the state

implemented its TANF program; poverty-related Medicaid and SCHIP income-eligibility

thresholds are expressed relative to the FPL. We include these interactions in all the

regression models reported below.

IV. Data

        Data on insurance coverage are taken from the March CPS surveys administered

between 1995 and 2002. Because the surveys provide information regarding coverage in

the previous calendar year, the sample period extends effectively from 1994 to 2001. As

mentioned above, the CPS insurance coverage questions were changed in 1995. The

questions were reordered, question wording changed and questions on coverage through

“other health insurance plans” were added. 5 In addition, the sample frame was updated in

1995 (as it is every decade to reflect changes in the population distribution uncovered by

5
  Of particular relevance to this study, the question wording with respect to Medicaid coverage changed
from “during the previous year, were you covered by Medicaid?” prior to 1995 to “at any time during 1994,
were you covered by Medicaid, the government assistance program that pays for health care?” beginning in
1995. In addition, specific state program names for Medicaid were provided beginning in 1995 (eg:
MediCal in California, Medi-Kan in Kansas, etc).


                                                   12
the decennial census). How these changes affected estimates of health insurance

coverage has been explored elsewhere. Swartz (1997) finds no increases in the number

of people with Medicaid coverage between 1994 and 1995, increases in the number of

people with CHAMPUS/VA/Military coverage as well as employer-sponsored coverage,

despite declines in military personnel and increases in Medicaid caseloads as reported in

administrative data. As such, to maintain continuity and eliminate the possibility that

changes in the questionnaire might contribute to the estimated changes in coverage that

we attribute to the parental Medicaid expansions, we limit our study to analysis of CPS

data collected from 1995 to 2002.

         We limit our sample to mothers and children with family income below 200

percent of the FPL. This corresponds to the post-expansion IEL of the District of

Columbia, which provides the most generous parental Medicaid eligibility. 6

         Table 2 provides insurance coverage rates from our sample of low- income

families. For both mothers and children, we provide estimated coverage rates both before

and after the parental-eligibility expansions. We consider Medicaid coverage, private

coverage, and any coverage, defined as coverage from either Medicaid or a private plan.

         Panel A provides coverage rates for Medicaid. Before the eligibility expansions,

Medicaid covered 43.4 percent of mothers and 55.9 percent of children in the below-

target group, that is, in families with incomes below the AFDC-related IEL. The

difference in coverage is probably related to differences in eligibility. Before the parental


6
  We exclude from the sample families in which anyone receives SSI or "other government insurance"
which largely includes coverage through the military and Medicare. Coverage under both types is subject
to policy changes that are independent of the adult Medicaid expansions studied here but may have
occurred at roughly the same time. As such we exclude both categories so as better isolate the effect of the
adult Medicaid expansions.



                                                    13
eligibility expansions, coverage for mothers was generally limited to mothers receiving

welfare. In contrast, children could have been either welfare-eligible or eligible under the

poverty-related eligibility expansions.

         For mothers below the AFDC-related IEL, post-expansion coverage fell by 4.7

percentage points. Clearly, this decline cannot be attributed to the parental-eligibility

expansion per se. Some analysts have attributed the decline in Medicaid coverage

between 1995 and 1997 to the effects of welfare reform. This is consistent with a number

of studies showing that many former welfare recipients did not retain their Medicaid

coverage after they left the welfare rolls, even though some may have remained eligible

for Medicaid under the Transitional Medical Assistance program, which provided for up

to 12 months of Medicaid eligibility for families that lost welfare eligibility due to an

increase in earnings. 7 In contrast, child coverage changed very little.

         The difference in the post-expansion Medicaid coverage of mothers and their

children may have to do with differences in non-welfare eligibility between the two

groups. Virtually all the children in the below-target group would have been eligible for

Medicaid under the poverty-related expansions starting in the early 1990s, well before

welfare reform. Thus children leaving welfare could have retained Medicaid eligibility

fairly seamlessly, at least in principle. In contrast, non-welfare mothers would have

become eligible for Medicaid only after their state implemented parental-eligibility

expansions. In most states, the parental-eligibility expansions were put in place well after

welfare reform, which may have resulted in a period of non-eligibility for many of these

mothers.

7
 Low rates of take-up in the transitional Medicaid program is typically attributed to lack of familiarity
among former welfare recipients with the program and stringent financial reporting requirements (GAO-
02-679T).


                                                    14
       Among mothers in the target group, that is, among those with incomes above the

AFDC-related IEL, 8.7 percent had Medicaid coverage in the pre-expansion period. This

could reflect coverage during pregnancy or under the Medically Needy eligibility

category. Alternatively, it may reflect a type of measurement error. Medicaid eligibility

is determined on the basis of monthly income. Thus a family could be welfare-eligible

one month but leave the rolls the next month due to an earnings gain. However, the

Medicaid coverage variable in the CPS indicates whether the respondent was covered at

any time in the previous year. Likewise, the CPS provides a measure of annual income,

from which we construct a measure of average monthly income that we use to assign

families to the target or below-target groups. Some families could have been eligible for

part of the year, but have enough average monthly income over the year so as to appear

income- ineligible based on the income measure available in the CPS. Coverage among

children was substantially higher during the pre-expansion period, at 16.9 percent. Many

of the children in this group would have been eligible for Medicaid under the poverty-

related eligibility expansions.

       Medicaid coverage among mothers in the target group rose by 3 percentage

points, to 11.7 percent, after the parental-eligibility expansions were implemented.

Among target- group children, Medicaid coverage rose by 8.4 percentage points, to 25.3

percent. This contrasts with decreases in coverage among mothers and children in the

below-target group of 4.7 and 0.5 percentage points, respectively.

       A simple within-state difference-in-difference estimate of the effect of the

parental-eligibility expansions can be constructed by subtracting the change in coverage




                                            15
within the below-target group from the change in coverage within the target group. 8 The

resulting estimate suggests that the parental-eligibility expansions increased maternal

coverage by 7.7 percentage points and child coverage by 8.9 percentage points. Of

course, if factors such as welfare reform affected the target and below-target groups

differently, then this simple estimate may overstate the effects of the parental eligibility

expansions.

         Private coverage rates are presented in Panel B. Within the below-target group,

private coverage rose for both mothers and children. This is consistent with other reports

of increasing private coverage among low- income families during much of our sample

period (Broaddus, et al., 2002). Among target-group mothers, private coverage rose less;

among target-group children, it fell. Relative to the below-target groups, private maternal

coverage fell 3.5 percentage points and private child coverage fell by 4.8 percentage

points. In the absence of other influences that may have affected private coverage, this

would suggest that the parental-eligibility expansions were responsible for some

crowding-out of private coverage.

         Finally, Panel C presents rates of coverage from either private sources or

Medicaid. The simple within- state difference- in-difference estimates suggest that the

probability of having any coverage among both mothers and children rose by about 4

percentage points. As a whole, the difference- in-difference estimates in Table 2 suggest

that the parental-eligibility expansions increased insurance coverage by raising Medicaid

coverage while reducing private coverage by a lesser amount. Of course, these estimates

are valid only if the parental-eligibility expansions were the only factor influencing


8
  This is equivalent to the estimate that one would obtain by estimating equation (1) subject to the
constraint that ? = 0.


                                                     16
coverage differentials between the target and below-target groups. However, as we

argued above, welfare reform, the economy, and the implementation of SCHIP could

have affected insurance coverage differently between the two groups. In the next section,

we present estimates that control for such differences.

V. Results

        Table 3 presents results from the regression models discussed in section III. We

focus first on the results for mothers, presented in columns (1) through (3). The

coefficients on the target group dummy, presented in the first row, show that mothers in

the target group are less likely to receive Medicaid than their counterparts in the omitted

below-target group. They are much more likely to have private coverage and somewhat

more likely to have any coverage.

        The coefficients on the interaction between the target-group dummy and the post-

expansion dummy presented in the second row provide our regression estimates of the

effects of the parental-eligibility expansions. 9 On average, the expansions increased

maternal Medicaid coverage by a statistically significant 2.7 percentage points. At the

same time, the expansions reduced private maternal coverage by 1.3 percentage points,

although this crowd-out effect is insignificant. The increase in any maternal coverage

resulting from the parental eligibility expansions was 1.4 percentage points.

        The next row of Table 3 suggests why the regression estimate of the effect of the

parental-eligibility expansions on Medicaid coverage is smaller than the simple within-

state difference- in-difference estimate presented in Table 2. In column (1), the

coefficient on the interaction between the target-group dummy and the welfare reform

  Recall that the coefficient on the post-expansion dummy is not identified because the post-expansion
varies only by state and year.


                                                   17
dummy is positive and significant. Taken at face value, it indicates that welfare reform

raised Medicaid coverage within the target group, relative to the below-target group, by

5.9 percentage points. Put equivalently and more intuitively, it indicates that welfare

reform reduced Medicaid within the below-target group, relative to the target group, by

5.9 percentage points. Since the target-group was income- ineligible for welfare, and thus

unlikely to be directly affected by welfare reform, this estimate suggests that welfare

reform reduced maternal Medicaid coverage within the income-eligible population by

nearly 6 percentage points. This is roughly consistent with estimates from some welfare

reform experiments (Grogger, Karoly, and Klerman 2002, chapter 6).

        Accounting for the effect of welfare reform on the below-target group explains

why the estimate of the effect of the parental Medicaid expansions on maternal Medicaid

coverage is so much smaller than the simple within-state difference-in-difference

estimate in Table 2. The simple estimate attributes the entire post-expansion change in

between- group coverage differentials to the parental eligibility expansions. The

regression estimate attributes the decline in coverage within the below-target group to

welfare reform, and attributes only the net change in between-group coverage

differentials to the parental Medicaid expansions. 10

        In the next row of the table, the coefficients on the target group-unemployment

interaction indicates that the economy had similar effects on mothers in both the target

and below-target groups. Beyond that, the signs of the other coefficients in the model are



10
   We also fit models where we replaced the reform-target group interaction with an interaction between
the target-group dummy and the log of the state's welfare caseload. The idea is that the welfare caseload
may provide a more comprehensive measure of the effects of welfare reform than a single reform dummy,
since the caseload would subsume the effects of the heterogeneous reforms that were implemented across
the states. The estimated effects of the parental expansions from those alternative specifications were
similar to the estimates reported here.


                                                   18
generally in accord with what one might expect based on previous research. Compared

with college graduates (the omitted education group), less educated mothers and their

children are more likely to receive Medicaid and less likely to have private health

insurance. Compared with mothers over age 50, younger mothers are generally more

likely to receive Medicaid and less likely to have private coverage. Single mothers are

more likely to receive Medicaid and less likely to have private insurance than married

mothers. Within the population of families whose incomes are less than 200 percent of

the FPL, they are more likely to have any coverage than married mothers. Mothers with

smaller families are less likely to have Medicaid coverage or any coverage than mothers

with larger families. Black mothers are substantially more likely than whites to have

Medicaid coverage and less likely to have private coverage. On net, they are slightly but

significantly more likely to have any coverage. In contrast, Hispanic mothers are no

more likely than whites to have Medicaid coverage, but are substantially less likely to

have private coverage. As a result, they are less likely to have any coverage. Recently

pregnant mothers, defined as those with a child age zero or one, are more likely to have

Medicaid coverage, presumably because they qualify under the provisions for pregnant

women.

       Estimates for children are reported in columns (4) through (6) of Table 3. With

only a few exceptions, the estimates in the children's coverage regressions are

qualitatively similar to those in the maternal coverage regressions. Like their mothers,

children in the target group are less likely to have Medicaid coverage, more likely to have

private coverage, and more likely to have any coverage than children in the omitted

below-target group. The adult eligibility expansions increased children's Medicaid




                                            19
coverage, had insignificant crowd-out effects on private coverage, and raised any

coverage. The interactions between the target group dummy and the welfare reform

dummy are insignificant, suggesting that children were less affected by welfare reform

than their mothers. This is consistent with the availability of Medicaid coverage for

children under the poverty-related Medicaid expansions and with the data from Table 2,

which show little change in Medicaid coverage within the below-target group at the time

of the parental Medicaid expansions. Mother and family demographics have qualitatively

similar effects on maternal and child coverage, as a rule. Child coverage from all sources

falls with the child's age; infants are additionally likely to have Medicaid coverage,

probably the result of the eligibility provisions for pregnant women and their infants.

Neither the Medicaid nor CHIP income-eligibility have significantly different effects on

the coverage of children in the target group, relative to those in the below-target group.

        Despite the general qualitative similarities between the maternal and child

coverage results, there is an important quantitative difference. The estimated effects of

the parental eligibility expansions are greater for children than for their parents.

Although this potentially could be the result of disproportionate take-up among large

families, some analysis revealed that it resulted largely from inappropriately pooling the

data by race and ethnicity.

        Table 4 presents results disaggregated by race and ethnicity, where only the key

coefficients are shown in order to save space. 11 Once the sample is stratified, the effects

of the parental Medicaid expansions are more similar between mothers and their children.


11
   The unusual racial/ethnic distributions implicit in the sample sizes stem from the fact that we include
only expansion states in the sample. The presence of California and New York account for the relative
abundance of Hispanics; the near-absence of Southern states accounts for the relative dearth of blacks. We
have omitted a fourth "other race/ethnicity" group from Table 4 due to small sample sizes.


                                                   20
Some further analysis revealed that the differences that remain can be explained by the

fact that the expansions had larger effects on larger families, suggesting that take-up rates

were larger for families with more children.

       More importantly, disaggregating the sample by race and ethnicity reveals that the

effects of the parental Medicaid expansions vary importantly along these lines. The

expansions slightly reduced coverage of white mothers and slightly increased coverage of

white children. However, none of these effects are significant In contrast, the

expansions had substantial effects on both blacks and Hispanics.

       The parental eligibility expansions increased Medicaid coverage by nearly 7

percentage points among black mo thers and by nearly 8 percentage points among their

children. The likelihood of any insurance rose by 4.4 percentage points for mothers and

6.3 percentage points for children. Most of these estimates are at least marginally

significant, despite limited sample sizes.

       Among Hispanics, the parental eligibility expansions increased Medicaid

coverage by 4.8 percentage points among mothers and 6.7 percentage points among their

children. Both of these effects are significant at conventional levels. The parental

eligibility expansions increased the likelihood of any coverage by 4.2 percentage points

for mothers and 3 percentage points for children.

       Although it is beyond the scope of this paper to fully explain why these

differences arise, we offer one suggestion. In the pre-expansion period, 73.5 percent of

white mothers in the target group had private insurance coverage. Among black and

Hispanic mothers, the respective percentages were 65.3 and 49.4. To the extent that

demand for public coverage is increased by lack of private coverage, these pre-existing




                                               21
differences in private coverage may help explain the differential effects of the parental

Medicaid expansions.

       We can also calculate the extent to which the parental eligibility expansions

altered racial and ethnic disparities in insurance coverage. In the pre-expansion period,

81.2 percent of white mothers in the target group had some sort of insurance coverage.

Among black and Hispanic mothers, the corresponding percentages were 78.1 and 57.7.

On the basis of the estimates in column (3) of table 4, predicted post-expansion coverage

rates, assuming that the expansions were the only factor affecting insurance rates, would

have been 79.9 percent for whites, 82.5 percent for blacks, and 61.9 percent for

Hispanics. Thus by themselves, the parental Medicaid expansions would have closed the

black-white insurance gap among the target group entirely, and would have reduced the

white-Hispanic insurance gap from 23.5 percentage points to 18 percentage points.

       Among target- group children, pre-expansion insurance coverage rates were 83.9

percent for whites, 85.3 percent for blacks, and 69.9 percent for Hispanics. Ceteris

paribus predicted values for the post-expansion period, based on the estimates in column

(6) of table 4, are 86.4 percent for whites, 91.6 percent for blacks, and 72.9 percent for

Hispanics. Thus by themselves, the parental eligibility expansions would have further

expanded the white-black coverage gap among the target group in favor of blacks and

would have reduced the white-Hispanic gap slightly, from 14 percentage points to 13.5

percentage points.

VI. Conclusions

       Since the 1990s, many states have sought to expand eligibility for Medicaid to

poor parents who were not receiving welfare. Our results show modest increases in




                                             22
health insurance coverage as a result of the expansions. There also appear to be

considerable spillover effects with respect to insurance coverage among children of

newly eligible parents.

       Our results also show substantial differences in the effects of the parental

eligibility expansions by race. Whereas the expansions had little effect on whites, they

had significant and generally sizeable effects on blacks and Hispanics. As a result, the

expansions generally contribute to reducing racial differences in insurance coverage.

Among children, they expand the slight advantage faced by black children as compared

to whites.

       Whether the recent gains in coverage are likely to persist is not clear. Recent

growth in unemployment presumably would increase take-up, as newly jobless families

lose access to employer-provided coverage. At the same time, however, pressing fiscal

issues may lead the states to scale back their expansions or delay those that had been

planned for the future
