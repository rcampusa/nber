                                           ABSTRACT

The interplay between investors' demand and providers' incentives has shaped the evolution of
exchange-traded funds (ETFs). While early ETFs offered diversification at low cost, later ETFs
track niche portfolios and charge high fees. Strikingly, over their first five years, specialized ETFs
lose about 30% in risk-adjusted terms. This underperformance cannot be explained by high fees
or hedging demand. Rather, it is driven by the overvaluation of the underlying stocks. Overall,
providers appear to cater to investors' extrapolative beliefs by issuing specialized ETFs that track
attention-grabbing themes.

                                                        --John Bogle, Financial Times, March 15, 2015



1         Introduction

        The wide adoption of exchange-traded funds is often celebrated as the democratization
of investments (e.g., Novick, 2017).1 According to this view, thanks to ETFs, investors--no
matter how small--can now achieve portfolio diversification at a low cost as well as obtain
long and short exposure to a wide variety of investment styles without the intermediation
of expensive asset managers. However, this narrative may not accurately and completely
describe investors' experience with these products. In practice, the available supply of ETFs
results from the interplay of investor demand and the profit-maximizing incentives of ETF
providers. Some investors demand ETFs as inexpensive buy-and-hold portfolios, while others
may use them to speculate based on their beliefs--rational or not. Therefore, to assess the
merit of the greatest financial innovation of the last decades, we need to investigate how
providers respond to investor demand.
        The goal of this paper is to study the dynamics of financial innovation in the ETF industry
and their potential implications for product performance. Our evidence helps explain the
evolution of the ETF landscape and sheds new light on investors' experience with these
products. Overall, our findings suggest that the ETF industry has evolved along two separate
paths. Broad-based ETFs offer investors an opportunity to achieve diversification at a low
    1
    An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a pooled investment vehicle whose shares are traded on exchanges. In
2021, the assets managed by ETFs in the United States alone surpassed the $6 trillion mark, amounting to
about 18% of the total assets in U.S. investment companies. To date, over 3,400 ETFs have been launched,
covering a wide array of investments, from broad-based indexes like the S&P 500 to niche investment themes,
such as a trade war, cannabis, vegan products, work from home, and COVID-19 vaccines.

cost. Other, more expensive, specialized ETFs appear to cater to investor demand for
popular, yet overvalued, investment themes. As a result, their performance is on average
disappointing.
       Prior literature has already studied the dynamics of financial innovation, but the specific
nature of ETFs motivates a fresh look at these issues. For example, the providers of active
mutual funds, relying on the fact that managerial skill is not observable, tend to promote a
positive track record as a promise of good future performance (e.g., Jain and Wu, 2000). Also,
the sponsors of structured products exploit the opaqueness of these vehicles to tout their
high yields and shroud risks.2 However, ETFs are different from other financial products in
that their portfolios are transparent and the investment style is passive; hence, it does not
involve managerial skill. Therefore, previously studied competitive strategies may not be
relevant in this context.
       As a first approximation on the dynamics of innovation in the ETF market, Figure 1
provides a bird's eye view of the evolution of the ETF "species" over time. The left axis shows
the average annual fees that these products charge their investors, a proxy for their direct
cost. The color of the markers reflects the degree of product differentiation with respect to
the existing offering in the market. The first breed of ETFs that came into existence in 1993
tracked broad-based indexes and charged low fees. Over time, tighter competition in this
segment of the market has led to even lower fees. To preserve high margins, the response
of the ETF industry has been to launch higher priced breeds of ETFs that diverge from
existing products, focusing on more specialized indexes. The industry, therefore, appears
to have has progressed toward more differentiated products, and this evolution has allowed
incumbents and new entrants to remain profitable despite tougher competition.

and Thaler, 1991), fixed-income securities (Gennaioli, Shleifer, and Vishny, 2012; Greenwood and Hanson,
2013), mutual funds (Elton, Gruber, and Rentzler, 1989; Arteaga, Ciccotello, and Grant, 1998; Massa, 1998;
Khorana and Servaes, 1999; Cooper, Gulen, and Rau, 2005; Evans, 2010; Kostovetsky and Warner, 2020,
among others), and equity offerings (Baker and Wurgler, 2007).

    Our analysis has two main parts. In the first part, we propose that the dynamics of
competition in the ETF industry fit the framework of Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer (2016).
The authors model the behavior of suppliers in a market in which consumers have limited
attention. To attract consumers, firms can make different product attributes salient. As a
result, competition can occur along the price and quality dimensions. While in their model
the market converges to either a price-salient or a quality-salient equilibrium, to describe the
structure of the ETF industry, we extend the interpretation of this framework. We suggest
that the two equilibria can coexist and characterize different segments of the ETF industry.
Specifically, broad-based ETFs compete on price, while more specialized ETFs compete along
the quality dimension. We interpret quality as other salient product attributes, different from
price, that investors may find attractive.
    The empirical evidence is consistent with segmentation in the ETF industry correspond-
ing to the price-salient and quality-salient equilibria. Our sample consists of nearly all equity



                                                                3
ETFs that ever traded in the U.S. equity market. We classify as broad-based all ETFs that
track broad market indexes, i.e., the broad-index and smart-beta categories in Figure 1.
These two groups differ only in that the latter adopts portfolio weights different from mar-
ket capitalization. We classify as specialized the ETFs that invest in a specific sector or in
sectors that are tied by a theme, i.e., the sector and thematic categories in Figure 1. As of
December 2019, specialized ETFs managed 18% of the industry's assets, yet they generated
about 36% of the industry's fee revenues. In the market for broad-based products, ETFs
hold large portfolios and compete on price by offering similar portfolios at a low cost. In the
specialized segment, ETFs hold small and differentiated portfolios and charge higher fees.
   Providing further support for the conjecture of a segmented market, we find a marked
difference in the sensitivity of investor demand to the cost of holding the ETF for the two
groups of products. Specifically, flows to broad-based ETFs display a significantly higher
sensitivity to fees, whereas flows to specialized ETFs are unrelated to fees and respond more
strongly to past performance. Moreover, high media exposure of the stocks in an ETF
portfolio reduces the sensitivity of flows to fees, suggesting that investors neglect price when
their attention is drawn to other product attributes.
   In the second part of our analysis, we study what makes specialized ETFs attractive to
investors, that is, we investigate the quality of specialized ETFs. The first obvious candidate
is that ETF providers are able to identify sectors and themes that deliver positive risk-
adjusted returns and issue products that track them.
   Our tests show that this is not the case. In fact, we find that the performance of special-
ized ETFs is disappointing in terms of both raw and risk-adjusted returns. A portfolio of all
specialized ETFs achieves risk-adjusted returns of -3.1% per year, after fees. This underper-
formance is due mostly to recently launched specialized ETFs, which grossly underperform:
about -6% annually in the first five years after inception. In comparison, the performance of
broad-based ETFs is slightly negative, though statistically indistinguishable from zero. The
underperformance of specialized ETFs is not explained by their higher fees, as it persists in


                                               4
terms of gross returns. The absolute size of the underperformance of specialized ETFs is
nonnegligible in dollar terms given that the assets in these funds are sizeable--about $460
billion at the end of our sample. Figure 2 illustrates this result.

Figure 2. Performance of ETFs Around Launch
The figure shows the performance of ETFs around launch, split by groups of broad-based and specialized
ETFs. We form 60 calendar-time portfolios that include returns of ETFs in their month +1, +2, . . . , +60
since the launch date (month 0). The portfolio returns are value-weighted using one-month-lagged market
capitalization. To adjust returns for risk factors, we estimate the Fama-French-Carhart four-factor model
(FFC-4) alphas of the portfolios (Fama and French, 1993; Carhart, 1997). The lines represent cumulative
FFC-4 alphas, and the shaded areas represent 95% confidence intervals.

   Given this evidence, we test a second alternative: specialized ETFs serve as a hedging
tool against risks to which investors are exposed. More broadly, this explanation relates to
the view of financial innovation as a means to achieve market completion and enable risk
sharing (Allen and Gale, 1994; Duffie and Rahi, 1995). While, in principle, ETFs can be
replicated using the underlying assets, they reduce transaction and search costs for a large
swath of investors.
   We do not find evidence consistent with such an insurance motive. The portfolio of stocks
that are most negatively correlated with the portfolio of all specialized ETFs does not earn
positive abnormal returns, which should be the case if it were a risk factor of hedging con-
cern. Importantly, while an insurance motive predicts that investors are willing to sacrifice


                                                                                          5
performance for hedging purposes, specialized ETFs are more likely to experience capital
outflows over their existence, which suggests instead that investors are disappointed by the
poor performance. Moreover, this finding makes a related explanation unlikely, i.e., that in-
vestors accept the underperformance of specialized ETFs because they obtain nonpecuniary
benefits from exposure to themes complying with their values (e.g., environmental, social,
and corporate governance (ESG) and faith-compliant ETFs). Also indicative of a souring
mood around these investment themes after the launch, we document that stocks that are
included in specialized ETFs experience a steep drop in their media sentiment right after
the time of launch, relative to the prelaunch period.
       The final hypothesis is that specialized ETFs cater to investor sentiment (akin to closed-
end funds in Lee, Shleifer, and Thaler, 1991).3 We conjecture that issuers of specialized
ETFs identify the popular trends in the market and respond to that demand by issuing
products that track these trends. However, by the time new ETFs enter the market, the
securities in which they invest have reached their valuation peak. Thus, specialized ETFs
underperform after launch. According to this hypothesis, specialized ETFs are chosen as a
speculative vehicle by investors who extrapolate past performance into the future.
       Our findings are consistent with this interpretation. Newly launched specialized ETFs
hold portfolios of securities in attention-grabbing segments of the market: These are stocks
that experienced recent price run-ups, had recent media exposure (especially positive ex-
posure), had more positive earnings surprises, and displayed general traits that have been
previously shown to indicate overvaluation (high market-to-book and high short interest).
We also find evidence of catering to preferences for gambling (Brunnermeier and Parker,
2005; Brunnermeier, Gollier, and Parker, 2007; Mitton and Vorkink, 2007; Barberis and
   3
    In line with the literature, we interpret sentiment as the component of expectations about future asset
returns not warranted by fundamentals (e.g., De Long, Shleifer, Summers, and Waldmann, 1990a). Lee et al.
(1991) find that new closed-end funds are started when the sentiment for the respective asset class is positive.
More recently, catering to investor sentiment appears to drive the launch of structured products (C´     el´
                                                                                                           erier
and Vall´ee, 2017; Henderson et al., 2020; Vokata, 2021) and mutual funds' dividend distributions (Harris,
Hartzmark, and Solomon, 2015). More generally, catering to sentiment characterizes different aspects of the
interaction between firms and investors (Baker and Wurgler, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2007; Baker, Greenwood, and

Huang, 2008; Kumar, 2009): Specialized ETFs contain securities with relatively more pos-
itively skewed returns. Moreover, the investor clientele of specialized ETFs has a greater
fraction of retail investors, who are typically considered less sophisticated and, therefore,
more prone to holding incorrect beliefs and engaging in positive feedback trading (De Long,
Shleifer, Summers, and Waldmann, 1990b). Relatedly, specialized ETFs are very popular
among Robinhood investors, who have become famous in recent years for being prone to
investment frenzies (Barber, Huang, Odean, and Schwarz, 2020).
       We find additional evidence indicating that specialized ETFs target investors' extrap-
olative beliefs, i.e., the tendency to expect recent performance of an asset to continue into
the future, or to their diagnostic expectations, which lead to overweighting of the best-case
scenario.4 Specifically, after the launch of specialized ETFs, analysts' long-term growth ex-
pectations for the underlying securities prove to be too optimistic, and they constantly revise
downward their bullish forecasts.
       Overall, our results suggest a new narrative for the evolution of the most transformative
financial innovation of the last three decades. The early ETFs, which are broad-based
products, are beneficial investment platforms, as they reduce transaction costs and provide
diversification.5 Specialized ETFs ride the same wave of financial innovation, but they mainly
compete for the attention of performance-chasing investors. Consequently, specialized ETFs,
on average, have generated disappointing performance for their investors.
       Our work relates to a few recent studies. Easley, Michayluk, O'Hara, and Putni¸
                                                                                     n s (2018)
propose that ETFs with a narrow focus are used as alpha-generating building blocks for active
strategies. As such, they contribute positively to price formation, reducing mispricing. Our
results, instead, suggest that specialized ETFs are not randomly launched, but rather issued

     See models and studies of extrapolative beliefs in Barberis and Shleifer (2003), Greenwood and Shleifer
(2014), Barberis, Greenwood, Jin, and Shleifer (2018), and Da, Huang, and Jin (2020). Egan, MacKay, and
Yang (2019) recover expectations of leveraged ETF investors and show that these beliefs are consistent with
extrapolative expectations. See models and studies of diagnostic expectations in Bordalo, Gennaioli, and
Shleifer (2018) and Bordalo, Gennaioli, La Porta, and Shleifer (2019)

     An important way in which broad-based ETFs reduce transaction costs is by being more tax-efficient
than mutual funds (Moussawi, Shen, and Velthuis, 2020).



                                                     7
in overvalued corners of the market and return negative alphas. Thus, they can, in principle,
contribute to overvaluation if they attract a new layer of investor demand to the underlying
securities (see Ben-David, Franzoni, and Moussawi, 2018). In later work, Akey, Robertson,
and Simutin (2021) confirm that less diversified ETFs underperform major benchmarks.
Huang, Song, and Xiang (2020) focus on smart-beta ETFs and show that their providers
overfit index weights in a way that generates in-sample alpha but does not produce abnormal
performance after launch. Different from that study, we focus on specialized ETFs and find
that they yield negative alphas after launch as a result of investing in securities that tend to
be overvalued. Our description of financial innovation via ETFs resonates with the model
of Simsek (2013a,b), in which new financial products are used for both risk sharing and
speculation. In the case of ETFs, it appears that broad-based products are primarily geared
toward the risk-sharing goal, while specialized ETFs are catering to speculative behavior.



2     Testable Conjectures

    The ETF market has grown substantially since the introduction of the first ETF in
the early 1990s. In the United States alone, over 3,400 exchange-traded funds have been
launched; of these, more than 1,000 invest in U.S. equities. Equity ETFs differ in the
breadth of their holdings--ranging from a few stocks to over 3,000 stocks--and in the fees
they charge--ranging from 4 basis points (bps) to over 150 bps per year.
    This paper aims to identify the main competitive strategies adopted by the ETF industry
along this path of extraordinary growth and, in particular, the features that have made these
products successful among investors. The evidence in Figure 1 suggests that the market is
segmented into low-cost, broad-based products and more expensive, highly differentiated
ETFs.




                                               8
2.1       Price Competition versus Quality Competition

       The model of industrial organization by Bordalo et al. (2016) provides a fitting framework
to describe the evolution and the current structure of the ETF industry.6 This theory
suggests that producers, facing consumers with limited attention, choose to compete on either
of two dimensions, price or quality. For example, Walmart sells cheap commoditizied goods,
while Starbucks emphasizes product quality and charges high prices. As a consequence,
a market can gravitate around either (i) a price-salient equilibrium in which products are
commoditized and firms compete by offering low prices or (ii) a quality-salient equilibrium in
which prices are high and firms differentiate themselves by offering distinct product features.
       While the theory predicts that one of these equilibria will emerge in a given market,
we extend this interpretation by suggesting that the two equilibria can co-exist in different
segments of the same industry (e.g., airline industry). We apply the framework to the ETF
industry and conjecture that the inexpensive and highly diversified ETFs are the commodi-
tized products that can be mapped into the price-salient equilibrium. This group of ETFs
allows investors to achieve market exposure and diversification at a low cost. In contrast, the
more expensive and specialized ETFs are part of the quality-salient equilibrium. Investors
who buy these ETFs are willing to overlook the high fees or loss of diversification as long as
they can gain exposure to their desired investment themes. In this segment of the market,
ETF issuers attract investor attention by designing products that lead investors to expect
high utility and to neglect their expensive price tag.


2.2       The Nature of Quality Competition

       In mapping the Bordalo et al. (2016) model to the ETFs market, it is crucial to understand
the nature of "quality competition." Specifically, what is the value proposition that investors
find attractive and that allows providers to charge high fees? After all, the specialized

segment of the market accounts for 36% of the industry's revenues at the end of our sample
period, despite managing only 18% of the assets.
   We next formulate conjectures on the unique features that make specialized ETFs ap-
pealing to investors. In particular, we consider three potential explanations to describe the
nature of quality competition.


2.2.1    Delivering Alpha?

   The first hypothesis is that specialized ETFs provide access to investment opportunities
that would be otherwise unattainable to investors because of information or transaction
costs.
   The resulting prediction is that specialized ETFs generate a positive alpha after fees. As
such, ETFs benefit investors by delivering higher risk-adjusted returns.


2.2.2    Providing Hedging Services?

   The second hypothesis is that investors use specialized ETFs for hedging some risks to
which they are exposed. In this light, specialized ETFs are beneficial as they enable risk
sharing among investors (Allen and Gale, 1994; Duffie and Rahi, 1995). Even though ETFs
replicate cash flow profiles of securities that already exist in the market, they increase the
accessibility of these portfolios to investors by reducing search and trading costs. Thus,
the variety of products coming to the market reflects the heterogeneity in investors' endow-
ments and in their need to insure against the risks associated with these endowments--i.e.,
their hedging demand. Viewed through this lens, the growth in the ETF market, including
the specialized segment, responds to investors' rational demand and is, therefore, welfare
improving.
   According to this hypothesis, investors hold specialized ETFs even if their performance
is negative because they provide insurance. Thus, we would expect investors not to aban-
don specialized ETFs following poor performance. The same prediction would emerge if


                                             10
specialized ETFs provided nonpecuniary benefits in the form of access to themes complying
with investors' values (e.g., ESG, faith-compliant ETFs). Moreover, if the risks for which
specialized ETFs provide hedging are systematic, a testable corollary of this hypothesis is
that the stocks that are exposed to these risks--i.e., they load positively on them--earn
positive risk-adjusted returns--i.e., a risk premium.


2.2.3      Catering to Investor Sentiment?

       A long literature cited in the introduction suggests that some financial innovators cater
to investor sentiment (e.g., Lee et al., 1991), which is broadly defined as the component of
expectations about future asset returns that are not warranted by fundamentals. Inspired
by this literature, our third hypothesis is that specialized ETFs cater to investors' optimistic
expectations about future stock performance.
       Thus, according to this hypothesis, new specialized ETFs are designed to appeal to in-
vestors' irrational beliefs.7 For example, some investors may suffer from representativeness
bias and they extrapolate past performance into the future (Greenwood and Shleifer, 2014;
Barberis et al., 2018; Cosemans and Frehen, 2021). Or they might have diagnostic expec-
tations (Bordalo et al., 2018, 2019), interpreting positive past performance as indicative of
the best possible future scenario. These investor audiences would be drawn, for instance, to
new ETFs that invest in past winners and stocks that delivered recent positive news.
       The catering hypothesis also implies that, if arbitrage is limited in the stock market,
high-sentiment stocks are likely to be overvalued (e.g., Miller, 1977; Shleifer and Vishny,
1997). As a result, securities held by specialized ETFs are overvalued at the time of launch
   7
    A related catering behavior has been documented for the mutual fund industry when, in the late 1990s,
mutual fund families changed the names of their products to attract flows of investors chasing popular
investment styles (Cooper et al., 2005).




                                                   11
and their post-launch alpha would be negative.8



3         Data

3.1        Data Sources

        We use data on ETFs traded in the U.S. market from the Center for Research in Security
Prices (CRSP) between 1993 and 2019. We restrict our sample to equity-focused ETFs
that hold U.S. stocks in their portfolios. This choice allows us to more closely benchmark
the ETF portfolios to broad-based U.S. stock indexes. Therefore, we exclude ETFs that
are classified as non-equity, foreign equity, inverse and/or leveraged, and active. The final
sample contains 1,080 U.S. equity ETFs. Appendix A introduces the mechanics of ETFs.
We provide detailed data sources in Appendix B and variable descriptions in Appendix C.
        We compute ETFs' portfolio holdings by combining the Thomson Reuters Global Mutual
Fund Ownership and the CRSP Mutual Fund Holdings databases. We start with the data
set that includes holdings information on the earliest date (closest to the launch date). We
then use the other data set to complement missing data. We use Bloomberg and Morningstar
Direct as guides for classifying ETFs, as described below.
        In addition, we use stock-level data from additional sources: market data from CRSP,
short interest from Compustat, analyst expectations from I/B/E/S, firm-level news from
RavenPack News Analytics, 13F institutional ownership data from Thomson Reuters, and
Robinhood user data from Robintrack.
    8
     Simsek's (2013b) theory provides additional theoretical background for our third hypothesis. In his
model, based on investor disagreement, financial products are used both by investors seeking risk sharing and
by those with diverging beliefs interested in speculation. Financial innovators, to maximize their revenues,
offer products for which the speculation motive is strongest. Therefore, this theory provides a rationalization
for the two segments of the ETF market, where broad-based products are primarily geared toward the risk-
sharing goal, while specialized ETFs are designed for speculators.




                                                      12
3.2       Classification of ETFs

       To analyze the evolution and motives behind the launch of new ETF products, we classify
ETFs in two steps. First, we classify ETFs into four groups based on their investment
objective (as was presented in Figure 1). The thematic group comprises ETFs that, according
to Bloomberg and CRSP, track multiple industries that are tied by a "theme" (e.g., clean
energy). If ETFs track a single industry, they belong to the sector category.9 Smart-beta
ETFs are identified using the Strategic Beta field in Morningstar. Finally, we identify as
broad-index those ETFs for which the Morningstar category Index Selection variable has
the value M arket Capitalization and that are not smart beta funds.10 We do not create
a separate category for ETF products specializing in environmental, social, and corporate
governance topics (ESG) because they cut across multiple ETF classes with different degrees
of diversification.11
       In the second step, we consolidate ETFs into two broader groups to facilitate the analysis
and presentation. We classify as broad-based ETFs all ETFs that track broad market indexes,
that is, the broad-index and smart-beta categories in Figure 1. The two types differ only
in that smart-beta ETFs do not use capitalization-based weights. We classify as specialized
ETFs those that invest in a specific sector or in sectors that are tied by a theme, that is,
sector and thematic categories in the figure.
       In most of our analysis, we start the sample in 2000, when sufficient variety in the ETF
   9
      Specifically, we reference the Bloomberg field F U N D IN DU ST RY F OCU S . Moreover, ETFs with a
CRSP Objective Code (CRSP OBJ CD variable) starting with EDS are classified as sector funds. Also,
those with Lipper Classification (LIP P ER CLASS variable) with value S are classified as thematic ETFs
if they track religious, artificial intelligence, clean energy, or gender themes, and as sector ETFs otherwise.
   10
      For the remaining equity ETFs, we rely on the variable LIP P ER CLASS in CRSP to classify funds as
either broad-index or smart-beta. LIP P ER CLASS values of LCV E , M CV E , M LV E , SCV E , LCGE ,
M CGE , M LGE , or SCGE ; alternative funds; and funds that include factors in their names (e.g., value,
growth, momentum, quality, sentiment, low volatility, dividends, earnings, profitability, alpha, multifactor,
equal-weighted) are classified as smart-beta ETFs. We drop actively managed ETFs and ETFs with industry
exclusions (e.g., S&P 500 ex-Technology ETF) from the list. The remaining funds are classified as broad-
index ETFs.
   11
      In particular, ESG ETFs are classified as specialized if they are sector ETFs according to the CRSP
classification codes (e.g., ALPS Clean Energy ETF). The remaining ESG ETFs, which are more diversified
products (e.g., iShares ESG Screened S&P 500 ETF), are included in the broad-based category.

offering allows for a meaningful classification, and end it in 2019. This sample contains 554
broad-based ETFs (90 broad-index and 464 smart beta ETFs) and 526 specialized ETFs
(411 sector and 115 thematic ETFs).

                  Panel (a) of Figure 3 shows that the assets managed by broad-based ETFs have grown
exponentially over the years, whereas the growth of the assets in specialized ETFs is less
striking. By the end of 2019, broad-based ETFs accounted for about 82% of the assets


                                                                              14
invested in equity-based ETFs, and specialized ETFs accounted for the remaining 18%.
Despite their relatively small market share, specialized ETFs at the end of the sample ac-
counted for about 36% of the industry's revenues, and broad-based ETFs generate 64% of it
(Panel (b)). The disproportionate share of revenues of specialized ETFs is due to the higher
fees that they charge on average (Table 1). Over the entire sample period, broad-based and
specialized ETFs generated cumulative revenues of $22.6bn and $14.6bn, respectively.
   Panels (c) and (d) of Figure 3 present the time series of ETF launches and closures. In
the early years, most newly launched ETFs were broad-based. A large batch of specialized
ETFs was launched in 2006, and another in 2011. Interestingly, the rate of ETF closures is
more pronounced for specialized ETFs.
   In Table 1, we present summary statistics for our sample of ETFs. Specialized ETFs hold
portfolios with fewer stocks than broad-based ETFs do: The median broad-based ETF holds
247 stocks, while the median specialized ETF holds 53 stocks. Broad-based ETFs charge
lower fees than specialized ETFs (medians of 35 versus 58 basis points, respectively).12
   There are other marked differences between the two groups of ETFs. Specialized ETFs
generate more volatile returns than do broad-based ETFs. Furthermore, turnover is ma-
terially higher for specialized ETFs, reflecting a different use of these products by their
investors relative to broad-based ETFs. Appendix Table D.1 breaks the two groups into the
four categories of ETFs and provides summary statistics.




 12
    The apparent discrepancy between the means of fees reported in Table 1 and Figure 1 is because the
mean is equally weighted in Table 1 but AUM-weighted in Figure 1.

Table 1. ETF Summary Statistics
The table shows summary statistics at the ETF level. Panel A reports summary statistics for broad-based
ETFs, and Panel B reports summary statistics for specialized ETFs. Number of holdings represents the
average number of stocks in the portfolios of ETFs. Fee refers to the annualized expense ratio. Turnover
is the average daily turnover over the six months after launch. Market-adjusted return is the monthly ETF
return in excess of the CRSP value-weighted return over the 60 months after launch. Delisted is an indicator
for whether the ETF was liquidated as of the end of 2019. Assets under management (AUM) is the total
market value of the investments in 2019. Implied revenues are calculated by multiplying fees by AUM in
2019.

4     Empirical Analysis: Segmentation in the ETF Space

    We begin our empirical examination by studying the joint distribution of fees and spe-
cialization.


4.1     Segmentation Along the Fee and Diversification Dimensions

    Several pieces of evidence support the view of a market segmented into price- and quality-
salient equilibria. First, in Figure 4, we plot ETF fees against product differentiation at two
points in time: close to the birth of the industry (2002) and toward the end of our sample



                                                    16
(2019).13 The figure shows that two clusters of products have emerged over time. Broad-
based ETFs, the early comers to the market, tend to charge lower fees and appear to be
more similar to one another. Specialized products, which proliferate in the late sample, are
more differentiated and expensive.

Figure 4. Segmentation in the ETF Market
The figure presents the ETF market configuration at two points in time. Panel (a) shows a snapshot as of
December 2002, and Panel (b) shows a snapshot as of December 2019. Product differentiation is computed
for each category as one minus the cosine similarity between the ETF portfolio weights and the weights of
the portfolio of all ETFs in that category that exist in the market at that point in time. The panels show the
universe of ETFs at each date, on two dimensions: product differentiation and fees. Each circle represents
one ETF, and the size of the circles represents relative share of assets under management across all ETFs.
Blue circles represent broad-based ETFs, and red circles represent specialized ETFs.

       In Appendix Table D.2, we show that the difference in fees between broad-based and
specialized ETFs is statistically significant, even controlling for time and management com-
pany fixed effects. The latter set of controls allows us to rule out the possibility that the
difference in fees results from different pricing power of different providers, for example due
to their brand recognition. Even within the same provider, specialized products are priced
significantly higher.
       Based on the size of the circles in Figure 4, which is proportional to the ETF's AUM,
  13
    Product differentiation is computed for each category as one minus the cosine similarity between the
ETF portfolio weights and the weights of the aggregate portfolio of all ETFs in that category that exist
in the market at that point in time. Kostovetsky and Warner (2020) develop an alternative measure of
product differentiation for active mutual funds using textual analysis of the fund prospectus. They show
that despite differentiation in strategy description, mutual fund holdings are similar. Likewise, we find that
some portfolios that are marketed as differentiated products have almost identical holdings. A noticeable
example are the ETFs offering investments based on religious or political values. Most of these ETFs hold
portfolios that are very similar to broad-based indexes, but charge high fees.


                                                                 17
we also conclude that the broad-based segment of the market is more concentrated. This
is probably a consequence of price competition leading to a winner-takes-all equilibrium.
In the specialized segment, multiple differentiated products with smaller portfolio sizes can
charge higher fees and survive, leading to lower concentration. Interestingly, the distribution
of revenues generated by broad-based ETFs largely matches that of specialized ETFs, as
can be seen in Table 1. For example, as of 2019, the median annual fee revenue was nearly
$1m in each group and the revenues at the 75th percentile were above $5m and $4m for
broad-based and specialized ETFs, respectively. The main difference between the groups
is in the extreme right tail, where the large broad-based ETFs (like State Street's SPDR
tracking the S&P 500 index) generate higher revenues due to their sheer portfolio size.
   At the level of providers, the concentration also differs markedly between the two sets
of products. Appendix Table D.3 reports that the concentration among providers declines
uniformly across the four categories depicted in Figure 1. Finally, the Venn diagram in
Appendix Figure D.1 shows that while a significant fraction of providers (41%) operate in
both segments of the market, nonnegligible shares of asset managers offer only broad-based
(37%) or specialized (23%) ETFs.
   In sum, the dynamics of competition in the ETF market appear to differ markedly in
the broad-based and specialized segments. In the broad-based segment, a small number of
issuers benefit from economies of scale, which allows them to spread the costs across a bigger
customer base--e.g., the costs of data licensing. Thus, they can charge lower fees. At the
same time, due to their large clientele, broad-based ETFs are a catalyst of significant trading
volume, which constitutes a source of liquidity that investors value (Khomyn, Putni¸
                                                                                   n s, and
Zoican, 2020). The large scale creates barriers to entry for new contenders. On the other
hand, for specialized ETFs, fees decline only slightly (see Figure 1), even though the supply
of specialized products increases substantially over time. These products are very differenti-
ated, so new entrants do not directly compete with the incumbents, preserving some of the
monopolistic rents.


                                              18
4.2       Segmentation of Investor Demand

       Next, we more directly investigate the conjecture that a price-salient and quality-salient
equilibria characterize different segments of the ETF industry. To this purpose, Table 2
presents an analysis of the product features that attract investor demand. We report es-
timates from regressions of monthly capital flows into each ETF, a proxy for demand, on
product characteristics. In particular, we focus on fees, as a measure of price, and on past
returns, which approximate expected returns for investors with extrapolative beliefs and, in
this sense, are a measure of quality.
       The results in Panel A suggest that investors pay more attention to price when trading
broad-based ETFs than specialized products, as the sensitivity to fees is significantly more
negative in the former products. In the late sample (2010­2019), when the bulk of specialized
ETFs are present in the market, specialized ETFs' sensitivity to fees is indistinguishable from
zero providing clear evidence in support of a quality-salient equilibrium in which consumers
disregard price.14 To address the issue that fees are fairly constant over the life of an ETF
while flows vary considerably, Appendix Table D.4 reports estimates from a regression of
cumulative flows over one- or two-year windows after the launch of the ETF onto average
fees in the same window. The result that investors in specialized ETFs are significantly less
sensitive to fees remains unchanged.
       In Panel B of Table 2, we study how the salience of an ETF in investors' perception,
proxied by media attention to the stocks in its portfolio, modifies investors' response to
different product attributes. Again, the evidence suggests that two separate equilibria prevail
in the industry. The investors in ETFs holding stocks that attract the most attention are
almost insensitive to price and, instead, care mostly about past performance. As we show
below, media attention is highest for the stocks in specialized ETFs.
  14
     An additional reason for investors in specialized ETFs to overlook the high fees is their higher turnover
in these products, i.e., shorter holding period, relative to broad-based ETFs (see Table 1). If investors expect
a high return in the short run for specialized ETFs, then fees can be disregarded as they will only be born
for a limited time.

Table 2. ETF Flow Sensitivity to Fees and Past Performance
The table presents the flow sensitivity of ETFs to their fees and past performance. Panel A compares flow
sensitivity between broad-based and specialized ETFs. Panel B compares flow sensitivity between ETFs that
recently received high media attention and those that recently received low media attention. The dependent
variable is ETF flows in month t + 1, computed as 100 × (AUMt+1 - AUMt × ETF returnt+1 )/AUMt . In
each month t, we calculate the percentile rank of ETF returns. Specialized is a dummy variable that equals
1 if an ETF is a specialized ETF. High media is a dummy variable that equals 1 if the AUM-weighted media
sentiment of an ETF's underlying securities computed in month t ranks in the top 20%. AUM is an ETF's
assets under management ($million) in month t, and Age is an ETF's age in months. Standard errors are
clustered at the ETF and the calendar-month levels. t -statistics are reported in parentheses. *, **, and ***
indicate significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

       Figure 5 provides a graphical representation of flow-performance sensitivity for broad-
based and specialized ETFs. In each month t, we compute next-period flows as 100 ×
(AUMt+1 - AUMt × ETF returnt+1 )/AUMt . Then, we estimate a nonparametric relation be-
tween next-period flows and period-t raw returns using local polynomials approximations.15
       Consistent with the results in Table 2, the figure shows that the return-chasing behavior of
investors in broad-based ETF differs from that of investors in specialized ETFs. The results

    In Appendix Figure F.1, we replicate the analysis using either market-adjusted returns or percentile
rank of returns within month and category. The conclusions remain unchanged.

are consistent with performance-chasing in the ETF market, as documented in Dannhauser
and Pontiff (2019); however, here we find that the sensitivity of flows to past returns is
significantly higher for specialized ETFs, consistent with more attention to past performance
in this segment of the market.16
       One legitimate concern is that the difference in flow-performance sensitivity between the
two groups of ETFs could result from a difference in the horizons at which the clienteles for
the two types of products evaluate them. The monthly frequency in Figure 5 may be too
restrictive, e.g., it may not capture the behavior of investors who rebalance their portfolios
at lower frequencies. To address this concern, Appendix Figures F.2 and F.3 show that the
same pattern is present when we measure performance at the quarterly and annual frequency,
respectively.
  16
    One might interpret these results as consistent with an extended version of the Berk and Green (2004)
model, in which Bayesian investors learn about the risk-adjusted performance of the strategies underlying
specialized ETFs, and flows are the result of this inference. We consider this explanation to be unlikely
because, conditioning on the ETF launch, we find that specialized ETFs significantly underperform on
average (see Figure 2). This finding is inconsistent with rational learning in Berk and Green (2004), in which
flows (or ETF launch) do not predict future performance and certainly not negative performance.


                                                              21
5       The "Quality" of Specialized ETFs

      In contrast to the clear benefits to investors offered by broad-based ETFs, via facilitated
market access and low-cost diversification, the case for value creation by specialized ETFs
is less obvious. Given the high fees that investors are willing to pay to hold these products,
we investigate two conjectures that fall within the framework of rational investor behavior.
      The first possibility is that specialized ETFs deliver superior performance. Under this
conjecture, the rationale for investing in high-fee ETFs is simply to achieve positive risk-
adjusted returns (alphas). Specialized ETFs, therefore, would provide a low-cost tool for
accessing these investment ideas.
      The second possibility is that specialized ETFs create value by providing a hedging tool
against some risks that investors care about. In other words, these products might operate
like insurance policies. Hence, their risk-adjusted returns do not have to be positive, as long
as their performance insulates against risks that investors care about.


5.1      The Performance of Specialized ETFs

      To measure the performance of specialized ETFs, we use a calendar-time portfolios ap-
proach, a standard approach in the asset pricing literature. We form portfolios that sep-
arately hold the universes of broad-based and specialized products. The portfolios are re-
formed each month and are market-capitalization-weighted.17 Then, we regress the (net of
fees) returns of these portfolios in excess of the risk-free rate on commonly used risk factors,
as is customary in asset pricing studies.18
      In Panel A of Table 3, we present excess returns as well as the alphas from these
risk models. In general, specialized ETFs have negative performance across the different
specifications. Focusing on the Fama-French-Carhart four-factor model (Fama and French,
 17
   The results with equal-weighted portfolios are similar and are shown in Appendix Table E.1.
 18
   Risk factor returns are downloaded from Professor French's website: https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.
edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html and Professors Hou, Xue, and Zhang's website:
http://global-q.org/factors.html.



                                                22
1993; Carhart, 1997), specialized ETFs generate negative alphas of about -3.24% per year
(-0.27% × 12). Underperformance is smaller (but still negative) when using more elabo-
rate factor models. In comparison, using the same risk model, broad-based ETFs generate
negative alpha of about -0.48% a year (-0.04% × 12), which is closer to their average fees.
       Importantly, the relative underperformance of specialized ETFs cannot be accounted for
by the higher fees that they charge. The difference in annual fees between specialized and
broad-based ETFs is about 0.13% on average (see Table 1). Thus, the difference in alphas
of specialized and broad-based ETFs (about -2.9% per year for the four-factor model) is an
order of magnitude larger than the difference in fees between the two groups.
       To understand whether the observed underperformance of specialized ETFs crucially
hinges on the valuation of their portfolios at the time of launch, we focus next on recently
launched ETFs. In Panel B of Table 3, we form calendar-time portfolios that hold all the
ETFs in each of the two categories that were launched in the prior five years. The results
show that the underperformance of specialized ETFs is stronger in the years following their
launch. For example, the four-factor alpha is -6% per year (-0.50% × 12). The estimates
show also a stark underperformance of recently launched specialized ETFs relative to the
broad-based ones with a four-factor alpha difference of -0.36% per month. For completeness,
Appendix Table E.2 shows that, after the first five years, the risk-adjusted underperformance
of specialized ETFs is substantially reduced and statistically indistinguishable from zero.19
Nevertheless, this evidence raises questions about the timing of specialized ETF issuance,
which we address in the next section.
       Similar results are depicted in Figure 2 in the Introduction. Each point in the chart is
produced by one regression based on the four-factor model (Fama and French, 1993; Carhart,
1997). The alpha associated with month one, for example, is produced from a regression
on the performance of a portfolio that includes all the ETFs that are exactly one-month
  19
     We also verify that our results are not driven by ETFs that hold a majority of foreign stocks. In
Appendix Table E.3, we restrict the sample to ETFs for which at least 80% of their market capitalization
is invested in stocks traded in the United States. The results of the analysis are similar to those reported in
Table 3.


                                                      23
old; the alpha associated with month two is produced by a portfolio that comprises ETFs
that are exactly two months old. We repeat the process up to the 60-month life span. The
striking result is that, over the first five years of their life, specialized ETFs lose about 30%
on average in terms of risk-adjusted returns.

Table 3. Calendar-Time Portfolios of ETFs
The table presents the risk-adjusted performance of ETFs from 2000 to 2019. In Panel A, we form portfolios
consisting of all ETFs in the same category. In Panel B, we identify new ETFs that were launched in the
previous five years in each month. We then form portfolios consisting of all new ETFs in the same category.
The portfolio returns are value-weighted using one-month-lagged market capitalization. Excess return refers
to the average monthly return in excess of the risk-free rate. CAPM, FF3, FFC4, FF5, FF6, and Q alpha
denote alphas with respect to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (Sharpe, 1964; Lintner, 1965; Mossin, 1966),
the Fama-French three-factor model (Fama and French, 1993), the Fama-French-Carhart four-factor model
(Carhart, 1997), the Fama-French five-factor model (Fama and French, 2015), the Fama-French six-factor
model (Fama and French, 2018), and the Q-factor model (Hou et al., 2015), respectively. The portfolios of all
broad-based (specialized) ETFs comprise 171 (189) ETFs on average. SP minus BB denotes the specialized
ETF portfolio minus the broad-based ETF portfolio. The excess return and alphas are in percentage points,
and t -statistics are reported in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1%
levels, respectively.

    The underperformance of specialized ETFs is robust to using other intuitive approaches
to define this group. Appendix Table E.4 shows that the evidence in Table 3 is confirmed
when we identify specialized products using heterogeneity along the investment strategy
(i.e., active share), the portfolio size (i.e., number of holdings), and the cost dimensions. In
particular, for this analysis, we define specialized ETFs as those with either a large active

                                                     24
share, or a small number of portfolio holdings, or those charging high fees. Finally, Appendix
Table E.5 shows that both categories in the specialized segment, sector and thematic ETFs,
display significant underperformance.
       To summarize, this analysis suggests that specialized ETFs generate an economically and
statistically significant negative alpha in the order of magnitude of -6% a year in the first
five years of their existence. As such, they do not create value for their investors by providing
outperforming investment strategies. Consequently, the combination of underperformance,
high fees, and lack of diversification of these products remains a puzzle. For this reason, we
entertain more closely the hypothesis that specialized ETFs provide insurance against some
underlying risks that investors care about.


5.2       Are Specialized ETFs Used for Hedging Purposes?

       To explain investors' demand for specialized ETFs in spite of their underperformance, we
investigate whether these products deliver value as a form of insurance. Specialized ETFs
might serve as a hedging tool for aggregate risks, in which case their underperformance is
a negative risk premium, or for idiosyncratic risks to which some subsets of investors are
exposed. A related conjecture is that specialized ETFs generate nonpecuniary benefits by
being compliant with investors' values.


5.2.1      Is the Underperformance a Hedging Premium?

       It is possible that our earlier tests fail to capture some unobserved risk factors that
investors care about, and that specialized ETFs might be the right vehicle that allows these
investors to hedge against these unobserved risk factors. For this reason, investors are willing
to accept lower returns.20
  20
    The hedging motive we discuss here is different from the specific notion that arbitrageurs use industry
ETFs as hedging tools within long-short strategies (Huang, O'Hara, and Zhong, 2020). More broadly, our
notion of hedging refers to the interpretation of financial innovation as a tool to improve risk sharing among
investors (Allen and Gale, 1994).




                                                     25
    A testable implication of this conjecture is that the performance of specialized ETFs has
a negative correlation with a portfolio of assets that investors dislike, i.e., a portfolio that
earns a positive risk premium. We emphasize that in the current analysis we are looking for
a risk factor that accounts for the evidence of negative average performance of the portfolio
of all specialized ETFs. It remains possible that different specialized ETFs serve as hedging
tool for different groups of investors, a possibility that we entertain later on in the analysis.
    To test this prediction, we construct a portfolio of stocks that have negative correlation
with the portfolio of all specialized ETFs. In particular, each month, we form five portfolios
of stocks sorted on their betas on the specialized-ETF factor, constructed as the excess
return of the market-capitalization-weighted portfolio of specialized ETFs.21 Portfolio 1 has
the stocks with the lowest correlation with the aggregate specialized ETF portfolio, and
portfolio 5 has the highest correlation.
    Our test results, shown in Table 4, indicate no support for the conjecture that specialized
ETFs provide hedging for an underlying risk factor. The table reports the alphas from
regressions of these portfolios' returns on different factor models. In no specification are the
alphas of low-specialized-beta stocks consistent with a positive risk premium.


5.2.2    Capital Allocation Over the Life Cycle

    Failing to find an aggregate risk factor of hedging concern points to the lack of a systematic
insurance motive behind the portfolio of all specialized ETFs. However, it is still possible
that different specialized ETFs provide insurance for different idiosyncratic risks. For this
reason, investors may still be willing to hold specialized ETFs in spite of their negative
risk-adjusted returns.22
  21
     The beta is estimated using 60-month rolling-window regressions, requiring each stock to have at least
36 months of available return observations. In these regressions, we control for the market factor. Then, we
form five portfolios corresponding to the quintiles of the estimated betas on the specialized-ETF factor based
on the breakpoints of the distribution of NYSE-listed stocks, to avoid giving disproportionate influence to
smaller stocks listed on other exchanges (Fama and French, 1992).
  22
     This story, however, does not explain why specialized ETFs generate negative risk-adjusted returns to
begin with.



                                                     26
Table 4. Hedging Motive?
The table presents the risk-adjusted monthly performance of stocks from 2000 to 2019 by quintiles of loadings
on specialized ETFs. In each month, we sort stocks based on their beta on the excess return of the market-
capitalization-weighted portfolio of specialized ETFs, controlling for the market factor. The beta is estimated
using 60-month rolling-window regressions, requiring each stock to have at least 36 months of observations
with returns. We then form five portfolios corresponding to the quintiles of the estimated betas based on
NYSE breakpoints. Portfolio Q1 (Q5) contains the stocks with the lowest (highest) correlation with the
specialized portfolio. CAPM, FF3, FFC4, FF5, FF6, and Q alpha denote alphas with respect to the Capital
Asset Pricing Model (Sharpe, 1964; Lintner, 1965; Mossin, 1966), the Fama-French three-factor model (Fama
and French, 1993), the Fama-French-Carhart four-factor model (Carhart, 1997), the Fama-French five-factor
model (Fama and French, 2015), the Fama-French six-factor model (Fama and French, 2018), and the Q-
factor model (Hou et al., 2015), respectively. The alphas are in percentage points, and t -statistics are
reported in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

    Directly testing for a hedging motive would require observing investors endowments,
which is not possible given the available data. Thus, we choose a different strategy. We study
whether investors are ex-ante aware of the negative risk premium delivered by specialized
ETFs and are willing to bear it as a form of insurance premium. In other words, we examine
whether investors stick with these products in spite of their negative performance.
    This empirical strategy also allows us to test the explanation that investors willingly sac-
rifice performance because specialized ETFs offer nonpecuniary benefits, e.g., in the form of
compliance with investors' ethical, political, or religious values. According to this explana-
tion, investors should remain invested over time despite specialized ETFs' underperformance.
    To implement this test, we analyze investors' likelihood to allocate capital into specialized
ETFs over the life of these products. Because there can be life-cycle patterns in ETF flows
that are independent of performance, we benchmark specialized ETFs against broad-based


                                                      27
ETFs. The sample consists of all ETF-months in our data. The dependent variable is an
indicator for whether an ETF received positive flows in a particular month. The variable of
interest is the interaction of the specialized ETF indicator and the logarithm of ETF age (in
months). We include the main effects as well as calendar-month fixed effects.
   The estimates in Table 5 suggest that investors are very enthusiastic about specialized
ETFs at their inception, but their enthusiasm fades over time. The positive slope on the
specialized dummy indicates that investors are more likely to add money to specialized
ETFs than to the broad-based ones in the early stages of these products' lives. However,
the negative slope on the interaction of the specialized ETF dummy with its age shows that
as time passes, investors are increasingly more likely to withdraw capital from specialized
products. This disenchantment manifests itself soon after the inception of the ETFs, as
suggested by the estimates in the second column, where we restrict the sample to ETFs that
are less than five years old. These findings are consistent with the positively sloped flow-
performance sensitivity for specialized ETFs shown in Figure 5, and we interpret them as
suggestive of investor disappointment following the poor performance of specialized products.
   Overall, the evidence in this subsection does not support the conjecture that investors
invest in specialized ETFs for their hedging properties or that they willingly sacrifice per-
formance because of nonpecuniary benefits. Therefore, in the next section, we turn to a
different hypothesis to explain the demand for specialized products.

Table 5. Disappointment in Flows
The table studies the probability of positive flows into ETFs since launch. The dependent variable is a
dummy variable that equals 1 if flow is positive. ETF flows in month t + 1 are defined as 100 × (AUMt+1 -
AUMt × ETF returnt+1 )/AUMt . Specialized is a dummy variable that equals 1 if an ETF is a specialized
ETF. log(Age) is an ETF's logged age, in months. The first column reports results using the full sample
from 2000 to 2019, and the second column reports results for new ETFs launched in the previous five years.

6     Do Specialized ETFs Cater to Investor Sentiment?

    Given that specialized ETFs generate negative alpha and that there is no evidence that
they serve as hedging tools, we turn to our third hypothesis. Specifically, we test whether
specialized ETFs are launched in response to investors' demand driven by irrational expec-
tations, such as extrapolative beliefs, which lead them to chase past winners.
    We have already found some supporting evidence in Section 5.1 for the notion that securi-
ties in specialized ETFs are overvalued. Specifically, we found that specialized ETFs deliver
negative risk-adjusted performance, which is consistent with the reversal of overvaluation of
the stocks in their underlying portfolios.
    In this section, we test predictions linking the underperformance of specialized ETFs to
investors' irrational beliefs. First, if newly launched specialized ETFs ride recent trends,
then the securities included in their portfolios should (i) have attracted investors' attention,
and (ii) display traits of overvaluation. Second, the stocks in specialized portfolios should be
attractive to investors who form expectations in an extrapolative way. Finally, specialized

                                                   29
ETFs are likely to be especially attractive to investors who are, on average, less sophisticated,
notably retail investors (Barber and Odean, 2013).


6.1       Characteristics of the Underlying Portfolios

       To understand whether the launch of ETFs caters to investors' irrational beliefs, we
analyze the characteristics of the stocks included in the portfolios of specialized and broad-
based ETFs at the time of their launch. We focus on several characteristics that could
indicate heightened investor attention and are likely associated with overvaluation.
       For each stock in an ETF portfolio, we measure a specific characteristic in the two-year
period before the launch. Then, we compute the value-weighted average characteristic at
the ETF level at the time of launch. Table 6 compares the average ETF-level characteristic
for specialized and broad-based portfolios.
       The table shows that stocks in specialized ETFs display significantly higher pre-launch
market-adjusted returns. This fact makes them attractive to investors with extrapolative
or diagnostic beliefs (e.g., Greenwood and Shleifer, 2014; Barberis et al., 2018; Bordalo
et al., 2018). Moreover, specialized stocks display more positive skewness, which would be
appealing for investors who have a preference for lottery-like payoffs (Brunnermeier and
Parker, 2005; Brunnermeier et al., 2007; Mitton and Vorkink, 2007; Barberis and Huang,
2008; Kumar, 2009).
       Incidentally, we note that stocks in broad-based ETF products also experience positive
pre-launch returns. This finding raises the possibility that the sets of broad-based and
specialized products are not entirely disjoint or, more likely, that the product classification
into broad-based and specialized ETFs is necessarily an approximation.23
       Next, Table 6 shows that stocks included in the portfolios of specialized ETFs were re-
cently under the spotlight. Relative to broad-based portfolios, stocks in specialized ETFs
  23
    For example, smart-beta ETFs are classified as broad-based because they do not have a theme or a
sector focus. However, these ETFs hold, on average, stocks that outperformed in the pre-launch period.
After launch, these funds generate no alpha. See an analysis of the formation and performance of smart-beta
ETFs in Huang et al. (2020).

                                                    30
Table 6. Portfolio Characteristics of ETFs Around Launch
The table reports the portfolio characteristics of ETFs within the two-year period before their launch. For
each characteristic of interest, we construct the time series of the ETF­month-level characteristic from month
-24 to month -6 using the ETF's initial portfolio weights in the launch month 0. We then calculate the
average characteristic across all ETFs in the same category. We report the average characteristics and t -
test results. Market-adjusted return represents returns in excess of CRSP value-weighted returns. Return
skewness is the skewness of returns following Ghysels et al. (2016). We use the 25th and 75th percentiles
as cutoffs. Media exposure is the number of monthly news articles scaled by market capitalization. Media
sentiment is the sum of each news article's composite sentiment score from RavenPack scaled by market
capitalization. For Media exposure and Media sentiment, we subtract the median in each month to filter out
time components, the mean being excessively impacted by outliers. Earnings surprise denotes the average
EPS surprise scaled by the one-quarter-lagged stock price. In each year, we standardize Earnings surprise.
Market-to-book is market equity divided by book equity. Short interest is the monthly short interest ratio.
We subtract the median of the short interest ratio in each month to filter out time components. In the right-
most column, we present the difference between the averages of specialized ETFs (SP) and broad-based
ETFs (BB). t -statistics are reported in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5%, and
1% levels, respectively.

experienced greater media exposure, with more positive sentiment, and higher earnings sur-
prises. The table also suggests that specialized ETFs hold glamour stocks, those with high
market-to-book ratios, and those with high short interest. These characteristics are typi-
cally associated with lower future returns (Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny, 1994; Daniel
and Titman, 1997; Boehmer, Jones, and Zhang, 2008; Ben-David, Drake, and Roulstone,
2015). We also note that turnover is materially larger for specialized products (see Table 1),
which is consistent with the conjecture that these products are used for speculative purposes
(e.g., Simsek, 2013a).
    The characteristics of the securities included in the portfolios of specialized ETFs indicate


                                                     31
that they are popular stocks. This finding is also consistent with anecdotal evidence on ETF
launches in recent times. In 2019, for example, new ETFs included products focusing on
cannabis, cyber security, and video games. In 2020, new specialized ETFs covered stocks
related to the Black Lives Matter movement, COVID-19 vaccines, and the work-from-home
trend. In 2021, tracking the recovery after the COVID recession, new specialized ETFs
covered the travel industry, and space travel as well as real estate and construction.
               To see how the popularity of the stocks in specialized ETFs varies around the time
of the launch, in Figure 6 we compare the evolution of the market-to-book ratios of the
stocks in broad-based and specialized ETFs (Panel (a)) as well as their media sentiment
scores (Panel (b)) around their launch. The figure shows that specialized stocks enjoy higher
market-to-book ratios and more positive media sentiment prior to launch. In the year after
the launch, both market-to-book ratios and the media sentiment of the stocks in specialized
ETFs quickly revert.24

Figure 6. Dynamics of ETF Portfolio Characteristics
The figure presents the evolution of ETF portfolio characteristics, per ETF category. Panel (a) shows the
evolution of the market-to-book ratio, and Panel (b) shows the evolution of media sentiment. For each
characteristic of interest, we construct the time series of the ETF­month-level characteristic from month
-24 to month +24 using the ETF's portfolio weights. In the pre-launch periods, we use the ETF's initial
portfolio weights in the launch month 0. In the post-launch periods, we use the actual portfolio weights.
We then calculate the average characteristic across all ETFs in each month, per ETF category. The shaded
areas represent 95% confidence intervals.

  24
     We note that, while we cannot infer that the two series in Panel (a) of Figure 6 differ at a given point
in time for lack of power, the test in Table 6, using data over the entire 24-month period before launch,
allows us to conclude that the market-to-book ratio of specialized ETFs is significantly higher than that of
broad-based ETFs.


                                                                         32
       This figure suggests that specialized ETFs are launched in a late stage of the valuation
cycle of the underlying portfolios. This pattern is consistent with the fact that it takes six
months to a year to launch a new ETF. Thus, there is a substantial delay between when
ETF providers spot trends of interest to investors and when ETFs actually reach the market.
After launch, valuations start sliding downward.25
       To provide further evidence that the characteristics in Table 6 and the patterns in Figure 6
reflect overvaluation of specialized ETFs, we return to the calendar-time portfolio approach.
Specifically, in Figure 7, we split ETFs based on whether the average characteristics of
the stocks in the ETF portfolio are above or below their median. The figure shows that
portfolios of the specialized ETFs scoring high on past returns and media sentiment display
more negative six-factor alphas after launch. Similar results are obtained with the other risk
adjustments that we consider.
       Overall, the evidence in this subsection suggests that the underperformance of specialized
ETFs is likely related to the overvaluation of the securities in the underlying portfolios at the
time of launch. Given that the pre-launch performance of the underlying portfolios of these
ETFs, as well as the attention they attract, is high, the negative post-launch alpha suggests
that the issuance of specialized ETFs occurs near the peak of valuation of the underlying
securities.


6.2       Evidence on the Nature of Investor Expectations

       Given that specialized ETFs hold securities displaying high past returns, high media
sentiment, and high valuations prior to launch, it is natural to ask whether the providers
of specialized ETFs cater to investors' extrapolative expectations. Following Bordalo et al.
(2019), we make the working assumption that analysts' forecasts are reflective of investor
  25
     After the end of our sample, the time-to-market for ETFs shortened due to a simplification of the
regulatory approval process. Specifically, in December 2019, with compliance date in December 2020, the
SEC introduced Rule 6c-11, which "permits exchange-traded funds that satisfy certain conditions to operate
without the expense and delay of obtaining an exemptive order." See https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/
2019/33-10695.pdf. We expect this change to delay the valuation peak in Panel (a) of Figure 6 but not to
affect the overall conclusion of underperformance in the five years after launch in Figure 2.

Figure 7. Performance of ETFs, Split by Pre-launch Stock Characteristics
The figure presents the Fama-French six-factor model (FF-6, Fama and French (2018)) alphas of the portfolios
of ETFs from 2000 to 2019, split by ETF categories and stock characteristics groups. In Panel (a), we split
each ETF category into two subgroups based on the past market-adjusted returns, computed as in Table 6.
In Panel (b), we split each ETF category into two subgroups based on the past media sentiment, computed
as in Table 6. In each month, we identify new ETFs that were launched in the previous five years. We
then form portfolios consisting of all new ETFs in the same category and the same subgroup. The portfolio
returns are value-weighted using one-month-lagged market capitalization. To adjust returns for risk factors,
we estimate FF-6 alphas of the portfolios. The alphas are in monthly percentage points. Error bars represent
95% confidence intervals.

beliefs and that they are informative about the expectations shaping market prices.
                         In Figure 8, we study analysts' forecasts for the stocks included in broad-based and
specialized ETFs. We use data from I/B/E/S on analysts' long-term earnings growth (LTG)
forecasts and earnings-per-share (EPS) realizations. In Panel (a), we report the behavior of
the average LTG forecasts for the stocks in the broad-based and specialized portfolios around
the time of the ETF launch. Mirroring the pattern of the high-LTG portfolio in Bordalo
et al. (2019), the portfolio of specialized stocks displays significantly higher forecasts on
average. These forecasts become increasingly more positive in the period leading up to the
launch. However, after the ETF launch, these stocks experience a marked downward revision
in LTG expectations. No such pattern is found for the stocks in the broad-based portfolio.
This finding cannot be attributed to attrition in the sample, as we keep only the stocks that
have LGT forecasts for all the relevant periods.
                         As argued by Bordalo et al. (2019), the mean-reversion in LTG forecasts could result
from mean reversion in the underlying process, making Panel (a) compatible with rational
expectations or excessively optimistic forecasts. To test the latter alternative, in Panel (b)


                                                                         34
of Figure 8, we report the average forecast errors for the stocks in the ETF portfolio in the
eight quarters following the launch. Forecast errors are computed as the annual change in
realized EPS minus the LTG forecast at the time of launch. We find that forecast errors
for specialized ETFs grow to be significantly negative and economically large, consistent
with strong overoptimism in expectations. We also find slightly negative forecast errors for
broad-based ETFs, consistent with analysts' incentives to inflate their forecasts (Easterwood
and Nutt, 1999; Michaely and Womack, 1999; Dechow, Hutton, and Sloan, 2000).

Figure 8. Dynamics of Earnings Forecasts Around Launch
The figure presents the evolution of earnings forecasts and forecast errors, per ETF category. Panel (a)
shows the evolution of analysts' expectations of long-term annual earnings growth (LTG). Panel (b) shows
the evolution of forecast errors, defined as the difference between the realized annual earnings growth
([EPSq /EPSq-4 ]-1) and LTG one quarter before launch (LTG-1 ). For each variable of interest, we construct
the time series of the ETF­quarter-level characteristic from quarters -8 to +8 relative to ETF launch quar-
ter 0 using the ETFs portfolio weights. To compute the portfolio-level averages, in the pre-launch periods,
we use the ETFs initial portfolio weights in the launch quarter 0. In the post-launch periods, we use the
actual portfolio weights. We then calculate the average across all ETFs in each quarter, per ETF category.

          According to Bordalo et al. (2019), such patterns of expectations are inconsistent with
a rational model of belief formation. Rather, these patterns can be generated in a model
with diagnostic expectations, which represent a specific form of extrapolative beliefs. In
particular, investors with diagnostic expectations would consider recent extreme realizations
as representative of the prevailing distribution for a group of stocks--in our case the stocks
that will be included in the specialized ETFs. Therefore, after positive surprises, expectations
about future performance tend to be excessively optimistic.


                                                            35
       In sum, the evidence in this subsection supports the hypothesis that the providers of
specialized ETFs launch new products in segments of the stock market in which investors hold
optimistic beliefs. These stocks likely experience greater investor demand, hence increasing
the attractiveness of the new products.


6.3       Who Is Attracted to Specialized ETFs?

       To determine whether specialized ETFs are relatively more appealing to unsophisticated
investors, we more closely examine the investor composition of the different types of ETFs.
In this analysis, we focus on the first year after launch to more closely identify the target
clientele of these products when they are created.
       We start by using regulatory filings by institutional investors. In particular, they report
their ownership of ETFs on the mandatory SEC 13F forms.26 Institutional investors include
mutual funds, hedge funds, pension funds, banks, insurance companies, endowments, etc.
Prior literature suggests that institutions are on average more sophisticated, i.e., their in-
vestment decisions are less prone to the systematic biases (e.g., French, 2008; Stambaugh,
2014) that plague retail investors' decisions (Barber and Odean, 2013)
       Figure 9, Panel (a), reports the average fraction of shares owned by institutional investors
in the first four quarters after launch. The panel shows that institutions own about 43% of
the market capitalization of broad-based ETFs in their first year. In contrast, institutions
own a significantly lower share of the market capitalization of specialized ETFs, about 39%.
Because shares not owned by 13F-reporting institutions are either owned by smaller (nonre-
porting) institutions, managers, or retail investors, we deduce that retail investors are likely
to own a greater share of the specialized ETFs universe than that of the broad-based ETF
universe, supporting the view that unsophisticated investors are more likely to be attracted
to specialized ETFs.
  26
    Only institutions that manage more than $100 million in U.S. equity and which are doing business with
U.S. investors are required to file a 13F form. The filers need to report positions exceeding $200,000 or
10,000 shares.

Figure 9. ETF Ownership Soon After Launch
The figure presents the ownership structures of ETFs one year after launch, per ETF category. Over the first
4 quarters after launch, we calculate the average ownership of 13F institutional investors and the number of

of Robinhood users per AUM. Bar charts represent the average ownership, and error bars represent 95%
confidence intervals.

                           We can also gain direct insights into ownership by sentiment-driven investors through user
data from the discount brokerage Robinhood. These data are available starting in 2018 and
include the number of Robinhood accounts holding each security. The Robinhood platform
has recently become known for investment frenzies, characterizing its users.27 Panel (b) of
Figure 9 shows that the number of Robinhood users scaled by ETF market capitalization is
substantially higher for specialized ETFs than for the broad-based ETFs in their first year
of existence.
                           The interest of Robinhood traders in specialized ETFs is consistent with the observations
of Barber et al. (2020) and Welch (2020), who document that Robinhood investors hold
attention-grabbing securities. The authors show that Robinhood traders experience negative
returns shortly after they enter their positions.28
                           Indeed, examining the portfolios of Robinhood users around the launch of ETFs provides
further support for the hypothesis that specialized ETFs are launched in segments of the

    Welch (2020) also finds that Robinhood traders' strategy, which is concentrated on high-volume and large
stocks, delivers a positive alpha over the 1980­2020 period. This evidence, arising from trades in stocks, does
not contradict our results showing that specialized ETFs, which are favored by Robinhood traders, deliver a
negative alpha.

Figure 10. Robinhood Users' Investments in the Underlying Stocks and ETFs
The figure presents the number of Robinhood users who hold ETFs or their underlying stocks around ETF
launch, per ETF category. We subtract the median of the Robinhood users in each month to filter out
time trends. In Panel (a), we construct the time series of the ETF­month-level number of Robinhood users
from month -18 to month +18 using the ETF's portfolio weights. In the pre-launch periods, we use the
ETF's initial portfolio weights in the launch month 0. In the post-launch periods, we use the actual portfolio
weights. We then calculate the average number of Robinhood users across all ETFs in the same category.
Panel (b) reports the average number of Robinhood users who directly invest in ETFs. The shaded areas
represent 95% confidence intervals.

ETF launches to plot the holdings of stocks in ETF portfolios by Robinhood users. Specifi-
cally, we compute the number of users holding the stocks that will be included in the ETF
(to be launched in month 0), weighted by their weight in the ETF. Because the Robinhood
user base increased significantly over the sample period, we subtract the median stock hold-
ing in the relevant calendar month.29 We also report the number of users holding the ETFs
themselves.
                      The results in Panel (a) of Figure 10 show that the number of users holding the stocks that
will be included in specialized ETFs increases and peaks right before the launch. Around
the launch time, the number of users starts declining. We observe no similar pattern for
broad-based ETFs. These results reiterate the point made in Subsection 6.1 that specialized
ETFs are launched in segments of the market about which investors hold positive views;
further, these products arrive to the market after the excitement has peaked.
                      Once new specialized ETFs are launched, they attract some of the Robinhood traders
(Figure 10, Panel (b)), though not at the same rate as the underlying stocks do. Investors
               29
    Due to the skewness of the holdings data, adjusting user holdings by the mean results in very high
cross-sectional variance in some months. Adjusting by the median produces more stable estimates.

                                                                               38
who are drawn to new specialized ETFs lose their interest within a few months of the launch.
Broad-based ETFs do not exhibit these patterns.
    The picture that emerges from the results in this section is that specialized ETFs cater
to investors' expectations formed by extrapolating past performance of popular investment
themes into the future. These portfolios include attention-grabbing stocks that are overval-
ued at the time of launch. In the years following the launch, the value of specialized ETFs
declines drastically.



7     Conclusion

    This paper studies the most prominent financial innovation in the last 30 years: exchange-
traded funds (ETFs). Many observers view the growth of ETFs as a positive development
that allows ordinary investors to achieve diversification at low cost and to construct payoff
profiles that would otherwise be unattainable.
    Our evidence shows a more nuanced reality. We identify two segments in the ETF market.
Broad-based ETFs hold diversified portfolios and charge low fees. These products respond
to investors' motive to achieve diversification and market access at a low cost. Specialized
ETFs, in contrast, offer investors exposure to trendy themes at a high cost and low level of
diversification. Although the average AUM of these funds are smaller, in the aggregate, they
drive over one-third of the revenues of the equity-based ETF industry.
    While broad-based ETFs clearly achieve their goal of providing diversification at low
cost, we examine whether specialized ETFs provide value in terms of exposure to successful
investment ideas or, if that is not the case, in the form of insurance. Our results suggest that
specialized ETFs, on average, do not create value for investors. These ETFs tend to hold
attention-grabbing and overvalued stocks and therefore underperform significantly: They
deliver a negative alpha of about -6% in the five years after their inception, on average.
We find no evidence that the negative performance corresponds to the price that investors



                                              39
are willing pay to insure against some relevant risk factor. Instead, our evidence suggests
that specialized ETFs are launched just after the very peak of excitement around popular
investment themes.
   We conclude that the implications of the "democratization of investment" that ETFs
bring about are mixed. On the one hand, investors can now access financial markets at
low cost, which can be welfare-improving because it allows broader risk sharing. On the
other hand, the marketing strategies of specialized ETFs facilitate speculation in overval-
ued securities, which soon underperform. It is possible that, absent specialized ETFs, these
investors would still invest their money inefficiently. However, specialized ETFs likely encour-
age greater investor participation due to their marketing efforts and competitive strategies.
Investors on the extensive margin may be worse off as a result of holding specialized ETFs.

Appendix A               A Primer on ETFs

   Exchange-traded products (ETPs) are investment companies whose objective is to repli-
cate the performance of an index, in a similar manner to index mutual funds. Unlike in-
dex funds, however, ETPs are listed on an exchange and are traded throughout the day.
These funds are organized in several legal structures, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs),
exchange-traded notes (ETNs), exchange-traded commodities, and index participation units
(IPU). In this article, we focus exclusively on ETFs.
   The first U.S. ETF was launched in January 1993. It tracked the S&P 500 (ticker: SPY).
SPY is currently the largest ETF in the world, with nearly $300 billion in assets. As of the
end of 2019, the number of ETFs has grown to over 3,000 in the United States and nearly
7,000 globally, with these products spanning various asset classes.
   ETFs can reproduce the performance of the relevant index in two distinct ways. First,
they can hold a basket of securities that, more or less, replicates the index ("physical replica-
tion"). Second, they can enter into swap agreements with financial institutions to have the
performance of the index delivered by these counterparties in exchange for a fee ("synthetic
replication"). The physical structure is prevalent in the United States, and it characterizes
all the ETFs in our sample.
   The focus in this article is on "plain vanilla" equity ETFs that hold portfolios of stocks
that track an index. The index can be an existing index, such as the S&P 500 or Russell
2000, or an index that is designed by the issuers expressly for the ETF, e.g., the index tracked
by the work-from-home ETF, launched in June 2020.
   The innovation in the ETF structure revolves around the creation and redemption mech-
anism that takes place on a daily basis and keeps the market price of the ETF in close
proximity to the value of the basket of securities in the index it tracks. Because ETFs hold
securities that are, themselves, traded on the market, there is a possibility of temporary
misalignment between the price of ETF shares and the value of the basket of securities. For
example, when there is high demand for the ETF, but not yet for the underlying securities,

                                               46
the ETF will trade at a premium relative to the underlying index. To ensure that significant
deviations are not created between the ETF and the underlying securities portfolio, ETFs
continuously issue new shares when investor demand is high or redeem shares when investor
demand is low. The creation or redemption of ETF shares is called flows, which can be
positive or negative, and can indicate the demand for the ETF in excess of the demand for
the underlying securities.
   For further reading about ETFs, please see Ben-David, Franzoni, and Moussawi (2017)
and Ben-David, Franzoni, and Moussawi (2018).

Appendix B                 Data Sources

B.1        ETF Data

       We use information from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) to identify
a comprehensive and survivorship-bias-free list of all U.S. equity ETFs. We first select
securities with share code of 73 from CRSP, or a nonmissing ETF flag in the CRSP Mutual
Fund Database. Because we are interested in ETFs that hold U.S. equities, we drop ETFs
focusing on the bond market (that have a CRSP style of fixed income, mixed holdings, or
other--style codes: I , M , O, or names that contain the word "bond"). We also drop inverse
and leveraged ETFs (that have a Lipper classification code of DSB ,30 or CRSP style code
EDY S or EDY H ,31 or the name contains any of the following: 2×, 3×, bear, or bull). We
exclude ETFs that are classified as foreign equity ETFs (CRSP style code F ). The final
sample contains 1,080 distinct U.S. equity ETFs that satisfy all requirements.
       CRSP is our primary source for daily trading data. We rely on Bloomberg for ETF shares
outstanding information, and supplement it with Compustat when the Bloomberg data are
not available. Furthermore, we use CRSP's end-of-month information about returns and
prices, and supplement it with Bloomberg's and Compustat's total shares outstanding to
calculate month-end assets under management (AUM). Compustat is our primary source for
monthly short interest data.


B.2        ETF Holdings Data

       We obtain ETF holdings information from two sources: the Thomson Reuters Global
Mutual Fund Ownership and CRSP Mutual Fund Holdings databases. For many ETFs,
both sources contain holdings information; for others, holdings information is only available
  30
     DSB : dedicated short bias funds. More information about Lipper classification codes is provided in:
http://www.crsp.org/products/documentation/lipper-objective-and-classification-codes.
  31
     EDY S : Dedicated Short Bias Funds. EDY N : long/short equity funds, equity market neutral funds,
absolute return funds, and equity leverage funds. More information about CRSP style codes is provided in:
http://www.crsp.org/products/documentation/crsp-style-code.


                                                   48
in one of the sources. In many cases, first report dates of portfolio holdings differ between
the two. Our approach is to take one source per ETF as the reference for its holdings. If
an ETF has holdings information in both sources, we use the one with the start date that
is closer to the launch date in CRSP. We notice that CRSP holdings data are relatively
more reliable and timely after June 2010 and those in the earlier period of the sample, the
Thomson Reuters Global Ownership data are more reliable to track ETF ownership soon
after launch dates.


B.3       Firm-Level Data

      We use Compustat for firm-level accounting information and obtain the analysts-forecast-
based measure of earnings surprises from I/B/E/S. Firm-level news data are from RavenPack
News Analytics. We aggregate daily-level news items into monthly-level news counts. 13F
institutional ownership data are from Thomson Reuters, and Robinhood users data are from

B.4       Financial Markets Data

      We calculate risk-adjusted returns using six different risk models: the CAPM (Sharpe,
1964; Lintner, 1965; Mossin, 1966), the Fama-French three-factor (Fama and French, 1993),
the Fama-French-Carhart four-factor (Carhart, 1997), the Fama-French five-factor (Fama
and French, 2015), and the Fama-French six-factor (Fama and French, 2018) models.32

   Risk factor returns are downloaded from Professor French's website: https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.
edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html and Professors Hou, Xue, and Zhang's website:

Appendix D                  Additional Empirical Results

Table D.1. ETF Summary Statistics
The table shows summary statistics at the ETF level. Panels A, B, C, and D report summary statistics for
broad-based ETFs, smart-beta ETFs, sector ETFs, and thematic ETFs, respectively. Number of holdings
represents the average number of stocks in the portfolios of ETFs. Fee refers to annualized expense ratio.
Turnover is the average daily turnover over the six months after launch. Market-adjusted return is monthly
ETF return in excess of CRSP value-weighted return over the 60 months after launch. Delisted is an indicator
for whether the ETF was liquidated as of the end of 2019. Assets under management (AUM) is the total
market value of the investments in 2019. Implied revenues are calculated by multiplying fee by average AUM
in 2019.

Table D.2. Difference in Fees
The table reports the difference in fees across ETF categories from 2000 to 2019. The dependent variable
Fee is the annualized expense ratio of an ETF in each month. Specialized is a dummy variable that equals
1 if an ETF is a specialized ETF. Thematic is a dummy variable that equals 1 if an ETF is a theamtic
ETF. Sector is a dummy variable that equals 1 if an ETF is a sector ETF. Smart-beta is a dummy variable
that equals 1 if an ETF is a smart-beta ETF. Standard errors are clustered at the ETF, the management
company, and the calendar-month levels. t -statistics are reported in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate
significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Table D.4. Sensitivity of ETF Flows to Fees (Robustness)
The table reports the flow sensitivity of ETFs to their fees. The observations are at the ETF level. The
dependent variable is cumulative flows over a 12-month or 24-month window after the launch of each ETF.
Fee is the average annualized expense ratio of an ETF over the 12-month or 24-month time window. Return
rank is the average percentile rank of returns within each month over the 12-month or 24-month time window.
Specialized is a dummy variable that equals 1 if an ETF is a specialized ETF. t -statistics are reported in
parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Appendix E                  Robustness Analysis of ETF Performance

E.1      ETF Performance with Equally Weighted Returns

    In Table E.1, we report the performance of ETFs with equal-weighted returns. The
results are similar to those reported in Table 3.

Table E.1. Calendar-Time Portfolios of ETFs (Equally-Weighted)
The table presents the risk-adjusted performance of ETFs from 2000 to 2019. In Panel A, we form portfolios
consisting of all ETFs in the same category. In Panel B, we identify new ETFs that were launched in
the previous five years in each month. We then form portfolios consisting of all new ETFs in the same
category. The portfolio returns are equal-weighted. Excess return refers to the average monthly return in
excess of the risk-free rate. CAPM, FF3, FFC4, FF5, FF6, and Q denote alphas with respect to the Capital
Asset Pricing Model (Sharpe, 1964; Lintner, 1965; Mossin, 1966), the Fama-French three-factor model (Fama
and French, 1993), the Fama-French-Carhart four-factor model (Carhart, 1997), the Fama-French five-factor
model (Fama and French, 2015), the Fama-French six-factor model (Fama and French, 2018), and the Q-
factor model (Hou et al., 2015), respectively. The portfolios of all broad-based (specialized) ETFs comprise
171 (189) ETFs on average. SP minus BB denotes the specialized ETF portfolio minus the broad-based ETF
portfolio. The excess return and alphas are in percentage points, and t -statistics are reported in parentheses.
*, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

E.2      ETF Performance: Seasoned ETFs

    In Appendix Table E.2, we report the performance of portfolios containing ETFs that
have been in existence for more than 60 months to complement the results in Table 3. We
note that the underperformance of specialized ETFs is no longer significant.

Table E.2. Calendar-Time Portfolios of Seasoned ETFs
The table presents the risk-adjusted performance of seasoned ETFs. We identify seasoned ETFs that were
launched more than five years prior in each month. We then form portfolios consisting of all seasoned ETFs
in the same category. The portfolio returns are value-weighted using one-month-lagged market capitalization.
Excess return refers to the average monthly return in excess of the risk-free rate. CAPM, FF3, FFC4, FF5,
FF6, and Q denote alphas with respect to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (Sharpe, 1964; Lintner, 1965;
Mossin, 1966), the Fama-French three-factor model (Fama and French, 1993), the Fama-French-Carhart

E.3      ETF Performance: U.S. Portfolio ETFs

    In Appendix Table E.3, we restrict the sample of broad-based and specialized ETFs to
those that include at least 80% of their market capitalization invested in stocks traded in the
United States, and estimate risk-adjusted returns using the calendar-time portfolio approach
as in Table 3. The results of the analysis are similar to those reported in Table 3.

Table E.3. Calendar-Time Portfolios Around ETF Launches (U.S. ETFs)
The table presents risk-adjusted performance of ETFs from 2000 to 2019. We require ETFs to hold at
least 80% of their AUM in U.S. stocks. In each month, we identify new ETFs that were launched within
the previous five years. We then form a portfolio consisting of all new ETFs in the same category. The
portfolio returns are value-weighted using one-month-lagged market capitalization. Excess return refers to
the average monthly return in excess of the risk-free rate. CAPM, FF3, FFC4, FF5, FF6, and Q alpha
denote alphas with respect to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (Sharpe, 1964; Lintner, 1965; Mossin, 1966),
the Fama-French three-factor model (Fama and French, 1993), the Fama-French-Carhart four-factor model
(Carhart, 1997), the Fama-French five-factor model (Fama and French, 2015), the Fama-French six-factor
model (Fama and French, 2018), and the Q-factor model (Hou et al., 2015), respectively. The portfolios
of broad-based (specialized) ETFs include 89 (79) ETFs on average. SP minus BB denotes the specialized
ETF portfolio minus the broad-based ETFs portfolio. The alphas are in percentage points, and t -statistics
are reported in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

E.4        ETF Performance: Alternative Classification

    In Appendix Table E.4, we confirm the underperformance of specialized ETFs when we
identify them as those with either a large active share, a small number of portfolio holdings,
or those charging high fees.
    In Appendix Table E.5, we show that both sector and thematic ETFs exhibit significant
underperformance. The sample period starts in 2010 since few new thematic ETFs are
available to form portfolios before 2010.

Table E.4. New ETFs' Performance (Alternative Classification)
The table presents risk-adjusted performance of ETFs from 2000 to 2019. We identify new ETFs that were
launched within the previous five years. In each month, we form 5 portfolios by sorting new ETFs on active
share (Panel A), the number of holdings (Panel B), or fee (Panel C). The three variables are measured within
the first six months after the launch of ETFs. The portfolio returns are value-weighted using one-month-
lagged market capitalization. We exclude ETFs' first six months of returns to avoid a look-ahead bias. Excess
return refers to the average monthly return in excess of the risk-free rate. CAPM, FF3, FFC4, FF5, FF6,
and Q denote alphas with respect to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (Sharpe, 1964; Lintner, 1965; Mossin,
1966), the Fama-French three-factor model (Fama and French, 1993), the Fama-French-Carhart four-factor
model (Carhart, 1997), the Fama-French five-factor model (Fama and French, 2015), the Fama-French six-
factor model (Fama and French, 2018), and the Q-factor model (Hou et al., 2015), respectively. The alphas
are in percentage points, and t -statistics are reported in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significance at
the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Table E.5. New ETFs' Performance by Categories
The table presents risk-adjusted performance of ETFs from 2010 to 2019. In each month, we identify new
ETFs that were launched within the previous five years. We then form a portfolio consisting of all new ETFs
in the same category. The portfolio returns are value-weighted using one-month-lagged market capitalization.
Excess return refers to the average monthly return in excess of the risk-free rate. CAPM, FF3, FFC4, FF5,
FF6, and Q denote alphas with respect to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (Sharpe, 1964; Lintner, 1965;
Mossin, 1966), the Fama-French three-factor model (Fama and French, 1993), the Fama-French-Carhart
four-factor model (Carhart, 1997), the Fama-French five-factor model (Fama and French, 2015), the Fama-
French six-factor model (Fama and French, 2018), and the Q-factor model (Hou et al., 2015), respectively.
The alphas are in percentage points, and t -statistics are reported in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate
significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

                                     Sensitivity

              In Appendix Figure F.1, we replicate the analysis in Figure 5 using market-adjusted
returns and the percentile rank of returns within each month. We confirm that the infer-
ences remain unchanged. In Appendix Figures F.2 and F.3, we show that the same flow-
performance sensitivity pattern is present when we measure the performance at the quarterly
and annual frequencies.

Figure F.1. Flow-Performance Sensitivity
The figure presents the flow-performance sensitivity of ETFs per ETF category. Flows are computed as
100 × (AUMt+1 - AUMt × ETF returnt+1 )/AUMt . Market-adjusted returns are raw ETF returns in excess
of CRSP value-weighted returns. Return percentile rank is the percentile rank of returns within each month.
We estimate a nonparametric relation between flows and returns using local polynomial approximations
obtained with Stata's -lpoly- command with bandwidth of 0.04. The shaded areas represent 95% confidence
intervals.
