This paper explores the nature of macroeconomic spillovers from advanced economies to emerging
market economies (EMEs) and the consequences for independent use of monetary policy in EMEs.
We first empirically document the effects of US monetary policy shocks on a sample group of EMEs.
A contractionary monetary shock leads a retrenchment in EME capital flows, a fall in EME GDP,
and an exchange rate depreciation. We construct a the- oretical model which can help to account for
these findings. In the model, macroeconomic spillovers are exacerbated by financial frictions. We
assess the extent to which domestic monetary policy can mitigate the negative spillovers from foreign
shocks. Absent financial frictions, international spillovers are minor, and an inflation targeting rule
represents an ef- fective policy for the EME. With frictions in financial intermediation, however, spillovers
are substantially magnified, and an inflation targeting rule has little advantage over an exchange rate
peg. However, an optimal monetary policy markedly improves on the performance of naive inflation
targeting or an exchange rate peg. Furthermore, optimal policies don’t need to be coordinated across
countries. Under the specific set of assumptions maintained in our model, a non-cooperative, self-oriented
optimal policy gives results very similar to those of a global cooperative optimal policy.

1. Introduction
    In recent years, the global economy has seen dramatic examples of volatility in capital
flows to emerging market countries. Following the global financial crisis and the subsequent
rapid monetary easing in the US and other advanced economies, there was a period of large
capital inflows into many fast growing EMEs such as China, India and Brazil. In 2013,
the threat of a US monetary ‘taper’ led to an abrupt reversal of inflows to many emerging
economies. The defining characteristic of these two episodes is that capital flows were driven
to a large degree by macroeconomic and financial conditions in the advanced economies,
especially those in the US. Although the size of the US economy relative to world GDP has
fallen in recent decades, the US still plays an outsized role in the global financial system
(e.g. Fischer, 2014), one reason being the overwhelming predominance of the US dollar as a
funding currency for global capital flows.
    There is substantial empirical evidence linking international capital flows to US asset
prices and US monetary policy. Rey (2013), Miranda-Agrippino and Rey (2014), and Bruno
and Shin (2015) describe a ‘global financial cycle’ in which capital flows to many countries
are highly positively correlated and closely tied to US monetary policy. Miranda-Agrippino
and Rey (2014) find that a tightening of US monetary policy leads to a spike in global risk
aversion, a fall in cross border lending, and a fall in asset prices at a global level. They
identify a single global factor that can explain a large part of the movement in cross border
credit flows, as well as domestic credit growth. Moreover, this factor can be related to
changes in US policy rates.
    A major policy question arising from these events is whether US monetary policy imparts
a global ‘externality’ through spillover effects on world capital flows, credit growth and asset
prices. Many policy makers in emerging markets (e.g. Rajan, 2014) have argued that the
US Federal Reserve should adjust its monetary policy decisions to take account of the excess
sensitivity of international capital flows to US policy. This criticism questions the view that a
‘self-oriented’ monetary policy based on inflation targeting principles represents an efficient
mechanism for the world monetary system (e.g. Obstfeld and Rogoff, 2002), without the
need for any cross-country coordination of policies.
    A related question is whether EMEs that find themselves excessively affected by capital
flow volatility need more policy tools besides interest rate and exchange rate adjustment.
Rey (2013) argues that for small open countries in present day global financial markets, the
classic policy ‘trilemma’ which states that independent policy may be followed provided the
exchange rate is flexible, in fact collapses to a ‘dilemma’, since exchange rate adjustment
cannot easily insulate against large reversals in capital flows. The ‘dilemma’ is one where
emerging market countries can either maintain an open capital account but remain vulnerable
to the global financial cycle, or choose to impose capital controls in order to achieve a greater
degree of macro policy independence.
    Our paper provides empirical as well as theoretical analysis of international spillovers,
their consequence for the design of monetary policy, and the desirability of ‘self-oriented’
monetary policy. We add to the empirical literature on macroeconomic spillovers by ex-
amining the impact of US monetary policy shocks on EMEs using a panel of 16 emerging
market countries. US monetary policy shocks are identified as in Coibion et al. (2012), who
provide an update to the Romer and Romer (2004) shocks. We examine the response of EME


                                               2
policy rates, exchange rates, GDP, inflation, and gross capital flows to these shocks. The
estimation is based on the local projection method proposed by Jordà (2005). We find that
an unexpected US monetary policy tightening leads to a fall in EMEs’ economic activity, a
rise in policy rates, an exchange rate depreciation, and a retrenchment of capital flows; that
is, a fall in both capital inflows to EMEs and outflows from EMEs.
    In the theoretical analysis, we develop a simple core-periphery DSGE model driven by
monetary policy and financial shocks in the core country whose currency dominates the flows
of financial capital across borders. Our model is based on the relationship between financial
institutions in a large financial centre (global banks or asset managers) and borrowing banks
or financial institutions in an emerging market country. We find that when these financial
institutions face agency constraints which restrict the growth of their balance sheets, then
monetary policy shocks or financial shocks in the centre country can produce many of the
features of international capital flows described above. A monetary contraction in the centre
leads to a sharp decline in capital inflows to the peripheral country, a fall also in outflows
from the periphery, a real exchange rate depreciation in the periphery, and a rise in interest
rate spreads which precipitates a coordinated downturn in real economic activity.
    We find that, for the baseline calibration of our model, the response of asset prices and
interest rate spreads in emerging economies to a monetary contraction in the centre country
can in fact be larger than the direct responses of these variables in the centre country itself.
Thus, sudden reversals in the monetary policy stance of the centre country can generate
what looks like excessive responses in the financial markets of emerging economies. This is
the case even if the emerging economy allows its exchange rate to adjust freely.
    The key mechanism in the model is the magnification effect of shocks to the balance sheets
of global lenders compounded with those of local emerging market borrowers. A monetary
tightening in the centre country raises interest rates and funding costs for global lenders.
This erodes their net worth, requiring them to reduce lending to local emerging market
borrowers. In addition, EMEs experience an immediate real exchange rate depreciation.
The combination of increased borrowing costs and unanticipated depreciation, which raises
the costs of servicing existing debt, leads a sharp decline in net worth for emerging market
borrowing institutions. This leads to a rise in spreads in emerging markets. We find that the
spreads rise significantly more in the emerging market country than in the centre country,
since they are subject to a ‘double agency’ effect. In contrast to a basic core-periphery
DSGE model without constrained financial institutions, a simple inflation targeting rule
(like a Taylor rule) does not insulate the peripheral economy from international monetary
spillovers.
    We go on to explore the implications of alternative policy and financial structures on the
nature of financial and real spillovers. We ask how the nature of spillovers would differ if the
emerging market were able to borrow in its own currency. This would eliminate the direct
deterioration of balance sheets coming from exchange rate depreciation. We find in this case
that the contraction in lending and the rise in spreads is mitigated somewhat, so that the
impact on the real economy is smaller. But despite this, the emerging economy is still highly
vulnerable to the cutback in direct capital flows and the increase in funding costs coming
from the centre country, so that the overall magnitude of spillovers is still very large.
    With frictionless financial markets, a pegged exchange rate magnifies the response of real
variables to the external shock, as it curtails the required adjustment in the real exchange

                                               3
rate. But when global and local financial firms are subject to agency constraints, the mag-
nitude of spillovers differs little between an exchange rate peg and an inflation targeting
monetary policy.
    We find similar results when we allow drivers of capital flows other than core country
monetary shocks. Direct shocks to the financial system in the core country triggers many of
the same features as those of the monetary shock described above.
    These results would seem to support the ’dilemma’ view. But in fact, we show that
this conclusion does not follow when we study optimal monetary policy responses. A global
cooperative monetary response to a financial downturn can largely eliminate the negative
impact of the capital flow spillovers. For this response to work however, it is essential that
the periphery country exploit the flexibility of its exchange rate. Thus, when an optimal
cooperative monetary rule is considered, the policy ‘trilemma’ becomes relevant again.
    Practically speaking, monetary policy is set at the national level, and especially for
the countries at the financial centre, national considerations alone will dictate policy re-
sponses. Although naive inflation targeting monetary rules have poor properties in dealing
with international spillovers in the presence of agency distortions in international financial
intermediation, this does not mean that any self-oriented monetary policy is ineffective. We
show that in a model with non-cooperative (Nash) optimal monetary policy game where
both core and peripheral countries independently choose an optimal monetary policy. We
find that, under the specific assumptions of our model, the outcome of the non-cooperative
game is very similar to the optimal cooperative solution.
    Our paper is related to a large literature on capital flows and the macroeconomics of
EMEs. Many recent papers have documented the empirical features of capital flows and
spillovers from advanced economies to emerging market economies. In particular Ahmed
and Zlate (2014), Chen et al. (2015), Bowman et al. (2015), and Chen et al. (2014) examine
the impact of the recent US unconventional monetary policy on emerging markets. Except
for Chen et al. (2015), who look at the response of emerging market inflation and real GDP,
these papers restrict their focus to the impacts on interest rates, asset prices and capital
flows. Gilchrist et al. (2014) examine the effect of US monetary policy shocks including the
period before unconventional monetary policies, but focus on the response of sovereign bond
yields. Fratzscher et al. (2014) examine the impact of ECB unconventional monetary policies
on emerging market asset prices. In addition, as discussed above, Rey (2013), and Miranda-
Agrippino and Rey (2014), examine spillovers in capital markets using factor analysis to
identify global shocks. In a recent work Dedola et al. (2015) provide empirical evidence of
strong international spillovers of US monetary policy shocks. Using a BVAR, they identify
monetary policy shocks by means of sign restrictions. Bluwstein et al. (2015) study spillovers
from the euro area to nine non-euro European economies using a mixed-frequency BVAR.
Among their findings: counties with more integrated financial markets and larger shares of
banks react more strongly to ECB unconventional policies. The credit-channel plays a minor
role in the transmission.
    Our paper differs from this previous literature in a number of respects. In particular, we
focus on US monetary policy shocks before the advent of the zero lower bound, we focus on
the general macroeconomic response in a group of emerging market countries, including the
response of interest rates, real GDP, inflation and capital flows, and rather than employing
a restrictive VAR specification, we follow Jordà (2005) in using a local projection method

                                              4
to construct impulse response functions to US monetary shocks. In addition, we explore the
response of both gross capital inflows and outflows to EMEs. 1
    The conceptual framework employed in our paper is similar to that of Bruno and Shin
(2014), although our structural model and analysis is very different from their paper. In
some respects our modelling strategy is close to the works by Devereux and Yetman (2010),
Dedola and Lombardo (2012), Dedola et al. (2013), Ueda (2012), Kollmann et al. (2011),
Kolasa and Lombardo (2014), Choi and Cook (2004), Perri and Quadrini (2011) Korinek
(2014), and Nuguer (2014). These authors study various positive and normative aspects
of international spillovers due to financial frictions. Our paper builds on these ideas to
address the specific questions highlighted above. A closely related investigation is carried
out by Agénor et al. (2014), who model a small-open-economy DSGE model with two-layers
of financial intermediation. Their main focus is on financial market regulation and macro-
prudential policy.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the empirical evidence
and provides novel estimates of the response of EMEs’ variables to US policy shocks. Section
3 develops the theoretical model. Section 4 discusses the parametrization of the model.
Section 5 discusses monetary policy shocks, while Section 6 provides results on financial
shocks. Sections 7 and 8 introduce the optimal (Ramsey) cooperative policy and the optimal
non-cooperative policy, respectively. Section 9 compares the results under the different policy
arrangements. Finally Section 10 offers some concluding remarks.

2. Capital Flows to Emerging Markets: Some recent evidence
    In 2013 and 2014, emerging market economies experienced significant volatility in gross
and net capital flows. Observers have attributed much of this to actual or prospective
changes in monetary policy in advanced economies. But in fact, highly volatile capital
flows are a fact of life for emerging market countries. Figure 2.1 illustrates net flows into
emerging market portfolio funds for a group of emerging markets since 2009. Following the
highly accommodative monetary policies of advanced countries in 2009-2010, there was a
significant uptick in net inflows to emerging markets. This continued with some volatility
until 2013, when the proximate cause of the US ‘taper’ announcement led to large outflows
from EME countries, both in bonds and equity assets.
    Figure 2.2 shows the currency composition of emerging economies net issuance of debt
securities over the past four years. A significant fraction of new issues remain denominated
in foreign currencies, with the US dollar still representing the major share of these. The
right hand panel of Figure 2.2 shows that the US dollar comprises about 90 percent of the
outstanding stock of debt securities for this representative group of EMEs.

     Alberola et al. (2012) look at the response of gross foreign outflows as well as gross inflows to EMEs
during episodes of financial crises. As in our empirical and theoretical analysis, they show that financial
crises may be associated with a retrenchment of capital flows - there is a fall in both inflows to EMEs
and outflows from EMEs. They show however that this response is critically related to the size of foreign
exchange reserve holdings - EME economies with higher FX reserves tend to see a greater fall in capital
outflows during financial crises. Our formal analysis abstracts from the importance of FX reserves. We
further discuss the implication of explicitly allowing a role for FX reserves below.

   Our theoretical analysis of spillovers depends in a central way on the correlation of interest
rate spreads across countries. Figure 2.3 illustrates the path of interest rate spreads in the
US domestic economy, in Asia, Latin America and Emerging Markets generally. The US
domestic issue on average has the lowest risk spreads, but clearly there is an extremely high
correlation between all the spreads. We also see that the jump in spreads in EMEs during
the 2008-9 financial crisis far exceeded the analogous increase in the US.

2.1. Empirical estimates of US monetary policy shocks spillovers to EMEs
    As a backdrop to our theoretical analysis, we wish to document some general features
of macroeconomic spillovers to emerging market economies. We do this by focusing on the
response to one particular shock; a US monetary policy shock. In order to empirically
examine how US monetary policy spills over to EMEs, we estimate the response of a number
of EMEs’ economic variables to an unexpected US monetary policy contraction. We identify
monetary policy shocks following Coibion et al. (2012), who update the Romer and Romer
(2004) estimates of US monetary policy shocks. Unlike the recent literature on the impacts
of unconventional US monetary policy, our policy shocks are focused on the experience before
the zero interest rate period.
    Rather than explicitly specifying a VAR model, we following (Jordà, 2005) in using local
projection techniques to estimate the impact of US monetary policy shocks across different
economic states in a panel of emerging economies. We estimate the impact of the policy
shock in period t labeled M St , on the variable of interest yi,t+h in country i at time t + h
from the following local projection


                                                          7
              yi,t+h − yi,t−1 = αh + θh M St + γ h wi,t−1 + i,t+h forh = 0, 1, ..., H   (2.1.1)
where wi,t−1 is a vector of control variables known prior to the US monetary policy shocks.
Assuming the conditional mean can be linearly approximated, θh estimates the average
treatment effect of a period t US monetary policy shock in period t + h. Thus, impulse
responses are computed as a sequence of the θh (h = 0, 1, ..., H) estimated in a series of
single regressions for each horizon. Standard errors are clustered by country to account for
within country correlation.
    Our estimates are based on quarterly data between Q1 1989 and Q2 2007. We construct
a quarterly measure of US monetary policy shocks, M St , by aggregating the Coibion et al.
(2012) US monetary policy shocks from each meeting in a given quarter. The emerging
economies included in the unbalanced panel are Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia,
India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, South Africa,
Thailand and Turkey. The dependent variables considered are the log bilateral exchange rate
with the US dollar, log real GDP, inflation, the domestic policy rate, and both portfolio debt
outflows and inflows as a share of GDP. The vector of control variables wi,t−1 consist of two
lags of output growth, export-weighted GDP growth of country i’s major trading partners,
inflation, the domestic policy rate, the log change in the US dollar bilateral exchange rate,
the change in domestic long-term bond yields, the change in the ratio of foreign exchange
reserves to short-term external borrowing, both portfolio debt inflows and outflows as a share
of GDP, past US monetary policy surprises and US 10-year Treasury yields. The HP-filtered
domestic output gap in period t − 1 is also included as a control variable.
    The top-left panel of Figure 2.4 shows that there is some persistence in US monetary
policy surprises as measured by the Romer and Romer shocks, but they essentially die out
after two quarters. Following a 100 basis point US monetary policy surprise (annualized),
quarterly real GDP in emerging economies decline by around 0.5% after one quarter but this
initial negative effect reverses. Bilateral exchange rates initially depreciate by around 4%
(quarterly). The inflation rate initially increases by around 250 basis points (annualized),
which could be due to strong exchange rate pass-through, but the subsequent decline is
suggestive of a price puzzle, similar to that found in advanced economies. Domestic policy
rates are initially tightened by nearly 200 basis points (annualized) in response to the 100
basis point US monetary policy tightening, but this initial tightening is quickly reversed
after one quarter. In terms of the impact on gross capital flows, the impulse responses show
a retrenchment of capital flows in response to US monetary policy tightening. There is a
persistent fall in portfolio debt inflows to emerging economies which decline by nearly 3% of
GDP (quarterly), and remain around 1% lower after four quarters. In addition, (quarterly)
portfolio debt outflows also fall following US monetary policy tightening. This evidence of
the retrenchment of gross capital flows is similar to that in Alberola et al. (2012) who find
falls in both capital in- and out-flows from emerging economies following periods of financial
stress.
    We now go on to develop a DSGE model of macroeconomic spillovers which can be used
to construct a theoretical counterpart to these empirical results.

3. The Global Model
    Our results are structured around a two country core-periphery model. The centre/core
country is assumed to be large relative to the peripheral country. We denote the emerging
economy with the superscript ‘e’ and the centre country with the superscript ‘c’.
    The schemata for our model is described in Figure 3.1. In the centre country there are
households, global financiers (banks or asset managers2 ), capital goods producers, production
firms, and a monetary authority. There is a global capital market for one-period risk free
bonds. In the emerging market country there are also households, local borrowers (banks or
financial managers), capital goods producers, production firms, and a monetary authority.
The centre country households make deposits with global financiers at the centre country
risk free rate, and can hold centre country one-period nominal government debt, which may
also be traded on international capital markets. The global banks receive deposits from
households in the centre country, and invest in risky centre country technologies, as well
as in emerging market banks. Along the lines of Gertler and Karadi (2011), banks in both
countries finance purchases of capital from capital goods producers, and rent this capital to
goods producers. The borrowing banks in the emerging market economy are funded through
loans from global banks/financiers.3 There are two levels of agency constraints; global banks
must satisfy a net worth constraint in order to be funded by their domestic depositors, and
local EME banks in turn must have enough capital in order to receive loans from global
banks. In both countries, the production goods firms use capital and labour to produce
differentiated goods, which are sold to retailers. Retailers are monopolistically competitive
and sell to final consuming households, subject to a constraint on their ability to adjust
prices. This set of assumptions constitutes the minimum arrangement whereby capital flows
from advanced economies to EMEs have a distinct directional pattern, financial frictions
act to magnify capital slow spillovers, and (due to sticky prices) the monetary policy and
exchange rate regime may have real consequences for the nature of spillovers and economic
fluctuations.
    The emerging country is essentially a mirror image of the centre country, except that
households in the emerging country do not finance local banks, but instead engage in inter-
temporal consumption smoothing through the purchase and sale of centre currency denom-
inated nominal bonds.4 Banks in the emerging market use their own capital and financing
from global financiers to make loans to local entrepreneurs. The net worth constraints on
banks in both the emerging market and centre countries are motivated along the lines of

    2
      In the remainder of the paper, to simplify the discussion, we will refer to capital goods financiers in both
the centre and peripheral countries as banks. It should be noted however that the key thing that distinguishes
them is that they make levered investments, and are subject to contract-enforcement constraints. In this
sense, they need not be literally banks in the strict sense.
    3
      This assumption is meant to capture the feature that within-country financial intermediation between
savers and investors is more difficult in EMEs than in advanced economies. See e.g. Mendoza Quadrini and
Rios-Rull 2009. We could relax the extreme assumption that EME households did not directly finance EME
banks. Under the reasonable assumption that frictions in intermediation within EMEs exceeded those in the
centre country, our qualitative results would remain unchanged.
    4
      We assume that the market for centre country nominal bonds is frictionless. Adding additional frictions
that limit the ability of emerging market households to invest in centre country nominal bonds would just
exacerbate the impact of financial frictions that are explored below.

3.1. The Emerging Market Economy (EME)
    A fraction n of the world’s households live in the emerging economy. Households consume
and work, and act separately as bankers. A banker member of a household has probability θ
of continuing as a banker, upon which she will accumulate net worth, and a probability 1−θ of
exiting to the status of a consuming / working household member, upon which all net worth
will be deposited to her household’s account. In every period, non-bank household members
are randomly assigned to be bankers so as to keep the population of bankers constant.
    While EME households don’t have access to the local financial market, they can trade in
international bonds (Bte ) with foreign agents.5 These bonds can be thought of as T-bills of the
core country (rebated directly to core-country households), deposits at core-country financial
intermediaries, or simply bonds traded directly with core-country households. Under the
assumptions of our model these three alternatives are equivalent.6
    Households in the EME have preferences over (per capita) consumption Cte and labor Hte
supply given by:

where consumption is broken down further into consumption of home (Cet ) and foreign (Ccte )
baskets as
                                                                        1
                                                                       1−η

                               Cte   = v Cet       + (1 − v ) Cct

Here η > 0 is the elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods, v e ≥ n indicates
the presence of home bias in preferences,7 and we assume in addition that within each basket,
goods are differentiated and within country elasticities of substitution are σp > 1.
   Given this, the true price index for EME households is
                                                                              1
                                     Pte = v e Pet1−η + (1 − v e )Pct1−η
                                                                            1−η

    Then the household budget constraint is described as follows
                                                                  ∗
                              Pte Cte + St Bte = Wte Hte + Πet + Rt−1     e
                                                                      St Bt−1

    Households purchase dollar (centre country) denominated debt (Bte ). St is the nominal

   5
      This is clearly an extreme case. In reality EME households’ saving does reach domestic firms via
the local banks too. Since, in our model, EME households can lend to domestic firms indirectly, via the
international financial market, our assumption emphasizes the strong influence that core-country financial
conditions exert on EME financial markets.
    6
      In particular we are not assuming a special role for government debt, nor asymmetries in the degree to
which the contract between depositors and core-country banks can be enforced.
    7
      Home bias is adjusted to take into account of country size. In particular, for a given degree of openness
x ≤ 1, v e = 1 − x(1 − n), and a similar transformation for the centre country home bias parameter.

   Given two-stage budgeting, it is straightforward (and omitted here) to break down con-
sumption expenditure of households into home and foreign consumption baskets.

3.2. Capital goods producers
    Capital producing firms in the EME buy back the old capital from banks at price Qet (in
units of the consumption aggregator) and produce new capital from the final good in the
EME economy subject to the following adjustment cost function:
                                                  e

where Ite represents investment in terms of the EME aggregator good.
  EME banks then finish the capital goods and rent them to intermediate goods producers.8

                                       Kte = Ite + (1 − δ)Kt−1
                                                           e


where Kte is the capital stock in production.

3.3. EME banks
    EME banks begin with some bequeathed net worth from their household, and continue
to operate with probability θ, as described above. We also follow Gertler and Karadi in the
nature of the incentive constraint. Ex ante, EME banks have an incentive to abscond with
borrowed funds before the investment is made. Consequently, conditional on their net worth,
their leverage must be limited by a constraint that ensures that they have no incentive to
abscond.
                                                                            e
    At the end of time t a bank i that survives has net worth given by Nt,i   in terms the
EME good. It can use this net worth, in addition to debt raised from the global bank, to

    Equivalently, we could assume that the bank provides risky loans to intermediate goods producers,
who use the funds to purchase capital. The only risk of this loan concerns the (real) gross return on the
underlying capital stock.

where Rct−1 is the ex-post real interest rate received by the global bank, equal to the prede-
                                                                                            e
termined nominal interest rate adjusted by ex-post inflation in the centre country, and Rk,t
is the gross return on capital.
    Because it has the ability to abscond with the proceeds of the loan and its existing net
worth, the loan from the global bank must be structured so that the EME bank’s continuation
value from making the investment exceeds the value of absconding. Following Gertler and
Karadi (2011), we assume that the latter value is κet times the value of existing capital ( κet
is a random variable, and represents the stochastic degree of the agency problem). Hence
                                          e
denoting the bank’s value function by Jt,i  , it must be the case that
                                             e
                                            Jt,i ≥ κet Qet Kt+1,i
                                                            e
                                                                  .                                  (3.3.2)

This is the incentive compatibility constraint faced by the bank.
    Once the bank has made the investment, at the beginning of period t + 1 its return is
realized.
    The problem for an EME bank at time t is described as follows:


          e
                                 = Et Λet+1 (1 − θ)(Rk,t+1

                                                                                               e
                                                                                                    

subject to (3.3.1) and (3.3.2).
    The full set of first order conditions for this problem are set out in the Appendix.
    The evolution of net worth averaged across all EME banks, taking account that banks
exit with probability 1 − θ, and that new banks receive infusions of cash from households at
rate δT times the existing value of capital, can be written as:
                                                                       
             e             e     RERt+1          e e    RERt+1
          Nt+1 = θ (Rkt+1 −               Rc,t )Qt Kt +         Rc,t Nt + δT Qet Kt−1
                                                                      e           e
                                  RERt                   RERt
    The first term on the right hand side captures the increase in net worth due to surviving
banks, given their average return on investment. The second term represents the ‘start-up’
financing given to newly created banks by households.
    Firms in the EME hire labour and capital to produce retail goods. Since a central aim
of our analysis is to explore the role of monetary policy and the exchange rate regime for
capital flows and macroeconomic spillovers, we assume that firms in both countries have
Calvo-style sticky prices with Calvo re-set parameter 1 − ς. The representative EME firm

                                                        14
has production function given by:
                                                 e(1−α)       e(α)
                                     Yte = Aet Ht           Kt−1
   Given this, then we can define the aggregate return on investment for EME banks (aver-
aging across idiosyncratic returns) as
                                            e
                                  e        Rzt+1 + (1 − δ)Qet+1
                                 Rkt+1 =
                                                   Qet
where Rzt+1 is the rental rate on capital and δ is the depreciation rate on capital.
   The representative EME firm chooses labour and capital so as to minimize costs. We can
then define the EME firm’s real marginal cost implicitly by the conditions
                                                    e(−α)    e(α)
                              M Cet (1 − α)Aet Ht           Kt−1 = Wrte                    (3.3.3)

                                 M Cet αHt          Kt−1       = Rzt
    The Calvo pricing formulation implies the following specification for the PPI rate of
           ppi
inflation πet  in the EME. Here Π∗et denotes the inflation rate of newly adjusted goods prices,
Fet and Get are implicitly defined, and σpσ−1p
                                                represents the optimal static markup of price
over marginal cost:
                                               σp Fet ppi
                                     Π∗et =             π                               (3.3.4)

3.4. Monetary policy
    In the baseline specification, the central bank follows a flexible inflation targeting policy,
here captured by a generalized Taylor rule, i.e.
                                                    e               e 
                                                     πt                Yt
      log Rt = λr,e log Rt−1 + (1 − λr,e ) λπ,e log   e
                                                          + λ y,e log          + εer,t .   (3.4.1)
                                                     πss               Ysse

where εer,t is a monetary policy shock.
    In analysis below we will also consider the design of optimal monetary policies. We will
focus on Ramsey optimal policy with commitment (or ‘open loop’ optimal policy), where
the path of interest rates is adjusted in order to implement an optimal policy. We explore
the nature of optimal policy under two strategic assumptions about policy making. In the
first, we will assume that central banks cooperate in order to implement the Ramsey optimal
allocation. In this case they choose the allocation that maximizes the size-weighted average
of households’ welfare across countries, subject to the competitive equilibrium conditions.
Following this, we define and analyze a Ramsey optimal non-cooperative monetary policy,



                                                15
in which each central bank follows its own optimal monetary rule, taking that of the other
monetary authority as given.
   We will also consider the case of an exchange rate peg. In this case we implement the
EME central bank’s policy in terms of the simple targeting rule ∆St = 0. The details are
provided in Appendix A.9

3.5. The centre country
    The centre country households have similar preferences to those of the EME, and its
production firms sell to the emerging market country households. The centre country’s
financial institution (the global bank) receives deposits from the households and guarantees
them the risk-free interest rate in return. The global bank then invests in the centre country
technology as well as the EME bank debt.
    Centre country representative household preferences are:
                                     ∞
                                                                !
                                              c(1−σ)     c(1+ψ)
                                   X        C t        H t
                                E0      βt           −
                                    t=0
                                             1−σ        1+ψ
and their budget constraint is given by:

                               Ptc Ctc + Btc = Wtc Htc + Πct + Rt∗ Btc + Ttc
   Centre country households make deposits in the banking system, and receive returns Rt∗ .
They receive profits Πct from (financial and non financial) firms, net of capital infusions into
the new banks.
   The definition of centre country CPI’s, and bond and labour supply choices for the
centre country households are exactly analogous to those of the EME country, so we omit
them here. Likewise, the specification for capital producing firms and the dynamics of the
aggregate capital stock for global banks is identical to that described for the EME economy.
See Appendix A for details.

   9
     We do not explicitly model the central bank balance sheet or the consequences of alternative exchange
rate regimes for the accumulation of international reserves. This is justified on the same grounds as that of
Woodford (2003) who models monetary policy in ‘cashless’ economies abstracting from monetary aggregates
or the central bank balance sheet. In following this strategy, we are attempting to focus specifically on the
role of the exchange rate and interest rates as monetary policy levers for EMEs. A more extended analysis
could be done by explicitly modelling the effect of foreign exchange rate reserves. In particular, if as in
Bacchetta et al. (2013), we assumed the EME residents had limited access to international financial markets,
then central bank reserves, or foreign currency swaps with central banks, could play an effective role in
providing risk sharing. Alternatively, following Gertler and Karadi (2011) and Dedola et al. (2013), we could
allow for EME central banks to provide foreign currency loans to EME banks, thereby introducing a role
for unconventional monetary policy in EMEs. We abstract away from the first option in this paper, since
the consequences of limited capital mobility have been extensively examined elsewhere. The second option,
direct foreign currency loans or foreign currency swaps, could be an interesting alternative policy tool. So,
while in this paper we focus on standard policy interventions, we leave the second option for future research.
Nuguer (2015) constructs a multi-country model with a global interbank market in a similar fashion to our
model, and explores the effects of unconventional credit policies.




                                                     16
3.6. Centre country banks
    A representative global bank j has a balance sheet constraint given by

                                              Vjte + Qct Kjt
                                                          c
                                                             = Njtc + Btc
where Vjte is investment in the EME bank, and Qct Kjt c
                                                        is investment in the centre country
                  e                                 c
capital stock. Njt is the bank’s net worth, and Bt are deposits received from households.
All variables are denominated in real terms, (in terms of the centre country CPI).
    The global bank’s value function can then be written as:

          Jjtc = Et                      Λct+1 (1 − θ)(Rkt+1
                                                        c
                                                             Qct Kjt
                                                                  c
                                                                     + Rct Vjte − Rt∗ Btc ) + θJjt+1
                                                                                                c
                                                                                                    
                       c
                          max   e ,B c
                      Kj,t+1 ,Vjt   t


    Here, Λt+1 is the stochastic discount factor for centre country households, Rct is, as
described above, the return on the global bank’s loans to the EME bank, and Rt∗ is the
risk-free rate paid to domestic depositors.
    The bank faces the no-absconding constraint:

                                               Jjt ≥ κct Vjte + Qct Kjt
                                                                     c
                                                                          

where, as in the EME case, κct measures the degree of the agency problem, and as before we
assume it is subject to exogenous shocks.
    We describe the first order conditions for the global bank in detail in the appendix. As
in the case of the EME banks, we can describe the dynamics of net worth for the global
banking system by averaging across surviving banks, and including the ‘start-up’ funding
provided by centre country households. We then get the following law of motion for net
worth


        c              c
                            − Rt∗ Qct Ktc + (Rc,t − Rt∗ ) Vte + Rt∗ Ntc + δT Qct+1 Kt−1
                                                                                    c
                                                                      
       Nt+1 =θ        Rkt+1                                                             .                (3.6.1)

   Again, the details of the production firms and price adjustment in the centre country are
identical to those of the EME economy, so we leave the description to the appendix.

3.7. Monetary Policy
    The central bank of the centre country, in our baseline specification, follows a Taylor rule
of the type described above (see equation 3.4.1).

4. Calibration
    Our aim is to use the model to provide a general qualitative assessment of the empirical
evidence discussed above. We do not attempt to find the best fit of the theoretical model
with the data. Therefore, we take parameters values that fall generally in line with the

Table 1 summarizes the values assigned to the parameters. In particular, we set the openness
parameters ν e and ν c in line with the trade shares of the US with a group of emerging markets,
and the trade shares of the same group of EMEs with the US using the IMF DOT statistics

(average shares since 2000). Given that the two shares are very similar in the data we set
both to ν c = ν e = 0.96. The intertemporal elasticity of substitution is set at approximately
unity, so that σ = 1.02. The Armington elasticity of substitution between home and foreign
goods (η) is 1.5, while the micro elasticity of substitution σp is 6. The discount factor is set

at β = 0.99, while the Frisch elasticity of labour supply 1+ψ   is set at 0.8. The parameters of
production are standard; the share of hours in production, 1 − α is .7, while the depreciation
rate δ is set at 0.025 (at quarterly frequency), and the parameter in the adjustment cost
technology is 1.73. From Gertler and Karadi (2011) we take the banking sector parameters
so that θ = 0.96 (the survival rate of banks), κe = κc = 0.38 (i.e. the steady-state value of
the incentive compatibility parameter), and δT = 0.004 (i.e. the transfer rate to new banks).

   The probability of changing prices in a quarter (1 − ζ) is 0.2.
    We will focus on shocks to monetary policy and to ‘financial shocks’, represented by
shocks to the parameter κct , the fraction of investment that can be obtained by an absconding
global bank. We assume that monetary policy shocks are i.i.d. with a 1 percent standard
deviation. Shocks to κct are AR(1) processes with persistent 0.9 and standard deviation of 1
percent also. The Taylor rule coefficients are chosen at standard levels (see Table 1).

5. The impact of monetary policy on capital flows and international transmission
    We first explore the impact of centre country monetary shocks on global GDP, capital
flows, asset prices, leverage, and interest rate spreads. The main set of questions we are
interested in is how is the impact of monetary tightening in the centre country is affected
by the presence of financial frictions. In addition, how does the relationship between global
banks and local banks affect the spillover effects of monetary policy shocks, and how do
these spillovers compare to the effect of a monetary policy shock in a standard multi country
DSGE model without financial frictions?

   10
     As in Gertler and Karadi (2011), these parameters target the steady state interest spread of 100 basis
points, the horizon of bankers of about 10 years, and the steady state leverage ratio of 4. Although clearly
leverage ratios differ across jurisdictions, we do not attempt to match EME ratios, as there is wide variability
across different countries. A higher leverage ratio in the EME would magnify our results.



                                                      18
    In addition, we wish to go beyond the question of transmission with financial frictions to
address the question of how important is the monetary policy response in the EME country.
Does the exchange rate policy followed by the EME significantly affect the international
transmission mechanism in the presence of financial frictions? A closely related question is
to what extent does the currency of denomination of nominal liabilities affect the transmission
properties of the model in response to centre country monetary tightening. Does ‘liability
dollarization’ significantly exacerbate the cross country transmission of monetary shocks?
    Figure 5.1 illustrates the effect of a monetary policy tightening in the centre country
in the case without financial frictions.11 The monetary shock is scaled to represent a 1%
innovation to the policy rule.12 Without financial frictions, and under a flexible exchange
rate (plain line) the shock is almost wholly absorbed within the centre country. The EME
country’s real economy is well insulated from the monetary policy shock. The EME policy
rate rises only slightly, and there is a sharp real depreciation of the EME currency, but
almost no effect on EME GDP, investment, or asset prices. In the centre country itself,
there is a sharp fall in GDP, investment and asset prices. We note also that, in the absence
of financial frictions, the monetary policy tightening leads to an increase in bank lending to
the EME, and an increase in capital outflows from the EME. This pattern of gross capital
flows goes against the empirical evidence described above.
    The minimal degree of international transmission of monetary policy in the absence of
financial frictions is in line with traditional models, and supports the theoretical presumption
of an important role for flexible exchange rates in the response to external shocks. The Figure
also illustrates the effect of the same shock, but assuming that the EME central bank chooses
an exchange rate peg (but again without financial frictions, crossed line). In this case, the real
exchange rate depreciation is dampened significantly, the EME short term policy rate rises
sharply, and there is a significant fall in real GDP and investment in the EME. Interestingly
however, in this case, bank lending to the EME still rises, relative to the initial steady state.
    When we introduce financial frictions in the form described in our model however, the
results are dramatically different. Figure 5.2 shows that in the baseline case, with financial
frictions (solid-plain line), the monetary tightening in the centre country precipitates a large
and persistent fall in capital inflows to the EME. The fall in bank loans causes a sharp
fall in asset prices, an increase in bank leverage13 , and a rise in interest rate spreads in
the EME. There is a general fall in investment and GDP of similar orders of magnitude
in both the centre country and the EME. We also see a fall in capital outflows from the

   11
      In the IRFs, NFA E denotes the aggregate net foreign assets of the EME in terms of steady-state GDP
in units of the consumption aggregator. Households NFA, denotes the net foreign assets of the households
sector, in terms of their steady-state value. Note that EME-bank debt is also in terms of its steady-state value.
The latter is equal to households’ net foreign assets in the steady state (implying a zero net foreign asset
position in the steady state). ∆F X is the change in nominal foreign exchange, while “spread” measures the
ex-ante difference between the gross return on capital and the policy rate: a measure of financial inefficiency.
   12
      Due to the endogeneity of the policy rate, the latter moves by less.
   13
      The question of whether leverage is procylical or countercyclical has been debated in the literature.
Bruno and Shin 2014b, argue bank leverage is pro cyclical, but Gertler (2012), points out that book value
and market value leverage may move in different directions over the cycle. In particular, in a model similar
to ours, he shows that book value leverage may be procyclical while market value leverage is countercyclical,
as in our impulse responses.

EME, so that there is a general retrenchment in gross capital flows. The contrast with the
case without financial frictions is highlighted even more when we look at the comparison
of the quantitative effects on leverage, asset prices and spreads across the two countries.
Even though the monetary tightening is precipitated by the shock in the centre country, the
response of spreads, leverage and asset prices is greater in the EME. This is associated with
a much greater fall in investment spending in the EME than in the centre country itself.
    These results are consistent with the observation that emerging markets are highly sensi-
tive to sudden reversals of capital flows, especially those associated with monetary tightening
in advanced economy markets. The international transmission in this model is critically tied
to the financial amplification mechanism coming from the linkage between bank’s net worth
and their asset valuation. A monetary tightening reduces aggregate demand and invest-
ment, which leads to a fall in the price of capital. This leads to a fall in bankers net worth
in the centre country, amplifying the fall in investment. At the same time, the fall in centre
country bank net worth leads to fall in capital flows to the EME, reducing investment and
asset prices in the EME, generating a further fall in EME net worth. As a result interest
rate spreads rise in both countries. In contrast to the case without financial frictions, we see
that monetary tightening in the centre country leads to a substantial and persistence fall in
global bank lending to the EME.
    We can again ask how the exchange rate regime affects the international transmission in
the case of financial frictions. Here the results are very different from the conventional DSGE
model. With financial frictions and bank-balance sheet linkages, there is relatively little
difference between the baseline case and the EME monetary policy with pegged exchange
rates (dashed line). The exchange rate peg does limit the EME real depreciation. This
magnifies the fall in real GDP, since there is less compensating expenditure switching towards
EME goods. But the fall in capital inflows and outflows, the rise in leverage and spreads, the
fall in asset prices, and the fall in EME investment is almost identical to that in the baseline
case with flexible exchange rates. Thus, these results tend to support the argument that in
the presence of financial frictions in capital flows, there is only a limited role for nominal
exchange rate adjustment in insulating the economy from external shocks. We will see this
even more clearly in the case of a financial shock in the analysis below.
    How do the results depend on the denomination of bank lending? The baseline case
assumes that all borrowing is done in centre country currency (e.g. US dollars). Hence,
the centre country monetary shocks precipitates an unanticipated depreciation in the EME
currency that has a direct negative impact on the EME bank’s net worth. This negative
effect of ‘liability dollarization’ on balance sheets has been much discussed in the literature
on emerging market crises and exchange rate adjustment (Bruno and Shin, 2014). Figure 5.2
illustrates the case where debt is denominated in domestic currency (dotted line). In that
alternative specification, an unanticipated centre country monetary shock still generates a
real exchange rate depreciation for the EME country, but there is no direct negative valua-
tion effect on the EME banks balance sheet. The impulse responses show that under local
currency denomination of liabilities the transmission effect of the centre country monetary
contraction is lessened. There is a smaller spike in the EME spread relative to the baseline
case. EME leverage rises by less, and the asset price falls by less. Consequently the fall in
investment and GDP is reduced by about 30% at their trough. But even without the direct
valuation effect of the exchange rate change, the effect of the fall in centre country capital

flows still leads to a large balance sheet deterioration and a fall in real activity. Relative to
the case without financial frictions, there is still a large negative impact on EME investment
and real GDP.
    These results would seem to underscore the message of Rey (2013) and others, suggest-
ing that despite having flexible exchange rates, emerging market countries are extremely
vulnerable to volatile capital flows related to US monetary policy shocks. Under a conven-
tional monetary policy rule, exchange rate adjustment can then only play a limited role in
mitigating the impact of shocks, and it suggests the need for other direct forms of capital
restrictions or macro-prudential policies that directly target the balance sheets of banks.
    We should note of course that the monetary rule described above is an ad-hoc speci-
fication. An optimal monetary policy response can be designed that will do much better
in response to the centre country monetary shock. In the case of an optimal cooperative
monetary rule, this statement becomes trivial, because then it is always optimal to directly
offset the monetary shock itself, and the impact of the monetary shock is entirely eliminated.
But a more interesting question arises when the EME must respond unilaterally. We explore
this response in the section on non-cooperative monetary policy and financial shocks below.
    Finally, we note that the impact of shocks in our model is extremely asymmetric. Fig-
ure 5.3 reports the effect on both the EME and the centre country of a monetary policy
contraction of similar magnitude to that of Figure 5.2 but now coming from the EME. The
impact on the centre country real activity is negligible. This is to be expected, since the
EME is small relative to the world economy. There is a fall in GDP in the EME, since the
monetary contraction leads to an immediate real exchange rate appreciation. But remark-
ably, we find that the contraction in real activity in the EME is now smaller than in the
response to the centre country shock. The critical feature is that the monetary shock in the
EME does not directly impact on the EME bank’s balance sheet. In fact, there is a small
boost to the bank’s net worth, coming from the unanticipated real appreciation. But the
effects on spreads, leverage and asset prices is small, and as a consequence, investment falls
by substantially less than in response to an external monetary tightening.

6. Financial Shocks
    In this section we discuss the spillover effects of financial shocks originating in the centre
country.14 Figure 6.1 shows impulse responses for a 1% increase in the incentive compat-
ibility constraint parameter κct . The first noticeable effect of this shock is the relatively
strong comovement across countries. As discussed by Devereux and Yetman (2010) and
Dedola and Lombardo (2012), financial shocks in one single economy, in a world charac-
terized by financial integration and financial frictions, can generate highly synchronized

  14
     The 2008-2009 financial crisis has motivated considerable research on the role of credit shocks. Jermann
and Quadrini (2012) show, in a model with financial constraints, that financial shocks can explain the 2008-
2009 US recession as well as other previous episodes. Helbling et al. (2011) provide empirical evidence on
the role of financial shocks in driving global recessions. Boivin et al. (2013) shed light on the macroeconomic
consequences of financial shocks for the US economy using a large set of macro and financial variables.
Christiano et al. (2014) estimate a DSGE model with financial frictions à la Bernanke et al. (1999) and show
that financial shocks (the idiosyncratic shock to financially constrained borrowers) are the most important
shock driving the business cycle.

responses across countries. As in the case of the response to centre country monetary policy
shocks, we see that impulse responses are essentially invariant to the exchange rate regime
or the currency denomination of liabilities. The synchronization of credit spreads (measured
as wedges between the return on capital and the domestic policy rate) is the dominant factor
in generating business cycle movements. Again, the contraction in the emerging economy is
markedly larger than that in the centre country (the epicentre of the shock), mainly due to
the asymmetric size of the two economic regions.15 In terms of capital flows the consequence
of the centre-country financial shock is a “retrenchment” of international capital. As before,
gross inflows into EME banks fall as do EME outflows from households. This adjustment is
reminiscent of the capital flows observed during the 2008-2009 financial crisis (e.g. Broner
et al., 2013).

7. Optimal cooperative monetary policy
    So far we have documented that financial market integration can generate disproportional
effects on EME of shocks originating in the centre country, quite independently of the ex-
change rate regime. These results, therefore, seem to provide theoretical support to the idea
of the changed nature of the monetary policy problem in a world characterized by financial
market integration: even under flexible exchange rates, free capital mobility is incompatible
with an independent domestic monetary policy (Rey, 2013).16 Nevertheless, in this section
we show that a more appropriate description of the effects of financial integration on the pol-
icy problem is that capital flows exacerbate the policy trade-offs and, thus, require different
policy strategies. It is well known that openness, in general, affects the optimal monetary
policy response to shocks (e.g. Corsetti et al., 2010, Faia and Monacelli, 2008, Devereux and
Sutherland, 2007, Devereux and Engel, 2003, Lombardo and Ravenna, 2014 and Kolasa and
Lombardo, 2014). In particular a monetary policy strategy that seems appropriate under a
particular mix of shocks ceases to be attractive under a different mix of shocks. Financial
integration not only changes the trade-offs faced by central banks, it also changes the type
of shocks that the economy is likely to experience. To illustrate this point, we study the
response of the two economies to financial shocks under the Ramsey cooperative optimal
policy.17 .

      Note that the “financial wedges” move almost identically. The double layer of financial frictions de
facto faced by the EME bank does not generate larger spreads than in the centre country.
   16
      Georgiadis and Mehl (2015) provide some GVAR-based evidence that financial integration might actu-
ally have increased monetary policy effectiveness, due to valuation effects.

      Fujiwara et al. (2015) provides theoretical support to the idea that cooperation in the presence of
financial frictions is welfare improving.

the households) and Yt is the vector containing all the endogenous variables of the model. In
solving for the optimal policy we follow the “timeless” perspective advocated by Woodford
(2003).
    Figure 7.1 compares the baseline case with the optimal cooperative policy. The optimal
policy reduces considerably the effect of financial shocks on both economies. In particular
the EME spread increases only modestly and less than the spread in the centre country.
This is reflected in a considerably smaller asset-price decline and, thus, in a smaller fall in
investment. Leverage and spreads co-move much less across countries than under the Taylor
rule. In order to achieve this allocation, the Ramsey policy-maker needs to depart from the
interest rate adjustment observed under the Taylor rule. In particular nominal interest rates
fall markedly in both countries and inflation is allowed to increase, albeit only temporarily.
The real exchange rate in the EME appreciates on impact, providing extra relief to the
balance sheet of EME banks. The optimal policy strongly mitigates capital “retrenchment”,
thus preventing the strong credit contraction that the Taylor rule brings about.
    The implication of these results is that domestic monetary policy matters, in a non-
trivial way, even under financial integration and financial frictions in international capital
flows. Nevertheless, it also shows that financial integration, and the spillovers of foreign
financial shocks that come with openness, do exacerbate the trade-offs faced by central
banks. The objective of inflation stabilization cannot be achieved to the same extent as in a
frictionless international capital market. Stabilization of financial market variables becomes
an important objective of policy, suggesting room for macro-prudential interventions (e.g.
Farhi and Werning, 2013).

8. Non-cooperative monetary policy
    The previous sections showed that while a naive Taylor rule has little advantage over
an exchange rate peg, an optimal cooperative discretionary monetary policy could play an
effective role in dealing with spillovers in international financial markets. But an obvious
objection to this is that cooperative monetary policy is an unrealistic ideal. Practically
speaking, monetary policy is set at the national level based on domestic objectives. How
would our results differ if we allow for optimal monetary policy, but recognizing that policy
is set by each country separately? In this section we analyse the effects of non-cooperative,
self-oriented monetary policies. In particular we solve our model for the open-loop, Nash
equilibrium and compare it with the baseline Taylor-type rule and the globally optimal
Ramsey policy.
    As is well known, there is no single non-cooperative optimal policy, as the solution de-
pends on the strategy space underlying the game. Also, defining the strategy space in terms
of policy rates does not yield a saddle-path equilibrium. Alternatively one could choose to
solve for the non-cooperative equilibrium in terms of explicit instrument rules (closed-loop
Nash equilibrium). Nevertheless, in this case too there is some degree of arbitrariness both
in the choice of the instrument and in the choice of the feedback variables and lags. Mindful
of these issues, we proceed by providing results for a baseline case where the strategy space
is defined in terms of PPI inflation (as for example in Benigno and Benigno, 2006).

private agents and resource constraints, see Appendix for details), where Yte is the vector
containing all the endogenous variables of the model except the foreign variable that co-
defines the strategy space.18 A similar problem is solved by the center-country central bank.
    The set of first order conditions of the two monetary authorities jointly defines the set of
best-responses and, thus, the implicit policy rules followed by the central banks. As in the
optimal cooperative monetary policy case, we follow the “timeless” perspective advocated
by Woodford (2003).

9. Comparison
    Figure 9.1 compares the (cooperative) Ramsey policy with the Taylor-type rule used in
our baseline specification as well as with the non-cooperative policy described above, under
the assumption that the strategy space is defined in terms of domestic PPI inflation rates.
    Under this strategy the non-cooperative policy generates dynamics in the main macro
variables that are essentially identical to the fully cooperative one.
    The lessons that we can draw from this results are the following. First, monetary policy is
crucial in determining the response of the economy to shocks (compare the arbitrary Taylor-
type rule with the two optimal rules). Second, an appropriately chosen monetary policy
can considerably mitigate the spillovers from foreign shocks. Third, a self-oriented monetary
policy response can achieve the same outcome of the fully cooperative policy.
    So, while financial frictions and financial globalization could generate scope for coopera-
tion in other policy dimensions (e.g. regulation), our analysis suggests that, to first order,
the response of the economies under the two regimes (cooperation and non-cooperation)
are virtually identical. The intuition behind this similarity is the following. Self-oriented
stabilization requires smoothing of credit-spread volatility. This policy is beneficial for all
countries. The spillover from foreign stabilization, while positive, is not strong enough to
generate free-riding incentives (e.g. see Dedola et al., 2013), since, in particular, financial
structures are not symmetric. The classic negative spillovers due to price rigidities are also
sufficiently small (e.g. Obstfeld and Rogoff, 2002). The net result entails negligible gains
from cooperation.
    As a caveat, it should be noted that we are not considering exceptionally large shocks
leading to a liquidity-trap equilibrium. Looking at the coordination gains of unconventional

   18
     Thus, if the PPI inflation rates πtppi,e and πtppi,c define the strategy space, Yte excludes πtppi,c and Ytc
excludes πtppi,e . The policymakers recognize that the counterpart can freely choose one variable: it has one
degree of freedom.

analysis.19

10. Conclusions
    The post crisis years have exposed substantial strains in the workings of the international
financial system. Excessive volatility in international capital flows have raised questions
about the efficacy of self-oriented monetary policies and the benefits of flexible exchange
rates under inflation targeting.
    We offer some further empirical evidence on the international transmission of US mon-
etary policy shocks to emerging market economies. We do so by applying local projection
methods to a large panel of countries and conditioning on monetary policy shocks identified
using standard techniques. We find that US monetary policy shocks tends to generate a
contraction in emerging markets, as well as a fall in both in- and out-flows of capital: a
global retrenchment.
    We then develop a simple template which allows both for an understanding of the sources
of excess volatility of capital flows to emerging markets, as well as an evaluation of policy
responses to capital flows. We show that, like in the data, under financial frictions a core-
country monetary policy shock generates a contraction in the emerging economy, alongside
a global capital retrenchment. We show that financial frictions play a crucial role both in
our positive as well as in our normative analysis. Absent financial frictions, and with flexible
exchange rates, the spillovers to the emerging economy are minimal.
    Our results indicate that the simple prescriptions about the benefits of flexible exchange
rates and inflation targeting are very unlikely to hold in a global financial environment domi-
nated by the currency and policy of a large financial centre, such as the current situation with
the US dollar and US monetary policy. Our preliminary analysis does suggest however that
an optimal monetary policy can substantially improve the workings of the international sys-
tem, even in the absence of direct intervention in capital markets through macro-prudential
policies or capital controls. Moreover, under the specific assumptions maintained in this
paper, this outcome can still be consistent with national independence in policy, or in other
words, a system of ‘self-oriented’ monetary policy making.

Appendix A. Full list of equations used in the simulation
    In this appendix we list all the equations of the model used in the derivation of the numerical results.
    All variables preceded by exp are in expressed in logs (i.e. we take a log-approximation). A ss subscript
indicates the value of that variable in the non-stochastic steady state. For simplicity we omit the expectation
operator, with the understanding that variables dated t + 1 are unknown at time t, so that the related
expression implicitly involves the expectation operator
