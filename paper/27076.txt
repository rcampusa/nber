Generosity Across the Income and Wealth Distributions
Jonathan Meer and Benjamin A. Priday
NBER Working Paper No. 27076
May 2020
JEL No. D31,D64,H41

                                          ABSTRACT

Despite widespread interest, there is little systematic evidence on the relationship between
income, wealth, and charitable giving. We use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to provide
descriptive statistics on this relationship. We find that, irrespective of specifica-tion, donative
behavior increases with greater resources.
