                                          ABSTRACT

We estimate a Markov-switching mixture of two familiar macroeconomic models: a richly parameterized
DSGE model and a corresponding BVAR model. We show that the Markov-switching mixture model
dominates both individual models and improves the fit considerably. Our estimation indicates that
the DSGE model plays an important role only in the late 1970s and the early 1980s. We show how
to use the mixture model as a data filter for estimation of the DSGE model when the BVAR model
is not identified. Moreover, we show how to compute the impulse responses to the same type of shock
shared by the DSGE and BVAR models when the shock is identified in the BVAR model. Our exercises
demonstrate the importance of integrating model uncertainty and parameter uncertainty to address
potential model misspecification in macroeconomics.

              CONFRONTING MODEL MISSPECIFICATION IN
                        MACROECONOMICS

                                  I. Introduction

  In this paper we study and estimate a Markov-switching mixture of two familiar
macroeconomic models: a medium-scale linearized dynamic stochastic general equi-
librium (DSGE) model and a Bayesian vector autoregression (BVAR) model. This
exercise is motivated by policy analysis dealing with situations where there are mul-
tiple models and each model may be misspecified. Practical policy discussions often
proceed with combining the implications from different models in an informal way. For
our exercise to be econometrically coherent and practically implementable, we build on
the recent work of Geweke and Amisano (2011) by estimating a time-varying mixture
of these two medium-scale macroeconomic models in which the time variation in the
weights assigned to the two models follows a Markov-switching process. Our objective
is to explore empirical implications of such a Markov-switching mixture model using a
standard set of U.S. time series data.
  Geweke and Amisano (2011) propose an optimal pool of alternative models, where
the pool combines predictive densities of alternative models. Predictive densities of
each model in the pool, as well as the parameters for any parametric model, are taken
as given. The optimal pool concerns the estimation of model weights only.
  We extend Geweke and Amisano (2011)’s approach in two dimensions. First, we
study a formal mixture of heterogenous models by estimating the parameters and the
combining weights simultaneously. Second, we allow model weights to switch between
two regimes to explore the possibility that the importance of a particular model may
change over time. To make our exercise relevant and at the same time feasible to
implement, we focus on only two macroeconomic models that are often used in the
literature.
  The DSGE and BVAR models studied in this paper are sufficiently heterogenous
to yield different economic implications. The DSGE model is tightly parameterized
around carefully chosen economic structures, whereas the BVAR model is loosely pa-
rameterized with relatively few theoretical preconceptions. The mixture of these two
models enables us to address both model uncertainty and parameter uncertainty jointly.

The Markov-switching feature allows us to study two possible regimes and to determine
when model weights change.
  Our application yields the following key findings. First, the Markov-switching mix-
ture model dominates both the DSGE and BVAR models according to the marginal
data density (MDD) measure.1 The estimation of the MDD is computationally de-
manding, but it is necessary for gauging the fit of the Markov-switching mixture model.
For the completeness of our analysis, we also compute the MDD for the mixture model
with constant weights. We find that much of the improvement in model fit comes
from the constant-weight mixture model. However, allowing regime-dependent model
weights not only improves the fit further but also enables us to identify the periods in
which the DSGE model or the BVAR model plays an important role.
  Second, the estimated posterior probabilities of two regimes reveal that in one regime
the DSGE model plays an important role only in the late 1970s and the early 1980s,
with the estimated model weight being 0.43. The BVAR model weight is 0.57 in the
same regime. In the other regime the BVAR model dominates the DSGE model. This
regime covers all other periods than the late 1970s and the early 1980s, including the
latest three recessions. Thus, only in certain periods can the DSGE model become an
important factor for the improvement in model fit.
  Third, the estimated Markov-switching mixture model is used to filter the data for
estimation of the DSGE model. Since the regime in which the BVAR model dominates
covers 76% of the sample, the mixture model effectively discounts the observations
in this regime when the DSGE parameters are estimated. Moreover, in the periods
when the DSGE model weight is significant, the data is partially discounted due to
the continuing influence of the BVAR model. As a result, the estimates of the DSGE
parameters differ considerably from those where the DSGE model is estimated alone
with the full sample. We use the impulse responses to a capital depreciation shock in
the DSGE model as an example to show that both the magnitude and the uncertainty

   The term “marginal data density” used in the macroeconomic literature is the same concept as
the “marginal likelihood” used in the statistics literature. That is, the MDD is an integral of the prior
density times the likelihood function, with both the prior and the likelihood being proper probability
density functions. When the two models are compared, the Bayes factor defined as the ratio of the
two MDDs is often used to determine which model fits to the data better.
            CONFRONTING MODEL MISSPECIFICATION IN MACROECONOMICS                        3

about these impulse responses are substantially larger than those where the DSGE
model is estimated alone over the full sample.
  Fourth, we show how to compute the impulse responses to the same type of shock
when both individual models in the mixture are structural. In our case, we set up the
BVAR model as a structural model to identify a shock to monetary policy. Since the
responses conditional on each model are tightly estimated, economic implications about
the effect of a monetary policy shock differ from the DSGE model to the BVAR model.
Once we recognize that each model may be misspecified and take model uncertainty
into account, we show that the estimate of the effect of a monetary policy shock is
smaller, but the probability bands around the estimate are larger than what is implied
from the BVAR model. We discuss how the effect of a monetary policy shock changes
from one regime to the other. Thus, our application illustrates an effective way of using
the Markov-switching mixture model for structural analysis.
  The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II provides a brief literature
review. In Section III we lay out a general framework. In Section IV we apply the
general framework to our specific case study and estimate a Markov-switching mixture
model of the DSGE and BVAR models. Section V reports different measures of fit
for the DSGE model, the BVAR model, the simple mixture model, and the Markov-
switching mixture model. In Section VI we show how to use the estimated Markov-
switching mixture model as a data filter for estimating the impulse responses to a
capital depreciation shock in the DSGE model. In Section VII we show how to perform
a full structural analysis when a monetary policy shock is identified in the BVAR model.
Concluding remarks are made in Section VIII.

                               II. Literature review

  The key contribution of this paper is an application of a general Markov-switching
mixture framework to two medium-scale macroeconomic models. The general frame-
work consists of two components. As there exists a large strand of literature on each
component, we focus on only a small handful of references that are most relevant to this
paper. The first component is a simple mixture of alternative models. The predictive
density in the mixture is a linear combination of predictive densities of individual mod-
els. The idea of combining point forecasts can be traced back to Bates and Granger
(1969) and Diebold (1991). In a recent work, Geweke and Amisano (2011) propose a
               CONFRONTING MODEL MISSPECIFICATION IN MACROECONOMICS                                  4

method of pooling individual models by combining predictive densities instead of point
forecasts.2 Fisher and Waggoner (2010) extend a pool of models emphasized by Geweke
and Amisano (2011) to a mixture of models and argue for the Bayesian approach to
estimation of the mixture model.
  The second component is a Markov-switching process applied to model weights. An
earlier paper by Harrison and Stevens (1976) introduces a Markov process in a mixture
model with an emphasis on changes in the noise and disturbance matrices. West
and Harrison (1997) allow model weights to change over time in dynamic forecasting
exercises. The modern analysis of Markov-switching dynamic models can be found in,
for example, Hamilton (1989), Chib (1996), Kim and Nelson (1999), and Frühwirth-
Schnatter (2006).
  The literature on model misspecification is large, and different approaches have been
taken to confront this issue. Del Negro and Schorfheide (2004) address potential DSGE
model misspecification by introducing the prior implied by a DSGE model into a BVAR
model. Further discussions about using the DSGE-VAR approach and about how it is
related to Ingram and Whiteman (1994) can be found in Del Negro and Schorfheide
(2009) and Del Negro and Schorfheide (Forthcoming). Hansen and Sargent (2001) and
Brock, Durlauf, and West (2003) provide the robustness-control framework to address
model misspecification. Using this idea, Cogley and Sargent (2005) study an economy
in which agents, facing model uncertainty, compute the posterior odds ratios over three
models and make decisions by Bayesian model averaging. Our analysis centers on a
Markov-switching mixture of the DSGE and BVAR models and is mostly related to
Geweke and Amisano (2011).



                        III. A general econometric framework

  To integrate model uncertainty and parameter uncertainty, we use the Bayesian ap-
proach. In our general setup we allow the weights in a linear combination of predictive
densities of individual heterogenous models to vary across regimes. We assume that
there are a total of n models (Mi for i = 1, . . . , n) in the study and that the observed

script “o” denotes the observed data. The notation Θi represents a vector of parameters

                                                                                         
for model i. The notation “Mi ” in the predictive density function p yt | Yt−1 , Θi , Mi
is not redundant because in the end we compare the marginal data density of model i,
denoted by p (YTo | Mi ), with the marginal data density of the mixture model, denoted
by p (YTo ).
                                                                                                     Pn

The regime variable st is an unobservable state and follows a Markov process with the
transition matrix Q = [qk,j ], where qk,j = Prob [st = k | st−1 = j] for k, j = 1, . . . , h.
The total number of regimes is h.
  Grouping all the parameters together, we have

                 Θ = {Θ1 , · · · , Θn }, w = {wi,k } for k = 1, . . . , h, i = 1, . . . , n.

Since st is unobservable, we integrate out st to obtain the conditional likelihood as
                                          h
                                          X

                                                                                                 

                                          st =1

The log likelihood function is thus given by

                        log p (YTo |Θ, Q, w)        =          log p yto | Yt−1

where the parameters Θ, Q, and w are to be estimated jointly.
  A special case of our Markov-switching framework is a mixture model with constant
weights. In model comparison we include this simple mixture model to gauge how
important a convex combination of predictive densities is in improving model fit.
  3In   an earlier draft, we impose the restriction that one of the weights wi,st is equal to 1 and others
are set to 0. The restriction, similar to the approach taken by McCulloch and Tsay (1994), reflects the
idea that only one model is operative at a time. Our current setup is more general and encompasses
the special case in which one of the weights wi,st is restricted to be 1.
              CONFRONTING MODEL MISSPECIFICATION IN MACROECONOMICS                                    6

  Given the prior p (Θ, Q, w) and the likelihood function (1), we form the posterior
density function proportional to the product of the likelihood function and the prior
density function:

                       p (Θ, Q, w | YTo ) ∝ p (YTo | Θ, Q, w) p (Θ, Q, w) .                         (2)


                                        IV. Application

  We apply the general framework presented in Section III to two types of widely used
models, a medium-scale DSGE model and a BVAR model. Since n = 2 in our case,
we adopt the notation i ∈ {DSGE, BV AR}. We focus on only two regimes, so that
h = 2.
  The DSGE model, based on Liu, Waggoner, and Zha (2011), is built on a combina-
tion of Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2000), Altig, Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Linde
(2004), and Smets and Wouters (2007).4 The DSGE model is fit to eight quarterly vari-
ables: quarterly growth of real per capita GDP (∆ log YtData ), quarterly growth of real
per capita consumption (∆ log CtData ), quarterly growth of real per capita investment
in capital goods unit (∆ log ItData ), quarterly growth of the real wage (∆ log wtData ),
the quarterly GDP-deflator inflation rate (πtData ), quarterly growth of per capita hours
(∆ log LData
        t    ), the federal funds rate (FFRData
                                           t    ), and quarterly growth of investment-
specific technology (∆ log QData
                            t    ) as measured by the inverse of the relative price of
investment. A detailed description of the data is given in Appendix A. The data in
the initial four quarters from 1960:I to 1960:IV are used to obtain the initial condition
at 1961:I for the Kalman filter. Thus, the effective sample used for model evaluation
is from 1961:I to 2010:II.
  The BVAR model has the same eight variables as the DSGE model; and it has four
lags from 1960:I to 1960:IV, so that the effective sample is also from 1961:I to 2010:II.
We use the standard BVAR model with the Sims and Zha (1998) prior.5

  4A   detailed description of the model is given in Appendix D.
  5Using   the notation of Sims and Zha (1998), µ1 = µ2 = µ3 = µ4 = 1, where µ1 controls overall
tightness of the random walk prior, µ2 controls relative tightness of the random walk prior on the
lagged coefficients, µ3 controls relative tightness of the prior on the constant term, and µ4 controls
tightness of the prior that dampens the erratic sampling effects on lag coefficients (lag decay).

  In estimation of the Markov-switching mixture of the DSGE and BVAR models, we
maintain the assumption that agents in the DSGE model form their expectations with-
out accounting for model uncertainty. To focus on the discussion of regime-dependent
weights and their posterior probabilities, we leave to Appendix D the presentation and
discussion of the prior distribution and the posterior estimates of DSGE parameters in
our Markov-switching mixture model. The transition matrix for the Markov process is

where 2s=1 qs,k = 1 for k = 1, 2. The prior density for Q is a Dirichlet probability
density:
                                                 2
                                                 X
                                       p(Q) ∝            (qs,k )(αs,k −1) ,
                                                 s,k=1

where αs,k > 0. Following Sims, Waggoner, and Zha (2008), we express a prior belief
that the average duration for each regime is between six and seven quarters. The
belief implies that the expected value of the probability of staying in the same regime
is Eqs,s = 8.5 and the corresponding hyperparameter value is αs,s = 5.6667. The
hyperparameter αs,k for s 6= k is set to 1.0 to allow for the possibility that the regime
may be absorbent (i.e., qs,s = 1).6 The prior for model weights in each regime is also
of Dirichlet form. Table 1 summarizes the prior distributions of both weights and
transition parameters.
  Given the prior and the data, the estimation and inference strategy is as follows:

Appendix C provides details of implementation at each step of our estimation and
simulation approach. Note that since the likelihood is of very high dimension, the
MCMC simulations will not deliver a point that is even close to the posterior mode.
Moreover, the posterior mode serves as an important benchmark for selecting a good
starting point for our MCMC simulator (see Appendix C for detailed discussions).
  Table 2 reports the posterior estimates and the 90% probability intervals for weights
and transition parameters. The probability intervals are computed from our MCMC
posterior draws. For each posterior draw, we label the regimes so that the weight of the
DSGE model in the first regime is less than that in the second regime. This label nor-
malization is a computationally efficient way to approximate the Wald normalization
discussed in Hamilton, Waggoner, and Zha (2007); and it is similar to the normal-
ization proposed by Sims and Zha (2006) in which the smoothed probabilities of a
regime for each posterior draw of the model parameters match closest to the smoothed
probabilities of that regime based on the posterior estimates of the parameters.
  In the first regime, the BVAR model dominates the DSGE model; the DSGE model
receives almost no weight at the posterior mode (even the upper bound of the 90%
probability interval gives the weight of only 8%). In the second regime, however, over
40% of the weight is assigned to the DSGE model at the mode estimate. Figure 1
displays marginal posterior probability distributions of the weights for the DSGE and
BVAR models. The marginal posterior distribution of the DSGE model’s weight is
skewed to the right or, symmetrically, the marginal posterior distribution of the BVAR
model’s weight is skewed to the left. As a result, the 90% probability intervals for
these weights differ only by less than 5%. It is evident that the DSGE model plays an
important role in the second regime.
  The posterior estimates of q1,1 and q2,2 , reported in Table 2, indicate that the proba-
bility of staying in the same regime is high. Although both regimes are persistent, the
first regime is more persistent than the second regime so that the ergodic probability
for the first regime is 0.77, implying that on average the second regime occurs only
23% of the time.7


  7For   only two regimes, as in our case, the values of q1,1 and q2,2 are all we need to know to compute
the ergodic probability. In general, however, the ergodic probability depends on the entire transition
matrix Q.

  When we restrict model weights to be constant throughout the whole sample and
estimate this constant-weight mixture model, the estimate of the DSGE model’s weight
is only 0.091. The magnitude of this estimate, however, is consistent with the estimates
in our Markov-switching case. Since the ergodic probability of the second regime is
estimated to be 0.23 and the DSGE model’s weight is estimated to be 0.43, the average
weight of the DSGE model is 0.23 × 0.43 = 0.10. In this respect the constant-weight
mixture model and the Markov-switching mixture model reveal the similar information
about the average role of the DSGE model throughout the history.
  Del Negro and Schorfheide (2004) connect a DSGE model to a BVAR model using
a parameter indicating the importance of each model, which they call λ. In their
approach, λ is not a weight on the predictive density but has some similar implications.

When λ is small, the data favors their DSGE model more than their BVAR model.
When λ approaches infinity, the data prefers the BVAR model. They find that λ is
relatively small. One main objective of their paper is to find a good prior for their
BVAR model. As discussed in Del Negro and Schorfheide (Forthcoming), the DSGE
prior derived in their approach has properties similar to the Sims and Zha (1998)
prior. Since our BVAR model has incorporated the Sims and Zha (1998) prior, it is
not surprising that the DSGE model’s weight in our framework is small on average
throughout the sample.
  In contrast to the constant-weight case, what is new in the Markov-switching case is
information about particular times of the history when the DSGE model is important.
Figure 2 displays the posterior (smoothed) probabilities of the second regime, condi-
tional on the posterior estimates of model parameters. In this regime both the DSGE
model and the BVAR model play an important role. The DSGE model matters for the
late 1970s and the early 1980s, the periods that cover three adjacent recessions. For

these periods the predictive densities of the DSGE model are in general much higher
than those of the BVAR model. The DSGE model, however, does not receive all the
weight because there is a non-trivial probability of switching from this regime to the
first regime. For many periods in the first regime, including the recession in the early
1970s and the latest three recessions, the DSGE model plays little role and the BVAR
model dominates. While both mixture models can be used to assess the average role of
the DSGE model throughout the history, it is the Markov-switching result that enables
us to determine when the DSGE model is usable and when it is not, as shown in Fig-
ure 2. In Sections VI and VII we explore further implications of this regime-switching
feature.

                                        V. Model fit

  To assess how well our proposed Markov-switching mixture model fits to the data in
comparison to other models, we compute the MDD for four models: the DSGE model,
the BVAR model, the mixture model with constant weights, and the Markov-switching
mixture model. For robustness of analysis we present other measures, such as the log
predictive score (LPS), and estimate two versions of a pool of the DSGE and BVAR
models, following Geweke and Amisano (2011). One version is based on the predictive
pool with constant weights:

  Table 3 reports the computed MDDs and LPSs for all the models we have discussed.
We begin with an analysis of the LPS. The LPS for the BVAR model is overwhelmingly
higher than that for the DSGE model, by over 500 in log value.8 In contrast, the
simple pool with optimal constant weights improves the LPS of the BVAR model
by only 0.03 in log value. To understand why the improvement is so insignificant,
we observe that the BVAR model fits to the data so much better than the DSGE
model that the log predictive density p (yto | Yt−1 , BV AR) is considerably greater than
  8The   superiority of the BVAR model with the Sims and Zha (1998) prior over the DSGE model is
well documented in the literature. See Del Negro and Schorfheide (Forthcoming).

p (yto | Yt−1 , DSGE) for 180 data points out of a total of 198 quarters in the sample.
In the other 18 periods when p (yto | Yt−1 , BV AR) is less than p (yto | Yt−1 , DSGE), the
differences between the log predictive densities is so small (relative to the differences
between p (yto | Yt−1 , BV AR) and p (yto | Yt−1 , DSGE) in those 180 periods) that the
optimal weight for the DSGE model is virtually zero (on the order of 1.0E − 10). The
Markov-switching version of an optimal pool yields the same result, with one regime
being an absorbing state and the weight for the BVAR model in this regime being
virtually one.
  The antecedent finding suggests that it would be worthwhile to explore a mixture of
the two models in which the parameters and the weights are jointly estimated. Geweke
and Amisano (2011) show that asymptotically a mixture model must be superior to
a pool and, when all individual models are false, the pool is superior to individual
models. Although this asymptotic result has, in general, no implication of the same
ranking in small samples, does it hold for our application? Table 3 indicates that the
mixture model with constant weights improves the log LPS by 96. The improvement
produced from the Markov-switching mixture increases the log LPS by additional 12.
Thus, about 90% of the improvement in model fit is due to a convex combination of
predictive densities of individual models. Changes in model weights deliver another
10% of the improvement. Moreover, allowing changes in model weights brings in impor-
tant economic substance regarding the role of the DSGE model at particular times in
history, as stressed in Section IV. We continue to discuss other economic implications
of the Markov-switching mixture model in Sections VI and VII.
  We now turn to an analysis of the MDD. We use the truncated modified harmonic
mean (MHM) method proposed by Sims, Waggoner, and Zha (2008) to calculate the
MDD. The details of this method are given in Appendix C. When comparing MDDs,
one should bear in mind that the ratio of two MDDs is the Bayes factor. If the
difference in log values of MDD between two models is greater than 5, for example, the
model with the higher value of MDD is favored decisively by the data. For the BVAR
model, there is an analytical solution for calculating the MDD so that the reported
log value of MDD has negligible numerical errors. For the DSGE model and the two
mixture models, however, numerical errors are small but noticeable. Table 3 reports the
               CONFRONTING MODEL MISSPECIFICATION IN MACROECONOMICS                                               15

minimum and maximum values of the MDDs estimated from 10 chains of one million
MCMC draws with 10 starting points independently drawn from the prior distribution.
  Note that we do not report MDDs for the two pool models (indicated by N/A).
One can compute the MDD by explicitly specifying a prior on model weights, which
would not differ much from the LPS value. Since each constituent model in the pool
is estimated beforehand, it is equivalent to say that the prior of model parameters
is degenerated by centering at the estimates. Reporting such an MDD value would
not be useful. Moreover, since each constituent model in the pool is taken as given
before the optimal weights are chosen, there is in general no internal mechanism to
prevent in-sample over-fit for an individual model. The mixture approach penalizes
model complexity by estimating the parameters in both models jointly.
  Nonetheless, the conclusion reached from the MDD results about the ranking of
models is the same as that from the LPS results. The two mixture models expand
the parameter space by jointly estimating the weights and the parameters of both
individual models. The log MDD for the BVAR is higher than the log MDD for the
DSGE model by over 150. But the mixture model with constant weights dominates
the BVAR model by about 50 in log MDD. For the Markov-switching mixture model,
we gain additional 9 value in the log MDD. Again, this result strengthens the previous
finding from the LPS analysis that 85% of the improvement in model fit is attributable
to a convex combination of predictive densities of individual models.
  All this analysis, computationally expensive as it is, indicates that a formal mixture
of the two heterogeneous models is important in improving the model’s fit to the data.9
As additional verification, by reducing the influence of the prior distribution, we use the
10-year data at the beginning of the sample to compute the log predictive likelihood,
concentrating on the latter part of the sample from 1972:I to 2010:II. To see how to
compute this log concentrated predictive likelihood (LCPL), we decompose the log
MDD as10

where M stands for a particular model we study and t∗ corresponds to 1972:I in our
case. The first term on the right-hand side is the log MDD using the data up to t∗ − 1.
We apply our MCMC simulator on this earlier sample. The LCPL, the second term
on the right-hand side, is the difference in log MDDs between the full sample and the
earlier sample. The column with the label “LCPL” on the top in Table 3 reports the
LCPL values for the four models studied in this paper. It is evident that the LCPLs
for both mixture models are significantly higher than those for the DSGE and BVAR
models, reinforcing the previous conclusion reached by both LPS and MDD analyses.




                                   VI. Data filter

  One application of our Markov-switching mixture model is to filter the data for
estimation of the DSGE model by discounting observations from the periods in which
the BVAR dominates. As shown in Table 2 and Figure 2, the DSGE model plays
almost no role during the periods under the first regime. This regime covers about
76% of the sample, consistent with the estimated ergodic probability of the first regime
presented in Section IV. The data in the first regime is almost completely discounted
for estimation of the DSGE parameters.
  The DSGE model plays an important role in the second regime. This regime covers a
much shorter period of the sample, concentrating on the late 1970s and the early 1980s.
The data in the periods under the second regime is partially discounted for estimation
of the DSGE parameters because the weight assigned to the DSGE model is less than
one. We present and discuss the estimation results for the DSGE parameters in the
Markov-switching mixture model in Appendix D.
  In this section we focus on the impulse responses of an economic shock in the DSGE
model. Since many structural shocks in the DSGE model cannot be identified by the
BVAR model, it is important to assess the differences between the responses implied by
the Markov-switching mixture model and those from the DSGE model when estimated
in isolation. To this end, we use a capital depreciation shock as an example. The
capital depreciation shock is a shock to the depreciation rate in the capital accumulation
equation in the DSGE model. It is an important shock, as it can be interpreted as a
proxy for a shock to efficiency in using the capital or a financial shock.
                 CONFRONTING MODEL MISSPECIFICATION IN MACROECONOMICS                          17

  Let εd t be an i.i.d. shock to capital depreciation at the time t with E(εd t ) = 0 and
V ar(εd t ) = 1. A vector of the k th step impulse responses is defined as
                      h                                       i
    (j)                         (j)
  IRDSGE,T +k      = E yT +k | ΘDSGE , εd T +1 = 1, YT , DSGE
                                                           h                       i
                                                                   (j)
                                                      − E yT +k | ΘDSGE , YT , DSGE , (3)

           (j)
where ΘDSGE is a j th posterior draw from the Markov-switching mixture model. In our
calculation, the initial condition represented by YT has no effect on impulse responses
because the DSGE model itself is linear. Thus one can choose an arbitrary value of
YT .
  Even if the DSGE parameters are dawn from the posterior distribution of the
Markov-switching mixture model, the impulse responses are computed based only on
the estimated DSGE model in the mixture because a depreciation shock is not iden-
tified in the BVAR model. Since the DSGE model is important only in the second
                                                        (j)
regime, the impulse responses represented by IRDSGE,T +k are effectively those in the
second regime. In Section VII we discuss how to obtain impulse responses in the first
regime when a common structural shock is identified in both individual models.
  Figure 3 contrasts the impulse responses generated by (3), the responses from the
DSGE-only model (i.e., when it is estimated in isolation over the full sample), and
those from the prior distribution of the DSGE model. The figure displays the impulse
responses of output, consumption, real wage, and inflation to a one-standard-deviation
shock to capital depreciation. To be compatible with the literature, we follow Sims and
Zha (1999) and report the 68% probability bands. The left-hand column displays the
responses generated from the estimated Markov-switching mixture model, the middle
column displays the responses from the DSGE-only model, and the right column dis-
plays the responses generated from the prior distribution of the DSGE model. It is
clear that the estimated responses from either the mixture model or the DSGE-only
model differ substantially from the responses generated by the prior distribution of the
DSGE model.11 The data are therefore informative.
  11Note   that the probability bands from the estimated DSGE model alone tend to be narrower than
those from the prior distribution of the DSGE model. Comparing the 95% probability intervals in
Table 5 and those in Table 7 in Appendix D, one can see that the posterior standard deviations for
some shocks, such as the monetary policy shock and the technology shock, have much tighter ranges
             CONFRONTING MODEL MISSPECIFICATION IN MACROECONOMICS                                18

  Comparing the left and middle columns side by side, one can see the notable differ-
ences between the mixture model and the DSGE-only model. We begin our analysis
with the middle column, when the impulse responses are based on the DSGE-only
model. The increase in the depreciation rate reduces the value of capital accumula-
tion, raises the marginal cost of capital, and lowers investment. Since the expected
stock of capital wealth declines, the negative wealth effect leads to a fall in consump-
tion. Consequently, aggregate output falls. The decline in output leads to a decline
in hours. The equilibrium real wage falls as well, because the declines in hours and in
consumption lower the marginal rate of substitution between labor and consumption,
so that the household’s desired wage falls. Inflation responses are positive, but it is
difficult to detect visually because the magnitude is too small (on the order of 1.0E-06).
Inflation increases in response to a depreciation shock because the rise in the marginal
cost of capital slightly dominates the fall in the real wage. According to the probability
bands, all the responses are sharply estimates.
  The corresponding impulse responses generated from the mixture model are consider-
ably larger, both in magnitude and in the width of probability bands (the left-hand col-
umn of Figure 3). For the estimates of the DSGE parameters from the mixture model,
the fall in the real wage in response to a positive depreciation shock slightly overweighs
the rise in the marginal cost of capital so that inflation responses are predominantly
negative on impact but are statistically insignificant according to the probability bands.
For the most part, the responses of the three real variables (output, consumption, and
the real wage) are statistically significant. In this sense, the data discounted or filtered
through the mixture model do not make estimation of the DSGE parameters lose its
economic meaning.
  More interesting is the width of probability bands in the left-hand column of Figure 3.
Our estimation indicates that estimation of the DSGE model utilizes about one-tenth
of the data points in the sample (taking into account the weight for the DSGE model
in the second regime being 0.43). Thus it is unsurprising that the probability bands
are wider. What is new in our finding, however, is that the width of probability
bands for the mixture model, for most impulse responses, is far more than three (a
square root of ten) times the width for the DSGE-only model when it is estimated
than do the prior standard deviations. In those cases, the probability bands from the estimated DSGE
model alone are much narrower than those from the prior distribution of the DSGE model.
            CONFRONTING MODEL MISSPECIFICATION IN MACROECONOMICS                      19

with all the data points. Insight about this result is revealed in Figure 2. Since the
second regime concentrates on three adjacent recessions and excludes many periods of
economic expansions, the data in this regime have more similarity than the data in the
first regime when both recessions and expansions are covered. Such similarity results in
considerably more uncertainty surrounding the estimates than what a simple counting
of data points would suggest.

                          VII. Full structural analysis

  Although the analysis of impulse responses to a capital depreciation shock, presented
in Section VI, is based on the DSGE model, the analysis is partially structural in the
sense that the BVAR model is not used to interpret the results. The BVAR model plays
a role only in the estimation stage. Once the estimation is finished and the posterior
draws of the DSGE parameters from the Markov-switching mixture are stored, the
BVAR model has no use in the analysis of impulse responses. This exercise is useful
only when the BVAR model is not treated as a structural model.
  There is a large strand of literature on using a BVAR model to identify certain eco-
nomic shocks, if not all the shocks (Bernanke (1986), Blanchard and Watson (1986),
Sims (1986), Leeper, Sims, and Zha (1996), Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (1999)).
One prominent example is a monetary policy shock. If we apply the Choleski decom-
position to our BVAR model and let the interest rate respond to all other variables
contemporaneously, a shock to the interest rate equation is identified as a monetary
policy shock by Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (1999). Our original BVAR model
has the same ordering of the variables as this structural version, which is now used
to identify a monetary policy shock. Building on our econometric framework, we now
merge this structural BVAR model (SBVAR model henceforth) with the DSGE model
that has the same type of shock: a shock to monetary policy.
  Figures 4 and 5 display the impulse responses to a one-standard-deviation monetary
policy shock under four scenarios: the DSGE-only model (when estimated alone over
the full sample), the SBVAR-only model (when estimated in isolation over the full
sample), the first regime for the Markov-switching mixture of these two heterogenous
models, and the second regime. To avoid wordiness, we use the DSGE model to mean
the “DSGE-only” model and the SBVAR model to mean the “SBVAR-only” model,
whenever it is clear in the context.

  We begin with our analysis on the DSGE-only and SBVAR-only models. Impulse
responses to a monetary policy shock from these two heterogenous models are consid-
erably different, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The top two rows of graphs in
Figures 4 show that the magnitude of the interest rate response for the DSGE-only
model is slightly higher than that for the SBVAR-only model at the beginning of the
forecast horizon, but the response for the SBVAR-only model is more persistent. The
response of the price level for the DSGE model is small and negative (on the order of
1.0E-06 and thus difficult to detect by eye). The response of the price level for the
SBVAR model is relatively large and positive. Although the positive response of the
price level is known in the SBVAR literature as a “price puzzle,” the SBVAR model
continues to be used to analyze the effect of a monetary policy shock on real variables
such as investment and output (Sims (1992), Leeper, Sims, and Zha (1996), Christiano,
Eichenbaum, and Evans (1999)).
  The top two rows of graphs in Figure 5 show drastically different patterns of the
responses of investment and output for the two individual models. The DSGE model
implies that the responses of both investment and output are negative at the beginning,
but the negative effect disappears after two years (eight quarters). In contrast, the
SBVAR model implies that the effect on investment and output of a monetary policy
shock is persistently negative throughout the forecast horizon.
  To resolve these differences between the DSGE and SBVAR models, the traditional
approach in the literature is to estimate the DSGE model subject to the constraint
that the impulse responses to a monetary policy matches those of the SBVAR model
(Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans, 2005). The key argument for this approach is
that the SBVAR model dominates the DSGE model in the fit to the data. Indeed,
the evidence is supported by the results presented in Table 3, where all three measures
indicate that the SBVAR model is decisively favored by the data. This approach
suggests that misspecification of the SBVAR model be not serious in practice.
  Our approach recognizes that both the DSGE and SBVAR models may be mis-
specified. Table 3 shows that our Markov-switching mixture model improves the fit
considerably when compared to the SBVAR model and that model weights differ sub-
stantially across the two regimes. We now describe how to compute impulse responses

to a monetary policy shock from the Markov-switching mixture model, and then ex-
plore how impulse responses change from one regime to the other and how they differ
from those generated from the two individual models.
  Let Θ(j) , Q(j) , and w (j) denote the j th posterior draw of all the model parameters. A
vector of impulse responses at horizon k to a one-standard-deviation monetary policy
shock εp T +1 = 1 in regime ℓ ∈ {1, 2} is given by

    (j)                                                                           

                                                   (j)                         (j)
Notice the notational difference between IRDSGE,T +k in (3) and IRℓ,T +k in (4). In (3),
since a depreciation shock is identified only in the DSGE model, the impulse responses
are computed through the DSGE model for every posterior MCMC draw of model
parameters. In (4) both the DSGE and SBVAR models identify the same type of
structural shock, which is a monetary policy shock in our case. Thus, the subscript in
   (j)
IRℓ,T +k has no reference to any particular model, only to the regime.
  To compute the impulse responses defined in (4), we let the state space representation
of the ith model be

                                   yt = ai + Hi fi,t ,                                            (5)

                                 fi,t = bi + Fi fi,t−1 + Φi εi,t .                                (6)

The first system (5) represents measurement equations, the second system (6) repre-
sents state equations, and ft is an unobserved state vector. For a monetary policy
shock, we have εi,pt = εpt for i ∈ {DSGE, SBV AR}. That is, the DSGE model and
the SBVAR model identify the same shock. Combining (4)-(6) leads to

               X           n                                                           

where i ∈ {DSGE, SBV AR}. Because both the DSGE and BVAR models are linear,
                                                              (j)
the impulse responses at regime ℓ, represented by IRℓ,T +k , turn out to be independent
of the initial condition YT .

  We follow Sims and Zha (2006) and report impulse responses to a monetary policy
                                                        (j)
shock under different regimes, represented by IRℓ,T +k .12 The bottom two rows of graphs
in Figures 4 and 5 display the resulting responses. We first analyze the first regime
in which the SBVAR model dominates. As shown in the third row of Figure 4, the
dynamic responses of the price level are smaller both in magnitude and in probability
bands than those generated by the SBVAR-only model; nonetheless, the price puzzle
continues to be significant. As for real variables, the effects on investment and output
of a monetary policy shock, estimated from the Markov-switching mixture model, are
smaller with wider probability bands than those generated from the SBVAR-only model
(comparing the second and third rows of Figure 5).
  The influence of model uncertainty is evident in this case. The SBVAR model,
when estimated alone, indicates that investment and output continue to stay negative
after two years (the second row of Figure 5). The Markov-switching mixture model
(the third row of Figure 5), however, reveals that there is a nontrivial probability that
investment and output become positive after two years. This time horizon is consistent
with the time after which the responses of investment and output from the DSGE-only
model become positive (the first row of Figure 5). Even though the DSGE model plays
little role in the first regime, its importance in the second regime influences the joint
estimation of the parameters in both individual models. The influence is large enough
to alter the estimates and distributions of impulse responses of both nominal and real
variables.
  We now analyze the second regime, in which both the DSGE model and the SBVAR
model play an important role, and compare the results to those in the first regime.
The fourth rows of graphs in Figures 4 and 5 display impulse responses under the
second regime in the Markov-switching mixture model. In response to a monetary
policy shock, the interest rate rises twice as much as does the interest rate in the first
regime. The price puzzle is much weakened. In comparison to the result in the first
regime, the magnitude of the responses is smaller and there is a nontrivial probability
of no price puzzle (the fourth row of Figure 4). As for real variables, the uncertainty
about the responses of investment and output is larger than that in the first regime.
  12We   compute the impulse responses using alternative methods discussed in Appendix B and with
various values of pT , including the unconditional probabilities of regimes. We find that the values
                      (j)                         (j)
tend to lie between IR1,T +k (first regime) and IR2,T +k (second regime).
            CONFRONTING MODEL MISSPECIFICATION IN MACROECONOMICS                       26

According to the probability bands, the negative responses of investment and output
in the second regime are short lived and, in general, have very wide probability bands,
even at the beginning of the forecast horizon.
  To summarize, we show how to compute the impulse responses to the same type
of shock when both individual models in the mixture are structural. More important
is what we have learned from this exercise. Since the responses based on on each
individual model are sharply estimated, economic implications about the effects of a
monetary policy shock differ from one model to the other, as shown in the top two
rows of graphs in Figures 4 and 5. Comparing the impulse responses in the third and
fourth rows to those in the first and second rows of Figures 4 and 5, one can see clearly
that the mixture of the two individual models, the DSGE model and the SBVAR
model, has fundamentally different implications about the magnitude and uncertainty
of the effects of a monetary policy on both nominal and real variables. The finding
of smaller magnitude and larger uncertainty about the impulse responses from the
Markov-switching mixture model, in comparison to those from the SBVAR-only model,
is consistent with the view that a large effect of monetary policy is predominantly due
to its systematic component, not due to its unpredictable (random) shocks (Bernanke,
Gertler, and Watson (1997), Sims and Zha (2006)).

                                  VIII. Conclusion

  We show in this paper how to apply the Markov-switching mixture methodology to
macroeconomic models. We study two types of widely used macroeconomic models:
a DSGE model and a BVAR model. Although it is computationally demanding, we
show that estimating a Markov-switching mixture of these two heterogenous models is
feasible. The estimated mixture model with two regimes improves the fit to the data
considerably, implying that both models may be misspecified. Taking into account
model uncertainty can alter the estimated results of the parameters in each individual
model. Using a capital depreciation shock as an example, we illustrate how impulse
responses in the DSGE model are changed when the mixture model is used as a data
filter. When the DSGE model and the BVAR model identify a common economic shock,
which is a monetary policy shock in our application, we show how to use the Markov-
switching mixture model to combine the two individual models and how to compute
the impulse responses from the mixture model. The resulting impulse responses differ
             CONFRONTING MODEL MISSPECIFICATION IN MACROECONOMICS                    27

across the two regimes and have different economic implications about the magnitude
and uncertainty when compared to the impulse responses generated by each individual
model.
  The Markov-switching mixture model studied in this paper should be viewed as
a step towards a deep and sophisticated macroeconomic model that we have neither
technology nor intellectual capacity to cope with at the present time. To this end, one
natural extension is to allow agents in our economic model to take into account both
model uncertainty and parameter uncertainty. Works by Hansen and Sargent (2001),
Brock, Durlauf, and West (2003), and Hansen and Sargent (2010) provide guidance on
how to pursue this line of research in the future. Meanwhile, it is our hope that the
empirical exercise conducted in this paper illustrates how a Markov-switching mixture
of heterogenous structural models can be used to integrate model uncertainty and
parameter uncertainty in macroeconomics.

  to construct this deflator as a weighted aggregate index from the four quality-

  index is a weighted one from a number of individual price series within these
  categories. For each individual price series from 1947 to 1983, we use Gordon
  (1990)’s quality-adjusted price index. Following Cummins and Violante (2002),
  we estimate an econometric model of Gordon’s price series as a function of a
  time trend and a number of NIPA indicators (including the current and lagged
  values of the corresponding NIPA price series). The estimated coefficients are
  then used to extrapolate the quality-adjusted price index for each individual
  price series for the sample from 1984 to 2007. These constructed price series
  are annual. Denton (1971)’s method is used to interpolate these annual series
  on a quarterly frequency. The Tornquist procedure is then used to construct

         each quality-adjusted price index from the appropriate interpolated quarterly
         price series.


       Appendix B. Impulse responses and decomposition of variance

  In Section VII we discuss how to compute impulse responses conditional on a partic-
ular regime when both models are structural. Because regime-switching model weights
introduce nonlinearity into the mixture model, there are many other ways to compute
impulse responses. One approach is to let impulse responses depend on the probability
                                                        (j)
of sT +k instead of a particular regime. Let pT +k be the vector whose ℓth component,
 (j)                                                  (j)        k (j)       (j)
pℓ,T +k , is the probability that sT +k = ℓ. We have pT +k = Q(j) pT . Let wi,T +k de-
note the weight associated with model i ∈ {DSGE, BV AR} at the time T + k. Thus,

of sT +k but rather on the probability of sT +k . Impulse responses are computed as

where i ∈ {DSGE, SBV AR}. Note that the impulse responses IRT +k do not depend

initial probability pT is a function of YT . Note that the term in the braces is simply
the impulse response of the ith state vector to a structural shock and can easily be
computed using the ith state equation.
  Impulse responses are nonlinear functions of model parameters Θ. For any function
of Θ that has a finite posterior variance, denoted by f (Θ), we propose the following
method to decompose the overall variance of f (Θ) into the sum of two components, one
attributable to parameter uncertainty within the model and the other to uncertainty
across models:13
                           Z
  V ar (f (Θ) | YT ) =       V ar (f (Θ) | w, YT ) p(w | YT ) dw
  |       {z       }
   Overall uncertainty     |                {z                 }
                                     Parameter uncertainty


  13This   decomposition is for the purpose of structural analysis. For the purpose of pure prediction
or forecasting, Geweke and Amisano (Forthcoming) show how to decompose the variance of predictive
distributions into extrinsic variance, arising from posterior uncertainty about parameters, and intrinsic
variance, arising from predictive errors given the parameters.

                                                          Model uncertainty

As shown in Table 3, the MDD for the BVAR model is at least 150 over the MDD for
the DSGE model. Thus, the BVAR model overwhelmingly dominates the DSGE model
and there is no model uncertainty according to Bayesian model averaging. In contrast,
our proposed approach to decomposition overcomes this difficulty by measuring model
uncertainty through variations in model weights. Indeed, as shown in Table 2, there
exists a considerable variation in model weights. Implementing our decomposition
method, however, incurs an additional cost of sampling Θ for each posterior draw of
w.


                   Appendix C. The MCMC posterior sampler

     In this section we describe, in detail, our algorithm of finding the posterior mode,
our posterior simulator for MCMC draws, and our method of computing the MDD.
Our approach follows Sims, Waggoner, and Zha (2008). In all succeeding subsections
we omit the notation Mi for notational simplicity with the understanding that all the
objects analyzed in this appendix are conditioned on a particular model, being the
DSGE model, the BVAR model, or the mixture model.

C.1. Posterior mode. Estimation of a mixture of our DSGE and BVAR models,
the two substantially heterogeneous models, is a challenging task, as the shape of
the posterior density tends to be very non-Gaussian, full of local modes and winding
ridges. Because of such a non-Gaussian shape of the density function, the posterior
mean receives an extremely low probability and thus is a poor approximation to the
posterior mode. For the same reason, searching the posterior mode is difficult, as
standard optimization routines often converge to different local peaks from different
starting points.
  We use the block-wise optimization method recommended by Sims, Waggoner, and
Zha (2008). We first group the model parameters into four blocks: ΘDSGE (all the pa-
rameters for the DSGE model), ΘBV AR (all the parameters for the BVAR model), Q,
and w. This separation proves critical in practice because the conditional posterior den-
sity p (θDSGE | YTo , θBV AR , Q, w) differs substantially from p (θBV AR | YTo , θDSGE , Q, w).
              CONFRONTING MODEL MISSPECIFICATION IN MACROECONOMICS                                  31

While the density p (θDSGE | YTo , θBV AR , Q, w) is non-Gaussian, the conditional poste-
rior density p (θBV AR | YTo , θDSGE , Q, w) is closer to being Gaussian.
  Given an initial guess of the values of the parameters, we use a standard hill-climbing
quasi-Newton optimization routine to find the value of each block of parameters that
maximizes the posterior density while holding other blocks of parameters fixed at the
previous values. We iterate this algorithm through blocks until it converges. For
each iteration we employ a constrained optimization routine to check whether there
are boundary or corner solutions associated with Q, w, or other model parameters.
While this block-wise approach at first increases likelihood more efficiently than a
quasi-Newton method applied directly to the complete parameter vector, it can be-
come inefficient after initial iterations. For this reason, when the block-wise iterations
have converged or nearly converged, we apply the quasi-Newton algorithm to the full
parameter vector, with BFGS (Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno) updates of the full
Hessian matrix. In our experience, these alternative approaches substantially improve
the likelihood value. We use a computer cluster to search in parallel for the highest
posterior density from as many as ten thousand randomly chosen starting points.

C.2. MCMC simulations. Our MCMC simulations are based on the Gibbs-Metropolis
algorithm. The general convergence property of the Gibbs-Metropolis algorithm is dis-
cussed in Geweke (Geweke, 2005). We use the idea of Gibbs sampling to obtain the
empirical joint posterior density p(θDSGE , θBV AR , Q, w | YTo ) by sampling alternately
from the following conditional posterior distributions represented by

                                   p(ΘDSGE | YTo , ΘBV AR , w),

                                   p(ΘBV AR | YTo , ΘDSGE , w),

                                          p(w | YTo , Θ, Q),

                                          p(Q | YTo , Θ, w),

where Θ = (ΘDSGE , ΘBV AR ). For each of the first three conditional posterior densities,
we use the straight Metropolis algorithm with a Gaussian density as a proposal den-
sity.14 To simulate from the last distribution, we first make a draw of the Markov chain
ST from p(ST | YTo , Θ, Q, w), and then draw Q from p(Q | YTo , Θ, w, ST ). This approach
  14We   have also experimented with a Beta or Dirichlet density. There is no notable improvement
in efficiency mainly because the shape of p(w | YTo , Θ, Q) is campanulate, as shown in Figure 1.
              CONFRONTING MODEL MISSPECIFICATION IN MACROECONOMICS                                               32

has the advantage that both of these distributions are sampled directly. To draw ST ,
the distributions p(st | Yto , Θ, Q, w) and p(st | Yt−1
                                                     o
                                                        , Θ, Q, w) are obtained using the
forward recursion algorithm documented in Hamilton (1989), Chib (1996), and Kim
and Nelson (1999). Then sT is drawn from p(sT | YTo , Θ, Q, w) and sT −1 , sT −2 , . . . , s0
are drawn recursively using
                                                                                  qst+1 ,st p (st | Yto , Θ, Q, w)
p (st | YTo , Θ, Q, w, sT , · · · , st+1 ) = p (st | Yto , Θ, Q, w, st+1) =                                        .
                                                                                    p (st+1 | Yto , Θ, Q, w)
The distribution p(Q | YTo , Θ, w, ST ) is of Dirichlet if the prior is of Dirichlet, which is
true in our case. It is straightforward to sample directly from the Dirichlet using the
univariate gamma distribution Devroye (1986, pp. 593-594).

C.3. Computing the MDD. Denote θ∗ = (Θ, Q, w). The marginal data density is
defined as                                        Z
                                  p(YTo )     =        p(YTo | θ∗ )p(θ∗ ) dθ∗ .                              (A1)
  We use the popular modified harmonic means method discussed in Gelfand and
Dey (1994) to approximate (A1) numerically. The method is based on the following
equation:                                 Z
                                            h(θ∗ )
                          p(YTo )−1   =   o
                                                            p(θ∗ | YTo )dθ∗ ,    (A2)
                                 Θ ∗ p(Y T   | θ ∗ )p(θ ∗ )

where Θ∗ is the support of the posterior probability density and the weighting density
(not just kernel) function h(θ∗ ) must have support that is contained in Θ∗ .
  A numerical evaluation of the integral on the right-hand side of (A2) is accomplished
through the Monte Carlo (MC) integration
                                                           N
                                                        1 X
                                      p̂(YTo )−1      =       m(θ∗, (j) ),                                   (A3)
                                                        N i=1

where θ∗, (j) is a j th draw of θ∗ from the posterior distribution p(θ∗ | YT ) and
                                                            h(θ∗ )
                                       m(θ∗ ) =                           .
                                                       p(YTo | θ∗ )p(θ∗ )
  If m(θ∗ ) is bounded above, the rate of convergence from this MC approximation
is likely to be practical. Geweke (1999) proposes an implementation with h(·) being
a truncated multivariate Gaussian density constructed from the posterior simulator.
The tail of this Gaussian distribution is truncated to ensure that the support of h(·)
is contained in the support of the posterior density function. When the posterior
distribution is very non-Gaussian, as in our case, Sims, Waggoner, and Zha (2008)
               CONFRONTING MODEL MISSPECIFICATION IN MACROECONOMICS                     33

point out three sources of difficulty with this implementation. One prominent source
of difficulty is that the likelihood can get to almost zero in the interior points of the
parameter space Θ∗ . In this situation, truncating the tail of the weight distribution
does not guarantee that m(θ∗ ) is bounded above.
  To overcome this numerical hurdle, we follow Sims, Waggoner, and Zha (2008) and
choose the weighting density such that m(θ∗ ) is bounded above by construction. Specif-
ically, let U be a positive number and Θ∗U be the region defined by

                                Θ∗U = {θ : p(YTo | θ∗ )p(θ∗ ) > U} .

If g(θ∗ ) is any known and tractable density that is bounded above, and h(θ∗ ) is the
density obtained by restricting g(θ∗ ) to Θ∗U , then the function m(θ∗ ) is bounded above
as well. To compute h(θ∗ ) from g(θ∗ ), we must know the probability that a draw from
g(θ∗ ) lies in Θ∗U . The probability is calculated using draws from the distribution given
by g(θ∗ ).
  We choose g(θ∗ ) from the family of elliptical distributions.15 For instance, Gaussian
distributions are elliptical. For our problem, an elliptical density function gives us
flexibility to approximate the posterior density function better than a Gaussian density
function. Elliptical distributions are characterized by a symmetric and positive definite
matrix S, which defines the elliptical contours, a vector c, which defines the center, and
non-negative one dimensional function, which defines the density across the contours.
We use the estimated posterior mode to define the center, the estimated second moment
of the posterior distribution to define the contours, and a step function to define the
density across the contours. The step function is chosen so that the probability of lying
inside an ellipse is approximately the same for the posterior and proposal distributions.

C.4. Convergence. To compute the MDD accurately, we take two steps. First, we
must be able to compute the probability that a proposal draw lies in the region Θ∗U ,
which can be interpreted as the probability of success in a Bernoulli trial. Because
we make as many independent draws from the proposal as desired, this probability is
accurately computed in our application.
  With this probability in hand, we can use posterior draws to compute the MDD using
equation (A3). To check the accuracy of this computation, we use two techniques.

  15See   Sims, Waggoner, and Zha (2008) for details.
              CONFRONTING MODEL MISSPECIFICATION IN MACROECONOMICS                            34

First, we use an extremely long sequence, one hundred million, of MCMC draws.16
We divided this sequence into a hundred subsequences of one million draws and then
computed the MDD from the entire sequence and from each of the subsequences. The
variation among the subsequences is very small.
  While the above technique employs many MCMC chains, the posterior mode is a
starting point for each. As an alternative, we use draws from the prior as starting points
for multiple MCMC chains, each of which has a length of one million draws. Selecting
an appropriate starting point is crucial for reliable MCMC draws. If the initial value
is in an extremely low probability region, then an unreasonably long burn-in period
would be required to obtain convergence of the MCMC chain. Most parameter values
drawn from the prior have extremely low likelihood values, a majority below −10 in
log value. Recall that the likelihood at the posterior density mode is over 6000 in log
value. Thus, we draw from the prior until it reaches a reasonable likelihood value (e.g.,
above 3000 in log value). We use 10 such randomly selected starting points and record
the minimum and maximum values of the MDDs calculated from these chains. The
MDD value reported in Table 3 uses the long MCMC chain starting from the posterior
mode, and the associated interval marks the minimum and maximum values of the
MDDs computed from the 10 shorter chains using draws from the prior distribution as
starting points.


                            Appendix D. The DSGE model

  In this appendix we describe the complete log-linearized system for the DSGE model
studied by Liu, Waggoner, and Zha (2011), along with the prior specification and the
posterior estimates. The model is similar to Altig, Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Linde
(2004) and Smets and Wouters (2007), with the notable exceptions that (1) some real
rigidity is introduced, as in Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2000), by assuming the
existence of firm-specific factors (such as land) such that the sum of cost shares of
capital and labor inputs is less or equal to one; and (2) a shock to the depreciation
in physical capital is introduced as a stand-in for a shock to capital destruction or a
financial shock.

  16On   a standard desktop computer with one core, the computation would have taken more than a
month. We have used a cluster of computers to help speed up our computation.

D.1. Linearized system. We introduce the notation ∆xt = xt −xt−1 . We use the hat
variable, x̂t , to denote the log deviation of the stationary variable Xt from its steady
state value (i.e., x̂t = log(Xt /X)). The log-linearized equilibrium conditions for our
DSGE mode, below, summarize the equilibrium dynamics.

  In addition to all the equilibrium conditions, we have 7 shock processes:

             log µpt = (1 − ρp ) log µp + ρp log µp,t−1 + σp εpt − φp σp εp,t−1 , (wage markup)

where ε represents an i.i.d. normal shock and σ represents the corresponding standard
deviation.
   To compute the equilibrium, we eliminate both ût and r̂kt by using (A8) and (A11),
leaving 9 equations and 9 variables π̂t , ŵt , ît , q̂kt , ĉt , k̂t , ŷt , ˆlt , and R̂t . Out of these
9 variables, we have 7 corresponding observable variables (except q̂kt and k̂t ) for our
estimation. Finally, we have one additional observable variable used in our estimation:
the biased technology shock q̂t .
  In addition to the 9 equilibrium conditions, we have 7 equations describing the AR
processes for the 7 structural shocks, 4 equations describing the 2 MA processes, and
7 equations concerning the 7 expectational terms in the system. Thus, there are 27
DSGE equations in total.
  A standard solution technique, such as the method proposed by Sims (2002), can
be directly applied to these 27 equations. The solution leads to the following VAR(1)
form of state equations:

                                           ft = F ft−1 + Φεt ,                                     (A22)

where εt = [εrt , εpt , εwt , εgt , εzt, εat , εdt , εqt ]′ , ft is a 27 × 1 vector of variables in the
log-linearized system, and F and Φ are matrix functions of model parameters.
  Let yt be a 8 × 1 vector of observable represented as

    h                                                                              i′

surement equations
                                          yt = a + Hft ,

The estimation applies to this state space form.

D.2. The prior. The prior for the DSGE model is reported in Tables 4 and 5. Instead
of specifying the mean and the standard deviation, we use the 90% probability interval
to back out the hyperparameter values of the prior distribution. The intervals are
chosen to be wide enough to allow for the possibility that the posterior mode is close
to or on the boundary of the parameter space. The wide intervals also allow for the
possibility of multiple local posterior peaks (Del Negro and Schorfheide, 2008). This
approach to choosing the prior is useful to deal with skewed distributions. It allows for
reasonable hyperparameter values in certain distributions, such as the Inverse-Gamma,
where the first two moments may not exist.
  For many parameters with the Beta prior distribution, such as the habit parameter
and the persistence parameters in shock processes, we insist on a positive probability
density at the value zero to allow for the possibility of no habit and no persistence at
all. On the other hand, we insist on zero probability density at the value 1 to maintain
the assumption that the economy is on the balanced growth path. Consequently, the
two hyperparameter values for the Beta prior are set at 1.0 and 2.0.
  The prior for the labor share and capital share is the Beta distribution with the
restriction α1 + α2 ≤ 1 such that the production technology requires firm-specific
factors (Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan, 2000). If we treated α1 and α2 independently,
the 90% probability bounds for the α1 values would be 0.3 and 0.4 and those for
α2 would be 0.5 and 0.7. With the restriction α1 + α2 ≤ 1 imposed in this paper,
however, the joint 90% probability region implies that the 90% probability bounds will
be different.
  The prior for the inverse Frisch elasticity η follows the Gamma distribution. We
choose the two hyperparameters of the Gamma distribution such that the lower bound
(0.2) and the upper bound (10.0) of η constitute the 90% probability interval. This
prior range for η implies that the Frisch elasticity lies between 0.1 and 5.
             CONFRONTING MODEL MISSPECIFICATION IN MACROECONOMICS                              39

  The lower and upper bounds of prior distributions for the parameters λq , λ∗ , β, σu ,
S ′′ , δ, ξp , γp , ξw , γw , φπ , φy , and π ∗ are specified in Table 4. Using these wide bounds,
we back out the two hyperparameter values for the corresponding prior distributions.
  The Gamma prior for the average net price markup µp −1 is the same as the Gamma
prior for the average net wage markup µw − 1. By setting the first hyperparameter of
this prior to be 1.0, we allow for a positive probability that the net markups may be
zero. This generality (a less stringent prior) turns out to be critical, as our posterior
estimates of µp − 1 and µw − 1 are nearly zero. We set the second hyperparameter of
the Gamma prior at 5.5 such that the implied 90% probability bounds are wide enough
(from 0.0094 to 0.5446).
  The prior for the parameter ρgz , capturing the impact of technological improvement
on government spending, is the Gamma distribution with the 90% probability bounds
given by [0.2, 3.0].
  The standard deviation of each of the 8 shocks has the Inverse Gamma prior distri-
bution with the 90% probability bounds given by [0.0005, 1.0]. These wide bounds are
necessary to take account of the possibility that some shocks may have very small vari-
ances while others may have very large variances. The two hyperparameters implied
by these bounds, as reported in Table 5, indicate that there exist no moments for this
Inverse Gamma prior.



D.3. Posterior estimates. The prior specified for the DSGE model is looser and more
agnostic in this paper than most priors used in the DSGE literature. The agnostic prior
comes also with a price: since the likelihood function for the Markov-switching mixture
model is complicated and full of multiple local peaks, the resulting posterior density
function is complicated as well. The non-Gaussian nature of the posterior density
implies that the posterior mean may have a very low probability and thus cannot
represent the most likely outcome for the model. The posterior mode is, by definition,
the most probable point in the parameter space, regardless of how non-Gaussian and
complicated the shape of the posterior probability density is. Moreover, using a point in
the neighborhood of the posterior mode as a starting point for the MCMC algorithm
avoids the situation where a long sequence of posterior draws gets stuck in the low
probability region due to a poor starting point.
             CONFRONTING MODEL MISSPECIFICATION IN MACROECONOMICS                      40

  Tables 6 and 7 report the posterior-mode estimates of the DSGE model parameters
along with the 90% marginal probability intervals. In these tables we contrast the es-
timated results for the Markov-switching mixture model to those for the DSGE model
when estimated alone (we call it “DSGE-only”). Despite the fact that the mixture
model discounts a great many observations used for estimation of the DSGE parame-
ters, a number of the estimated DSGE parameters from the mixture model are similar
to those from the DSGE-only model. For instance, the estimate of the average price
markup is close to zero, similar to the estimate in the DSGE-only model. This result
implies that the demand curve for differentiated goods is very flat. Thus, a small in-
crease in the relative price can lead to large declines in relative output demand. Even
if firms can re-optimize their pricing decisions frequently, they choose not to adjust
their relative prices too much. In other words, the small average markup and thus the
large demand elasticity become a source of strategic complementarity in firms’ pricing
decisions.
  The strength of strategic complementarity is measured by the price Phillips-curve
slope parameter:
                                               κp
                                     ps =            .
                                            1 + ᾱθp
The smaller the value of ps is, the stronger strategic complementarity is. According to
the posterior estimates for the DSGE model alone (Table 6), we have µp = 1.00019,
α1 = 0.177, α2 = 0.804, β = 0.9977, and ξp = 0.372. Thus, the Phillips-cure slope
parameter is pc = 0.0103. If there were no real rigidity (i.e., α1 + α2 were equal to one
exactly), we would have pc = κp = 1.0616. This weak strategic complementarity would
imply a fairly large response of inflation or the price level to a structural shock. But
our estimated Phillips-curve slope parameter is much smaller. To attain such a small
value (pc = 0.0103) without any real rigidity, the price sticky parameter would have
to be ξp = 0.90, implying the average duration of two and a half years before prices
change.
  The general pattern, as indicated by the 90% probability intervals, is that the
Markov-switching mixture model exposes more uncertainty about the estimated DSGE
parameters than what is implied when the DSGE model is treated as the truth and
estimated alone. In many cases, such as the inverse Frisch elasticity of labor supply
(η), the curvature of the capital utilization cost function evaluated at the steady state
              CONFRONTING MODEL MISSPECIFICATION IN MACROECONOMICS                                 41

(σu ), and the curvature of the adjustment cost function at the steady state (S ′′ ), the
probability distributions have changed to be heavily skewed to higher values. For in-
stance, the posterior distribution of η is so skewed that the mode is outside the 90%
probability interval.17
     In addition to changes of probability intervals, many of the estimated DSGE param-
eters from the mixture model are different from the DSGE-only model. For instance,
the estimate of β is much smaller for the mixture model than for the DSGE-only model.
Both the biased technology growth rate (λq ) and the output growth rate (λ∗ ) are esti-
mated to be much smaller from the mixture model than from the DSGE-only model.
These results are intuitive because the DSGE model in the mixture plays an important
role only in the late 1970s and early 1980s (see Figure 2). These are the times when
the U.S. economy experiences three large recessions in a very short period of time and
the growth rates are slower than the rest of the sample.
     Perhaps the most notable are changes pertaining to every persistence parameter. As
shown in Table 7, the 90% probability intervals for persistence parameters are much
wider in the mixture model than in the DSGE-only model. Specifically, the posterior
distributions for persistence parameters tend to have a long fat tail toward zero, in-
dicating much more uncertainty about the persistence of a shock than the inference
from the DSGE-only model. The estimates of persistence parameters themselves from
the mixture model are considerably smaller than those estimates from the DSGE-only
model.
     Another notable example pertains to the estimated results for the capital deprecia-
tion shock process. The estimate of the shock standard deviation (σd ) from the mixture
model is considerably larger than that from the DSGE-only model. Moreover, the 90%
probability interval indicates that the marginal distribution of the shock standard de-
viation is skewed heavily to a very high value. The estimated persistence parameter


     17Remember   that the number of parameters combined from the two models in the mixture is very
large and the shape of the posterior probability density over this high-dimensional parameter space is
extremely non-Gaussian full of skewness and fat-tails. When we compute the marginal 90% probability
interval of one parameter by integrating out all the rest of the parameters, it is not uncommon that
some posterior mode estimates fall outside the 90% probability intervals as indicated in Tables 6 and
7.

(ρd ), on the other hand, is smaller than that from the DSGE-only model. The proba-
bility interval implies a large amount of probability of lower values of the persistence
parameter than the value at the posterior mode. In the main text, we compare the
impulse responses to a depreciation shock from the mixture model to those from the
DSGE-only model.
