A Cautionary Tale of Evaluating Identifying Assumptions: Did Reality TV Really Cause a
Decline in Teenage Childbearing?

                                           ABSTRACT

Evaluating policy changes that occur everywhere at the same time is difficult because of the lack
of a clear counterfactual. Hoping to address this problem, researchers often proxy for differential
exposure using some observed characteristic in the pre-treatment period. As a cautionary tale of
how difficult identification is in such settings, we re-examine the results of an influential paper by
Melissa Kearney and Phillip Levine, who found that the MTV program 16 and Pregnant had a
substantial impact on teen birth rates. In what amounts to a difference-in-differences approach,
they use the pre-treatment levels of MTV viewership across media markets as an instrument. We
show that controlling for differential time trends in birth rates by a market’s pre-treatment racial/
ethnic composition or unemployment rate causes Kearney and Levine’s results to disappear,
invalidating the parallel trends assumption necessary for a causal interpretation. Extending the
pre-treatment period and estimating placebo tests, we find evidence of an “effect” long before 16
and Pregnant started broadcasting. Our results highlight the difficulty of drawing causal
inferences from national point-in-time policy changes.

       Evaluating policy changes that occur nationally at one point in time is particularly

challenging. Cross-country comparisons are unlikely to be convincing because of institutional and

cultural difference and simple before-and-after comparisons within a country are likely to be

confounded by secular changes over time in the outcome. Finding an appropriate counterfactual

in such cases is daunting and the assumptions necessary for identifying a causal effect should be

thoroughly scrutinized.

       One common identification strategy when evaluating a point-in-time change in policy is to

use pre-treatment characteristics of the units under study as a measure of the exposure to the

treatment. These characteristics are often interacted with indicators of time or other variables that

vary over time to create instruments that are used to isolate exogenous variation in the endogenous

variable of interest. The threats to identification are likely to be substantial, however, as the pre-

treatment characteristics must stratify the units in a way that is orthogonal to any subsequent trends

in the outcome apart from the effect of treatment.

       As a cautionary tale of the difficulty of meeting such assumptions, we reexamine the results

of a recent and influential paper by Kearney and Levine (2015b, henceforth KL) that claimed that

the MTV reality shows 16 and Pregnant, Teen Mom, and Teen Mom 2 (henceforth collectively

referred to as 16 and Pregnant) caused a 4.3 percent drop in teen birth rates between July 2009

and December 2010. This effect is large and would account for a quarter of the total reduction in

teen childbearing during this period. KL interpret their estimates as causal and write that “…a

social media campaign in the guise of a very popular reality TV show… adds a new ‘policy mix’”

(p. 3598) to current interventions designed to reduce teen pregnancy.

       KL use the audience share watching MTV at a specific time of day in each media market

in the year before 16 and Pregnant began broadcasting, interacted with a post-16 and Pregnant



                                                  1
dummy variable as an instrument for the 16 and Pregnant viewership. There is little theoretical

justification for this instrument, however, because MTV viewership is a choice variable that is

likely to be determined by the same demographic and socioeconomic factors that determine 16

and Pregnant viewership. Because the same demographic and socioeconomic factors are likely to

be associated with teen births, it is natural to question the exogeneity of the instrument. KL’s

identification fundamentally relies on comparing changes in teen birth rates before and after 16

and Pregnant in media markets with relatively high- and low-MTV viewership in the year before

the show.

       Identification strategies that use fixed unit characteristics (like MTV viewership in the pre-

treatment period) interacted with something that varies over time (like the post-treatment dummy

variable) are quite common. In another recent example, Nunn and Qian (2014) examine the impact

of U.S. food aid on conflict in recipient countries. They use U.S. wheat production in the period

prior to aid receipt interacted with the fraction of years that a country received any food aid in a

fixed twenty-five-year period to create an instrument for U.S. food aid that varies by country and

time period. Nunn and Qian note explicitly that their identification strategy is a difference-in-

differences analysis. In a critique similar to ours about KL, Christian and Barrett (2017) conclude

that the parallel trends assumption inherent in Nunn and Qian’s analysis does not hold.

       As noted by Goldsmith-Pinkham, Sorkin, and Swift (2018), KL’s identification strategy is

also related to the use of “Bartik” or shift-share instruments common in the trade literature, and

the literature estimating the impact of immigration on wages and other outcomes, among others.

Goldsmith-Pinkham, Sorkin, and Swift (2018) discuss the general conditions for validity of Bartik

instruments in static contexts, while Jaeger, Ruist, and Stuhler (2018) raise concerns about such

instruments in presence of dynamic adjustment processes, particularly in the immigration



                                                 2
literature. All of these studies can be viewed as essentially relying on a difference-in-differences

research design on the basis of pre-treatment characteristics.

       KL’s reliance on a variant of the “shift-share” methodology stands in marked contrast to

other studies of the impact of media (Gentzkow 2006, Della Vigna and Kaplan 2007, Gentzkow

and Shapiro 2008, Jensen and Oster 2009, La Ferrara, Chong, and Duryea 2012, Campante and

Hojman 2013, Kearney and Levine 2015a, among others). In all of these studies, the authors

exploit plausibly exogenous changes in media exposure across both space and time. The addition

of spatial variation allows these authors to control more convincingly for trends that may confound

the treatments in question.

       The assumption necessary for a causal interpretation of KL’s results is that trends in teen

birth rates in geographic areas with high- and low-MTV viewership would have been the same,

conditional on area and time fixed effect and a limited set of covariates, in the absence of 16 and

Pregnant. How likely is it that this identifying assumption holds? Teen birth rates began falling

precipitously with the onset of the Great Recession in 2008 and there were profound racial and

ethnic differences in the rate of decline. Given the substantial geographic variation in racial/ethnic

composition, trends in birth rates in the media markets used by KL are also likely to vary because

of different trends in birth rates by race/ethnicity. These differences may confound KL’s estimates

and violate the parallel trend assumption necessary for a causal interpretation.

       This is precisely what we find. Allowing for differential time trends by the racial/ethnic

composition of a media market eliminates any association between 16 and Pregnant and teen birth

rates, as well as the birth rates of women ages 20 to 24 and 25-29. We obtain the same null findings

when we interact the racial/ethnic composition of an area with the unemployment rate. The

importance of differential time trends in teen birth rates prior to 16 and Pregnant is evident from



                                                  3
KL’s own results. They report no association between 16 and Pregnant and the birth rates of non-

Hispanic black and Hispanic teens when their analyses are stratified by race/ethnicity, despite

national data indicating that black and Hispanic young women watched the show as much, or even

more, than their white counterparts (Kearney and Levine 2014).

       To assess whether parallel trends in birth rates between low- and high-MTV viewing areas

held before 16 and Pregnant began broadcasting, we perform a series of placebo tests and find an

“effect” of 16 and Pregnant prior to the advent of the show. Using Kearney and Levine’s “IV

Event Study” methodology, we also show that including even a few additional periods in the

analysis prior to the beginning of 16 and Pregnant leads to a rejection of the hypothesis that pre-

treatment trends were parallel. Combined with our in-sample results, our out-of-sample rejection

of the parallel trends assumption leave little question that KL’s results do not warrant a causal

interpretation.



I.     KL’s Empirical Framework



       KL’s empirical model consists of the following four equations



(1)               ln#$%&' (=*+, + *++ #%./0163& × 356/' ( + *+7 8&9 + :&' ;+ + <+' + =+&> + ?+&'

where BRjt is the birth rate by calendar quarter of conception t, in Designated Market Area (DMA)

j; Rate16Pj is the average Nielsen rating in DMA j for the shows 16 and Pregnant, Teen Mom, and

Teen Mom 2 for 12 to 24 year-old viewers for the seven Nielsen sweep months, when viewership

is measured to set advertising rates for the following period, of July 2009, February 2010, July

2010, November 2010, May 2011, November 2011, and May 2012; Postt is a dichotomous

indicator for the period after the introduction of 16 and Pregnant; MTV0809j is the average Nielsen

rating for 12 through 24 year olds in DMAj for all MTV shows in the sweeps months of July 2008,

November 2008, February 2009, and May 2009, Ujy is the annual unemployment rate in DMA j

in year y; Xjy is a vector that includes the percent population in the DMA that is that non-Hispanic

black, and the percent that is Hispanic in calendar year y; the qt’s represent time period (quarter)

fixed effects; and the   js’s   are full sets of DMA ´ season fixed effects, which also implicitly

include DMA fixed effects. Note that we have modified KL’s notation to reflect that the

parameters and disturbance terms differ across equations.

       Equation (1) represents the equation of interest that yields estimates of the association

between 16 and Pregnant viewership and teen birth rates. Equation (3) is the first stage regression

with (MTV0809j ´ Postt) as an instrument. Equation (2) is the second stage regression and identical

to equation (1) except that predicted 16 and Pregnant viewership derived from equation (2) is used

instead of actual 16 and Pregnant viewership. Equation (4) represents the reduced form effect of

MTV viewership on teen birth rates.

       KL’s study period includes 24 quarters (2005:QI – 2010:QIV) for 205 DMAs for a total

(potential) sample of 4,920 observations. The dependent variable is missing in some DMAs in

some quarters because there are no teen births. This occurs more frequently in the analyses


                                                  5
stratified by age or race/ethnicity. Ratings for 16 and Pregnant are measured during the time slot

from 9:00 to 10:00 pm for 12- to 24-year-old viewers on Tuesdays in the sweep months. KL

average these Tuesday ratings within each month and then average the four months of ratings and

assign that value to the six post-16 and Pregnant quarters within each DMA. They follow the

same procedure for the MTV ratings during the period 2008:QIII to 2009:QII by using the average

for the four quarters within each DMA. The ratings that KL use for 16 and Pregnant and MTV

therefore vary only in the cross section (by DMA).

       KL use the interaction between a time-invariant, DMA-specific measure of MTV

viewership and an indicator for the post-16 and Pregnant period as the instrument for the

viewership of 16 and Pregnant. For the instrument to be valid, MTV viewership in the pre-16 and

Pregnant Period must “randomly” assign 16 and Pregnant viewership, conditional on DMA fixed

effects and a small number of covariates. Because of the inclusion of DMA fixed effects, this

interaction is necessary to generate time series variation in the instrument, which consists of zeros

in all DMAs and all quarters from 2005:QI to 2009:QII with a discrete jump for each DMA in

2009:QIII. The measure of 16 and Pregnant is also time invariant in the post-treatment period

(and obviously zero in the pre-treatment period), generating a strong first-stage association.



II.    Within-Sample Evaluation of KL’s Identifying Assumptions



       KL’s reduced form compares teen birth rates before and after the introduction of 16 and

Pregnant, stratified by levels of MTV viewership in the year before the show began. The key

identification assumption is therefore parallel trends: in the absence of 16 and Pregnant, birth

rates should change in the same way in areas with high and low MTV viewership. Figure 1 shows


                                                 6
that overall teen birth rates decline significantly prior to 16 and Pregnant and that the rate of

decline accelerates after 2007 with the onset of the Great Recession. There is substantial variation

in the rate of decline across race/ethnicity groups. The average annual change in teen births

between 2005 and 2010 was -1.9 percent among non-Hispanic whites, -2.9 percent among non-

Hispanic blacks and -6.3 percent among Hispanics (our calculations based on data reported in

Hamilton, et al. 2015).

        While differential trends across race/ethnicity groups in birth rates do not, by themselves,

invalidate KL’s identification strategy, the likelihood that these differential trends will cause the

parallel trends assumption to be violated increases to the extent to which DMAs vary in their ethnic

composition. We find that the correlation between MTV viewership (in 2008-9) and the non-

Hispanic black share of the female population (in 2005) is quite high (0.413) while substantially

lower for the Hispanic share (0.093). This masks some variation, however, for Hispanics. In 2005,

the Hispanic share of the female population across the four quartiles (lowest to highest) of MTV

viewership was 11.1, 19.8, 16.6 and 18.1, respectively. The corresponding values for the non-

Hispanic black share in 2005 across quartiles of MTV viewership were monotonic: 7.6, 11.6, 13.9,

and 20.3, respectively. These substantial differences in race/ethnicity across quartiles of the

instrument are a threat to KL’s identification strategy if there are differential trends by racial

groups within high- and low-MTV watching areas. This is what we find in Figure 2, which

presents trends in log teen birth rates for each of the race/ethnicity groups that KL examine for

groups of DMAs by quartile of MTV viewership in 2008-09. For non-Hispanic blacks and

Hispanics, in particular, the trends in log teen birth rates across MTV quartiles do not appear to be

parallel.




                                                 7
       To assess formally the importance of this potential confounding for KL’s estimates, we

augment their model with time trends that vary with levels of the exogenous covariates,

particularly the pre-16 and Pregnant racial/ethnic composition. This approach has been used in

several recent articles (Hoynes and Schanzenbach 2009; Hoynes, Schanzenbach, and Almond

2016; and Hjort, Sølvsten, and Wüst, 2017). Large changes in the IV and reduced form coefficients

after including these trends would suggest that KL’s estimates are biased.

       The results are shown in Table 1. In each panel, we show the reduced form estimates from

equation (4) and the IV estimates from equation (2), which include DMA and period fixed effects.

Panel 1 exactly replicates KL’s reduced form and IV estimates for comparison. In panel 2 we

show estimates from a specification in which we interact the values of the covariates, X, in 2005

(well before the start of 16 and Pregnant) with the period fixed effects. Both the reduced form

relationship between MTV and the IV estimate of the impact of 16 and Pregnant are reduced by a

factor of approximately 10 and are no longer statistically significantly different from zero.

       The results in panel 2 strongly suggest that the parallel trends assumption in KL’s model

does not hold.     In panel 3 we reduce the possibility of overfitting by estimating a more

parsimonious specification, adding only interactions of the three covariates with a linear trend to

the base models from equations (4) and (2). These results are very similar to those in panel 2 and,

again, suggest that the parallel trends assumption does not hold. In panel 4 we limit the trend

interactions to the percent non-Hispanic black and percent Hispanic in 2005, yielding reduced form

and IV coefficients that are still approximately only 1/3 the size of those in panel 1 and are not

statistically significantly different from zero. In contrast, in panel 5 we include only the interaction

of a trend with the unemployment rate in 2005 and obtain results that are quite similar to KL’s in

panel 1.



                                                   8
       As Figures 1 and 2 suggest, the results in panels 4 and 5 lead to the conclusion that the

effect of 16 and Pregnant that KL estimate is largely driven by differential trends in birth rates

across race and ethnic groups that are correlated with the timing of the introduction 16 and

Pregnant. We confirm this in panels 6 through 8, where we simplify the trend interactions further

and merely interact the covariate levels in 2005 with Postt. The single interaction of the covariate

levels in 2005 with the post-period dummy is nested within the specification that interacts the same

covariates with the complete set of time fixed effects. A Wald test indicates that we cannot reject

the restrictions implied in panel 6 relative to panel 2. The results are essentially the same as in

panels 3 through 5. Taken together, the results in Table 1 strongly suggest that the parallel trend

assumption underlying the KL analysis does not hold and that a causal interpretation of KL’s

estimated impact of 16 and Pregnant is unwarranted and, indeed, that 16 and Pregnant had no

meaningful effect on teen birth rates.



Stratification by Age



       In their Table 2, KL present results of the effect of 16 and Pregnant stratified by age and

race/ethnicity. We exactly replicate their estimates for 20 to 24 year olds (panel 1), 25 to 29 year

olds (panel 2) and 30 to 34 year olds (panel 3) in the odd-numbered rows in our Table 2. In the

even-numbered rows, we modify those specifications by including, as in panel 3 of Table 1, a

linear time trend interacted with the level of the three covariates in 2005. We have also estimated

these models using both the full set of period ´ 2005 covariate interactions as well as the 2005

covariates interacted with the Postt dummy. The results are qualitatively similar and available

from the authors by request. As in Table 1, when we include these interactions, we find no


                                                 9
statistically significant associations between 16 and Pregnant and birth rates by age. For example,

KL report that a one ratings point increase in the viewership of 16 and Pregnant lowers birth rates

of 20-24 year-olds by 2.4 percent (row 3, panel 1). Inclusion of the additional trend terms reduces

the effect to a statistically insignificant reduction (p-value of 0.19) of 0.9 percent (row 4, panel 1).

We find the same pattern for 25-29 and 30-34 year-olds, respectively.

       The results in Tables 1 and 2 suggest that the estimated association between 16 and

Pregnant and teen birth rates reported by KL is due to differential trends in birth rates across areas

in ways that are associated with MTV viewing. The more challenging task is to explain why. As

Figure 1 shows, the differential rate of decline in teen birth rates by race/ethnicity appears to have

increased with the onset of the Great Recession. Several recent studies demonstrate that the Great

Recession had particularly large effects on the fertility of young women (Sobotka, Skirbekk, and

Philipov, 2011; Cherlin, et al. 2013). Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2017) show that recent trade

shocks that affect the employment opportunities of less educated men and women decrease both

marriage and birth rates. Kearney and Wilson (2017) have documented that improved economic

conditions from the fracking boom may lead to increased non-marital and marital fertility. Most

relevant for our analysis, Villarreal (2014) finds that areas with relatively large Hispanic

populations may have been more affected by the Great Recession through decreased employment

and flow of immigrants.

       To explore the differential response of birth rates to the Great Recession, in Table 3 we

interact each of the three covariate levels in 2005 with the unemployment rate. We find that for

teens, the IV coefficient on 16 and Pregnant falls from -2.37 (Table 2, row 3) to -0.562 (Table 3,

row 2). For this group, the interaction between the share of the DMA that is black in 2005 and the

unemployment rate is negative and statistically significant – consistent with the hypothesis that


                                                  10
worse labor market conditions lowered birth rates differentially for minority populations. We find

similar results for Hispanics in the other age groups. For all age groups, the interaction between

the unemployment rate in 2005 and the contemporaneous unemployment rate are also statistically

significant, suggesting a non-linear relationship between birth rates and labor market conditions.

As in Tables 2 and 3, allowing for the effect of the racial/ethnic composition on birth rates to vary

over time reduces the reduced form and IV coefficients such that they are no longer statistically

significant.



Stratification by Race/Ethnicity



          KL stratify by race/ethnicity and find that the effects of 16 and Pregnant are statistically

significant for non-Hispanic whites and marginally so for Hispanics. In the odd-numbered rows

of Table 4 we replicate these results for all three race/ethnicity groups. KL do not include

race/ethnicity variables in these regressions. To test the parallel trends assumption, therefore, we

now include a full set of DMA-specific time trends. KL find that an increase in 16 and Pregnant

viewership lowers the birth rates of non-Hispanic whites by 2.4 percent (panel 1, row 3). When

we include DMA-specific trends, this coefficient turns positive and is statistically insignificantly

different from zero (panel 1, row 4). We find no statistically significant reduced form or IV effects

for non-Hispanic blacks (panel 2) or Hispanics (panel 3). As with the full sample, we find little

in these results to suggest that 16 and Pregnant affected birth rates in any of the race/ethnicity

groups.




                                                  11
III.   Out-of-Sample Evaluation of KL’s Identifying Assumptions



       As Kahn-Lang and Lang (forthcoming) note, differences in mean outcomes between the

treatment and control groups at some point prior to the beginning of treatment suggest that parallel

trends between the two groups do not hold unless there is some identifiable explanation. One way

to assess these differences is to extend the pre-treatment period. The choice of how long into the

past to extend the pre-treatment period is, of course, arbitrary. This is a practical not a conceptual

issue, however, as the beginning of the pre-treatment period is usually determined arbitrarily, by

data availability, or by path dependence in the conduct of the analysis. Even if there are level

differences at some point in the past, small changes in the length of the pre-treatment period should

not greatly affect estimated treatment effects if the parallel trends assumption holds.

       In practice, there are few guidelines for what constitutes a sufficiently long (or short) pre-

treatment period, which may lead to “cherry picking” results. Robustness of results to pre-

treatment periods of different lengths would increase confidence in those results, particularly when

the pre-treatment period includes geographic and over-time variation in factors that are known

predictors of the outcome. Periods, like the Great Recession, in which the covariates differ in their

relationship to the outcome relative to other periods, may be ill-suited for inclusion in the analysis.

       We conduct two types of analyses to assess the validity of the parallel trends assumption.

In the first, we do placebo tests to assess the “impact” of 16 and Pregnant in periods before the

show was broadcast.      In the second, we replicate KL’s “Reduced Form Event Study” and

incrementally extend the pre-treatment period further into the past.




                                                  12
Placebo Tests



       As we have noted, MTV ratings should be unrelated to trends in birth rates conditional on

time and DMA fixed effects except through their relationship with 16 and Pregnant ratings. Any

association between MTV ratings and birth rates in the pre-16 and Pregnant period would suggest

a violation of the exclusion restriction (i.e., parallel trends) necessary for identification. In Table

5, we present results from a series of reduced form and IV regressions in which we artificially start

a placebo “show” in sequential quarters. Each regression includes 24 quarters, the same length of

analysis used by KL: 18 prior to the beginning of the placebo show and 6 after, including the

quarter that the “show” starts. We estimate the reduced form equation (4) and IV equation (5) and

use MTV viewing from 2008-2009 interacted with a post-“show” indicator as the instrument.

       Each row of Table 5 presents the estimated coefficients and standard errors from the

estimation of the reduced form and instrumental variables models from a different 24 quarter-

period. For example, in row (1) the 24-quarter period begins in 2001:Q1 and ends in 2006:QIV,

with the placebo show beginning in 2005:QIII. Row 12, which is shaded in the table, reproduces

KL’s reduced form and instrumental variables results from their Table 1 columns (4) and (3),

respectively. For the reduced form, we find that 9 of the 11 estimated coefficients in rows (1)

through (11), which use data exclusively from the pre-16 and Pregnant period, are statistically

different from zero at conventional levels. That all of the estimates are negative and roughly equal

to KL’s reduced form result in magnitude strongly suggests that that the parallel trends assumption

required for the difference-in-differences strategy does not hold. Because the sample period is

fixed at 24 quarters, the first stage relationship between MTV and 16 and Pregnant ratings is quite

stable, with the first-stage coefficient on MTV Ratings ranging from 1.457 in row (1) to 1.524 in



                                                  13
row (9); the first-stage coefficient is 1.513 in row (12), which corresponds to KL’s analysis period.

The IV results therefore reflect those from the reduced form.

       Adjusting for multiple comparisons in Table 5 using the Bonferroni (1936) correction or

the somewhat more powerful Bonferroni-Holm (Holm 1979) correction leads to rejection of none

of the null hypotheses that the coefficients in both the reduced form and instrumental variables

placebo results equal to zero. For the purposes of these tests, we treat the reduced form and

instrumental variables results separately. Both the Bonferroni and Bonferroni-Holm multiple

comparison procedures fix the so-called familywise error rate (the rate of committing any Type I

error) and tend to have substantially less power than single comparison procedures. An alternative

procedure is to focus on the so-called false discovery rate (FDR), which is less conservative and

fixes the share of null hypothesis rejections that are false rather than fixing the probability that any

null hypothesis rejections are false. When we perform the Benjamini-Hochberg (1995) on the 11

placebo reduced form tests, we do not reject any of the hypotheses implicit in Table 5 when we fix

the FDR at 5 or 10 percent. Increasing the FDR to 11 percent leads to the rejection of the null in

rows 7 through 9, and increasing it to twenty percent allows us to reject the null in all but row 1.

If we fix the FDR at 5 percent for the placebo instrumental variables results, we reject the null that

the coefficient in row 7 is equal to zero. Increasing the FDR to 10 percent, leads to the rejection

of the null hypotheses that the coefficients in rows 6 through 10 are separately equal to zero, and

if the FDR is set at 20 percent we reject the nulls in rows 4 through 11.

       The IV estimates in Table 5 are similar to KL’s “IV Event Study” (p. 3614) in the sense

that we use data on MTV and 16 and Pregnant Ratings that post-date the period under study. For

example, in row (7) our IV estimate suggests that teen birth rates decrease 2.194 percent from a

one rating point increase in our placebo 16 and Pregnant show, which is very similar to the


                                                  14
estimate of -1.88 that KL report in their Figure 6 and Appendix Table B1. Our estimate captures

unobserved and time-varying factors within the DMA that are correlated with teen birth rates and

16 and Pregnant viewership. Finding any statistically significant coefficients in a period before

16 and Pregnant began broadcasting strongly suggests that KL’s instrument is invalid.

       Although we have presented a series of placebo results in order to keep from “cherry

picking” those that are particularly favorable to our argument, we recognize that the results in

Table 5 are not independent of one another when the “treatment” periods overlap.              We have

therefore boxed rows 1 and 7 to illustrate results where the “post” periods are disjoint (and as

indicated above, all placebo “treatment” periods are disjoint from the actual period when 16 and

Pregnant was being broadcast). Focusing only on rows 1, 7, and 12, on the basis of the coefficients

and their statistical significance, it would be virtually impossible to distinguish which of these

results was generated by the actual 16 and Pregnant and which were placebo tests.



“Reduced Form Event Study”



       KL present results from an “event study” of the reduced-form relationship between MTV

viewership and teen birth rates (KL Figure 5 and Appendix Table B1). Their primary goal is to

assess the validity of the parallel trends assumption. They estimate the following regression:

                                  14
                 ln(BR jt ) = β0 + ∑ α i ( MTV 0809 j × PreQi ) +
                                  i=1
(5)                               24

                                  ∑ β ( MTV 0809 × PostQ ) +φ U
                                         i            j       i     jy
                                                                         +θt +δ js + ε jt .
                                  i=19



The coefficients αi show the average difference in log birth rates for varying levels of MTV

viewership by quarter of conception in the pre-16 and Pregnant period (quarters 1 to 14, 2005:QI-

2009:QII) relative to the reference category (quarters 15 to 18, 2008:QIII-2009:QII). The βi

                                                 15
coefficients show the same contrast, but for the six quarters after the introduction of 16 and

Pregnant (quarters 19 to 24: 2009:III-2010:QIV). KL reported that the joint null hypothesis that

L+ = 0, L7 = 0, … , L+K = 0 cannot be rejected, but the null hypothesis that *+O = 0, *7, =

0, … , *7K = 0 is rejected (p<0.01).

       KL take the lack of a statistically significant relationship between MTV and birth rates in

the pre-16 and Pregnant period as evidence that their instrument meets the exclusion restriction.

We test this assumption further by extending the event study analysis backwards in increments of

two years. In Figure 3, Panels 1, 2, and 3, we present results from estimating equation (5) for

periods with the starting year in 2005 (KL’s period), 2003, and 2001, respectively. We present the

c2 statistic for the joint test of the coefficients in the pre-16 and Pregnant period. Unlike KL, we

use the first four quarters in each panel as the reference period. The c2 tests for the coefficients in

the pre-16 and Pregnant period are invariant to the choice of a reference category (in the pre-

treatment period). KL’s choice of using the four quarters prior to the start of 16 and Pregnant as

the reference category is arbitrary, tends to obscure the smooth trends in the birth rates, and gives

the appearance of a discontinuity when, in fact, a break in trend is difficult to discern.

       The downward trend in teen birth rates in the years prior to 16 and Pregnant and the lack

of a clear discontinuity at 2009:QIII is quite apparent in all three panels and we strongly reject the

null hypothesis that the pre-16 and Pregnant coefficients are jointly equal to zero in Panels 2 and

3 with p-values of 0.036 and <0.001, respectively. These results are not artifacts of greatly

extending the period of analysis. Extending the pre-16 and Pregnant period even by only two

years (Panel A of Table 2) results in rejection of the null that pre-treatment coefficients are jointly

equal to zero. The sensitivity of KL’s results to extending the pre-treatment period by even a small

amount suggests that the assumptions needed to identify a causal effect are unlikely to be met.


                                                  16
       Although there is no formal and global test of the parallel trends assumption, even a lack

of rejection of differential trends cannot disprove a change in trends for the counterfactual group

in the post-treatment period. In the case of 16 and Pregnant, a number of factors suggest that

underlying trends in teen fertility may be confounding KL's estimate of its impact. As we show

in Figure 2, there are clearly differential trends in teen birth rates by race/ethnicity and MTV

viewership prior to the beginning of 16 and Pregnant. There is also a noticeable dip in the reduced-

form relationship between MTV viewership and birth rates beginning in 2008, as shown in panels

B and C of Figure 3, that is coincident with the onset of the Great Recession. A point-in-time

change at the national level is more vulnerable to coincident shocks than interventions that occur

across time and space.




IV.    Conclusion



       Identification strategies that interact fixed pre-treatment characteristics with variables that

vary over time are quite common and may seem particularly enticing for evaluating policies or

treatments that begin at a single point in time for an entire population. In such cases, the lack of

an obvious counterfactual for the treated group in the post-treatment period makes identification

of causal effects difficult, and studies claiming to estimate a causal effect in in the face of such

challenges should be viewed with appropriate skepticism.

       As an example of the difficulties associated with identification in these situations, we have

reexamined causal claims that the MTV program 16 and Pregnant was responsible for lowering



                                                 17
birth rates substantially in the United States. Our results strongly suggest that the association

between 16 and Pregnant and teen birth rates is due to differential trends in birth rates across areas

with different demographic characteristics in the wake of Great Recession. The fertility rates of

less advantaged teens, as proxied by race/ethnicity, fell much faster with the onset of the recession

than those of white non-Hispanics. We find a relationship between MTV and birth rates even in

the period prior to the existence of 16 and Pregnant, casting substantial doubt on the validity of

the parallel trends assumption required for identification. While is possible that 16 and Pregnant

may have affected teen birth rates, our results point to the difficulty of making a causal claim that

the show, which debuted nationally at the nadir of the Great Recession, had a significant impact

on teen birth rates.

        Our results add to a growing literature that highlights the difficulties associated with

identification strategies that employ instruments derived from interacting pre-treatment

characteristics with a time varying variable. Future researchers wishing to identify a causal effect

of a policy that was introduced everywhere at a single point in time, who may be tempted to use

similar instruments, should recognize that “shift-share” instruments are not a panacea and be

careful to assess thoroughly whether the necessary assumptions inherent in such research designs

are credible.

Source: Authors’ calculations using Bureau of Labor Statistics Local Area Unemployment Statistics,
Bureau of the Census Census County Characteristics, National Vital Statistics System births, and Nielsen
ratings data. The latter two data sources are confidential.
Notes: These figures plot the coefficients of average MTV Ratings interacted with period dummy variables.
The regressions also include the unemployment rate, the percent non-Hispanic black, percent Hispanic, and
a full set of period dummy variables and DMA × season interactions. Variance-covariance matrices are calculated by
clustering by DMA. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals shown. The χ2 tests shown are for the joint
significance of the coefficients shown in the pre-16 and Pregnant period. Panel A shows the period used in
Kearney and Levine (2015b). Regressions are weighted by the female population aged 15-19 in the DMA.

Note: Each row shows results from a separate regression. The dependent variable in all regressions is the natural logarithm of the birth rate for 15-19 year olds.
Standard errors, clustered by DMA, are shown in parentheses. All regressions are weighted by the female population aged 15 to 19 in the DMA at the time of the
observation. All regressions include 24 quarter fixed effects as well DMA × season fixed effects as regressors. The sample size in all regressions is 4,919. ***

Notes: Entries in the table are a) in the reduced form, the estimated coefficient on MTV Ratings in 2008:QIII-
2009:QII interacted with a dummy variable for being in the "post" period and b) for instrumental variables, the
estimated coefficient on 16 and Pregnant Ratings interacted with a dummy variable for being in the "post" period
where the instrument is the regressor of interest from the reduced form regressions. Standard errors, clustered by
DMA, are shown in parentheses. All regressions are weighted by the female population aged 15-19 in the DMA at
the time of the observation. In each regression there are 18 pre-"show" quarers and 6 post-"show" quarters. All
regressions also include the unemployment rate, the percent of the population that is non-Hispanic black and the
percent of the population that is Hispanic, 24 quarter fixed effects as well DMA × season fixed effects as regressors.
