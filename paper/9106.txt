                                              ABSTRACT

        Does economic development depend on geographic endowments like temperate instead of
tropical location, the ecological conditions shaping diseases, or an environment good for grains or certain
cash crops? Or do these endowments of tropics, germs, and crops affect economic development only
through institutions or policies? We test the endowment, institution, and policy views against each other
using cross country evidence. We find evidence that tropics, germs, and crops affect development through
institutions. We find no evidence that tropics, germs, and crops affect country incomes directly other than
through institutions, nor do we find any effect of policies on development once we control for institutions.

   1. Introduction

       Burundi today has a per capita income of $200, which is one-third lower than 4 decades

ago. Burundi is poor despite a lush agricultural endowment that has three growing seasons,

abundant rainfall, fertile volcanic soils, and suitability for cash crops such as coffee, tea, cotton,

bananas, palm oil, and rice.1

       Burundi has other geographic endowments that place it at a disadvantage, however,

according to some stories of economic development summarized below. It is virtually on the

equator, is landlocked, is far from rich trading partners, and has a disease environment that has

left life expectancy today at only 47 years. During the colonial period, mortality among the

European settlers was a frightful 280 per 1000 per year. The Belgian colonialists thus did not

settle but exploited the colony through forced labor on coffee and other cash crop plantations and

compulsory food crop quotas.2 The Belgians ruled indirectly through Tutsi chiefs, to whom they

spuriously attributed “racial superiority” over the Hutu.3 Even the cash crops that could generate

high export revenue are thought to be adverse for political economy and institutional

development according to some studies.

       Three Tutsi military dictators from the same commune in Bururi province have ruled

Burundi for 32 out of the 38 years since independence, which has been marred by massacres of

civilians, recurrent civil war, and as noted, economic decline.4 Institutions have disastrously

failed to protect the citizens’ lives or to establish any resemblance of the rule of law. Ndikumana

(1998) describes how the elite “privatized” the state and enforced their control through violence.

Nkurunziza and Ngaruko (2002) show how the rulers have systematically looted the economy,

using mechanisms such as state subsidies to public enterprises controlled by the rulers, severe

taxation of cash crops, lucrative civil service positions for the ruling clan (the mean government
                                                                                                       2

wage puts the civil servant in the richest 6% of the economy), acquiring consumer goods at

controlled prices and reselling them on the black market, and acquiring foreign exchange at the

official rate and reselling it at the much higher black market rate.

       Canada today has a per capita income 107 times higher than Burundi’s. Canada is rich

today despite being marginal for much of the colonial period. In the peace negotiations between

Britain and France following the Seven Years War in the 18th century (which Voltaire described

as “fighting over a few acres of snow”), the British seriously debated taking the island of

Guadeloupe instead of Canada as reparations for the war.5

       Yet Canada has geographic endowments that some stories of economic development

argue give it advantages. It is far from the tropics, has a long border with a rich trading partner,

has access to the sea, and has a disease environment that gives it a life expectancy of 79 years.

During the colonial period, mortality among European settlers was only one-seventeenth of

Burundi’s. While Canada lacks lucrative cash crops like coffee, cotton, and tea, it is one of the

world’s premier grain producers – and some studies suggest grain endowments are better for

political economy and institutional development than tropical cash crops.

       Canada has long been a democracy with the rule of law, has never had a civil war, and

has one of the world’s best ratings on freedom from corruption.6 Canada’s boring rulers have

perpetrated few of the egregious interventions in the economy seen in Burundi.

How much of Canadians’ 107-fold income advantage over Burundians is due to more favorable

geographic endowments? How much is due to better institutions? How much is due to better

policies? Do the alleged geographic advantages of Canada over Burundi directly affect income,

or do they work through institutions or policies?
                                                                                                     3

       The purpose of this research is to assess empirically different theories of how geography,

institutions, and policy influence economic development.

       The geography/endowment hypothesis holds that environment directly influences the

quality of land, labor, and production technologies (Machiavelli, 1519; Montesquieu, 1750). For

example, compared to temperate climates, tropical environments tend to have poor crop yields,

more debilitating diseases, and endowments that cannot effectively employ production

technologies developed in more temperate zones (Kamarck, 1976; Diamond, 1997). Similarly,

particular geographical circumstances – whether a country is landlocked and therefore not open

to trade – will permanently limit the country’s ability to access a large economic market, hinder

its ability to exploit economies of scale, and therefore lower its production efficiency (Sachs and

Warner, 1995; 1997). Resource endowments like minerals or ecological conditions favoring cash

crops may also influence income. According to the geography hypothesis, the environment

shapes economic development directly by influencing the inputs into the production function and

the production function itself (i.e. certain endowments could make production technologically

more difficult).

       The institution view holds that the environment’s main impact on economic development

runs through long-lasting institutions. For example, environments where crops are most

effectively produced using large plantations will quickly develop political and legal institutions

that protect the few landholders from the many peasants and may even feature slavery

(Engerman and Sokoloff, 1997; Sokoloff and Engerman, 2000). Even when agriculture recedes

from the economic spotlight, enduring institutions will continue to thwart competition and hence

economic development. Similarly, many countries’ institutions were shaped during colonization,

so that examining colonies is a natural experiment (Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson, 2001;
                                                                                                     4

2002). European colonialists found different disease environments around the globe. In colonies

with inhospitable germs and climates, the colonial powers established extractive institutions, so

that a few colonialists could exploit natural resources. In colonies with hospitable climates and

germs, colonial powers established settler institutions. According to this view, the institutional

structures created by the colonialists in response to the environment endure even with the end of

colonialism. Thus, the institution view argues that the major impact of the environment on

economic development runs through its long-lasting impact on institutions.7 Technology in this

story is endogenous to the institutions that make adoption of better techniques of production

likely.

          Finally, the policy view – which is really a collection of many different approaches --

questions the importance of tropics, germs, and crops in shaping economic development today.

This view is embedded in the approach of multilateral development institutions. The policy view

holds that economic policies and institutions reflect current knowledge and political forces.

Thus, changes in either knowledge about which policies and institutions are best for development

or changes in political incentives will produce rapid changes in institutions and economic

policies. In this view, history does not play a large role – any adverse historical legacy can be

quickly reversed. According to the policy view, while tropical environments, disease, and

specific crops may have influenced production and institutions, understanding environmental

forces is not crucial to understanding economic development today.

          The purpose of this research is to assess which of these three views of the role of the

environment in economic development enjoys the most empirical support. There may be overlap

and interactions among these theories of economic development. In motivating the analysis,

however, we highlight the distinctions.

2. Literature review

       A. Geography/Endowment hypothesis

       Some studies argue for direct effects of tropics, germs, and crops on development. Many

authors have noted the association between tropical location and underdevelopment, going at

least as far back as Montesquieu (1750). People long ago gave a racist interpretation to the

climate theory of underdevelopment, including Montesquieu, which helps explain why

economists have been reluctant to revive it:

       You will find in the climates of the north, peoples with few vices, many virtues,
       sincerity and truthfulness. Approach the south, you will think you are leaving
       morality itself, the passions become more vivacious and multiply crimes... The
       heat can be so excessive that the body is totally without force. The resignation
       passes to the spirit and leads people to be without curiosity, nor the desire
       for noble enterprise.8

       Still guilt by association is not sufficient reason to discard the tropics hypothesis, or to

ignore the strong correlation between latitude and income. Sachs and Warner (1995, 1997)

suggest that tropical location, landlocked location, and commodity dependence directly inhibit

development or growth. Bloom and Sachs (1998) point to Africa’s tropical location as a large

hindrance to development. Bloom and Sachs (1998) and Sachs (2001) argue that tropical location

leads to underdevelopment through mechanisms such as (1) the fragility and low fertility of

tropical soils, (2) high prevalence of crop pests and parasites, (3) excessive plant respiration and

lower rate of net photosynthesis, (4) high evaporation and unstable supply of water, (5) lack of a

dry season, cold temperatures, or long enough summer days for temperate grain crops, 9 (6)

ecological conditions favoring infectious diseases for humans, (7) lack of coal deposits, and (8)

high transport costs.

         Landes (1998, p.5) says the tropics inhibit work: “few manage to work at full capacity

when hot and wet.” He quotes a Third World diplomat as saying “in countries like India,
                                                                                                       6

Pakistan, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Ghana I have always felt enervated by the slightest physical or

mental exertion, whereas in the UK, France, Germany, or the US I have always felt reinforced

and stimulated by the temperate climate” (p. 15). A related idea with an ancient lineage is that

it’s easy to gather food crops in the tropics (the opposite of the Bloom and Sachs (1988) idea),

which reduces the need to work hard and produce: “fertile countries … are apt to making men

idle and unable to exercise any virtu”(Machiavelli 1519). 10

       Diamond (1997) doesn’t stress tropics, but instead suggests that germs and crops directly

affected the technological development of societies in the very long run. First, some peoples

developed some resistance to germs like smallpox and measles that they got from their farm

animals (like Europe), while other peoples lacked farm animals and did not develop this

resistance, with catastrophic results once Europeans arrived (the Americas after Columbus, later

the Pacific islands). Draft animals also conveyed a direct productivity advantage (Eurasia), while

other regions suffered technological disadvantages from the lack of draft animals (Africa, where

germs carried by tsetse flies restricted the distribution of cattle). Second, some regions happened

to have wild plant species that lent themselves to domesticated high-yielding food crops (or

importantly, were on the same landmass and latitude as someone else who developed the crop),

while others had much less promising plant species. Olsson and Hibbs (2000) point out that of

the 56 heaviest-seeded wild grasses on earth, 33 occurred naturally in western Eurasia, while

only 4 grew in sub-Saharan Africa, and only 2 grew in South America. Again, this seems

contrary to the traditional idea that the tropics are naturally abundant in food, but tropical crops

are mainly not grains -- and the Diamond view argues grains are key. Regions with a more

promising endowment of grain species and that developed a resistance to germs, in the Diamond

story, developed a technological lead that was never overcome.
                                                                                                      7


       B. Institutions hypothesis

       Other studies trace the effect of tropics, germs, and crops through institutions. Hall and

Jones (1999) are one example of the “tropics” view of institutions. They use institutional quality

as one component of their “social infrastructure” (which explains productivity), with distance

from the equator (along with European language) as instruments.11 Their reasoning is that

Western Europeans have historically been associated with high quality institutions, and Western

Europeans settled in climates similar to Western Europe. Kaufmann et al. (1999) also use this

reasoning by using percent speaking English and percent speaking a European language as

instruments for their institutional variables, getting a strong effect on per capita income. Hall and

Jones’ other component of social infrastructure reflects government policy -- openness as

measured by Sachs and Warner (1995) – which is also related to Western European influence.

Note that Hall and Jones specify institutions and government policy as perfect substitutes.

       Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001) (AJR) also suggest institutional quality as a

fundamental determinant of economic development, but they have a “germs” theory of

institutions. AJR base their theory on three premises. First, AJR note that Europeans adopted

different types of colonization strategies. At one end of the spectrum, the Europeans settled and

created institutions to support private property and check the power of the State. These “settler

colonies” include the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. At the other end of the

spectrum, Europeans did not aim to settle and instead sought to extract as much from the colony

as possible. In these “extractive states,” Europeans did not create institutions to support private

property rights; rather, they established institutions that empowered the elite to extract gold,

silver, cash crops, etc. (e.g., Congo, Burundi, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Bolivia, Mexico, Peru).
                                                                                                     8

Although AJR don’t emphasize it, slavery was a way for Europeans to capture a labor force for

extractive states, such as in the Caribbean and Brazil.

       The second component of AJR’s theory holds that the type of colonization strategy was

heavily influenced by the feasibility of settlement. In areas where “germs” created high

mortality among potential settlers, Europeans tended to create extractive states. In areas where

“germs” favored settlement, Europeans tended to form settler colonies. For instance, AJR note

that the Pilgrims decided to settle in the American colonies instead of Guyana partially because

of the high mortality rates in Guyana (similarly, Sokoloff and Engerman (2000) note that a

Puritan colony on Providence Island off the coast of Nicaragua did not last long). Moreover,

Curtin (1964, 1989, 1998) documents that the European press published colonial mortality rates

widely, so that potential settlers had information about colonial “germs.” Thus, according to the

endowment theory, the disease environment shaped colonization strategy and the types of

institutions established by Europeans colonizers.

       The final piece of the AJR theory of institutional development stresses that the

institutions created by European colonizers endured after independence. As we discuss below in

greater detail, post-independent regimes tended to resemble pre-independent regimes. Settler

colonies tended to produce post-colonial governments that were more democratic and more

devoted to defending private property rights than extractive colonies. In contrast, since

extractive colonies had already constructed institutions for effectively extracting resources, the

post-colonial elite frequently assumed power and readily exploited the pre-existing extractive

institutions, sometimes making them even more extractive. According to the endowment theory,

differences in endowments shaped initial institutions and these initial institutions have had long-

lasting repercussions on private property rights protection and other institutions.
                                                                                                      9

       In a subsequent paper, Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2002) provide further

evidence that it is institutions rather than tropics per se that matters. They point out that among

colonized regions of the world, societies with higher urbanization or population density in 1500

have worse institutions and lower income today. Since urbanization and population density are a

good proxy for income, this suggests a reversal in income ranking between 1500 and today. The

tropics hypothesis would predict persistence in income ranking, since latitude doesn’t change.

AJR (2002) argue that it was the introduction of extractive institutions in high urbanization

places (which turned out to be places with dangerous “germs”), contrasted with the introduction

of “settler institutions” in low urbanization places (which were places with less dangerous

“germs”), that explains the reversal in incomes.

       The “crops” hypothesis is due to Engerman and Sokoloff (1997) and Sokoloff and

Engerman (2000) (henceforth ES). ES argue that the land endowments of Latin America lent

themselves to commodities featuring economies of scale and/or the use of slave and indigenous

labor (sugar cane, rice, silver) and thus were historically associated with power concentrated in

the hands of the plantation and mining elite. In contrast, the endowments of North America lent

themselves to commodities grown on family farms (wheat, maize) and thus promoted the growth

of a large middle class in which power was widely distributed.12

       Once power was concentrated, the elite in Latin America created institutions that

preserved their hegemony, like a narrow franchise for voting, restricted distribution of public

lands and mineral rights, and low access to schooling. In countries like Mexico, Chile, and Peru

up through the early 20th century, land was redistributed away from indigenous populations

towards a small group of landowners. In Mexico in 1910, 2.4 percent of household heads owned

land (compared to about 75 percent of farmers in the US around the same time).13 The favoritism
                                                                                                     10

towards the elite also showed up in Latin American laws regulating establishment of

corporations, financial institutions, patents, and industrial policies. Grants of new charters for

banks and corporations were controlled in favor of insiders in Latin America. Patent fees in the

late 19th century in Argentina, Brazil, British Guiana (today’s Guyana), Mexico, Peru, Uruguay,

and Venezuela were over $400 (Khan and Sokoloff, 2002), which is between 2.5 and 9.5 times

their annual per capita incomes in contemporaneous dollars.

       In contrast, North America above the Rio Grande enjoyed a larger middle class with a

less powerful elite so that the United States and Canada created more open, egalitarian

institutions. For instance, these regions adopted earlier a broad franchise for voting, equal

protection before the law, widespread distribution of public lands and mineral rights, cheap

patent fees ($35 in US in the late 19th century), relatively easy entry for new banks and

corporations, and a big government push on schooling.14 The work of ES follows a long history

literature that postulates domination by the elite owners of encomiendas (land grants for

plantations and mines from the crown, accompanied by feudal rights over the indigenous

population) as the “original sin” of Latin American underdevelopment (Chasteen, 2000). 15

       ES suggest that the elite in Latin America opposed democracy and other institutions

promoting equality before the law because they were afraid of the poor majority gaining power.

The elite feared in particular that the majority would use power to redistribute income and rents

away from the elite towards the majority. ES note that even when Latin American nations were

nominal democracies, they imposed literacy or wealth requirements for voting that sharply

restricted the franchise well into the 20th century. Through 1940, the US and Canada had

proportions of the population voting that were 5 to 10 times higher than Bolivia, Brazil, Chile,

and Ecuador.
                                                                                                    11

       Like AJR, ES note that European migration was much larger to North America than to

tropical Latin America. They attribute the difference in part to colonial institutions that

discouraged European immigration in Latin America (because the elite wanted to preserve their

exclusive position), but encouraged it in North America (where abundant land for family farms

made new immigrants less threatening). In short, the ES story goes from particular crop

endowments to the creation of a privileged elite, who in turn created institutions restricting

opportunities to the elite; other crop endowments led to diffuse distribution of power, which

created institutions giving fairly equal opportunities to all. According to ES, the institutional

restriction of opportunities in Latin America was not conducive to a development strategy, like

industrialization, that requires the participation of the majority of society; the generally inclusive

institutions in North America facilitated industrialization.

       C. Policy hypothesis

       The policy hypothesis is an amalgam of views that stress the importance of major

national policies and de-emphasize the importance of endowments in determining economic

development. The policy view holds that sound macroeconomic policies, openness to

international trade, and the absence of capital account controls will tend to foster long-run

economic success. This perspective is clearly imbedded in the policy recommendations adopted

by major multilateral institutions. Indeed, a motivating factor for creating international financial

institutions is to facilitate the adoption of sound national policies that foster economic

development. According to the policy hypothesis, while tropics, germs, and crops may influence

production technologies and institutions, the adoption of policies that foster low inflation,

openness to international trade, and unchecked international financial flows will promote

economic development.
                                                                                                 12

       Some economists have taken a notably sophisticated view of the role of policies in

economic development. Frankel and Romer (1999) and Frankel et al (1996) argue that

geography matters for economic development through government policy, specifically trade

openness. They argue that openness per se has a strong causal effect on per capita income,

instrumenting for openness with a country’s natural propensity to trade based on the gravity

model. In the gravity model, predicted trade between two countries goes up with the area and

population size of the trading partner and down with the distance between two countries. Trade

also goes down with higher population size of the home country (more trade takes place within

borders relative to across borders) and goes down if the country is landlocked.16 They construct

“natural openness” by summing up the predicted bilateral trade shares of each country with all

the other countries in the world. According this line of research, geography matters for many

poor developing countries because they are far from markets and thus less likely to realize

benefits from trade.



3. Data and Summary Statistics

       To assess different theories regarding the potential mechanisms via which tropics, germs,

and crops influence economic development, we need measures of the underlying endowments

and indicators of the possible institutions via which endowments may influence output. We also

need measures of national policies since the policy hypothesis questions the importance natural

endowments and instead emphasizes the impact of macroeconomic policies on economic

development. This section defines the variables, presents simple graphs, and discusses the

sample of countries on which we focus our investigation. The next section presents the

regression results.
                                                                                                  13


A. Endowments

       We focus on four different measures of endowments, but experimented with others to

assess the robustness of the results.

       SETTLER MORTALITY equals the logarithm of annualized deaths per thousand of

European solders (with each death replaced with a new soldier) during the early 19th century, for

72 former colonies. AJR (2001) compiles data. The raw data come from British, French, and

United States governments during the period 1817-1848 (Curtin, 1989). AJR (2001) argue that

these early 19th century mortality rates among soldiers are good proxies for long run mortality by

comparing it to (i) Curtin (1998), who examines similar data on soldier mortality from disease

during the second half of the nineteenth century and (ii) Gutierrez (1986), who uses Vatican

records to construct estimates of the mortality rates of bishops in Latin America from 1604 to

1876. As in AJR (2001), logarithms are used to diminish the impact of outliers.

       Settler mortality exhibits both high cross-country variability and a strong positive

connection with the level of economic development. First, there is enormous variability in the

settler mortality data, ranging from 8.5 annualized deaths per thousand to well over a thousand

deaths per thousand in Gambia, Nigeria, and Mali (recall the rates are computed with

replacement). Second, Table 1 and Figure 1 document the negative relationship between settler

mortality and the logarithm of real per capita GDP in 1995. The correlation is significant at the

one-percent level and illustrates that higher levels of settler mortality are associated with lower

levels of economic development.17

       We use settler mortality as an indicator of endowments to assess both the geography and

institutions hypotheses. The geography hypothesis stresses that the disease environment directly

influences productivity. Settler mortality measures the disease environment as European settlers
                                                                                                    14

arrived and thereby provides an exogenous indicator of “germs.” The AJR (2001) institution

hypothesis, instead, stresses that (i) initial endowments shape the long-lasting institutions created

by European conquerors and (ii) these long lasting institution continue to shape economic

development today. Settler mortality provides information on whether initial endowments

tended to favor the creation of “extractive colonies” or “settler colonies” as defined above.

       LATITUDE equals the absolute value of the latitude of the country. We take the data

from LaPorta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny (1999). Countries that are closer to the

equator will tend to have a more tropical climate. Tropical endowments may directly hinder

production (Kamarck, 1976; Crosby, 1986; and Gallup, Sachs, and Mellinger, 1998).

Alternatively, tropical endowments represent an inhospitable disease environment for

colonialists, which may foster “extractive” institutions according to the institutions hypothesis

(AJR, 2001; 2002).18

       The data indicate a strong positive association between latitude and economic

development. As shown in Table 1 and Figure 2, countries with higher absolute latitude tend to

have higher levels of real per capita GDP.19 Thus, we use latitude as an objective measure of

“tropics.” We experimented with other measures of endowments. In particular the World Bank

global economic indicators produces a zero-one dummy variable of whether the country is

tropical. Using this measure does not change this paper’s conclusions.

       CROPS/MINERALS

       Our measures of “crops/minerals” are dummies for whether a country produced any of a

given set of leading commodities in 1998-1999. For example, the dummy WHEAT takes on the

value 1 if the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) records the country as producing any

wheat in 1998-1999 and 0 otherwise. We adopt the same convention for mining commodities,
                                                                                                 15

with the data on production coming from the World Bureau of Metal Statistics. These dummies

are arguably exogenous since they reflect simply whether the land endowment makes it possible

to produce or mine a particular commodity. Harlan (1992, p. 53-60) discusses the botanical

mechanisms by which different ecological zones are compatible with some types of crops and

not with others. The quantity of wheat produced would endogenously respond to price

incentives, institutions, and other country characteristics, but whether ANY wheat is produced is

more likely to reflect exogenous characteristics like soil and climate. These characteristics have

thus remained constant over time, and hence reflect historical agricultural endowments, which in

turn reflects historical conditions for institutions.

        We use the crops/minerals dummy variables to assess the ES hypothesis. ES argue that

certain commodities lent themselves to economies of scale and the use of slave labor. These

types of commodities naturally produced long-lasting extractive institutions that protect the elite

and stymie overall economic development. Other types of commodities, however, lent

themselves to production by middle class family farmers. These types of commodities, then,

tended to produce long-lasting inclusive institutions that foster economic growth. Thus, we use

commodity endowments to test the ES hypothesis.

        The crops/minerals dummies are bananas, coffee, copper, maize, millet, oil, rice, rubber,

silver, sugarcane, wheat. We chose the particular list of commodities (from the more than a

hundred possible primary commodities in the data) based on our random priors as to what were

important commodities in many countries’ economic history, either because they were

mentioned by ES or because of our knowledge of country case studies. We did not do any

specification searches to choose the basket of commodities.20

        LAND LOCKED
                                                                                                  16

       Landlocked is simply a dummy value that takes one the value 0 if the country has coastal

territory on the world’s oceans, and 1 otherwise. There are 40 landlocked countries in the world

according to this definition. In our sample of 72 countries (restricted by the SETTLER

MORTALITY variable), ten are landlocked.

       NATURAL OPENNESS

       We do not feature this endowment variable in our main regressions, but we substitute it

for landlocked as a robustness check (it will turn out the results below are unchanged). Frankel

and Romer (1999) define natural openness as the trade share built up from an equation predicting

bilateral trade with other countries. The bilateral trade equation that we use from Frankel and

Romer includes only purely geographic variables: the home country’s population and area, the

trading partner’s population and area, the distance between the two countries, whether the

countries share a common border, and whether the home country is landlocked. Natural openness

for the home country is the predicted trade share summing up all the predicted bilateral trade

with all potential trading partners. The most “naturally open” countries in the world are Belize,

Malta, and Luxembourg.21 The most “naturally closed” countries are China, the United States,

and Brazil.


       B. Institutions

       Since theories by AJR (2001) and Engerman and Sokoloff (1997) stress that endowments

influence economic development through their impact on institutional development, we need

measures of institutional development to assess these theories. We focus on Kaufman, Kraay,

and Zoido-Lobaton’s (1999) six measures of institutional development, but confirm our results

using a measure of private property rights protection (Holmes, Johnson, Kirkpatrick, 1997).
                                                                                                 17

       INSTITUTIONS INDEX equals the average of the six Kaufman, Kraay, and Zoido-

Lobaton (1999) measures of institutional development, where larger values signify better

institutional development. Although we focus the analysis on the Institutions Index, we confirm

the findings with each of these six underlying measures. These measures are based on an

unobserved components model that aggregates over 300 indicators, ranging from ratings by

country experts to survey results. The underlying measures are defined as follows:

   (1) Voice and accountability – the extent to which citizens can choose their government,

       political rights, civil liberties, and an independent press

   (2) Political stability and absence of violence – a low likelihood that the government will be

       overthrown by unconstitutional or violent means

   (3) Government effectiveness – quality of public service delivery, competence of civil

       servants, and the degree of politicization of the civil service.

   (4) Light regulatory burden – relative absence of government controls on goods markets,

       government interference in the banking system, excessive bureaucratic controls on

       starting new businesses, or excessive regulation of private business and international

       trade.

   (5) Rule of law – protection of persons and property against violence or theft, independent

       and effective judges, contract enforcement

   (6) Freedom from graft – absence of the use of public power for private gain, corruption.

       The method used to calculate the index gives it approximately a unit normal distribution,

with an increase always meaning better quality institutions.

       The institutions index is positively associated with both economic development and

better endowments. First, many rich countries, such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand,
                                                                                                      18

Singapore, and the United States, all have institutions index values of greater than 1.0, where the

sample mean is –0.1. Similarly, very poor countries, such as Angola, Burundi, Haiti, Niger,

Nigeria, and Rwanda, all have institutions index values of less than –1.0. More formally, Table

1 and Figure 3 demonstrate the strong positive relationship between the logarithm of GDP per

capita and the institutions index. Second, Table 1 and Figures 4 and 5 show that the institutions

index is positively correlated with latitude and negatively correlated with settler mortality. For

instance, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United States all of settler

mortality rates of less than 20 per thousand, and all have institutions indexes greater than 1.0.

Similarly, Angola, Burundi, Haiti, Niger, Nigeria, and Rwanda all have settler mortality rates of

greater than 100 per thousand, and all have institutions indexes of less than –1.


        C. Macroeconomic Policies

        To measure the macroeconomic environment, we use three indicators of macroeconomic

policies over the last four decades that capture the historical emphasis on openness to trade,

capital, and sound fiscal and monetary policies. We assess whether these macroeconomic policy

indicators explain cross-country variations in economic development after accounting for the

explanatory power of natural resource endowments.

        OPENNESS measures the degree to which the country does or does not interfere with

foreign trade. More specifically, it is the fraction of years from 1960 to 1994 that Sachs and

Warner (1995) classified a country as “open”. They define a country as open if (i) nontariff

barriers cover less than 40 percent of trade, (ii) average tariff rates are less than 40 percent, (iii)

the black market premium was less than 20 percent during the 1970s and 1980s, (iv) the

economy is not socialist, and (v) the government does not control major exports through

marketing boards.
                                                                                                   19

       REAL EXCHANGE RATE OVERVALUATION measures the degree to which the

exchange rate is overvalued on average. We start with the index of overvaluation for 1976-85

that Dollar (1992) calculates. Dollar’s calculation was based on Summers-Heston purchasing

power parity comparisons, measuring the extent of general overvaluation controlling for the level

of income. He found this to be a significant determinant of growth rates (the more overvaluation,

the less growth). We convert this into an annual series by calculating the real exchange rate as

(Domestic CPI)/(Exchange Rate Domestic Currency per Dollar*US CPI). We benchmark this

series for each country by adjusting the level such that the average for 1976-85 equals Dollar’s

calculation. Our overvaluation measure is the average over 1960-1998. An increase in the index

signifies more overvaluation. The index ranges from a minimum of 69 to a maximum of 381,

where 100 signifies no under- or over-valuation. Extreme overvaluation usually reflects a

situation where the government has kept the official exchange rate constant in the face of high

domestic inflation.

       INFLATION is the average of the logarithm of the inflation rate over the last four

decades. Inflation is meant to capture the consistency of monetary and fiscal policies in that

large, structural fiscal imbalances may lead to debt monetization and higher inflation rates.

Major international institutions focus on controlling inflation as a mechanism for boosting long-

run economic activity.


       D. Other Explanatory Variables

       To assess the robustness of our results, we include several other potential determinants of

economic development.

       ETHNOLINGUISTIC DIVERSITY measures the probability that two randomly selected

individuals from a country are from different ethnolinguistic groups. Some political economy
                                                                                                    20

models predict that as ethnolinguistic diversity rises, countries tend to formulate weaker

institutions, weaker public services, and policies that close the economy to foreign interactions

(e.g., Alesina, Easterly, and Baqir, 1999). Recent studies show that in highly ethnically diverse

economies, the group that comes to power tends to implement policies that: (a) expropriate as

many resources as possible from the ethnic losers, (b) restrict the rights of other groups, and (c)

prohibit the growth of industries or sectors that threaten the ruling group (Alesina, Easterly, and

Baqir, 1999; Easterly and Levine, 1997). Thus, ethnolinguistic diversity may directly hinder

economic development and indirectly shape the underlying institutions and policies that

influence economic development.

       RELIGION may also influence economic development. Many scholars argue that

religion shapes national views regarding property rights, competition, and the role of the State.

Putnam (1993, p. 107), for instance, contends that the Catholic Church fosters “vertical bonds of

authority” rather than “horizontal bonds of fellowship”. Similarly, Landes (1998) argues that

Catholic and Muslim countries have tended to develop xenophobic cultures and powerful

church/state bonds to maintain control, which hinders institutional and economic development.

To measure religious composition, we use the following variables: CATHOLIC, MUSLIM, and

OTHER RELIGION, which equal the fraction of the population that is Catholic, Muslim, or of

another (non-Protestant) religion. The Protestant share of the population is omitted (and therefore

captured in the regression constant). The data are from LaPorta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and

Vishny (1999).

       FRENCH LEGAL ORIGIN equals one if the country has a French civil law tradition and

zero if the country has a British common law tradition as defined by the origin of each country’s

Commercial/Company law (LaPorta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny, 1999). As
                                                                                                 21

discussed below, the sample only includes former colonies with either French or British legal

origins. We include the legal origin variable in our analyses because there is a growing body of

work which argues that the legal tradition implanted in countries by European colonists has

profoundly shaped national approaches to property rights protection and the degree to which the

State intervenes in the economy. In short, Hayek (1960), LaPorta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer,

and Vishny (1998), and Beck, Demirguc-Kunt, and Levine (2002b) argue that the French civil

law was developed to unify the legal system, prevent jurisprudence, and solidify State control of

the courts. In contrast, the British common law evolved to protect private property owners from

the Crown. Thus, this view contends that countries with a French legal origin will tend to place

greater emphasis on the rights of the State versus the rights of individuals. Beck, Demirguc-

Kunt, and Levine (2002a) show that countries with French legal origins tend to have lower levels

of property rights protection than countries with British legal origins after controlling for many

other factors, including natural resource endowments. We include this variable in our analyses

to assess the robustness of our results.


       E. Sample

       We focus our analysis on a sample of 72 former colonies. Focusing on former colonies

represents a natural experiment for assessing how tropics, germs, and crops influenced

subsequent economic development (AJR, 2002). That is, colonizers arrived and faced different

environmental endowments. We examine whether these endowments directly influences

economic development, or whether these endowments shaped the formation of critical, long-

lasting institutions that form the foundation of economic development. Furthermore, we have

data on settler mortality only for this sample of 72 former colonies, and as shown graphically
                                                                                                22

above, settler mortality is an informative indicator of future economic and institutional

development.


4. Regression Results

       This section evaluates the following four questions. First, do endowments explain cross-

country variations in economic development? Second, do endowments explain cross-country

variations in institutional development? If endowments do not explain economic development,

then there is no support for the geography hypothesis. If endowments do not explain institutional

development, then there is no support for the institutions hypothesis. In fact, we find that

endowments explain both economic development and institutional development. Thus, we

proceed to the next two questions. Third, do endowments explain cross-country variations in

economic development beyond their ability to explain cross-country variations in institutions? If

the answer is no, then this provides evidence for the institutions hypothesis and against the

geography hypothesis. If, however, endowments explain economic development beyond the

institutional development channel, then this provides support for the geography hypothesis.

Finally, after accounting for the impact that endowments have on growth through institutions, do

the macroeconomic policies pursued by countries over the last four decades help explain current

levels of economic development?


       A. Do Endowments Explain Economic Development?

       Table 2 present ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions, with heteroskedasticity-

consistent standard errors, of the logarithm of real per capita GDP in 1995 on the various

endowment indicators. Specifically, we examine settler mortality, latitude, land locked, and the

full assortment of crop and mineral dummy variables discussed in Section 3. We run a very
                                                                                                   23

simple regression of the logarithm of per capita GDP on the endowment variables, taken one-at-

a-time and then in groups. However, we examine the eleven crops/minerals variables

collectively. Furthermore, we also list the results from a multivariate regression that includes the

French legal origin dummy variable, the three religious composition variables (Catholic, Muslim,

and Other Non-Protestant religions), and the ethnolinguistic diversity index. We include these

control variables to assess the independent link between endowments and the level of economic

development.

       The results clearly indicate that endowments explain economic development. Each of the

four endowment indicators – settler mortality, latitude, land locked, and the crops/minerals

indicators – significantly explain cross-country variation in the logarithm of GDP per capita.

These findings do not change when controlling for legal origin, religious composition, or

ethnolinguistic diversity. The signs on settler mortality, latitude, and land locked are consistent

with theory. Namely, lower settler mortality, higher latitude, and not being land locked are all

associated higher levels of economic development. When we also try Frankel-Romer natural

openness, we also find it to be significantly associated with economic development with the

predicted sign (not shown). Of the other exogenous control variables, religion and ethnolinguistic

diversity are frequently significant but French legal origin is not.22

       When we include all the endowment indicators together, there is clearly some multi-

collinearity across the endowment variables. Nevertheless, settler mortality and the

crops/minerals variables remain independently linked with economic development even when all

the endowment and control variables are included simultaneously. Note that settler mortality

alone explains almost half of the cross-country variation in GDP per capita. The latitude and

landlocked variables are not actually significant. We don’t want to make too much of this
                                                                                                    24

because of the high collinearity between these variables and the other endowment variables.

However, these results do not provide strong support for the idea that tropical location and lack

of access to the sea inhibit development through channels other than through their effect on

human disease and on natural resource endowments.

       The sizes of the coefficients suggest that endowments exert an economically big impact

on economic development. For instance, Tanzania had very high rates of settler mortality of 5.6

(i.e., 280 death per thousand, where 280≈exp(5.6)) and has a very low level of per capita GDP of

$182, where the natural log of $182 equals 5.21. The regression coefficient from the second

regression in Table 2 (which controls for legal origin, religion, and ethnic diversity) indicates

that if Tanzania had a disease environment that produced settler mortality rates closer to that

experienced in India of 3.9 respectively (i.e., 49 deaths per thousand), then Tanzania would

enjoy income levels of more than double its current level and even greater than that enjoyed in

India now, e.g., about $415.23


   B. Do Endowments Explain Institutional Development?

       The Table 3 regressions indicate that endowments help explain cross-country variation in

institutional development. Each of the endowment indicators is significantly associated with the

aggregate institutions index. These relationships hold when controlling for legal origin, religious

composition, and ethnic diversity. As noted earlier, adding all the endowment variables together

induces multicollinearity, such that it is not always possible to identify the independent link

between each endowment indicator and institutional development when controlling for all of the

other endowment indicators. Settler mortality and natural resources (germs and crops) are again

more significant than tropical latitude or lack of coastal access (although only crops remain

independently significant when other exogenous variables are included). Note that when settler
                                                                                                     25

mortality and latitude are included together, they jointly explain 45 percent of the cross-country

variation in the institutions index (when not controlling for legal origin, religious composition,

and ethnic diversity).24

       The impact is economically substantial. For instance, Chile’s settler mortality rate is 4.23

while Singapore’s is 2.87 (i.e., 69 and 18 deaths per thousand respectively). If Chile had the

disease endowments of Singapore, the results suggest that this would substantially close the gap

between Chile’s level of institutional development (0.87) and Singapore’s (1.44).25 Consistent

with AJR (2001) and Engerman and Sokoloff (1997), endowments importantly shape

institutional development.

       We reproduced the analyses in Table 3 for each of the six components of the institutions

index and the index of private property rights used by La Porta et al. (1999). Specifically, we

examine the connections between endowments and (i) voice and accountability, (ii) political

stability and absence of violence, (iii) government effectiveness, (iv) relatively light regulatory

burden, (v) rule of law, (vi) absence of graft, and (vii) the private property rights index. We

confirm the Table 3 results for each of these indicators of institutional development. In

particular, settler mortality, latitude, and crops/minerals are always strongly correlated with

institutional development even when controlling for legal origin, religious composition, and

ethnic diversity (which are themselves significant in many of the regressions).


   C. Do Endowments Explain Development Beyond Institutions?

Thus far the regression results indicate that endowments influence both economic and

institutional development. These findings are consistent with both the geography hypothesis,

which stresses that endowments directly influence work effort (Machiavelli, 1519; Montesquieu,

1748; Landes, 1998) and agricultural productivity (Myrdal, 1968; Diamond, 1997; Sachs, 2001)
                                                                                                   26

and therefore GDP per capita. The findings are also consistent, however, with the institutions

hypothesis, which stresses that endowments influence the formation of long-lasting institutions –

such as the application of private property rights protection, the operation of the rule of law, the

extent of corruption, and the general degree to which the government produces rules that

facilitate private interactions vis-à-vis the extent to which the government protects a small elite –

that shape economic development (AJR, 2001, 2002; Engerman and Sokoloff, 1997, 2000). We

now conduct regression analyses to distinguish between these two hypotheses.

           a. Econometric specification and methods

To distinguish between the geography and institutions hypotheses, we run two-stage least

squares regressions with heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors of the following form:

       Second Stage:           Logarithm of GDP per capita = α[Institutions Index] + βX + u

       First Stage:            Institutions Index             = δ[Endowments]          + γX + v

X is a set of included exogenous variables, meaning they are exogenous variables that are

included in the second stage regression (i.e. French legal origin, religion, ethnic

fractionalization). In some regressions, X is omitted. The error terms in the first and second

stage regressions are v and u respectively. Endowments are considered excluded exogenous

variables in that they are used as instrumental variables to extract the exogenous component of

the Institutions Index but they are excluded from the second stage regression.

       Consider first the case where there are no X variables, then the regression addresses the

question: does the component of the Institutions Index explained by exogenous endowments

explain cross-country differences in the logarithm of GDP per capita? If α is significant, then

this suggests that endowments influence economic development through institutions, which is

consistent with the institutions hypothesis.
                                                                                                     27

       Continuing with the case where there are no X variables, the test of the overidentifying

restrictions (OIR) addresses a key question: do endowments explain economic development

beyond the ability of endowments to explain institutional development? Specifically, the OIR

test has as its null hypothesis that endowments do not explain u, i.e., endowments do not explain

the logarithm of GDP per capita beyond the ability of endowments to explain institutions. This

produces a Lagrange multiplier test statistic that under the null hypothesis is distributed Chi-

squared (m), where m is the number of overidentifying restrictions. The number of

overidentifying restrictions equals the number excluded exogenous variables minus the number

of endogenous variables included as regressors in the second stage regression.

       For the case where the regressions include, X, i.e., the second-stage includes non-

endowment instrumental variables, the OIR test becomes a general specification test of the

validity of instruments. We use these regressions with X to assess the robustness of the findings

when controlling for other potential exogenous determinants of economic development.

       Table 4 presents the two-state least squares regression results, with the OIR tests, and the

first-stage F-test’s P-value. The first-stage F-test has as its null hypothesis that the instruments

do not explain any cross-country variation in institutional development. Table 4 presents results

using the Institutions Index, though also we confirm the findings for each of the indicators of

institutional development discussed above. There are three pairs of regressions. The first pair of

regressions uses Settler Mortality and Latitude as instrumental variables (excluded exogenous

variables). In the first of these regressions, no X variables are included.26 The second regression

includes the X-variables i.e., we include legal origin, the three religious composition variables,

and ethnic diversity as included exogenous variables. The second pair of regressions adds Land

Locked to the instrument set. The OIR test now examines whether Settler Mortality, Latitude,
                                                                                                       28

and Land Locked explain economic development beyond their ability to account for cross-

country differences in the Institutions Index.27 Finally, the last pair of regressions adds eleven

Crops/Minerals instruments to Settler Mortality, Latitude, and Land Locked. Here we examine

whether endowments – defined very broadly – explains current levels of economic development

beyond their ability to explain institutional development. Again, there are two regressions for

this last pair of regression: a regression with no X-variables included and a regression with X-

included. Note we include Oil in the second stage. We do this because Oil independently

explains cross-country differences in the logarithm of GDP per capita beyond any impact on

institutions in all of the regressions that we assessed. We recognize this explicitly by including it

in the second stage. The phenomenon of states that are rich solely because they have large oil

reserves is well known.28 We do not, however, believe that this finding importantly

distinguishes between the geography, institutions, or policy hypotheses.

           b. Results

       The exogenous component of the Institutions Index significantly explains economic

development, which is consistent with the institutions hypothesis. The Institutions Index enters

significantly at the one-percent level in all of the Table 4 regressions. The results are robust to

controlling for legal origin, religious composition, and ethnic diversity. The strong positive

impact of institutional development on economic development is also robust to alterations in the

instrumental variable set. Furthermore, the instrumental variables are valid: they are highly

correlated with the Institutions Index, as illustrated by the P-value of the first-stage F-test, and

the OIR test does not reject the hypothesis that the instruments can be excluded from the second

stage regression.
                                                                                                 29

       The coefficient on the Institutions Index is remarkably consistent across the various

specifications in Table 4 and economically large. For instance the regression coefficients

indicate that if Mexico exogenously improved its level of institutional development from about

the sample mean (–0.07) to the level in the United States, this would eliminate the huge GDP per

capita gap between the two countries.29 While these experiments are for illustrative purposes

only, they do provide an empirical sense that the impact of institutional development on

economic development is substantial, which supports the institutions hypothesis.

       The Table 4 results indicate that endowments do not explain economic development

beyond the ability of endowments to explain institutional development. Specifically, when

considering the regressions that only include endowment indicators – Settler Mortality, Latitude,

Land Locked, and Crops/Minerals – as instrumental variables, the data never reject the

hypothesis that endowments only explain the logarithm of GDP per capita through their ability to

explain institutional development. (Nor do the results change when we use Frankel-Romer

natural openness as an endowment variable.) That is, the OIR-test is never rejected at standard

confidence levels. Even when including the X-variables, we do not reject the OIR-test at the 5

percent level, which means we do not reject the validity of the instruments. As noted above, Oil

helps explain economic development directly: countries that have produced oil have higher

levels of economic development beyond the ability of oil to explain institutional development.

We do not view this as support for the geography hypothesis relative to an interesting alternative

view. The geography hypothesis focuses on the impact of disease and climate on labor

productivity and technological change. We do not believe the proponents of the geography

hypothesis will be comforted by the observation that oil is positively associated with economic
                                                                                                   30

development; moreover, we do not believe that proponents of the institutions hypothesis will

view the significance of the Oil dummy as rejecting the institutions hypothesis.

       In sum, the Table 4 results provide strong support for the institutions hypothesis but no

evidence for the geography hypothesis. Endowments explain institutions, which in turn explain

economic development. The data fail to reject the hypothesis that endowments only explain

cross-country differences in the level of economic development through the ability of

endowments to explain institutional development.


       D. Do Macro-Policies Matter After Accounting for Endowments?

       Next, we examine whether major, macroeconomic policies – inflation, trade policies, and

impediments to international transactions as reflected in real exchange rate overvaluation – help

explain current levels of economic development. We do this in two steps. First, we treat the

macroeconomic policy indicators, which are averaged over the last four decades as exogenous.

Simultaneity bias may bias these results toward finding a significant statistical relationship

between policies and economic development if economic success tends to produce better

policies. Second, we treat the macroeconomic policy indicators as endogenous; we use

instrumental variables to control for potential simultaneity bias. Using these two methods, we

assess whether macroeconomic policies explain cross-country differences in economic

development.

       The evidence suggests that macroeconomic policies do not help account for economic

development after accounting for the impact of institutions on the level of economic

development. In Table 5, the policy variables are treated as included exogenous variables. The

Institutions Index enters all of the regression significantly. Furthermore, the coefficient size on

the Institutions Index is essentially unchanged from Table 4, which did not include policy
                                                                                                      31

indicators. Thus, even after controlling for macroeconomic policies, endowments explain cross-

country differences in economic development through their ability to account for cross-country

differences in institutional development. Furthermore, the data never reject the OIR-test. The

policy indicators never enter the regressions significantly. Inflation, Openness, and Real

Exchange Rate Overvaluation never enter with a P-value below 0.10. Moreover, even when they

are included together, the data do not reject the null hypothesis that the three policies all enter

with coefficients equal to zero, which is shown using the F-test on the three policy variables.

       When using instrumental variables for the policy indicators, we again find that

macroeconomic policies do not explain economic development. Specifically, we fail to reject

that hypothesis that macroeconomic policies have zero impact on economic development after

accounting for the impact of endowments and institutions. In Table 6, we add an additional

excluded exogenous variable to the set of instruments. We use ethnolinguistic diversity since

Easterly and Levine (1997) and La Porta et al (1999) find that ethnolinguistic diversity helps

explain cross-country differences in government policies. As noted earlier, the instrumental

variables explain a significant amount of the cross-country variation in the Institutions Index. In

the first-stage regressions for policy, we find that the instruments explain a significant amount of

the cross-country variation in Openness and Real Exchange Rate Overvaluation at the 0.01

significance level. However, the instruments do not do a very good job of explaining cross-

country variation in Inflation, i.e., we fail to find evidence that the instruments explain average

inflation rates over the last four decades at the 0.01 significance level. As shown, the policy

variables never enter significantly. While the exogenous component of the Institutions Index

(i.e., the component defined by endowments) continues to significantly account for international
                                                                                                  32

differences in the level of GDP per capita, the macroeconomic policy indicators do not add any

additional explanatory power.


5. Conclusions

       In sum, measures of tropics, germs, and crops explain cross-country differences in

economic development through their impact on institutions. To answer some of the questions in

the introduction, if Burundi’s endowments had been like those of Canada, it would have

increased Burundi’s income per capita through institutions by a factor of 38.30 Recalling the 107-

fold difference between Canada and Burundi’s income, we can say that a variation of 38 times is

explained by our story, while variation by a factor of 2.8 (107/38) is unexplained. (In log terms,

78 percent of the log income difference between Canada and Burundi is explained.)

       Consistent with AJR (2001) and ES (1997), tropics, germs, and crops do not explain

economic development beyond their impact on institutions. These findings are consistent with

the institutions hypothesis and inconsistent with the geography hypothesis. Furthermore,

policies do not explain cross-country differences in GDP per capita once one controls for the

impact of endowments on institutions and on to economic development. Thus, the results are

inconsistent with the policy hypothesis but consistent with a view that stresses the role of

endowments in shaping long-lasting and defining institutions.

       There is a large literature that relates cross-country differences in per capita growth rates

to economic policies. How do we relate our present findings on income levels to this literature? It

could be that episodes of bad policies are associated with a temporary decrease in income, which

shows up in the growth rate over a limited period, but leave no long run impact on the income

level (Bruno and Easterly, 1998, made this argument for inflation and output).
                                                                                                    33

       It could also be that bad policies are proxying for poor institutions, in those cases where

they are not included in the growth regression. The policy implication of this latter explanation is

that bad policies are only symptoms of longer-run institutional factors, and correcting the

policies without correcting the institutions will bring little long-run benefit. Bad policies would

be kind of like a high fever from a bacterial infection. Packing the patient in ice would bring

down the fever but does not cure the infection. This kind of story could help explain the

disappointing results in developing countries to the wave of macroeconomic policy reforms in

the 1990s (Hausmann and Rodrik, 2002; Easterly, 2001).

       We acknowledge the caveats that one should not put all one’s weight on a failure to reject

a zero coefficient or an exclusion restriction. Nor does the kind of general indicator of

institutional quality we use, while representing a valuable contribution by Kaufmann et al

(1999), provide much actual guidance to officials making real laws and regulations. This kind of

result should be tested and illumined further with detailed historical case studies of institutional

development like those conducted by Engerman and Sokoloff (1997) and coauthors, studies of

the links between colonial experiences and later developments (Mamdani, 1996), and

contemporary case studies like those in Rodrik (2002). These kind of cross-country results are

only a beginning to telling the story of colonial experiences, political conflict and consensus,

institution-building, and economic development for each unique case. Still, we are struck by the

way that endowments and policies have no independent effect once we control for institutions,

contrary to a number of stories, and that institutional quality seems to be a sufficient statistic for

accounting for economic development.

1 Burundi may well have been relatively rich compared to other African countries at some point
in the past because of these endowments, but we lack data on African incomes before 1950 or
1960. Our focus is on the long run outcome, which is clearly relative poverty.

3 The nature of the pre-independence ethnic division between the Hutu and Tutsi, which
undoubtedly was politically explosive after independence, has been hotly debated. The
traditional European view was that the Tutsi were a Nilotic group of tall cattle-herding nomads
who migrated into the region and became feudal lords over the short Bantu agricultural Hutus
(see McDonald et al., 1969). More recent scholars deem this a myth and describe a much more
fluid and complex traditional society. Gahama et al. (1999) describe the Tutsi “feudal
aristocracy” as a racist invention of the Belgians dating from the 1930s. Ndikumana 1998, on the
other hand, describes how the post-independence (Tutsi) governments blamed ethnic divisions
on the Belgians as a device to suppress discussion of real ethnic discrimination.
4 The civil war has been between the Hutus and Tutsis, with other more subtle conflicts between
the Bururi Tutsis and non-Bururi Tutsis and also clashes between the Bayanzi and the Bashingo
clans of Bururi Tutsi. See Nkurunziza and Ngaruko (2002).

is the backward bending labor supply curve idea, in modern parlance. Of course, bad institutions
could also reduce the supply of effort, and this is only one of several possible mechanisms by
which some authors believe there is a direct effect of tropical location on development.

institutional outcomes.

Woolcock, Isham, and Pritchett (2001) found that institutions are worse in resource-rich than in
resource-poor economies, and that “point-source” and coffee and cocoa resources were
associated with worse institutions compared to “diffuse” resource economies. Isham, Pritchett,
Woolcock, and Busby (2001) find worse institutions in resource-rich relative to research poor
countries.

14 Slavery in the southern United States, and post-Reconstruction restrictions on black civil
rights, is an obvious exception to these statements. ES suggest that the American South is a kind
of middle ground between North America and Latin America, lagging behind North America but
ahead of Latin America (where African slavery in Brazil and the Caribbean covered a larger
                                                                                                  39



share of the population than in North America, and where the violation of rights of indigenous
people also covered a larger share of the population than in North America).
15Of course, pre-colonial institutions in the Aztec and Inca empires also featured elite
domination.
16 Bilateral trade also goes up with per capita incomes of the trading partners. Because of
concerns about endogeneity, Frankel and Romer use the factor accumulation of trading partners
to predict per capita income. However, they also have a “pure geography” measure that includes
only the factors mentioned in the text, which is what we use in the empirical work below.
17 These historical mortality rates are correlated with mortality rates today (AJR, 2001), which
are themselves correlated with per capita income today.
18 The literature has given little attention to some of the advantages of tropical location, like
greater biodiversity, tourism potential, less discomfort and need for protection from cold
temperatures, other intangible quality of life aspects, etc.
19 Naturally, there is some cut-off at extremely high latitudes where little settlement is feasible.
20 These are the same commodities that are used in Easterly 2001, who found that commodity
dummies helped explain differences in inequality across countries in a way consistent with the
ES hypothesis.
21 Although Luxembourg is landlocked, it is located next to dense population concentrations in
trading partners. Note that country size is an important determinant of natural openness.
22 The significance of the religion variable varies, but sometimes indicates that the Muslim
religion is associated with less institutional quality and development than other religions,
particularly Protestant and Other religion.
23 Formally, ∆(log GDP per Capita) = -(0.62)*∆(settler mortality). Tanzania’s settler mortality
equals 5.6 and India’s equals 3.9. Thus, ∆(log GDP per Capita) = -(0.62)*∆(-1.7) = 1.05. Since
Tanzania’s log of GDP per capita equals 5.21 (which equals $182), its new level would equal
6.27, which equals $528.
24 Instead of examining eleven individual dummy variables related to crops and minerals, we
also constructed an index, “good crops,” to examine more narrowly the Engerman and Sokoloff
(1997) hypothesis about crops and institutional development using one summary measure. In
particular, the good crops index equals log (1 + zmaize + zwheat)/(1 + zrice + zsugarcane),
where zX equals the share of the land area that is judged to be suitable by FAO for growing crop
X. We construct this index because ES focus on wheat and maize as crops that foster a large
middle class with egalitarian institutions in contrast to rice and sugarcane, which tend to produce
a powerful elite and more closed institutions. We find that this good crops index significantly
and positively explains institutional development, even when controlling for religion, ethnic
diversity, and legal origin. We also find that this good crops index is highly correlated with
settler mortality and latitude and does not enter the institution regression significantly when these
other endowment indicators are simultaneously included. We also find that when we use this
good crops index as an instrumental for institutions we confirm this paper’s findings and the
good crops index does not reject the test of the overidentifying restrictions, which again confirms
this paper’s findings.
25 Specifically, ∆(Institutions Index) = -(0.25)*∆(settler mortality). Chile’s settler mortality
equals 4.23 and Singapore’s is 2.87. Thus, ∆(Institutions Index) = -(0.25)*∆(-1.36) = 0.34.
Since Chile’s institutions index is 0.87, its new level would equal 1.21, while Singapore’s is
1.44.

26 Thus, in the OIR test, the Chi-square statistics as 1 degree of freedom because there is one
endogenous variable included as a regressor in the second-stage (Institutions Index) and there are
two excluded exogenous variables (Settler Mortality and Latitude).
27 For this second pair of regressions, the OIR test has two degrees of freedom: three excluded
exogenous variables minus one endogenous regressor in the second state.
28 We mean here oil states that are so abundantly endowed with oil that it increases their
income. There is also a literature on how intermediate levels of oil resources are often
squandered and can lead to vicious competition for rents. We do not address this latter literature.
29 Specifically, ∆(Log GDP per Capita) = (2.1)*∆(Institutions Index) from the second regression
in Table 4. Since Mexico’ Institution Index is –0.07 and the U.S.’s is 1.29, the ∆(Institutions
Index) equals 1.36. Plugging values in yields the following: ∆(Log GDP per Capita) =
(2.1)*∆(1.36) = 2.86. Since Mexico’s log of GDP per Capita is 8.13, its new level would equal
10.99, while the U.S.’s is 10.28.
30 We do this exercise using only settler mortality and latitude as endowments for institutions,
using the regression coefficients discussed above.
                      Table 1: Correlations and Summary Statistics: Selected Variables

Log(GDP per Capita) is the logarithm of real GDP per Capita in 1995.
The institution index averages the six Kaufman, Kraay, and Zoido-Lobaton (1999) measures: (i) voice and accountability, (ii) political instability
and violance, (iii) government effectiveness, (iv) regulatory burden, (v) rule of law, and (vi) graft, and (2) one of the three policy variables: inflation,
trade openness, or real exchange rate overvaluation.
 Settler mortality is the logarithm of annualized deaths per thousand of European soldiers. Latitude is absolute value of each country's latitude.
Landlock equals one if the country is land locked and zero otherwise.
Inflation equals the average annual inflation rate 1960-1995, Openness equals years that the country has been open to trade, and Real
Exchange Rate Overvaluation equals the average real exchange rate overvaluation, 1960-95.

Dependent Variable: Logarithm of GDP per Capita in 1995

The cross-country regressions are estimated using ordinary least squares with 72 observations. The heteroskedasticity consistent P-values are reported in parentheses. The
constant is omitted from the Table. Settler mortality is the logarithm of annualized deaths per thousand of European soldiers in the early 19th century. Latitude is absolute value of
each country's latitude, scaled between 0 and 1. Land locked equals one if the country does not have access to the sea, and zero otherwise. Crops/Minerals is a series of eleven one-
zero dummy variables of whether the country has ever had the following crops and minerals: bananas, coffee, copper, maize, millet, oil, rice, rubber, silver, sugarcane, or wheat.
Religion is a series of three variables, the fraction of the population that is Catholic, Muslim, or a religion that is not Catholic, Muslim, or Protestant). For Crops/Minerals and Religion,
the table reports the F-test of joint significance of the individual variables composing these concepts, with the corresponding p-value in parentheses under the F-statistic.
Ethnolinguistic fractionalization is the probability that two randomly selected individuals in a country will not speak the same language.

Dependent Variable: Institution Index

The regressions are estimated using OLS, with heteroskedasticity consistent P-values in parentheses, and 72 observations. The constant is not reported. The institution index
averages the six Kaufman, Kraay, and Zoido-Lobaton (1999) measures: (i) voice and accountability, (ii) political instability and violance, (iii) government effectiveness, (iv) regulatory
burden, (v) rule of law, and (vi) graft. Settler mortality is the logarithm of annualized deaths per thousand of European soldiers in the early 19th century. Latitude is the absolute value
of each country's latitude, scaled between 0 and 1. Land locked equals one if the country does not have access to the sea, and zero otherwise. Crops/Minerals is a series of eleven
one-zero dummy variables of whether the country has ever had the following crops and minerals: bananas, coffee, copper, maize, millet, oil, rice, rubber, silver, sugarcane, or wheat.
Religion is a series of three variables, the fraction of the population that is Catholic, Muslim, or a religion that is not Catholic, Muslim, or Protestant). For Crops/Minerals and Religion,
we report the F-test of joint significance, with the corresponding p-value in parentheses. Ethnolinguistic fractionalization is the probability that two randomly selected individuals do not speak the same language.

Dependent Variable: Logarithm of GDP per Capita in 1995

Regressions are estimated using two-stage least squares, 72 observations, with heteroskedasticity consistent P-values in parentheses. The constant is unreported.
The endogenous variable in the regression is the institution index, averages the six Kaufman, Kraay, and Zoido-Lobaton (1999) measures: (i) voice and accountability, (ii) political instability and violance, (iii)
government effectiveness, (iv) regulatory burden, (v) rule of law, and (vi) graft.
The exogenous variables that are included in some of the second stage regressions are as follows. French legal origin is a dummy variable that equals one if the country has a French civil law tradition, and
zero if the country has a British common law tradition. Religion is a series of three variables, the fraction of the population that is Catholic, Muslim, or a religion that is not Catholic, Muslim, or Protestant).
Ethnolinguistic fractionalization is the probability that two randomly selected individuals in a country will not speak the same language. For Religion, the table reports the F-test of joint significance of the
individual variables, with the corresponding p-value in parentheses. Oil, which equals one if the country is an oil producer.
The instrumental variables, i.e., exogenous variables excluded from the second stage regressions, potentially include the following variables. Settler mortality is the logarithm of annualized deaths per thousand
of European soldiers. Latitude is absolute value of each country's latitude. Land locked equals one if the country does not have access to the sea, zero otherwise. Crops/Minerals is a series of ten one-zero
dummy variables of whether the country has ever had the following crops/minerals: bananas, coffee, copper, maize, millet,rice, rubber, silver, sugarcane, or wheat.

Dependent Variable: Logarithm of GDP per Capita in 1995
Regressions are estimated using two-stage least squares, with heteroskedasticity consistent P-values in parentheses. The constant is unreported.
The endogenous variable in the regression is the institution index, averages the six Kaufman, Kraay, and Zoido-Lobaton (1999) measures: (i) voice and accountability, (ii) political instability and
violance, (iii) government effectiveness, (iv) regulatory burden, (v) rule of law, and (vi) graft.
Three policy variables: Inflation equals the average annual inflation rate 1960-1995, Openness equals years that the country has been open to trade, and Real Exchange Rate Overvaluation equals
the average real exchange rate overvaluation, 1960-95.
The exogenous variables that are included in some of the second stage regressions are as follows. French legal origin is a dummy variable that equals one if the country has a French civil law
tradition, and zero if the country has a British common law tradition. Religion is a series of three variables, the fraction of the population that is Catholic, Muslim, or a religion that is not Catholic,
Muslim, or Protestant). Ethnolinguistic fractionalization is the probability that two randomly selected individuals in a country will not speak the same language. For Religion, the table reports the F-test
of joint significance of the individual variables, with the corresponding p-value in parentheses.
The instrumental variables, i.e., exogenous variables excluded from the second stage regressions are as follows. Settler mortality is the logarithm of annualized deaths per thousand of European
soldiers. Latitude is absolute value of each country's latitude.
