                 Speculative Behavior of Institutional Investors




                                     ABSTRACT



        A survey compared speculative behavior in two groups of institutional
     investors. The 'experimental' group held stocks that had shown extraordinary
     price increases over the preceding year that also had high price earnings
     ratios. The control group held randomly selected stocks. In Shiller and
     Pound [1986] we argued that the survey results gave some support to some
     diffusion or epidemic models for interest in the stocks in the experimental
     group. Here, we show that the two groups are similar in describing their
     investment strategy as relating to a theory about fundamental value rather
     than about the kind of stocks that are becoming attractive to investors.
     However, the experimental group is less likely to make explicit comparisons
     of price with measures of fundamental value, and differs from the control
     group in their attitudes toward timing, price changes, and short-term
     earnings disappointment. Overall, these results appear consistent with the
     notion that price changes unrelated to fundamentals may be caused by
     contagious enthusiasm about fundamentals amongst institutional investors.

        The holding patterns of those experimental group investors who said that
     they were unsystematic in their stock choice are studied. These investors
     tended to show gradually increasing holdings over the period of stock price
     increase. Reasons respondents gave for the gradual increase are discussed.

Introduction

   We have undertaken a broad-based survey of institutional investors to

learn about the their habits of behavior, interpersonal communications, and

the nature of their theories. In a companion paper (Shiller and Pound

[1986]) some results of the survey were used to evaluate a model of

interpersonal communications that was patterned after contagion models used

by epidemiologists. In this paper other results of the survey are described

that help us learn whether institutional investors in some stocks fit models

of speculative behavior that could mean that they (and not just individual

investors) give rise to price movements unrelated to objective fundamentals.

Here, we also look at patterns of holdings of those institutional investors

whose behavior seems particularly relevant to such presumed speculative

"bubbles".

   The idea that prices of speculative assets might move for reasons having

to do more with the speculative behavior of investors than with information

about true fundamentals has generally been out of favor ever since the

literature on market efficiency became widely known. More recently, however,

a lot of 'anomalous evidence' regarding the efficient markets hypothesis has

appeared and the widespread conclusion that markets are efficient has been

questioned (see, for example, Shiller [1984], or Summers [1986] for a

discussion). One of us (Shiller [1984]) has proposed an alternative model of

prices of speculative assets which admits the existence of some "smart

money" that attenuate the effects of the more ordinary investors on price

but do not eliminate the effects. In this model price is equal to the

                                     3
present value of expected future dividends plus a term proportional to the

present value of the expected (by smart money) demands of ordinary

investors. Such a model might well accommodate most of the evidence on

market efficiency while at the same time allowing also purely speculative

price movements, i. e., price movements generated by investors speculative

behavior rather than by any information about fundamental value. Analogous

models have been proposed by Kyle [1986], and Singleton [1985]. A number of

papers in the "noisy rational expectations" models literature also imply

that the effect of ordinary investors on price is not eliminated by smart

money (e. g., Hellwig [1980], Admati [1985]). The arbitrage pricing theory

(Ross [1976]) is consistent with such an effect if the speculative price

movements in individual stocks contribute towards a factor structure for all

returns.

   A great deal of attention has recently been paid the fact that stocks

with high price-earnings ratios and stocks whose price has increased

dramatically tend to show subsequent negative abnormal returns. (See for

example Basu [1983] and DeBondt and Thaler [1985].) One popular

interpretation for these results is that such stocks are often undergoing

purely speculative price runups whose probable end brings subsequent price

declines. We thus sought to study such stocks to see if we could find

evidence that might show a speculative component to institutional investors'

behavior.

   The ten stocks used for the experimental1 group were chosen to show, in



     1We use the term 'experimental' to denote the group of investors that
we wish to compare with randomly selected investors. This use of the term
corresponds to the common usage in analysis of variance, even though here no
controlled experiment was undertaken.

May or June of 1985, extremely high price increase in the preceding year and

a high P/E ratio. Of course, we do not know with any certainty whether any

of the ten stocks that we selected were actually overpriced. At the very

least, however, the experimental group stocks are stocks that are

 'interesting' and may incite extensive interpersonal communications, and may

be also be grouped in some other dimensions with the stocks that could be

predicted to show negative abnormal returns. The experimental group of

investors consisted of 125 institutional investors in these ten stocks. The

control group of investors consisted of 95 institutional investors in ten

companies chosen at random from the universe of publicly held corporations.

These investors should be representative of the market as a whole. Names of

institutional investors were taken from those who indicated, on the 13f

report to the Securities Exchange Commission, that they held stock in one

of the companies on March 31 or June 30, 1985.2

    Questionnaires that used the company name throughout for each of the 20

stocks. Complete individualization of questionnaires (rather than individu-

alization of letters only asking that the questionnaire be filled out with

the stock in mind) was done to assure that answers related to the actual

stocks and were not interpreted as answers to hypothetical questions.

Responses were obtained for nine stocks in the experimental group, and six

in the control group. For these stocks, several summary statistical

differences are shown in Table 1. As can be seen, not only were price

increases and P/E ratios more dramatic in the group, but other differences


     2lnstitutional investors with discretion over accounts with combined
equity assets exceeding $100 million must report on Form l3f their equity
holdings at the end of each quarter. Equity holdings below 10,000 shares and
also below $200,000 in market value need not be reported, although such
holdings often are reported anyway.

that we did x select on are also evocative of stocks going through a
public fad. Turnover rates were higher for the experimental group stocks.

Consensus forecasts of fiscal 1985 earnings increased more in the

experimental group than in the control group, but the increase came nowhere

near the increase in prices. The increase in the consensus forecast for

fiscal 1985 relates to expectations for the firms over a short horizon (for

which information is likely to be relatively concrete), in contrast to the

increase in price which presumably reflects expectations for the firm over

the indefinite future.

    We followed a rigorous regimen (following Dilinian's [1978] "Total Design

Method") in order to maximize accuracy of sampling and the response rate

from our sample of investing institutions. Each institution was initially

contacted and asked to forward a questionnaire to an individual within the

organization who was responsible for the decision to purchase stock in the

corporation in question. The letter strongly emphasized that the

questionnaire should be filled out only by the actual decision maker. Three

follow-up letters were then sent, two of which included an extra

questionnaire, the final letter delivered by registered mail. All

emphasized the individual survey response would be treated confidentially,

and that the survey results would be published, so that their efforts had

the potential to result in significant advancement of public knowledge about

the stock market.

   We received cooperative responses from 128 or 59% of the 216 institutions

surveyed. We felt this was a very high response rate given the pitfalls

involved in asking institutions to obtain the cooperation of the relevant

decision maker. Of these, 57 institutions indicated that they were out of


                                       6
frame (usually, that the decision to purchase was not made by someone

presently in the institution or that the decision was forced by a mechanical

rule, as with index funds). We received usable questionnaires from 41

experimental group institutions, and 30 control group respondents.3

   We concluded, in the other paper discussing some results of this survey

(Shiller and Pound [1986]), that the evidence supported the notion that

contagion models are particularly useful in understanding the investors'

behavior in our experimental group. Contagion models have been used by

epidemiologists to study the transmission of diseases (e. g., Bailey [1975])

or social psychologists and sociologists to study the transmission of

fashions or fads (e. g., Bartholomew [l982]). If, as a simple    contagion
model suggests, interest in fad stocks is spread primarily by personal

communication among investors, then this should be evident in two aspects of

fad investors' communication patterns in our experimental group. First,

these investors should become interested in the stocks in question primarily

because of personal communications with other investors. Second, these

investors should be active in communicating with others, thereby spreading

the word about the stock. We interpreted our results as in concordance these

inferences even for our control group, and, moreover, supporting these

inferences more for those investors in the experimental group.

Fundamentals versus Market Psychology

    For the purpose of learning whether traditional bubble or fads models


     3Further details about the sampling procedure, implementation method

     4Social psychologists have shown that direct interpersonal
communications among peers is of singular importance for attitude change

might in some sense be descriptive of the behavior of investors in our

experimental group, we first approached the issue in a very direct way. We

posed an open-ended question, asking investors to state briefly the theory

that motivated them to invest in the stock in question:5



   In a few words, state the theory that caused you to purchase
   ___________ Put the theory as you would have put it to convince a
   trusted friend or fellow investment professional to buy the stock.


Immediately after the space in which they were to write the theory, the

following questions appeared:



   Which of the following better describes the above theory? (circle one
   number)

        A theory about the kinds of stocks that are becoming
        attractive to investors

                                           experimental group: 25% (ci  7%)
                                               control group: 21% (a = 8%)


        A theory about fundamentals, such as profits or dividends


                                          experimental group: 75% (ci = 7%)
                                               control group: 79% (ci = 8%)

                                                                 n:40,28

   There is virtually no difference between the experimental and control

groups on their classification of their theories: they both tend strongly to

describe their theories as concerning fundamentals.6 The theories provided,

 in both control and experimental groups, seemed also to refer to judgments

about public information about fundamentals, such things as growth trends in

the industry and quality of management] For both experimental and control

groups, there was no explicit mention in the open-ended question of market

psychology. No investor in either the control or experimental group of

stocks explicitly stated that the stock in question might be overpriced.

Of course, buying an overpriced stock would seem unlikely unless there is a

theory that market psychology would result in its becoming even more

overpriced, and we have seen that no mention of market psychology was ever

made.

   We interpret these results as rather unfavorable (at least for these

institutional investors) to the sort of traditional bubble model in which

investors perceive themselves as participating in a bubble and hope to exit

before it is over. The answers to the open-ended question, however, are not

inconsistent with the notion that 'fads' among institutional investors about

theories of fundamental value might engender speculative bubbles.

    Within the framework of fundamental analysis used by both investor

groups, there was in fact a significant difference between control and

experimental investors' theories. The difference lay in their concern with

relative valuation. Among control investors, 60% mentioned the relative

value of their stock in describing their investment theory --   comparing   its

         Of course, choosing the second answer to the above question does
not rule out that the respondent was counting on an inappropriate market
response to fundamentals. Margin comments indicated that some respondents
had trouble answering this question

       Except for unspecific references to discussions with management, none
referred to distinct inside information.

price, at the time they invested, to some measure of fundamental value.8

Most common were mentions of low P/E rations, low price relative to asset

(or book) value, and low price relative to cash flow. A majority of control

group investors thus explicitly stated that they considered the stock a good

value at the time of investment - -   with   44% explicitly suggesting that it

was undervalued at the time.

    By contrast, only 12% of our 41 experimental respondents compared the

price of the stock to either current or future fundamental value.9 Instead,

their answers focussed almost exclusively on the near-term future earnings

and growth prospects for the industry in question. Of the 41 experimental

group investors, 80% mentioned the prospect for strong, apparently

short-term, growth as the major motivation to invest. Earnings projections

were virtually never compared to price but rather mentioned as something

desirable in their own right. The group thus appeared caught up in growth

potential, and far less concerned with whether this potential was already

reflected in the stock's current market price.

    Almost all of the experimental group investors described their theory in

the classic lines of the good "story" stock. The industry in question had


           8Perhaps this concern with undervaluation reflects some concern
with market psychology, not explicitly stated.

     9Such comparisons with fundamental value need not have involved
complicated calculations. While price was very high relative to the
immediately available earnings figure, there are potentially many other
things that one might expect professional investors to compare with price.
For example, they might cite the per-share values of the appraised value of
the assets, of public earnings forecasts, or of size of plausible market
share. We cannot rule out the possibility that they had such comparisons in
mind and did not see fit to write them in the four-lines space provided.
Still, if such calculations were really on their mind one would think that
the calculations would be cited more often in efforts to convince a "fellow
investment professional to buy the stock."


                                        10
undergone an important shift in prospects. This shift was tied to a fairly

vivid recent qualitative changes that have been widely analyzed in the

popular press. Prominent among the investors' "theories" mentioned were

trends that any follower of general corporate news would be familiar with;

including the shift in medical care to health maintenance organizations, the

shift to generic drugs, and the growing industrial waste problem. Thus,

experimental group investors' theories did not seem particularly subtle or

unusually insightful, as would be suggested if the investment were driven by

comparisons of price with specialized knowledge about the company.

Market Timing

      The traditional bubble model might seem to suggest that investors are

very concerned with the timing of their investments. If fundamentals do not

justify the price increases, then investors are perhaps likely to feel that

the profit opportunity is short-lived. We asked:

   Do you remember thinking at any time that the potential for profiting
   in __________ was short-lived and that it was therefore urgent to
   purchase quickly?

                                                    (CIRCLE ONE NUMBER]

                                               control group: 17% (a — 7%)


                                                No             2
                                          experimental group: 70% (a — 7%)
                                               control group: 83% (a — 7%)

The experimental group does have somewhat more investors who feel that the

profit opportunity is short-lived. We thought that such a result might be

suggest that concerns with what other investors are thinking in the short

run is much more on the mind of the experimental group investors. But,


                                     11
admittedly, the outcome of this question could have other interpretations.

It's possible, for example, that the greater concern with timing is just due

to the observed rapidity of price movements.

Hypothetical Questions

   We posed several hypothetical questions concerning the stocks under

study:

   In each of the following questions, what is your best guess as to how
   you would change your holdings of __________ common stock?

   Answers to part "a" show that control group investors are more likely

than experimental group investors to sell if the price rises substantially.

This suggest perhaps that control group investors more often have in mind a

notion of fundamental value, and tend more to be looking for bargains in

stocks. Moreover, the experimental group investors are more likely to buy

more if there is a price rise, as suggested by traditional bubble models.

Still, only 16% would buy more, which suggests against the importance of the

notion that experimental group investors are well-described in terms of a

traditional bubble story in which price increases generate increased demand

and thus further price increases, in a vicious circle. There is essentially

no difference between the groups in their reaction to a price decline, part



   Answers to part "d" show a difference between the groups' reactions to a

short-term disappointment in fundamental performance. A majority of the

experimental group investors say they would sell their holdings given such

news, compared to only a fifth of the control investors. This result is

consistent with the heavy emphasis experimental investors gave to near-term

earnings performance in describing their investing theory.

   Part ttb shows essentially no difference between the groups, but it is

noteworthy that essentially half of both groups would buy more if price fell

25%. Certainly this result Is not consistent with traditional bubble theory

in which a price decrease would signal the collapse of the bubble.

    Price Changes and Investor Interest

   One possible view of investment professionals is that they might spend


                                     13
their time estimating "intrinsic values" for a large number of stocks, and

then automatically buy stocks whenever price falls below intrinsic value.

Interest in particular stocks would then be spurred by price declines (as

well as by reevaluations of intrinsic values). This may well be true of most

of the investors in the control group:

   Did a significant change in the price of stock motivate your initial
   interest in a way that led to your purchase of this stock?

  An opposite view of investor reaction to price changes that is often

espoused is that investor interest in individual stocks is spurred by price

increases. As noted above, traditional bubble models say that people

extrapolate past price increases, thinking that the trend will continue.

Some of the experimental group said they were attracted by a price


                                     14
increase, though most did not.



Investor Motivation

Related to the conventional notion of speculative bubbles is the notion that

participants in the bubble are motivated by the hopes of great profits. This

would imply that the experimental group investors would be more likely to be

seeking an unusual profit opportunity. The answers to the following question

confirm this presumption, but in fact most investors in both groups describe

themselves as seeking such opportunities:

   Which of the following statements better describes how your current
   portfolio (or the portfolios you manage) was put together?

        expectation of an unusual profit opportunity in that stock
        at the time of purchase.

        The primary motivation for purchasing each stock was to

Diffusion Investors and Systematic Investors

  Decision makers in the experimental group of stocks tend to describe

their approach to stock-picking differently than do investors in other

stocks. We asked the decision makers surveyed whether they agreed with the

                                     15
statement: "My initial interest was the result of my, or someone else's,

systematic search over a large number of stocks (using a computerized or

other similar search procedure) for a stock with certain characteristics."

The differences in response to this question were striking. Among

control-group investors, 67% answered yes. By contrast, in the experimental

group only 25% answered yes. We took these results to be quite important

(Shiller and Pound [1986]). Diffusion or contagion models of stock price

behavior are based on unsystematic investor behavior, and indeed the great

majority in our experimental group appear unsystematic. Even if the wording

of the question leaves some doubt as to how unsystematic those who answer no

actually are, it is nonetheless clear that those in the experimental group

are less systematic than those in the control group. Note that the question

does not specify what the investors were systematic about. For what follows,

we shall divide the investors in our sample into two groups: 'diffusion

investors' are those who answered no to the above question, denying that

they were systematic. 'Systematic investors' are those who answered yes.



Diffusion Investors Tended to Increase Holdings During Period of

Rapidly Rising Prices

   Figure 1 shows the number of shares (adjusted for splits and

distributions) held by each of the diffusion traders in the experimental

group as a function of time.1° These are end-of-quarter data for each

quarter from June 1984 to September 1985. Since the stocks used in the

experimental group were selected to have very high price increases over the


     101t should be noted that figures shown are for the institution and do
not necessarily reflect primarily the decision maker who filled out the
questionnaire.

                                      16
year ending May or June 1985, the time period in the plots (except for the

last observation) may be characterized as having an 'uptrend' in price.

   It is striking that over this period of price increase diffusion

investors tended to increase their holdings. Many of these investors showed

a gradual increase in holdings over the period of price increase, but only

one showed a gradual decrease. It should be emphasized that what are

plotted are numbers of shares and not value of holdings. Since there were no

new issues by any of the firms, the remainder of investors, not among the

diffusion investors in our sample, must have tended to decrease their

holdings over the sample period.

   One possible interpretation that is consistent with this   finding is that

diffusion investors are overly enthusiastic and faddish, that other

investors tend to offset the effect of their enthusiasm on price, but do not

offset their effect enough to prevent a dramatic price increase.

The Steady Growth and Sudden CollaDse' Pattern of Holdings

   As is evident from Figure 1, the number of shares held through time for

each of the 30 diffusion investors in the experimental group tended to grow

zradually through the sample period, over which prices per share were

generally rising dramatically.12 This steady growth generally either


     110f course, since our sample consisted of investors who held the stock
near the end of the sample period plotted, those investors who
systematically decreased their holdings to zero by this date do not appear
in the plots. However, it is not clear that any important bias is introduced
by this sampling method. Suppose that the holdings of shares are for each
investor a random walk truncated at zero and at an upper barrier. Then those
in the sample are as likely to have a higher quantity of holdings at the
beginning of the sample as a lower.
     12 .
       Since the stocks for the experimental group were selected from
                                                                      among
the highest performing stocks for the year ending June 1985 (corresponding
to the second to the last point plotted in Figure 1) the prevailing pattern
of price was dramatically upwards.

                                     17
continued unabated throughout the times observed or suddenly collapsed.

  All of the 30 investors increased their holdings at some point in the

sample shown in Figure 1, yet only 7 (or 23%) made an abrupt (that is,

within three months) increase in their holdings from essentially nothing to

the maximum holdings. On the other hand, of the 15 investors whose holdings

decreased at some point in the sample shown in Figure 1, 11 (Or 73%)

decreased their holdings abruptly (that is, within three months) from

essentially their maximum holdings to essentially zero. There is thus a

distinct asymmetry between increases and decreases in holdings patterns.

   In only two cases was there an abrupt in-and-out pattern of holding.

There was no highly irregular pattern of holdings, in which a firm came in

and out of the stock more than once in the sample period, as might be

suggested by models in which firms were comparing the price with their own

specific information as it evolved.13

        The smoothness of the increase in holdings might possibly be

attributed to the fear on the part of investors that buying large blocks of

stocks might push up the price of the stock. But there are several reasons

why this explanation is unconvincing. First, our diffusion investors are not

afraid to sell abruptly, only to buy. Second, total institutional holdings

in our sample are small, with none exceeding the 5% threshold requiring SEC

disclosure. Third, the literature on block trades - -   defined   as more than

10,000 shares transacted at once, as a secondary distribution - - documents


     13The absence of monotonically declining patterns of holdings among the
diffusion investors in the experimental group is striking. Of course, our
sampling procedure assured that all those included would hold shares on
either March or June 1985, and so there are none who had sold out by those
dates. Still, there could have been monotonically declining patterns in
figure 1, and their absence is probably due to the behavior of diffusion
investors in a market with rapidly rising prices.

                                        18
an insignificant price effect from "market disruption", and a small (1 or

2%) price impact from "information" (Scholes [1972], Kraus and Stoll

[1972]).

   A further examination of the holdings in the sample, comparing them to

trading volume, heightens the impression that market disruption is not the

reason for the pattern of slow accumulation. Taking the largest holdings

among diffusion traders in our experimental group in each of the nine

experimental stocks, as of December 31, 1984, and dividing the number of

shares traded in that stock in January 1985 yields an average ratio of .165.

With about 22 trading days in the average month, this ratio shows that the

largest positions in our sample of institutional investors amounted

approximately to three trading days worth of volume - -   hardly   justification

for six-month-long periods of increasing holdings. Further, as the

institutions showing highest holdings tended to be disproportionately large,

with disproportionately large holdings, the same ratio for most institutions

was a fraction of the above figure, often amounting to less than one day of

trading volume.

    If investors' fear of influencing price is not likely to be the reason

for the smoothness of holding patterns, what ia   the reason? The following
question was posed to afford some impression as to the possibilities:


   Which of the following help to explain why you waited as long as you

   Most of those filling in an "other" for part "f" said something to the

effect that the purchase was triggered when price fell or when information

suggested that fundamental value had risen relative to price. Only three of

the 71 answering part "f" brought up concerns that might be construed as

related to their possibly influencing the price of the stock.

   We see in these answers instead some confirmation that for many their

timing of purchase had its origins in their own way of thinking or

operating. They needed time to think through their purchases (part "b"). To

a lesser extent, they maintain their interest until cash flows allow them to

invest in the shares (part "a"). These answers suggest that the kind of time

lags between the time a diffusion investor hears a story about a stock and

actually invests fully in it may be thought of as due to simple delay, as

hypothesized in the simple contagion or epidemic models (Shiller and Pound

[1986]).

   The most popular answer of all to the above question is part "c". They

wanted to experience good performance before investing a lot. This answer

suggests that traditional 'vicious circle' bubble models may have some

validity, not because price increases attract initial interest, but because

they reassure those who have already invested, who then increase their

demand.

Analysis

   Institutional investors in our experimental group of 'fad' stocks are

different from those in our control group in a number of dimensions. They

are less likely to compare price with any measure of fundamental value, and

more likely to rest their case for a stock on a nonspecific "story" about

                                     21
short-run earnings prospects. They are somewhat more likely to think that

timing is critical, somewhat more likely to have their interest attracted by

price increases and somewhat less likely to report that they would sell the

share if the price increases substantially. They are more likely to sell

their shares if confronted with a short-term disappointment about

fundamental performance.

   Institutional investors in our experimental group are not very different

from those in our control group in a number of other dimensions where

bubble models might have led us to expect differences. The two groups both

generally agree that they are investing on theories about fundamentals

rather than about market psychology. Most in the two groups agree that they

are seeking unusual profit opportunities, and not looking for a "balanced1'

portfolio. The two groups give similar explanations why most of them take a

substantial time to get around to investing in the stocks they are

interested in.

   These results help us to frame a little better the nature of possible

purely speculative movements in stock prices. They suggest, for example,

some modification of the traditional story, as told by Keynes, of the role

of professionals in such price movements:14

   This battle of wits to anticipate the basis of conventional valuation
   a few months hence, rather than the prospective yield of an investment
   over the long term of years, does not even require the gulls amongst
   the public to feed the maws of the professional; - -




            Maynard Keynes, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and
Money, pp.155-6.

                                      22
   -- itcan be played by the professionals amongst themselves. Nor is it
  necessary that anyone should keep this simple faith in the
  conventional basis of valuation having any genuine long-term validity.
  For it is, so to speak, a game of Snap, of Old Maid, of Musical
  Chairs, a pastime in which he is victor who says Snap neither too soon
  nor too late, who passes the Old Maid to his neighbor before the game
  is over, who secures a seat for himself when the music stops.


Investors in our experimental group are not so conscious of timing and are

more concerned with fundamentals than his story might suggest. The bubbles

might better be described as involving interpersonal communications, rumors

and theories, about genuine fundamentals. The bubbles, if they indeed were

found among our experimental group, would be more in the nature of fashions

or fads concerning theories about which industries will be profitable in the

short- run.
