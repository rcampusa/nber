Wealth Mobility in the 1860s

                                          ABSTRACT

We offer new evidence on the regional dynamics of wealth holding in the United States over the
Civil War decade based on a hand-linked random sample of wealth holders drawn from the 1860
census. Despite the wealth shock caused by emancipation, we find that patterns of wealth
mobility were broadly similar for northern and southern residents in 1860. Looking at the
determinants of individual wealth holding in 1870, we find that the elasticity with respect to 1860
wealth was quite low in both regions--consistent with high levels of wealth mobility.

1. Introduction

         Rising levels of income and wealth inequality in the United States and other developed

economies since the 1980s have attracted renewed attention to the dynamics of wealth

accumulation. Whether market economies display a tendency toward rising inequality remains an

open question. There is evidence, however, that major economic dislocations such as the Great

Depression and World War II ­ and the policies enacted during this period - temporarily reversed

the trend toward increasing inequality. Piketty (2014, p. 275) showed that, "it was the chaos of

war, with its attendant economic and political shocks, that reduced inequality in the twentieth

century...In the twentieth century it was war, and not harmonious democratic or economic

rationality, that erased the past and enabled society to begin anew with a clean slate." But there

is relatively little evidence from earlier time periods that would contextualize these mid-

twentieth century events.

         In this paper we offer new evidence from an earlier period by examining patterns of

wealth mobility in the United States over the Civil War decade. The U.S. federal censuses of

1860 and 1870 included questions about personal and real property wealth, allowing us to

examine how the Civil War and the resulting emancipation of enslaved African-Americans

affected property ownership. 1




1
  Despite the fact that these property ownership data are self-reported, the general consensus has been that they are
reasonably accurate. Soltow (1975, p. 6) concluded that they were "generally in line with estimates made by various
authorities on wealth distribution. Growth rates are similar to those found for GNP per worker by Kuznets and
commodity output per worker by Gallman." Steckel (1990) noted that it would be difficult to have concealed real
estate holdings and Querubin and Snyder (2011, p. 65) have argued that there was little incentive to conceal or under
report wealth holding. Where other local tax data are available, they generally line up with the census data. See
Steckel (1994) for comparisons with Ohio and Massachusetts data, as well as Galenson and Pope (1992), Blocker
(1994) and Bleakley and Ferrie (2016). Another concern with the Census data is that some populations were under
enumerated in 1870, a point argued by Steckel (1991). Hacker (2013) and Blocker (1994), however, show that the
rate of under enumeration was not exceptionally high.
                                                                                                                   2

        In addition to contributing to the larger literature on the dynamics of wealth inequality

our analysis also contributes to an historical literature that has sought to trace the effects of

emancipation on the southern elite. Among early analysts of the effects of emancipation, the

prevailing argument was that emancipation had been accompanied by the displacement of the

pre-war elite (see, e.g., Hammond 1897). Reflective of this view, Buck (1937, p. 145) concluded

that: "The small, rich landowning aristocracy in whose interest so much of Southern energy had

been expended was deprived of its privileged position." Yet, by the time Buck was writing a

new view based on more quantitative evidence was beginning to emerge. Reflecting this new

perspective, Shugg (1937) argued that the plantation system was not destroyed by the war and

that land ownership actually became more concentrated after the Civil War.

        The most influential modern works on this subject are Jonathan Wiener's (1976, 1979)

studies using census data for five Alabama counties. Relying on manuscript censuses from these

counties, Wiener analyzed a sample of the 263 largest landholders in 1860, seeking to locate

them in the 1870 census. He then compared their persistence rate over the 1860s with the

persistence of a comparable group between 1850 and 1860. Finding that the rate of persistence

in the 1860s (43 percent) was close to that of the 1850s (47 percent), he concluded that this

supported Shugg's argument that the wealthy planter elite had been successful in retaining their

position despite the disruptions of the Civil War. Ransom and Sutch (1977) concurred with

Wiener that the land ownership patterns were quite stable over the decade allowing the pre-war

elite to retain their political and social influence in the post-war South.2

  In addition to the sources cited in the text see also Campbell (1982) who analyzed persistence in one Texas county
from 1850 to 1880, and Ransom (1989).
                                                                                                    3

       An important limitation of the studies by Wiener and other quantitative historians is their

limited geographic scope. In the absence of comprehensive finding aids for the census, data

could only be gathered on individuals who remained within a narrow geographic area. Thus, the

fate of individuals who migrated out of the region of study could not be determined. Their

departure might have reflected a response to downward mobility, but it was equally possible that

they had moved in pursuit of new and more attractive opportunities elsewhere. As Massey

(2016, p. 5) notes, matching individuals within restricted geographic areas "poses a serious threat

to the representativeness of the matched sample."

       In the past decade, however, advances in electronic finding aids for historical censuses

combined with online access to complete census manuscripts for the entire country, has

eliminated these technical constraints and enabled a new generation of scholars to trace

individuals regardless of geographic mobility. In a recent article, we analyzed the top 5 percent

of wealth holders in the North and South found in the IPUMS 1% sample of the 1870 census,

linking them backward to the 1860 census using Ancestry.com's search function and then

locating them in the 1860 wealth distribution (Dupont and Rosenbloom 2018). We found that

while there was substantial persistence among the southern elite, the rate of downward (and

upward) mobility was greater in the South than in the North. While 40 percent of the wealthiest

northerners in 1870 had been in the top 5 percent in 1860, less than 28 percent of the richest

southerners had been in the top 5 percent in 1860.

       Using the complete-count digitized version of the 1860 census linked to the 1870, 1880

and 1900 censuses Ager, Boustan and Eriksson (2019) were able to trace the fortunes of southern

household heads and their sons over a substantially longer period. Consistent with Dupont and

Rosenbloom (2018) they found that southern slaveholders experience larger drops in wealth than
                                                                                                    4

other household heads. However, they reported that by 1880 the sons of southern slave holders

had rebounded, achieving a status comparable to that of their fathers before the Civil War.

Because questions about wealth were included only in the 1860, 1860 and 1870 censuses,

however, comparisons beyond this period must be based on the inferred status of different

occupations rather than on a direct comparison of wealth.

       In this paper we offer an additional perspective on the effects of the events of the 1860s

through a comparison of a random sample of household heads in all regions of the country drawn

from the one percent sample of the 1860 census and linked forward to the 1870 censuses. While

the Ager, Boustan and Eriksson (2019) analysis focused on the differential effects of slave

ownership on the fortunes of southerners, we explicitly consider inter-regional differences in

wealth mobility. And in contrast to our earlier work, by using a random sample of pre-war

wealth holders we are better able to analyze the factors that were associated with upward and

downward mobility over the decade. With this new sample we find that overall wealth

persistence was remarkably similar across regions, despite the fact that most of the effects of the

Civil War were concentrated in the South. Nonetheless, we do find some evidence that

emancipation did produce greater wealth mobility in the South. Specifically, we show that the

correlation of personal property ownership (which included slave wealth in 1860) between 1860

and 1870 was lower in the South than in the North, but that the magnitude of this difference was

too small to impact the behavior of total wealth in the decade.



2. Data

       In the absence of unique and reliable identifying information that would allow individuals

to be unambiguously linked between different data sources, researchers seeking to create linked
                                                                                                     5

data must draw inferences about whether observations in different sources are truly the same

person based on commonly available and time invariant information such as name, birth year,

and birth place. In doing so, they must contend with the fact that names may change over time

because Census enumerators may have misspelled them, the household respondent may have

reported them incorrectly, or an individual may have changed her/his name. Age and birth year

may differ across sources due to a tendency of people to round age to the nearest multiple of 5

("age heaping"). Similarly, respondents may provide somewhat different information about birth

place at different times. Digitization of the original handwritten records can introduce further

errors, when the original information is difficult to read or is transcribed incorrectly (Bailey et al

2017, p. 3). Finally, mortality and emigration mean that some individuals are not available to be

enumerated in subsequent data sets.

       For these reasons, constructing a linked data set requires a set of subjective judgements

about whether an individual located in one source is in fact the same person as the one found in

another. Among the most important questions to consider are whether the names are sufficiently

similar and whether the reported age is close to what it should be. As the criteria for accepting

non-exact matches are loosened more matches may be made, increasing the size of the linked

sample. But at the same time, the possibility of incorrect linkages (Type I errors), in which two

different people are assumed to be the same person, increases, which introduces spurious

matches. Stricter criteria reduce the number of incorrect linkages, but increase the likelihood of

rejecting correct linkages (Type II errors). Including incorrect linkages introduces noise in the

data with a resultant attenuation of estimated parameters. Rejecting true links reduces sample

size and hence statistical precision. Moreover, if the rejected links are systematically selected,

these Type II errors can introduce sample selection issues into the resulting data.
                                                                                                                     6

         Bailey et al (2017) provide an excellent overview of the different approaches to record

linkage that have been adopted by researchers and evaluate how well they perform on several

data sets for which the ground truth is known with a high degree of certainty. Their comparisons

reveal that the automated linkage methods that have been used in a number of recent studies are

prone to accepting incorrect links in up to 37 percent of cases. Interestingly, many of these

methods also increase the number of incorrectly rejected links. The reason for both seems to

derive from phonetic name processing and other approaches to inexact name matching. Because

these approaches reduce spelling variations, they result in more potential matches which

increases the chance of incorrect matches and the likelihood of rejecting a true match because

there are multiple matches that cannot be disambiguated.

         For this paper we have hand-collected a set of 1,682 observations of household heads

between the 1860 and 1870 federal censuses. To obtain these data we began by drawing a

random sample of 8,400 household heads from the one percent sample of the 1860 federal

population census available through IPUMS (Ruggles et al 2020; downloaded 1/3/2018). After

dropping individuals younger than 16 and older than 76 in 1860, the sample is reduced to 8,321

observations. To ensure reasonable geographic representation we stratified our initial sample by

census regions: we selected 4,000 observations each from the North and South, and 400

observations from the western states. 3

         Our research assistants then searched for each individual using Ancestry.com's search

algorithm based on first and last name, birth year, birth location, and gender. Ancestry's search

algorithm uses Soundex to produce search results for exact and similar name matches. Our

Divisions, with the exception of Missouri (a slave state in 1860) which we include in our definition of the South.

Divisions.
                                                                                                                    7

research assistants reviewed the search results. If there was an exact and unique match they were

instructed to accept it and record data from the 1870 census manuscript. If there was no exact

match, they reviewed the search results for names that appeared acceptably similar and had a

birth year within 2 years of that inferred from the 1860 census. If multiple matches met these

criteria they were instructed to consider place of birth to break these "ties." In cases where it was

not possible to uniquely resolve the match they were instructed to treat the case as an

unsuccessful link. 4

         Our linkage rate of 1,682/8,321 (20.2%) is roughly consistent with that of other

researchers linking records forward from one census to a later one (Bailey et al 2017). 5 Because

marital status and children are endogenous and may be correlated with other characteristics of

interest, we did not use information about other household members as a criterion to select links.

However, comparing data on spouses and children, when present, offers an independent

assessment of the quality of the links. In 923 (about 55%) of the linked observations cases we are

able to confirm that another household member present in 1860 was also present in the 1870




4
  Because our method relied on the subjective judgement of our research assistants to determine which variant
names were "close enough" we assigned about 10 percent of cases to multiple research assistants and compared
these cases. When the research assistants made different choices, we discussed the reasons for each choice and
determined if there was a way to resolve these differences. These discussions helped both to sharpen their judgment
over time and increase the uniformity of decision making as the project progressed.
5
  Census officials at the time, and some later scholars have expressed concern about the high rate of under
enumeruation in the 1870 census, which could depress the rate of successful linkage. However, according to Hacker
et al (1999, p.129), "the undercount estimate given in the 1890 census report was greatly exaggerated as a result of a
failure to account for the magnitude of the negative demographic shock caused by the Civil War." They point out
that to arrive at the estimate of a 1.2 million person undercount, the 1890 investigators had assumed that the South
experienced steady population growth between 1860 and 1880. Recent studies, however, have suggested that the
Civil War substantially slowed population growth in the 1860s relative to the pace in the 1870s. Adopting a more
realistic set of assumptions about the rate of population increase in the 1860s implies an undercount of about 6.6
percent, not significantly different from nonresponse rates in modern survey data (Hacker, 2013). On this basis
Hacker et al, argued that the "under enumeration of southern whites and blacks in 1870 was far lower than 1890
investigators estimated. [The 1870 census] will not pose a significant problem for most analyses."
                                                                                                       8

census records for the household. This result provides an independent confirmation that these

observations are indeed correctly matched.

        Table 1 summarizes the results of our linkage effort, comparing a variety of demographic

characteristics between the linked (column 2) and unlinked (column 1) observations. We also

report the same summary statistics for those "high quality" links (column 3) in which another

household member can be linked across the two census years. The fourth and fifth columns

report, respectively, the t-statistics for the difference in means between the linked and unlinked

observations and the p-value of this test statistic. There are a number of systematic differences

between the linked and unlinked observations. Compared to the unlinked, our linked sample is

about 15 months older, was more likely to report non-zero wealth in 1860 was less likely to be

foreign born, less likely to be nonwhite, less likely to be living in an urban area, and more likely

to have a family in 1860. The average wealth of the linked sample is also somewhat higher,

although this difference is not statistically significant. In addition, it is apparent that we were

more successful in linking individuals residing in the North in 1860 than those living in the

South or West. Given the more pronounced effects of the Civil War on the southern economy

and the greater geographic mobility of individuals in the West it is perhaps not surprising that

this is the case. For the most part the occupational distribution of the linked and unlinked

samples is quite similar, although farmers are over represented in the linked sample and service

workers, laborers and those in the non-occupational category are under represented.



3. Wealth Mobility

        One way to describe wealth mobility over the 1860s is to look at individual movement

within the wealth distribution in the two years. This is the approach we took in our earlier
                                                                                                    9

analysis (Dupont and Rosenbloom 2018). Before considering the data, however, it is important

to note that emancipation presents an inherent challenge to these comparisons. In 1860, enslaved

persons were not enumerated in the population census. In 1870, however, the formerly enslaved

were included in the population count, which added to the size of the overall population,

especially in the South. Because they were mostly propertyless, the added observations were

concentrated in the bottom tail of the distribution. The larger population expands the size of

each percentile category, thus shifting the dividing points between percentile groups. In general

we would expect the lower bounds for each group to decline, producing an apparent upward

mobility among the 1860 free population. Ideally, we would like to be able to track movements

in the wealth distribution within a consistently defined population. The best we can do in this

case, however, is to locate individuals relative to the distribution of wealth among white

household heads in both 1860 and 1870.

       In Table 2 we compare individuals' locations in the overall distribution of total property

ownership between 1860 and 1870 based on their 1860 region of residence. To do this we first

use data on all white household heads in the 1 percent samples of the 1860 and 1870 censuses to

characterize the distribution of wealth in each region in each year, and use this information to

locate individuals in our linked sample within the distribution for their region of residence in

each year. We aggregate the bottom 55 percent of wealth holders because most of this group

reported zero wealth holding and it is not possible to discern movement up or down within this

group. In the table, the rows of each panel count individuals based on their position in the 1860

wealth distribution within their region of residence in 1860, while the columns count individuals

based on their position in the 1870 wealth distribution in the region of residence in 1870. The

cells along the diagonal of the table represent individuals who neither moved up nor down. Cells
                                                                                                    10

to the right of the diagonal represent individuals who moved up in the wealth distribution, while

cells to the left represent individuals whose wealth status declined over the decade. Panel (a)

reports mobility for residents of the Northern states in 1860 regardless of 1870 location, while

panels (b) and (c) show similar data for residents of Southern and Western states, respectively.

       In all three regions there is a considerable degree of movement, both up and down the

wealth distribution over the decade. In the North, for example, of 431 household heads in the

bottom 55 percent of the wealth distribution in 1860, 295 (68.4 percent) remained in this

category in 1870, but 38 had moved into the 55th-65th percentile, while 39 had moved into the

next tier (65th-75th percentile), and 61 had moved up even futher, with 6 reaching the top 5

percent of 1870 wealth holders. A very similar movement is apparent in the South where 65.8

percent of those in the bottom tier of the wealth distribution remained in that category in 1870,

but 34.2 percent had moved up.

       One quick way to summarize the overall pattern of movement within regions is to count

the numbers of those who moved down the distribution, remained in the same relative position or

moved up. We report these figures at the bottom of the panels in Tables 2-4. Since wealth

accumulates with age we would expect, other things equal, that household heads in 1860 would

move up the wealth distribution over the succeeding decade as they aged and accumulated

wealth. We see some evidence of this ­ more northern and southern heads of household moved

to higher wealth categories than moved to lower ones ­ but there is significant stability within

the wealth distribution in both regions. A plurality of households in the north and the south were

in the same wealth category in 1870 as they were in 1860 whether we measure total wealth or its

components. And we see a fairly large percentage of households that moved down the wealth

distribution, sometimes considerably. The west is somewhat different, with the largest
                                                                                                                      11

percentage of those households moving down the wealth distribution, but the small number of

individuals in that region should lead us to interpret those results with caution.

         Because individuals reported personal and real estate wealth separately, we can also

examine the evolution of wealth holding in these separate categories. Tables 3 and 4 report

wealth transition tables for each of these wealth categories, respectively. There is greater

stability in the wealth distribution when we look at real property wealth as compared to personal

wealth. For real property wealth, the percentage of households that did not change positions in

the wealth distribution were 46.2 and 44.4 percent for the north and south, respectively. But for

personal wealth, those figures drop to 41 and 37 percent, respectively. In our earlier work

(Dupont and Rosenbloom 2018), we found that there was more turnover among top wealth

holders in the south. Our results here similarly show that the top wealth holders in the north

were more likely to be non-movers; for example, 42 percent of northerners who were in the 85-

95th percentile of the total wealth distribution in 1860 were in that same category in 1870 but

only 32 percent of southerners were. This same pattern holds throughout the top end of the total

wealth distribution. Most of these north-south differences are driven by the personal property

component of total wealth, which is not surprising given that the 1860 personal property for
                                     6
southereners included slaves.




6
  The magnitude of this regional differential is perhaps somewhat less muted than that found in our earlier analysis
of top wealth holders in the South. One reason for this is that our earlier focused only on top wealth holders in 1870
and did not account for the effects of emancipation on the population enumerated in the 1870 census. Adding the
formerly enslaved to the population in 1870 has a pronounced effect in the South, where it both increases total
population size (thus increasing the size of each percentile category) and alters the overall distribution of wealth by
increasing the size of the population with little or no property. As one illustration, if we use the entire population to
calculate the wealth distribution in 1870, 47.6% of southern household heads in our linked sample moved up in the
wealth distribution between 1860 and 1870 (compared to 31.6% percent using only the white population in 1870).
By contrast, in the North, where there were far fewer of the formerly enslaved in 1870, the fraction moving up
changes only from 28.9% (white population wealth distribution) to 29.9%.

4. The Determinants of 1870 Individual Wealth Holding

           The aggregated data reported so far establish that broad patterns of wealth mobility in the

North and South were similar over the 1860s, although there are noticeable differences at the top

end of the wealth distribution, mostly driven by differences in the personal wealth category.

There is some evidence that wealth mobility in the more sparsely settled western parts of the

country behaved differently, but because of relatively small size of our linked sample from this

region it is hard to draw firm conclusions about this.

           Using the individual level data we have collected we can move beyond these broad

patterns, however, and analyze those factors that influenced individual fortunes over the decade.

In this section of the paper we take advantage of the full range of individual data available to

more closely examine factors that influenced individual wealth holding at the end of the decade.

In Table 5 we report results of regressing log wealth in 1870 on a quadratic function of age, log

wealth in 1860, and indicators for race, nativity, and whether the individual is living in his or her

state of birth in 1860. 7 To address the fact that many individuals report no wealth in one or both

years we add $1 to reported wealth for all individuals. The first three columns report regressions

for total wealth, the next three show personal property, and the final three show real property.

           The R-squared statistics for these regressions, which are mostly in the range of 0.1 to 0.2,

make clear that there is a large unexplained component to 1870 wealth. Nonetheless we find a

number of economically and statistically significant systematic effects. Quite reasonably, 1870

wealth has an inverted-U relationship with age in 1860, rising until roughly the mid-40s in 1860

(mid-50s in 1870) before beginning to decline. The effects of the wealth shock caused by

emancipation are evident in the coefficients on the regional indicator variables, that imply that,



7
    We adopt a log transformation because of the skewed distribution of wealth.
                                                                                                             13

other things equal, individuals living in the South in 1860 had lower levels of wealth in 1870

than comparable individuals living in the North. The coefficient on the foreign-born indicator is

consistently negative and relatively large in magnitude, but it is statistically significant only in

the case of personal property. Individuals living outside their state of birth also appear to have

lower wealth than those who had not moved outside their state of birth, but none of these effects

is statistically significant. The signs on the occupational variables are consistent with what we

might expect, implying higher wealth for farmers, managers and proprietors than for laborers and

service workers. For the most part occupational effects are not statistically significant, but

service workers in 1860, the unemployed and those giving other non-occupational responses did

have significantly lower wealth in 1870. 8

        Of primary interest in these regressions is the coefficient on 1860 wealth holding, which

measures the elasticity of 1870 wealth with respect to wealth 10 years earlier. For each category

of wealth, we begin by imposing a constant elasticity across regions, and then allow it to differ

across regions. The cross-decade wealth elasticity is greatest, indicating the most persistence, for

real estate wealth, and least for personal wealth. Total wealth, which aggregates these two

categories, lies somewhere in between. It is worth noting that none of these elasticities appears

to be very high in absolute terms. In other words, the data suggest a considerable degree of

unpredictability in wealth holding from decade to decade. When we allow the elasticity of 1860

wealth to vary by 1860 region of residence we find a strong negative effect for western residents,

consistent with our earlier finding of greater downward mobility for this group.




8
  The occupation category unemployed includes the responses "at home," "no employment," "no occupation", and
"without occupation;" while the non-occupational responses include many individuals who described themselves as
retired from a particular occupation as well as a number of other assorted responses.
                                                                                                     14

       If the effects of the Civil War and emancipation reduced wealth persistence in the South

relative to other regions, we would expect the wealth elasticity measure would be smaller in this

region, and, we do find evidence that the estimated wealth elasticity is indeed lower for 1860

residents of the South than for northerners. This effect is largest and statistically significant,

however, only for personal property. The impact on real property holding is far smaller and

statistically insignificant. As we might expect the magnitude of the effect on total property lies

somewhere in between these two and is not significant at standard confidence levels.         These

results are consistent with the conjecture that the effects of emancipation were concentrated in

personal property wealth holding, which is consistent with the aggregated results we show in

Table 4. Moreover, this more granular analysis suggests that in fact the wealth shock caused by

the war and emancipation did result in both a reduction in overall wealth in the South and a

greater degree of wealth mobility over the decade of the 1860s.

       The regression results in Table 5 describe responses at the mean of the distribution. It

seems possible, however, that wealth persistence varied systematically with 1860 wealth. To

investigate this possibility, we estimated a series of quantile regression models. The results are

reported in Tables 6 and 7.

       In Table 6 we have pooled observations across regions to focus on differences in the

determinants of 1870 wealth holding across different segments of the wealth distribution. All of

the regressions include controls for 1860 occupation, which are suppressed to simplify the

presentation. The first three columns of results show estimates at the 55th, 75th and 90th

percentiles, respectively, for total property ownership. We then report estimates for real property

and personal property separately. In each case, we find that the elasticity of 1870 wealth with

respect to 1860 wealth was declining across wealth percentiles. This pattern is much more
                                                                                                    15

pronounced for real property than for personal property. Nonetheless it appears that across all

categories of wealth there was more randomness among the top wealth strata than among those

near the bottom of the wealth distribution.

       In Table 7 we focus on differences in the elasticity of 1870 wealth with respect to 1860

wealth between the North and South. As in the pooled regressions, elasticities are declining as

we move to higher wealth quantiles. This pattern is evident in both regions and for all three

types of wealth. At the 55th percentile of the wealth distribution 1860 wealth had a greater

impact on 1870 wealth in the North than in the South. But at both the 75th and 90th quantiles the

coefficients reported in Table 7 are quite similar across the two regions.



5. Conclusion

       Ending slavery resulted in an historically unprecedented transfer of wealth from slave

owners to the formerly enslaved. The war itself devastated large areas of the southern United

States, and reconstruction resulted in significant political upheaval within the states of the

Confederacy. Not surprisingly, historians have long been interested in how these multiple

shocks affected southern society and southern elites. Recent interest among economists in issues

of inequality and the dynamics of wealth distribution offer another reason for studying this

episode.

       Several recent studies have begun to exploit the ability to link data for individuals across

multiple censuses to shed light on the evolution of individual fortunes. In this paper we offer

additional evidence from a hand-linked sample of 1,682 household heads followed between the

1860 and 1870 censuses. Several important insights follow from our analysis. First, we find

little difference in relative wealth mobility patterns between northern and southern residents in
                                                                                                     16

1860. That is those at the top of the southern wealth distribution were just as likely to remain at

the top in 1870 as was the case for northern residents. In 1860 western states were still relatively

sparsely settled, and our sample for this region is small. Nonetheless, our data suggest that

fortunes in this region were more dynamic and that downward mobility was much more likely

for residents in this region. Presumably, spaces at the top were filled by new residents moving

into the region.

       Second, we are able to examine in some detail the determinants of individual wealth

holding in 1870 as a function of exogenous personal characteristics determined at the beginning

of the decade of the 1860s. Consistent with the expected effects of emancipation, war and

political turmoil, we find that holding 1860 wealth and other characteristics constant southern

residents held substantially (35 to 50 percent) less wealth in 1870 than did their counterparts in

the North. We also find some support for the conclusion that the events of the 1860s created

more mobility among southern wealth holders than in among those in the north. When we allow

the elasticity of 1870 wealth with respect to 1860 wealth to vary by region of residence in 1860,

our estimates imply that the effects of 1860 wealth were weaker for southern residents than for

northern ones.
