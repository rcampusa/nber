External validity is a challenge in treatment effect estimation. Even in randomized trials, the
experimental sample often differs from the population of interest. If participation decisions are
explained by observed variables such differences can be overcome by reweighting. However,
participation may depend on unobserved variables. Even in such cases, under a common support
assumption there exist weights which, if known, would allow reweighting the sample to match
the population. While these weights cannot in general be estimated, we develop approximations
which relate them to the role of private information in participation decisions. These
approximations suggest benchmarks for assessing external validity.

                                                 Abstract

        External validity is a challenge in treatment effect estimation. Even in randomized trials,
        the experimental sample often differs from the population of interest. If participation deci-
        sions are explained by observed variables such differences can be overcome by reweighting.
        However, participation may depend on unobserved variables. Even in such cases, under a
        common support assumption there exist weights which, if known, would allow reweighting
        the sample to match the population. While these weights cannot in general be esti-
        mated, we develop approximations which relate them to the role of private information in
        participation decisions. These approximations suggest benchmarks for assessing external
        validity.



1       Introduction

External validity is a major challenge in empirical social science. As an example, consider
Bloom, Liang, Roberts and Ying (2015), who report results from an experimental evaluation
of working from home in a Chinese firm. In the first stage of the evaluation, workers at the
firm were asked to volunteer for an experiment in which they might have the opportunity
to work from home. The study then randomized among eligible volunteers, and compliance
was excellent. The study estimates large productivity gains from working from home. Given
these results, one might reasonably ask whether the firm would be better off having more of
their employees work from home - or even having them all work from home. To answer this

question, we need to know the average treatment effect of working from home in the entire
population of workers.
    The population of volunteers for the experiment differs from the overall population of
workers along some observable dimensions (for example, commute time and gender). It seems
plausible that they also differ on some unobservable dimensions, for example ability to self-
motivate. For both reasons, volunteers may have systematically different treatment effects
than non-volunteers. In this case, the average treatment effect estimated by the experiment
will differ from that in the population of workers as a whole. This issue - that the experimental
sample differs from the population of policy interest - is widespread in economics and other
fields.1
    In this paper we consider external validity of treatment effects estimated from a random-
ized trial in a non-representative sample. For average treatment effects estimated from a
randomized trial to be externally valid for a target population, they should coincide with the
average treatment effect in the target population. We focus on the case where participation
in the experiment is possibly non-random; we refer to this as the “participation decision,” al-
though note that it may be either a decision by an individual to enroll in a trial, or a decision
by a researcher to include a particular area or unit in their experimental set.
    If participation is driven entirely by observable variables, this problem has a well-known
solution; one can reweight the sample to obtain population-appropriate estimates (as in e.g.
Stuart et al, 2011). However, when participation depends on unobservable factors, including
directly on the treatment effect, adjusting for differences in observable characteristics may be
insufficient.In the context of instrumental variables estimation with heterogenous treatment
effects, as in Imbens and Angrist (1994), Heckman et al (2006) refer to this possibility as
“essential heterogeneity.”2
    Like Nyugen et al (2017), we observe that even when participation is driven by unob-
servable variables, under a common support assumption there exist weights which deliver the

     In medicine, for example, the efficacy of drugs is tested on study participants who may differ systematically
from the general population of possible users. See Stuart, Cole, Bradshaw and Leaf (2011) for discussion.
Within economics, Allcott (2015) shows that OPower treatment effects are larger in early sites than later sites,
and that adjustments for selection on observables do not close this gap.

     We use “participation” for the decision to take part in the randomized trial, rather than “selection,” to
distinguish the decision to join the trial from the treatment decision. We thank Peter Hull for suggesting this
terminology.

average treatment effect – or any other moment of the data – for the population as a whole.
While these weights are in general unknown, they provide an natural lens through which to
consider external validity. In particular, the bias in the experimental estimate of the average
treatment effect, as an estimate for the average treatment effect in the population as a whole,
is given by the covariance of the individual-level treatment effect with these weights.
   While the covariance of the treatment effect with the weights is a natural statistical object,
its magnitude is difficult to directly interpret. In our main result, we therefore model the
participation decision. We derive an approximation which relates external validity bias to
the role of unobservables in the participation decision. This approximation uses an estimate
of bias under the assumption that the participation decision is due entirely to observable
variables; we refer to this bias as the “participation on observables” bias. We show that the
ratio of the true bias to this participation on observables bias is inversely proportional to the
fraction of the covariance between the variables driving participation and the treatment effect
which is explained by the observables.
   In the special case where participation is driven directly by the treatment effect, this
implies that the ratio of total bias to participation on observables bias is inversely proportional
to the R2 from regressing individual-level treatment effects on the observables. Thus, in this
setting our results highlight that the degree of private information about the treatment effect
determines the extent of external validity bias.
   Our approximations yield expressions which involve unobservables, and so cannot be es-
timated from the data. Moreover, the plausible importance of unobservables relative to ob-
servables will vary across applications, not least depending on the available covariates. Thus
the point of our analysis is not to deliver definitive estimates or universal bounds, but instead
to reframe the question of external validity in terms of the relative importance of observable
and unobservable variables in a given context, since these are objects about which researchers
may have plausible intuition or priors.
   To provide some intuition for the procedure we suggest, consider again the Bloom et
al (2015) example discussed above. Through the experimental data collection the authors
observe some demographic characteristics of the overall population of workers which can be
compared to the population who volunteer for the experiment. The first step in our procedure
is to formally adjust the treatment effect estimate to reflect differences in these observable

                                                3
features; we discuss a straightforward regression-based approach for this. The second step is
to calculate bounds on the population average treatment effect by combining the adjustment
for observable differences with an assumption about the relative importance of the observable
and unobservable features in driving the participation decision. In this case, the adjustment
would be informed by our sense of how much private information people have about their
relative productivity at home.
   Our results rely on approximations which are developed by considering cases where the
bias is small. In a simulation example based on Muralidharan and Sundararaman (2011),
however, we find that these approximations remain reliable in an example with nontrivial
participation on unobservables.
   To further illustrate, we apply our framework to four experimental papers: Attanasio,
Kugler and Meghir (2011), Bloom et al (2015), Dupas and Robinson (2013), and Olken,
Onishi, and Wong (2014). In each case we discuss the settings and describe how we might
identify data from the relevant target population. We then discuss the robustness of the
results to concerns about external validity.
   Our results relate to a number of previous literatures, including those studying selection
on observables (e.g. Hellerstein and Imbens, 1999; Hotz et al, 2005; Cole and Stuart, 2010;
Stuart et al, 2011; Imai and Ratkovic, 2014; Dehejia, Pop-Eleches and Samii, 2015; Hartman,
Grieve, Ramsahai and Sekhon, 2015), and propensity score reweighting (e.g. Hahn 1998 and
Hirano, Imbens and Ridder 2003). Olsen et al (2013) derive expressions for the bias arising
from participation on unobservables, while Alcott (2015), Bell et al (2016), and Chyn (2016)
document such biases in applications.
   Like us, Gechter (2015) and Nyugen et al (2017) provide methods for sensitivity analysis
when we are concerned about participation on unobservables. While our bounds assume limits
on the role of private information, Gechter (2015) assumes limits of the level of dependence
between the individual outcomes in the treated and untreated states, and Nyugen et al (2017)
assume limits on the mean of the unobservables. Hence, both approaches are complementary
to ours. Bell and Stuart (2016) emphasize the importance of considering external validity in
practice and discuss a variety of methods which may be used to evaluate threats to external
validity, while Olsen and Orr (2016) discuss strategies which may be used in the design of an
experiment to improve external validity.

                                               4
   Our analysis builds on the literature on structural models for policy evaluation, reviewed
in Heckman and Vytlacil (2007a) and Heckman and Vytlacil (2007b). We follow this literature
in using a threshold crossing latent-index model to represent the participation decision, and
similar to Vytlacil (2002) we show that this model is not restrictive. While the primary focus
of this literature has been on instrumental variables models, the form of participation we
consider is allowed by the general frameworks of Heckman and Navarro (2007) and Heckman
and Vytlacil (2007a).
   A particularly active recent strand of the structural policy evaluation literature considers
external validity in instrumental variable settings using the marginal treatment effect (MTE)
approach (see, for example, Brinch et al (2016), Kline and Walters (2016), Kowalski (2016),
and Mogstad et al (2017)). In contrast to these papers we are interested in applications where
there is perfect compliance with the assigned treatment, but there is an ex ante participation
decision. As a result there are no “always takers” in the settings we consider, which complicates
direct application of the MTE approach as in e.g. Brinch et al (2016). On the other hand, in
standard IV settings MTE approaches take advantage of information in the data we do not
use and so may deliver sharper conclusions.
   Our approach is likewise related to the literature on sensitivity analysis, reviewed by
Rosenbaum (2002), that supposes that there is an unobserved variable which influences selec-
tion into treatment. While we consider the decision to participate in the experiment, rather
than selection into treatment, it seems likely that the methods studied in this literature could
be extended to our setting. Related approaches include Altonji Elder and Taber (2005) and
Oster (forthcoming). Finally we also relate, more distantly, to the recent literature on external
validity in regression discontinuity settings (Bertanha and Imbens, 2014; Angrist and Rokka-
nen, 2015; Rokkanen, 2015). This link, along with the connection to methods for instrumental
variables settings, is discussed further in Section 7.
   In the next section, we briefly discuss the sorts of the external validity problems we aim to
address. Following that, we introduce the setting we consider and give sufficient conditions for
the existence of weights which recover the average treatment effect in the target population.
Section 4 develops our main approximation result. Section 5 discusses implementation of
our approach and illustrates in a constructed example based on data from Muralidharan and
Sundararaman (2011). Section 6 details our applications, while Section 7 discusses extensions

                                                5
of our results and Section 8 concludes.


2     Scope of Problem

Before introducing our framework, it is useful to be explicit about the range of problems to
which we hope to speak. To fix ideas, we first discuss two broad types of studies where we
expect our approach to be useful. We then briefly discuss the kinds of external validity issues
our approach is well-suited to address in the settings.


2.1   Settings

Experiments with a Participation Margin In many experimental settings there is an
explicit choice by participants to take part in the study. Quite often the treatment offered
is only available through the study. Examples include Attanasio, Kugler and Meghir (2011)
and Gelber, Ibsen and Kessler (2016) on job training, Bloom et al (2015) on working from
home, and Muraldiharan et al (2017) on computer-based tutoring. A key feature of these
experiments is that a broad population is offered the chance to be in the experiment, and
only those who volunteer are included in the randomization set. The estimates derived from
such experiments are therefore valid for the sample who choose to take part, but may not be
valid for the overall population. This is of particular concern if, for example, we think people
are more likely to participate when they expect a large treatment effect.


Experiments with Selected Locations or Units A second group of experiments are
those in which researchers select a set of areas or treatment units (schools, villages, etc)
in which to run their experiment, and the locations are selected non-randomly. Examples
include Muraldiharan and Sundararaman (2011) on teacher performance pay, Jensen (2012)
on education and job opportunities, Olken et al (2014) on block grants, and Alcott (2015)
on Opower. In contrast to the above, in these settings there is no individual participation
margin, and locations typically do not select themselves into the study. Nevertheless, the
selection of locations is often non-random in ways that may influence the results.     As with
individual participation decisions, this concern is particularly acute when we think researchers
select units based in part on their predictions for the treatment effect.

2.2   Types of External Validity

Having run an experiment of the sort described above, there are many external validity ques-
tions one could ask. We may wonder about extrapolation to a random sample, or to the full
population, or more broadly to other locations or time periods. We will briefly discuss the
role of our approach in addressing each of these extrapolation problems.


Extrapolation to Random Sample Our approach is most directly applicable if we want
to extrapolate from an experimental sample to a similarly sized random sample. This may be
relevant if, for example, one planned a policy where a treatment would be offered to employees
randomly rather than allowing them to select into it.


Extrapolation to Full Population In many settings our approach is also suited to con-
sidering extrapolation to a full population. This is a common type of external validity concern
in practice. For example, one might have evaluated a policy in a subset of locations in a state
or country and now want to extend to the whole area. Or one might have evaluated the
policy using individuals who volunteered for an experiment, and now want to extend it to all
individuals.
   A complication is that treating the entire population could introduce important general
equilibrium or spillover effects. Where such issues arise it may well be interesting to undertake
the analysis we suggest, but to accurately predict the effect of treating the full population one
will need to separately account for effects arising from the scale of treatment.


Extrapolation to Additional Locations, Circumstances Perhaps the most ambitious
external validity goals relate to extrapolation to different time periods or locations - for ex-
ample, to times with better labor market conditions or to different states. This case is beyond
the scope of our approach, since we fundamentally rely on the assumption that the trial pop-
ulation is a subset of the target population. Bates and Glennerster (2017) provide a nuanced
discussion of the extent to which one can port the results of randomized trials between loca-
tions within developing countries, while Gechter (2015) develops formal extrapolation bounds
under assumptions on the relationship between treated and untreated outcomes.
   As this discussion suggests, we view our approach as best suited to asking whether the


                                               7
results in a particular experiment are likely to extend to an overall population. As we illustrate
in our examples, this is often a question of policy interest. We turn now to developing our
theoretical framework, after which we return to implementation and applied examples.


3     Participation Decisions and Reweighting

We assume that we observe a sample of observations i from a randomized trial in some
population, and denote the distribution in this trial population by PS . We are interested in
the average treatment effect in a larger target population, whose distribution we denote by P .
In this section, we show that under mild conditions we can reweight the trial population to
match the target population. For simplicity we assume an infinite sample in developing our
theoretical results, so the distribution of observables under PS is known. Results on inference,
which account for sampling uncertainty, are developed in Section 5.1 below.
    We consider a binary treatment, with Di ∈ {0, 1} a dummy equal to one when i is treated.
We write the outcomes of i in the untreated and treated states as Yi (0) , Yi (1), respec-
tively. We assume that we also observe a vector of covariates Ci for each individual which
are unaffected by treatment. Let Xi = (Yi (0) , Yi (1) , Ci ) collect the potential outcomes and
covariates. We observe each unit in only a single treatment state, so the observed outcome
for i is
                           Yi = Yi (Di ) = (1 − Di ) Yi (0) + Di Yi (1) ,

and the observed data are (Yi , Di , Ci ) . See Imbens and Rubin (2015) for further discussion of
the potential outcomes framework.
    We assume that treatment is randomly assigned in the trial population.

Assumption 1 Under PS , Di ⊥ (Yi (0) , Yi (1) , Ci ) and E [Di ] = d for known d.

    Under Assumption 1, we can express the average treatment effect (ATE) in the trial
population as

                                                                      Di      1 − Di
             EPS [T Ei ] = EPS [Yi (1) − Yi (0)] = EPS [Ti ] , Ti =      Yi −        Yi .     (1)
                                                                      d        1−d

Since Ti can be calculated from the data, this confirms that we can estimate the trial-

                                                 8
population ATE from our experimental sample, as is well-understood.3
       Our ultimate interest is not in the trial population ATE EPS [T Ei ], but instead in the
target population ATE EP [T Ei ].4 We assume that the trial population is a subset of the
target population, and that there is a variable Si in the target population that indicates
whether individual i is also part of the trial population
                                     
                                     1
                                     
                                             if i is part of the trial population
                              Si =
                                     
                                     0      otherwise.


If the distribution of Xi under P , PX , has density pX (x) then we can write the density in
the trial population in terms of pX (x) and Si .5

Lemma 1 Let PX have density pX (x). If EP [Si ] > 0 then PX,S is absolutely continuous
with respect to PX and the density of PX,S is

                                                      EP [Si |Xi ]
                                      pX,S (Xi ) =                 pX (Xi ) .
                                                       EP [Si ]

       If we assume that Si is independent of Xi , this result implies that PX,S = PX and thus
that the distribution of Xi is the same in the trial and target populations. If, on the other
hand, Si is not independent of Xi , then we will have EPS [f (Xi )] 6= EP [f (Xi )] for some
functions f (·) . In particular, if participation is related to the treatment effect Yi (1) − Yi (0),
in general EPS [T Ei ] 6= EP [T Ei ] so the ATE in the trial population is biased as an estimate
of the ATE in the target population.
       To draw conclusions about the target population based on data in the trial population, it
is important that all values of X which are present in the target population also have some
chance of appearing in the trial population.
   3
    While we focus on random assignment of Di for simplicity, if one instead considers random assignment
                               Di ⊥ (Yi (1) , Yi (0)) |Ci and EPS [Di |Ci ] = d (Ci ) for known d (·), we can instead
conditional on covariates, with
              Di      1−Di
take Ti = d(C   i)
                   − 1−d(Ci )
                               Yi and our results below will go through. This follows from well-known results in
the literature on propensity score reweighting- see Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983).
   4
     Our analysis extends directly to other common target parameters in treatment effect settings. For example,
to calculate average treatment effects for subgroups defined based on covariates we can limit the trial and
target populations to these groups, while to calculate average
                                                           n treatmento effects on the ndistributiono function of
an outcome variable Ỹ at some y we can define Yi (0) = 1 Ỹi (0) ≤ y and Yi (1) = 1 Ỹi (1) ≤ y .
   5
     We define all densities with respect to a fixed base measure µ. µ need not be Lebesgue measure, so our
results do not require that Xi be continuously distributed.


                                                          9
Assumption 2 0 < EP [Si |Xi ] for all Xi .

       This assumption ensures that the distributions in the trial and target populations are
mutually absolutely continuous. If this assumption fails, so there are some values of Xi in the
target population which are never observed in the trial population, the reweighting approach
developed in this paper no longer applies. Even in this case, under limited deviations from
absolute continuity one could build on our results to derive bounds, though we do not pursue
this possibility.


Illustration: To develop intuition, we begin by illustrating the participation problem in
a dataset commonly used in economics: the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979
(NLSY-79). The NLSY-79 is a longitudinal panel which began with youth aged 14 to 21 in
1979 and has continued to the present. At each round data is collected on education, labor
market experiences, health, and other variables.
       The NLSY oversampled certain groups (e.g. African-Americans). Due to this sampling
scheme, moments of these data (for example, means of variables) will not be unbiased for
those moments in the full population. We use the NLSY as illustration since in these data
we observe sampling weights. These weights are intended to allow researchers to reweight the
NLSY to obtain a representative sample from the US population.6 Since the NLSY is not a
randomized trial, we take the moments of interest to be the means of demographic variables
in the data. We use the 1984 survey data for this illustration.
       In our terminology, we define the NLSY sample as our trial population, and the reweighted
representative sample as our target population. The availability of the weights makes it
possible to explicitly illustrate the reweighting calculations we develop below. 4


3.1      Reweighting Algebra

When the trial and target populations differ, Assumption 2 implies that (in principle) we can
reweight the trial population to match the target population.

   6
    The NLSY provides a number of different weights; we use the overall sampling weights, not the cross
sectional weights. One could raise concerns that the NLSY weights may not fully accurately match the overall
population. Given that our interest here is solely in illustration, however, we abstract away from these concerns.




                                                       10

Lemma 2 Under Assumption 2, for Wi =               pX,S (Xi )   and any function f (·),


                                      EP [f (Xi )] = EPS [Wi f (Xi )] .


   Lemma 2 is a well-known result (see e.g. Horvitz and Thompson, 1952), and shows that
we can recover expectations under PX by reweighting our observations from PX,S using the
                pX (Xi )
weights Wi =   pX,S (Xi ) ,   which compare the densities of the trial and target populations at each
Xi . Since Lemma 2 implies that EP [T Ei ] = EPS [Wi T Ei ] , if we observed the weights Wi we
could estimate the ATE in the target population as EPS [Wi Ti ] . The weights depend on both
the distribution in the target population and the potential outcomes, however, and so cannot
be calculated in practice.
   While unknown, the weights Wi provide a useful lens through which to consider external
validity. These weights are non-negative by construction, and taking f (·) = 1 in Lemma 2
confirms that EPS [Wi ] = 1. An immediate corollary of Lemma 2 allows us to characterize
the bias of the sample mean of f (Xi ) as an estimator for EP [f (Xi )] . A closely related result
was previously derived in Olsen et al (2013).

Corollary 1 For any function f (·), under Assumption 2 we have


                         EPS [f (Xi )] − EP [f (Xi )] = −CovPS (Wi , f (Xi )) .

                             h        i
If we further assume that EPS f (Xi )2 and EPS Wi2 are finite, then
                                                 



            EPS [f (Xi )] − EP [f (Xi )] = −σPS (Wi ) ρPS (Wi , f (Xi )) σPS (f (Xi )) ,          (2)


for σPS (Ai ) and ρPS (Ai , Bi ) the standard deviation of Ai and the correlation of Ai and Bi
under PS , respectively.

   The final term in equation (2), σPS (f (Xi )) , measures the standard deviation of f (Xi ) in
the trial population. The correlation ρPS (Wi , f (Xi )) measures the strength of the relationship
between the weights and f (Xi ), and can loosely be viewed as measuring the extent to which
the participation decision loads on f (Xi ) . By definition this quantity is smaller than one
in absolute value. Lastly, the standard deviation σPS (Wi ) can be viewed as measuring how

                                                     11
much the trial and target populations differ along any dimension of Xi , since the bounds on
ρPS (Wi , f (Xi )) imply that for all functions f (·),


                      |EP [f (Xi )] − EPS [f (Xi )]| ≤ σPS (Wi ) σPS (f (Xi )) .                  (3)


Thus, the mean of f (Xi ) in the target population can differ from its mean in the trial popu-
lation by at most σPS (Wi ) times its standard deviation.
   The same decomposition applies to any collection of moments. In particular, suppose
we are interested in the mean of a vector of functions f1 (Xi ), f2 (Xi ), ..., fq (Xi ) in the target
population. Applying Corollary 1 to each element, we obtain


            EPS [f1 (Xi )] − EP [f1 (Xi )] = −σPS (Wi ) ρPS (Wi , f1 (Xi )) σPS (f1 (Xi ))
            EPS [f2 (Xi )] − EP [f2 (Xi )] = −σPS (Wi ) ρPS (Wi , f2 (Xi )) σPS (f2 (Xi ))
                                                 ..                                               (4)
                                                  .
           EPS [fq (Xi )] − EP [fq (Xi )] = −σPS (Wi ) ρPS (Wi , fq (Xi )) σPS (fq (Xi )) .

A key feature of this decomposition is that the standard deviation of the weights, σPS (Wi )
appears in all rows. This again reflects the fact that σPS (Wi ) measures the degree to which
the trial and target populations differ along any dimension of Xi .


Illustration (continued): In the NLSY we observe the weights Wi . Therefore, we can
calculate all terms in the decomposition (4). In particular, we consider this decomposition
when taking f (Xi ) to measure race (share white), high school completion, and gender (share
male).
   The first two columns of Table 1 report the trial and target population means for these
variables in the NLSY. The final three columns show the elements of the bias decomposition in
equation (2). The difference in means for each variable is the product of these three elements.
The differences between trial and target population means reflect the sampling structure: the
NLSY over-samples racial minority groups and individuals from lower socioeconomic status
backgrounds. There are fewer whites and fewer high school graduates in the sample than in
the overall US population. The bias is largest for race, which reflects the very high correlation
between the sampling weights and race.


                                                 12
    In contrast to race and education, there is little bias in the gender variable since the sample
is not selected on gender. This lack of selection is reflected in the very small correlation
between this variable and the weights. As noted above the standard deviation of the weights
is the same in all rows, since this is a measure of selection on any dimension. 4
    While the decomposition (2) does not deliver precise conclusions about the degree of bias
without further restrictions, it provides a useful guide to intuition. In particular, the bias
in the trial population ATE is larger when (a) the trial and target populations differ more
in general, (b) participation decisions are more correlated with the treatment effect, and
(c) there is more variability in the treatment effect. In the next section we build on these
intuitions, introducing unobserved variables that drive participation decisions and developing
approximations which allow us to translate beliefs about the role of private information in
participation decisions to bounds on the plausible degree of external validity bias.


4    Bias Approximations

While the the results of the last section are helpful for developing intuition, to use these results
to draw quantitative conclusions about the bias of the sample average of Ti as an estimator
for EP [T Ei ] (i.e EPS [T Ei ] − EP [T Ei ]) we need to know certain properties of the weights
Wi . These weights, in turn, depend on distribution of Xi in the target population and so are
unknown in applications. In this section we develop approximate expressions for the weights
which allow us to express the bias EPS [T Ei ] − EP [T Ei ] in the trial population ATE in terms
of (a) the bias due to participation on observables and (b) the role of private information
in participation decisions. Bias from participation on unobservables can be estimated, so if
researchers have a view about the degree of private information in a given setting, they can
use these results to estimate the plausible degree of bias. Our approximations become exact
when the participation decision is nearly random, in a sense we make precise below, but we
find in the next section that they perform well in simulated examples where participation
decisions depend non-trivially on unobservables.




                                                13
4.1    Participation Model

Throughout this section we assume that in addition to Xi = (Yi (0) , Yi (1) , Ci ) , there are also
variables Ui which are unobserved by the researcher but may play a role in the participation
decision. Further, we assume that the distribution of the covariates Ci in the target population
is known (though we discuss in Section 5.1 below how we can proceed if we know only some
aspects of this distribution). If there are variables which are observed in the trial population
but whose distribution in the target population is entirely unknown, for the purposes of
analysis we include these in Ui . See Nyugen et al (2017) for alternative approaches to using
variables observed in the trial population but not the target population.
   Since we can take Ui to include (Yi (0) , Yi (1)) , it is without loss of generality to assume
that participation depends only on (Ci , Ui ) , so Si is conditionally independent of the potential
outcomes
                                   Si ⊥ (Yi (0) , Yi (1)) | (Ci , Ui ) .                          (5)

Analogous to Assumption 2, we further assume that every value of (Ci , Ui ) may appear in
the trial population, where we now strengthen this assumption by bounding the conditional
probability of participation away from zero and one.

Assumption 3 Equation (5) holds, and there exists ν > 0 such that ν < EP [Si |Ci = c, Ui = u] <
1 − ν for all (c, u).

   Assumption 3 implies Assumption 2. To develop our approximation results, it will be help-
ful to model participation using a threshold-crossing latent index model. Under Assumption
3, this is without loss of generality.

Lemma 3 Under Assumption 3 we can write


                                      Si = 1 {g (Ci , Ui ) ≥ Vi } ,                               (6)


where Vi is continuously distributed with Lipschitz density pV independently of (Ci , Ui , Yi (0) , Yi (1))
and has support equal to R, and g (Ci , Ui ) is bounded.

   This result shows that since we do not restrict the functional form of g (Ci , Ui ) , it is


                                                    14
without loss of generality to assume a latent index model.7 Thus, similar to Vytlacil (2002),
a sufficiently flexible latent index model imposes no restrictions beyond those implied by
Assumption 3. See also Vytlacil (2006). The independence condition (5) then implies that
there exist weights Wi that depend only on g (Ci , Ui ) and allow us to calculate the target-
population mean of any function f (Xi ) .

Lemma 4 Under Assumption 3, there exist weights

                                             p (Ci , Ui )
                                    Wi =                  = w (g (Ci , Ui ))
                                            pS (Ci , Ui )

for a continuously differentiable function w, such that for any function f (·)


                                      EP [f (Xi )] = EPS [Wi f (Xi )] .


    Lemma 4 builds on Lemma 2 by showing that under Assumption 3, we can take the weights
Wi to depend only on the function g (Ci , Ui ) in the latent index model. This result directly
captures the bias, but the function w (·) is unknown and depends on the data generating
process, so this result is still not directly useable in practice.


4.2    Approximate Weights

To obtain more easily interpretable expressions, we consider Taylor approximations to Wi . In
particular, since w (·) is a smooth function, Taylor expansion around EPS [g (Ci , Ui )] suggests8


                                     Wi ≈ Wi∗ = w0 + w1 g (Ci , Ui ) .


With this approximation, as in Corollary 1 we have


    EPS [f (Xi )] − EP [f (Xi )] ≈ −CovPS (Wi∗ , f (Xi )) = −w1 CovPS (g (Ci , Ui ) , f (Xi )) .             (7)
   7
     In fact, the proof shows it is without loss to assume that the error Vi is normal as in e.g. Heckman (1979).
Hence, unlike in the literature on empirical implications of the Roy model, e.g. Heckman and Honore (1990),
normality of Vi imposes no restrictions in our setting beyond those implied by Assumption 3.
   8
     First-order Taylor approximation yields w1 = w0 (EPS [g (Ci , Ui )]), w0 = w(EPS [g (Ci , Ui )]) −
w1 EPS [g (Ci , Ui )].




                                                       15
Thus, the bias in the trial-population mean of f (Xi ) is proportional to the covariance between
the participation variable g (Ci , Ui ) and f (Xi ).
   Our next result shows that this approximation becomes arbitrarily accurate when partic-
ipation is nearly random. To formalize this idea, we make the following assumption.

Assumption 4 We can write


                                      g (Ci , Ui ) = κ · h (Ci , Ui )


for a constant κ.

   For a fixed data generating process, Assumption 4 is without loss of generality, since we
can always take κ = 1 and h (Ci , Ui ) = g (Ci , Ui ) . To develop our approximations, however,
we will hold the distribution of (Xi , Ui ) in the target population, as well as the function h,
fixed and take κ to zero, so participation becomes entirely random in the limit. Assumption
4 thus specifies precisely how the participation decision approaches the fully random case.
                                                                     h        i
Proposition 1 Under Assumptions 3 and 4, for any f (Xi ) such that EP f (Xi )2 is finite


                       CovPS (Wi , f (Xi )) = CovPS (Wi∗ , f (Xi )) + O κ2 ,
                                                                          



as κ → 0. In particular, if CovP (g (Ci , Ui ) , f (Xi )) 6= 0 then

                                      CovPS (Wi , f (Xi ))
                                                            → 1.
                                      CovPS (Wi∗ , f (Xi ))

   This proposition shows that when participation is nearly random, the approximation error
in (7) vanishes. In particular, while the overall degree of bias CovPS (Wi , f (Xi )) tends to zero
as κ → 0, the approximation error vanishes even faster.
   If we apply our bias approximation (7) with f (Xi ) = T Ei equal to the treatment effect,


                      EPS [T Ei ] − EP [T Ei ] ≈ −w1 CovPS (g (Ci , Ui ) , T Ei ) ,            (8)


so the bias in the trial population ATE is approximately proportional to the covariance of the
treatment effect with g (Ci , Ui ) . Even if this covariance were known, however, this formula is

                                                    16
not usable due to the unknown constant of proportionality w1 . To eliminate this term, we
compare the true bias to the bias from participation on observables.
   Corrections for participation on observables, including Hotz et al (2005) and Stuart et
al (2011), adjust the average treatment effect for differences between the trial and target
populations in the distribution of the covariates Ci . Given enough data and a sufficiently
flexible specification, these methods consistently estimate EP [EPS [T Ei |Ci ]] , which can be
interpreted as the ATE corrected for participation on observables. In particular, this param-
eter begins with the average treatment effect conditional on each value of the covariates in
the trial population, EPS [T Ei |Ci ] , and then averages over these conditional effects using the
distribution of covariates in the target population. Since we have assumed the distribution
of covariates in the target population is known and that we observe data from a randomized
experiment in the trial population, this is a quantity we can estimate.
   If we apply our bias approximation (7) with f (Xi ) = EPS [T Ei |Ci ] , then since EPS [EPS [T Ei |Ci ]] =
EPS [T Ei ] by the law of iterated expectations, we see that


             EPS [T Ei ] − EP [EPS [T Ei |Ci ]] ≈ −w1 CovP (g (Ci , Ui ) , EPS [T Ei |Ci ])          (9)


                         = −w1 CovP (EPS [g (Ci , Ui ) |Ci ] , EPS [T Ei |Ci ])

where the equality follows from another application of the law of iterated expectations. Thus,
the correction for participation on observables (9) takes the same form as the true bias (8),
except that we consider the covariance of g (Ci , Ui ) (or EPS [g (Ci , Ui ) |Ci ]) with the conditional
average treatment effect EPS [T Ei |Ci ] rather than the true treatment effect T Ei . If we take
the ratio of the true bias to the participation on observables bias, we see that

           EP [T Ei ] − EPS [T Ei ]                 CovPS (g (Ci , Ui ) , T Ei )
                                          ≈                                                   = Φ,
       EP [EPS [T Ei |Ci ]] − EPS [T Ei ]   CovPS (EPS [g (Ci , Ui ) |Ci ] , EPS [T Ei |Ci ])

where the constant of proportionality w1 drops out and we are left with a ratio of covariances.
   While the ratio Φ may initially appear rather involved, it has an intuitive interpretation.
In particular, Φ−1 is the share of the covariance between g (Ci , Ui ) and T Ei which is explained




                                                   17
by covariates. To further draw this out, note that we can write

                       CovPS (g (Ci , Ui ) − EPS [g (Ci , Ui ) |Ci ] , T Ei − EPS [T Ei |Ci ])
             Φ=1+                                                                              .   (10)
                                CovPS (EPS [g (Ci , Ui ) |Ci ] , EPS [T Ei |Ci ])

The numerator in the second term is the covariance between the residuals from nonparamet-
rically regressing g (Ci , Ui ) and EPS [T Ei ] on the covariates Ci , while the denominator is the
covariance between the fitted values.
    If the covariates fully explain any relationship between participation decisions and treat-
ment effects, the numerator in (10) is zero and Φ = 1. For this to be the case it suf-
fices either that the unobservables Ui are uninformative about participation, so g (Ci , Ui ) =
E [g (Ci , Ui ) |Ci ], or that they are uninformative about the treatment effect, so EPS [T Ei |Ci , Ui ] =
EPS [T Ei |Ci ] . In either case, correcting for participation on observables is enough to recover
the ATE in the target population, and EP [T Ei ] = EP [EPS [T Ei |Ci ]] .
    By contrast, if private information plays a role in both participation decisions and the
treatment effect, there is scope for bias. If the covariance between the residuals is of the
same sign as that between the fitted values, we will have Φ ≥ 1. This need not be the case
in general, however, and the plausible range of values of Φ will vary across different settings
depending on the set of available covariates Ci , the plausible set of unobservables Ui , and our
beliefs about how participation is determined.


Special Case: Participation on the Treatment Effect An important special case arises
when we assume that participation decisions are based directly on the predicted treatment
effect given Ci and Ui , potentially along with some set of unrelated variables.

Assumption 5 Suppose that


                       g (Ci , Ui ) = α1 EP [T Ei |Ci , Ui ] + gC (Ci ) + gU (Ui ) ,


where EPS [gU (Ui ) |Ci ] = 0 and


                        CovPS (T Ei , gC (Ci )) = CovPS (T Ei , gU (Ui )) = 0.


    Intuitively, we can think of this as the case where participation depends on the predicted

                                                    18
treatment effect EPS [T Ei |Ci , Ui ], a function of covariates which is unrelated to the treatment
effect and, potentially, a function of unobservables which is unrelated to both the treatment
effect and the covariates. Note that if we include the potential outcomes (Yi (0), Yi (1)) among
the unobservables, EPS [T Ei |Ci , Ui ] = T Ei , so Assumption 5 allows the possibility of direct
participation on the treatment effect.
   Under Assumption 5, we obtain a simplified expression for Φ.

Lemma 5 Under Assumption 5,

                                      V arPS (EPS [T Ei |Ci , Ui ])
                                 Φ=                                 .
                                        V arPS (EPS [T Ei |Ci ])

Thus, under Assumption 5, Φ measures the variance of treatment effects predicted based on
(Ci , Ui ), relative to the variance of treatment effects predicted based on Ci alone. This can
be interpreted as a measure for the degree of private information about the treatment effect
used in participation decisions. When there is a large amount of private information the true
bias in the ATE will be much larger than the participation on observables bias EPS [T Ei ] −
EP [EPS [T Ei |Ci ]]. By contrast, when there is little private information the target-population
ATE will be close to EP [EPS [T Ei |Ci ]]. In the extreme case where participation is directly
on the treatment effect and EPS [T Ei |Ci , Ui ] = T Ei , Φ−1 measures the share of treatment
effect heterogeneity captured by the covariates, specifically the R2 from nonparametrically
regressing T Ei on Ci .
   To further explore the structure of Φ in this case, analogous to (10) we can write

                                V arPS (EPS [T Ei |Ci , Ui ] − EPS [T Ei |Ci ])
                      Φ=1+                                                      .
                                         V arPS (EPS [T Ei |Ci ])

Unlike in (10), however, the second term involves a ratio of variances and so is always positive.
Thus, under Assumption 5 we know that Φ ≥ 1 so that, up to approximation error,

                                  EP [T Ei ] − EPS [T Ei ]
                                                                 ≥ 1.
                              EP [EPS [T Ei |Ci ]] − EPS [T Ei ]

Thus, if correcting for participation on observables reduces our estimate of the target-population
average treatment effect, allowing for additional participation on unobservables implies still-


                                                 19
further reductions, and likewise for increases. We thus see that, unlike the general case, the
assumption of participation on the treatment effect delivers unambiguous predictions about
the sign of the bias from participation on unobservables.9


5     Implementation and Example

This section discusses implementation of our approach and examines performance in a con-
structed example.


5.1    Implementation

Our assumption of random assignment, Assumption 1, ensures that we can estimate the
ATE EPS [T Ei ] in the trial population. We are interested in the range of plausible values
for the ATE in the target population. To assess the plausible of bias from participation on
unobservables, we consider two distinct approaches. First, we can consider a particular value
for the ATE in the target population, t∗P , and ask how important a role private information
would have to play in participation decisions to obtain this value. Alternatively, we can
assume limits the degree of private information and calculate the implied range of ATEs.
    For both approaches, an important first step is correction for participation on observables.
Recall that the ATE corrected for participation on observables is EP [EPS [T Ei |Ci ]] . Provided
the distribution of Ci in the target population is known, to calculate this correction we only
need an estimate of EPS [T Ei |Ci ] . In this section we discuss a simple approach based on linear
regression of the treatment effect proxy Ti on functions of covariates, which can be applied
even with limited knowledge of the features of the target population. Similar linear corrections
are considered in Hotz et al (2005) to account for residual differences after matching. More
broadly, linear corrections for differences in the distribution of covariates between groups have
been widely studied - see for example Kline (2011) and references therein. In settings with
richer data on the target population, one can also apply our general approach together with
    9
      Note, further, that since the resulting expressions to not depend on g (Ci , Ui ), we can bound Φ using
properties of the treatment effect. For example, in the special case where we observe Ui in the trial population
but its distribution in the target population is unknown, we can estimate V arPS (EPS [T Ei |Ci , Ui ]) directly.
Even when Ui is unobserved in the trial population, we know that V arPS (EPS [T Ei |Ci , Ui ]) ≤ V arPS (T Ei ) ,
and so can use known bounds on V arPS (T Ei ), perhaps under assumptions on the degree of dependence between
Yi (0) and Yi (1) as in Gechter (2015), to bound Φ.



                                                       20
more sophisticated corrections for participation on observables, including matching as in Hotz
et al (2005) and propensity-score reweighting as in Stuart et al (2011).
       Given the participation on observables adjustment, we implement our two approaches
to robustness. First, taking the target value of interest as t∗P we evaluate robustness by
calculating the value of Φ sufficient to produce t∗P . A natural target value in many treatment
effect settings is zero. Let us denote the resulting Φ by Φ (t∗P ). To calculate Φ (t∗P ) , we simply
compare the implied total adjustment to the participation on observables adjustment,

                                                        t∗P − EPS [T Ei ]
                                    Φ (t∗P ) =                                      .
                                                 EP [EPS [T Ei |Ci ]] − EPS [T Ei ]

       Alternatively, also using the participation on observables adjustment, we can impose
bounds Φ ∈ [ΦL , ΦU ] . Under these bounds we know that (assuming the participation on
observables correction is positive),10 EP [T Ei ] lies in the interval


 EPS [T Ei ] + [ΦL (EP [EPS [T Ei |Ci ]] − EPS [T Ei ]) , ΦU (EP [EPS [T Ei |Ci ]] − EPS [T Ei ])] . (11)


With the participation on observables correction and the trial population ATE, EPS [T Ei ] ,
we can thus easily calculate the implied range of values for EP [T Ei ].
       The plausible range of values for Φ will depend on the context. Consider first the case
where we think that participation decisions are driven by the treatment effect along with vari-
ables unrelated to treatment, in the sense of Assumption 5. In this case Φ can be interpreted
as a measure of the degree of private information about treatment effects used in participation
decisions. For example, suppose we find that a value of Φ = 2 is necessary to eliminate a
positive result. This indicates that the unobservables would have to be at least as informative
about the treatment effect as the observables in order for the effect in the target population
to be zero.11 If we have a rich set of covariates which seems likely to be informative about
treatment effect heterogeneity relative to the plausible sources of private information, we can
  10
       If it is instead negative, then EP [T Ei ] lies in the interval

                   EPS [T Ei ] + [ΦU (EPS [T Ei |Ci ] − EPS [T Ei ]) , ΦL (EPS [T Ei |Ci ] − EPS [T Ei ])] .

  11
    In particular, if we regress the predicted treatment effects based on both unobservables and observables on
the observables alone, the R2 must be less than 0.5.




                                                             21
then conclude that our result is robust to plausible levels of private information. If, on the
other hand, the available covariates seem unlikely to be very informative about the treatment
effect, then a value of Φ = 2 may be quite plausible, suggesting that our result is not robust.
       The interpretation is similar under more general assumptions about participation deci-
sions. For example, consider a case where experimental locations were chosen on accessibility,
but we do not observe accessibility measures. In this case Φ measures the relative impor-
tance of the observables and unobservables in explaining the covariance between accessibility
and the treatment effect. If we think that our covariates suffice to construct a good proxy
for accessibility, or that they explain much more treatment effect heterogeneity than do the
plausible unobservables, then finding that a value of Φ = 2 is needed to overturn our results
should reassure us about their robustness. On the other hand, if neither of these conditions
hold we may remain concerned about external validity even if a large value of Φ is needed to
overturn our results.
       Further intuition may be provided by thinking about the share of relevant variables missed
by our observed covariates. In Appendix B.1, we describe a model where a large number of
latent factors drive treatment effects and participation decisions, and a random subset of these
are measured by Ci while the rest are measured by Ui . In this setting Φ can be interpreted
as the ratio of the total to the observed factors. In particular, Φ = 2 reflects a case where the
observed covariates capture 50% of the latent factors.12


5.1.1      Correction for Participation on Observables

To implement the approaches discussed above, we need an estimate of EP [EPS [T Ei |Ci ]] −
EPS [T Ei ] . As noted in Section 3 we can estimate EPS [T Ei ] by the sample average of Ti
as defined in (1), so the challenge is estimation of EP [EPS [T Ei |Ci ]], the ATE corrected for
participation on observables.
       In our applications below, we first estimate EPS [T Ei |Ci ] by regressing Ti on a vector of
functions of the covariates r (Ci ) whose mean EP [r (Ci )] in the target population is known,


                                             Ti = r (Ci )0 δ + ei ,
  12
    The assumptions needed for this interpretation are considerably stronger than those required for the rest of
our results. We thus regard the model yielding this result more as a way to build intuition than as a description
of a plausible data generating process.


                                                       22
where we assume r (Ci ) includes a constant. We then approximate EP [EPS [T Ei |Ci ]] by
EP [r (Ci )]0 δ. If we assume a linear model for treatment effect heterogeneity,


                                 EPS [T Ei |Ci ] = EPS [Ti |Ci ] = r (Ci )0 δ,


then this procedure exactly recovers EP [EPS [T Ei |Ci ]] . If on the other hand we consider
the linear specification as an approximation, then this procedure delivers an approximation
to EP [EPS [T Ei |Ci ]] , where the approximation error will vanish as we consider rich sets of
functions r (Ci ) .13
       An advantage of the regression approach we use in this paper is that it can be implemented
based on knowledge of EP [r (Ci )] alone, and so does not require us to know the full distribution
of Ci in the target population. In settings where more is known about the distribution of Ci
under P , however, one could also consider other methods, for example matching as in Hotz
et al (2005), or propensity score reweighting as in Stuart et al (2011). Such approaches again
yield estimates of the ATE corrected for participation on observables, EP [EPS [T Ei |Ci ]], which
can be plugged into our approach exactly as described above.


5.1.2      Inference

Thus far, we have conducted our analysis treating the distribution of observables in the trial
population as known. In applications we observe only a finite sample from the trial population,
however, and need to account for sampling uncertainty. In discussing inference we focus
on the case of simple random sampling, where treatment is assigned iid across units. For
discussion of the complications arising from other randomization schemes see Bugni, Canay
and Shaikh (2017). The development of inference results for our approach under more general
randomization schemes is an interesting question for future work.
       Under the assumption of simple random assignment, we can conduct inference using the
bootstrap.14 Bootstrap standard errors for Φ (t∗P ) become unreliable when the correction
  13
      Ideally we would include interactions and higher-order terms in r (Ci ), although this may be infeasible
given data constraints. Nonetheless, whenever possible researchers should at a minimum include linear and
squared terms in the covariates, since this will capture differences between the trial and target populations in
the means and variances of these variables. In settings with richer data one should consider even more moments
- interactions between the variables, higher moments of the distribution of each variable, etc.
   14
      Note that when we estimate the distribution in the target population from a sample, we should bootstrap
target population quantities as well in order to obtain accurate measures of uncertainty.


                                                      23
for participation on observables is close to zero, however. In this case, the denominator
in Φ (t∗P ) is almost zero, which results in problems very similar to those that arise from
weak instruments.15 In Appendix B.2 we discuss how to construct reliable confidence sets for
Φ (t∗P ). These confidence sets are close to the usual ones when the participation on observables
correction is large, but can be unbounded when it is small.
       Confidence sets for the ATE EP [T Ei ] are more straightforward. In particular, for (σ̂L , σ̂U )
bootstrap standard errors for our estimates (γ̂L , γ̂U ) of the lower and upper bounds in (11),
we can construct a (conservative) level 1 − α confidence interval for EP [T Ei ] as


                    [min {γ̂L − σ̂L cα , γ̂U − σ̂U cα } , max {γ̂L + σ̂L cα , γ̂U + σ̂U cα }] ,


for cα the two-sided level 1 − α normal critical value (e.g. 1.96 for a 95% confidence set).16
Alternatively, one can report (γ̂L , γ̂U , σ̂L , σ̂U ), which allows readers to construct the confidence
set of their choice.


5.2       Example

We illustrate our approach in an example. To ensure that we know the true bias while also
having an empirically reasonable distribution for the data, we use a constructed example
based on a real experiment.


5.2.1      Data and Empirical Approach

We base our example on data from Muralidharan and Sundararaman (2011), which is a
randomized evaluation of a teacher performance pay scheme in India. The project includes
student-level data from roughly 300 schools across the state of Andhra Pradesh. Teachers in
“incentive” schools were paid more for better student test scores, while those in control schools
were not. The primary outcome is student test scores. Muralidharan and Sundararaman
(2011) find that student test scores increase as a result of incentive pay.
  15
      The participation on observables correction EP [EPS [T Ei |Ci ]] − EPS [T Ei ] plays the same role as the
first-stage parameter in linear IV, so problems arise when this difference is close to zero relative to sampling
variability.
   16
      In fact, one can typically use a critical value smaller than cα , though more computation is required to
derive the exact value. We do this in our applications - see Appendix B.2 for details.




                                                        24
      To construct our example, we define the distribution of the target population to be the
empirical distribution in the Muralidharan and Sundararaman (2011) data. That is: although
it would also be reasonable to ask about the external validity of their results to a broader
population, for this exercise we assume that they are studying the target population and we
ask what conclusions we would draw if we observed only a selected subset. To abstract from
issues of sampling variability, we collapse the data to the school level and sample from the
data with replacement to create a large target population.
      We predict treatment effects based on school-level characteristics: average teacher edu-
cation, average teacher training, average teacher salary, average household income, a school
infrastructure index, the share of the student population who is scheduled tribe or scheduled
caste, and average teacher absence. We also include dummies for which mandal (a geographic
area) the school is in. We can think of these controls as capturing differences across areas in
how effective the program is.
      From this target population, we extract a trial population based either on the predicted
treatment effect or on area-level characteristics. This process is described in more detail in
each case below. Under both schemes the ATE in the trial population exceeds that in the
target population. Our sample construction is such that if we observed all of the school-level
characteristics in both the trial and target populations, we could recover the target population
treatment effect using the participation on observables adjustment. Our approach, then, is to
explore what happens as we treat increasingly large sets of the characteristics as unobserved.


5.2.2      Participation on Treatment Effect

We first model participation on the predicted treatment effect. We create a predicted treat-
ment effect EP [T Ei |Ci , Ui ] by defining Ti as in (1) above and regressing Ti on the full
set of controls for school-level characteristics. We include schools in the trial population if
EP [T Ei |Ci , Ui ] ≥ Vi where Vi is normally distributed with the same mean as EP [T Ei |Ci , Ui ]
and a standard deviation three times as large.17
      The ATE in the target population is 0.074.18 The ATE in the trial population is consider-
ably larger, 0.15. If we assume that we observe all the characteristics used in the participation
 17
      The mean of Vi ensures that roughly half of the target population will be in the trial population.
 18
      This is slightly smaller than the effect in the original paper since we collapse to the school level.



                                                         25
decision, the adjustment for participation on observables delivers the correct value 0.074 for
the target population ATE.
      We next consider the case where we cannot observe some of the variables used in the
participation decision. We vary the size of the subset which is unobserved, considering what
happens when we eliminate just one variable, then 10%, 20%, 30%, and 50% of the variables
(chosen at random).19 In each case we calculate the ATE correcting for participation on
observables, where there is now also participation on unobservables. We consider all possible
single-variable eliminations, while for the other cases we take 200 draws at random.
      The first column of Panel A of Table 2 shows the average participation on observables
adjusted ATE for each exclusion set. When only one covariate is treated as unobserved (the
last row in Panel A) the estimate is extremely close to the target population ATE, since the
unobservables are quite limited. As we treat larger sets as unobserved the estimate is further
from the target population ATE and closer to the trial population estimate.
      The second column of Panel A in this table reports the average value of Φ to match the
target population treatment effect for each specification. This value is largest when the largest
share of covariates is excluded. It is worth noting that the average values of Φ are quite close
to the actual ratio of the number of total covariates to the observed covariates, reflecting the
results for cases with many covariates developed in Appendix B.1.
      We can visualize the range of values Φ which generate the target population ATE, given
each set of unobservables. This is done in Figure 1. As we exclude a larger set of variables,
the range of Φ goes up, consistent with the presence of more private information in the
participation decision. These values of Φ correspond directly to the relative importance of the
observed versus unobserved covariates in predicting the treatment effect.
      To see this more directly, we calculate the ratio of the R-squared from regressing Ti on the
observed covariates to the R-squared from regressing on all the school characteristics. This
R-squared is equivalent to the variance ratio in Lemma 5, which approximates the true bias
by Proposition 1. We graph this against the value of Φ to match the true bias. Deviations
from equality arise from approximation error. Figure 2 suggests such error here is limited.
 19
      Performance in this example remains quite good even when we exclude 80% of the variables.




                                                     26
5.2.3       Participation on Other Unobsrevables

We next model a case where participation is driven by features of the data other than the
treatment effect. In particular, we imagine that we select areas based on mandal-level teacher
training. We divide the sample into quartiles based on the mandal-level average of teacher
training, and then calculate the average treatment effect within each quartile, which we use
as our g (Ci , Ui ). In practice, this puts more weight on mandals with the highest teacher
training values, and on areas in the second quartile of training. This approximates a case
where experimental locations are chosen based on average teacher training, with a preference
for teacher training levels predictive of high treatment effects.20
       Given this index g (Ci , Ui ), we include schools in the sample if g (Ci , Ui ) ≥ Vi where Vi is
normally distributed with the same mean as g (Ci , Ui ) and a standard deviation three times
as large. Although the structure of the sample construction is similar to the participation on
treatment effects case discussed above, the difference in ATEs between the trial and target
populations is less extreme. The target population ATE is again 0.074, while that in the trial
population is 0.119.
       We again consider the case where we cannot observe a subset of the variables used in the
construction of the index g (Ci , Ui ). As above, we consider varying the size of the subset which
is unobserved and calculate the same participation on observables quantities as above.
       Panel B of Table 2 replicates Panel A for this setting. When we treat larger sets as
unobserved, the estimate is further from the target population ATE, and closer to the trial
population estimate. The values of Φ are largest for the largest exclusion set, and reflect the
share of covariates missing from the observable set.
       Figure 3 plots the distribution of the values Φ that would generate the target popula-
tion ATE as we consider different sets of observables. With small exclusion sets the values
are relatively small, although with large sets of variables treated as unobserved the results
are noisier, and sometimes imply very large values of Φ to match the true treatment effect.
Figure 4, graphs the value of Φ to match the true bias against the ratio of the covariance of
g (Ci , Ui ) , EPS [T Ei |Ci , Ui ] to the covariance of EPS [g (Ci , Ui ) |Ci ] , EPS [T Ei |Ci ]; the correla-
tion is also very strong.
  20
       The effects of teacher training here is non-linear, reflecting the actual patterns in the data.

6         Applications

This section discusses a number of specific examples applying our framework to papers in
the literature. In each case, we describe the setting, our identification of a plausible target
population, and our results.


6.1        Attanasio, Kugler and Meghir (2011)

Setting Attanasio et al (2011) report results from an evaluation of a job training program
in Colombia. The program provided vocational training to poor men and women in several
cities. We focus here on the results for women since there were concerns about the validity of
the program randomization for men. The results show large positive impacts on employment,
hours and days worked, and salaries for women.
         The experimental sample consists of individuals who applied to be in the program at a
number of program centers. In many cases more people applied to be in the program than
there was space in the center, and the evaluation is based on randomizing program enrollment
among eligible individuals who chose to apply.
         As discussed in Section 2.1, Attanasio et al (2011) is representative of the broad class
of papers in which participants volunteer for a study and treatment is randomized among
volunteers.
         In this case, a possible question of interest for policy is whether it would be a good idea
to extend the vocational training program to all individuals - perhaps making it part of a
school curriculum.21 If the ATE estimated in this experiment is valid for such an expansion,
the answer is likely yes. Given the sample construction, however, it seems unlikely that the
ATE for the experimental sample is representative of that for the population as a whole. In
particular, individuals who volunteer may be those who expect vocational training to work
for them. The in-sample ATE could then be biased upwards relative to the full population
ATE.
    21
    This is an example of a setting where one may also want to consider the possible general equilibrium effects
of a broad expansion; those effects will not be captured by our adjusted estimate. By contrast, such concerns
would be less pressing if one instead considered an expansion to a small, random subset of the population.




                                                      28
Target Population Data               A key step in implementing our approach in any setting is to
identify the target population of interest and to find a data source for comparable information
on that group. In this case, a natural target population is all eligible individuals in the cities
in question. In the original paper, the authors note that there is a nationally representative
survey, the National Household Survey, which can be used to provide target population esti-
mates. The authors provide some general comparisons to this population, but do not formally
adjust for differences in population characteristics.
       The program studied in Attanasio et al (2011) is generally not open to people with degrees
beyond high school.22 We therefore exclude individuals with more than a high school education
from the target population and think of our results as a bound on the population effect for
those with a high school degree or less.23
       Appendix Table 1 reports summary statistics on the target population and the experimen-
tal group. As noted in the original paper, the target population is slightly less educated and
less likely to be employed, but similarly likely to have a formal contract conditional on employ-
ment. The differences in education reflect that a much larger share of the trial population has
completed high school. This might argue for using a dummy for high school completion in our
correction for participation on observables, rather than the mean and variance of education.
In fact, the results are very similar under both approaches.


Results Table 3 implements our calculations for each of the primary outcomes reported in
Table 4A of Attanasio et al (2011) - that is, the main results for women on which the authors
focus.24
       Column 2 shows the baseline effects, which are mostly significant and show better labor
market outcomes for the treatment group. Column 3 shows the estimate after correcting for
participation on observables as described in Section 5.1 above. This correction substantially
  22
      See http://www.dps.gov.co/que/jov/Paginas/Requisitos.aspx
  23
      We also exclude from the analysis the small number of people in the trial population who report having
more than a high school degree, who should not have been eligible (this is only 1% of the sample and makes
little difference to the trial population results). These individuals may have been included in error, have special
circumstances, or have reported their education incorrectly.
   24
      We implement this as described above, constructing Ti and regressing it on the covariates. A complication
is that there was a variation across cities and programs in the share of people randomized into the treatment
group. As the authors note, in most cases the shares were close to 50% (which is the average). If we observed
the exact share in treatment for each course we could use that in the construction of Ti. This was used in a
robustness check discussed in the original paper but we were unable to get the data from the authors. We
therefore use 50%, but note that it is an approximation.


                                                        29
attenuates the estimates; in some cases the adjusted effect is zero or negative. The primary
reason is that there is substantial treatment effect heterogeneity on education. While the
magnitude of the differences in education may seem fairly small, when scaled by the large
degree of heterogeneity on this dimension the implied treatment effect difference is substantial.
The results on increased wage and salary earnings are the least affected.
       Columns 4 and 5 show two measures of external validity. First, Column 4 reports bounds
on the target population ATE under the assumption that Φ ∈ [1, 2]. For the most part these
bounds are much less encouraging about the effectiveness of the program than are the baseline
estimates. The only exception is earnings, where the impacts seem somewhat robust. Second,
Column 5 shows the value of Φ corresponding to a zero ATE. These figures are, in some
cases, less than 1 - this implies that the unobservables would have to operate in the opposite
direction of the observables to produce an effect of zero, which as noted above in section 4.2
is ruled out if one assumes participation on the treatment effect.
       Confidence sets are reported in Columns 4 and 5. In Column 4 these are generally large,
corresponding to the relatively large adjustments. The confidence sets in Column 5, which
are mostly infinite, illustrate the fairly poor inference properties of Φ(0) in this setting. As
we discuss above this is a known issue, and is related to the problem of weak instruments.25


6.2      Bloom, Liang, Roberts, and Ying (2015)

Setting Bloom et al (2015) report results from an experiment in a Chinese firm designed
to evaluate the productivity consequences of working from home. The firm operates a call
center, so it is possible for workers to perform their duties from home.
       The design of the experiment is as follows. First, workers at the firm were informed of the
possibility of working from home and given an opportunity to volunteer for the program. Ap-
proximately 50% of them did so. Treatment was then randomized among eligible volunteers.
Eligibility was enforced only after volunteering, and was based on several criteria including
whether the individual had a private bedroom. The results suggest substantial productivity
gains - about 0.2 standard deviations on a combined productivity measure - from working
from home.
  25
   The confidence set we use here is asymptotically optimal, so the poor performance seems to reflect funda-
mental difficulties in conducting inference on Φ(0), rather than a poor choice of confidence set.



                                                    30
       In this case, a question of interest for the firm may be whether it would be sensible to
have many or all eligible call center employees work from home.26 If the ATE estimated in
the experiment is valid for the entire workforce, then the answer is likely yes. In fact, given
the expense of running an office, this might be a good policy even if the ATE on productivity
were zero or slightly negative.
       Given the sample construction it seems plausible that the ATE for the experimental sample
is not representative of that for the population as a whole. Individuals may be more likely
to volunteer if they expect working from home to work for them. The in-sample ATE could
therefore be biased upwards relative to the full population ATE.


Target Population Data              It is straightforward to identify the target population for this
study: it is all workers at the firm with private bedrooms.27 Bloom et al (2015) collect some
basic characteristics for this overall population of workers. These can then be compared to
the volunteers.
       Appendix Table 2 reports summary statistics in the overall population and experimental
group. There are some differences: the volunteer group has a longer commute, is more likely
to be male, and more likely to have children. As suggested above, when we correct for
participation on observables we use these variables and allow them to enter linearly and (for
non-binary variables) squared.


Results Table 4 shows results. Column 2 shows the baseline effect for the primary outcome
in the paper, which is the increase in overall performance. Column 3 shows estimates from
the regression-based correction for participation on observables. This slightly decreases the
effect, from 0.22 to about 0.20.28
       Columns 4 and 5 again show the two measures of external validity. Column (4) illustrates
  26
     Again, however, there could be additional impacts of such a major expansion which would require additional
attention.
  27
     Note that the restriction to private bedrooms arises because eligibility for the program is limited to this
group. It is therefore appropriate to consider the target population as all eligible workers, rather than all
workers.
  28
     We implement this adjustment as described above, by regressing the constructed Ti on the observables.
An alternative approach is to regress the outcome on covariates for the treatment group and the control group
separately and difference the predicted values. Assuming successful randomization, these will yield similar
results. In this case there is some imbalance across treatment and control in commute time - specifically, the
treatment group has longer commutes on average than the control group. As a result, these two approaches
yield slightly different coefficients. In Appendix Table 3 we report these results using the alternative approach.


                                                       31
the bounds on the effect if we assume Φ ∈ [1, 2]. The lower bound is still well above zero, and
the confidence interval indicates a significant effect. Column 5 shows the value of Φ which
corresponds to an ATE of zero; this figure is a bit above 12, implying that the unobservables
would have to be substantially more important than the observables in order to deliver an
ATE of zero in the population.


6.3      Dupas and Robinson (2013)

Setting Our third application uses data from Dupas and Robinson (2013), who analyze the
impact of informal savings technologies on investments in preventative healthcare and vulner-
ability to health shocks. The experiment, run in Kenya, includes four treatment arms, each
of which provided a different technology (a safe box for money, a locked box, and two health-
specific savings technologies). The outcomes include investments in health and measures of
whether people have trouble affording medical treatments.
       The experiment finds significant results for some combinations of outcomes and treatments.
We focus on the combinations of outcomes and treatments which the authors suggest should
be significant based on their theory. The first two columns of Table 5 list these combinations.
Most of these effects are significant at conventional levels (see Table 3 in Dupas and Robinson
(2013)).
       The experiment was run through Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs),
and participants were required to be enrolled in a ROSCA at the start.29 External validity
concerns again arise here because of the sampling frame: ROSCA participants are likely to
be a non-representative group. Most notably, ROSCAs are designed in part as a savings and
investment mechanism, so participants may differ on characteristics related to their respon-
siveness to savings products.
       From a policy standpoint, however, there is interest in how to increase savings behaviors
broadly, not just among ROSCA participants. We would therefore like to evaluate the external
validity of these results relative to the overall population.
       To frame this in our language, our concern is that there is some feature - say, interest in
  29
    ROSCAs are informal savings groups common in many developing countries. Although the setup varies,
typically these groups come together on a regular basis and contribute to a common pot of money which is
taken home by one member on a rotating basis.




                                                  32
saving - which influences ROSCA participation and also co-varies with the treatment effect.
We observe some correlates of this feature, but there is further private information among
the participants. The question is how important this private information would have to be
in order to produce ATEs equal to zero. We can use our approach to calculate sensitivity
values Φ for each outcome-treatment pair in the data. These can be interpreted as measuring
how much of the covariance between the participation variable and the treatment effect would
need to be due to private information in order to eliminate the result. As above, higher values
point to a more robust result.


Target Population Data           Column 1 of Appendix Table 4 shows summary statistics for
the sample in Dupas and Robinson (2013). To perform an adjustment for participation on
observables, it is necessary to observe the same variables for people who do not participate
in ROSCAs. In an appendix to Dupas and Robinson (2013), the authors provide evidence
on differences between ROSCA participants and non-participants using a second survey run
in the same area. These differences can be used to construct population-level values for the
covariates. These are shown in Column 2 of Appendix Table 4. We use these to adjust for
participation on observables, where we allow the variables listed to enter linearly.


Results Table 5 shows the results. For most of the analyses adjustment for participation
on observables moves the coefficient towards zero, suggesting the patterns of participation are
such that those with larger treatment effects are more likely to be in the sample. However,
there is substantial variation across the outcome-treatment pairs in the degree of sensitivity.
For example, the relationship between the treatments and the variable measuring whether
people have trouble affording treatment is fairly robust. The participation on observables
adjustment is extremely small and in one case goes in the opposite direction, suggesting that
adjustments for participation on observables actually increase the ATE. By contrast, the
results for investment in health show larger adjustments.
   These differences are reflected in the metrics of external validity in Columns 5 and 6. The
bounds in Column 5 for the trouble affording treatment outcome generally remain close to the
baseline effect. In contrast, the bounds for investments in health suggest less robust impacts.




                                              33
6.4      Olken, Onishi, and Wong (2014)

Setting Olken et al (2014) report results from an experiment in Indonesia which provides
block grants to villages to improve maternal health and child education. A subset of the grants
include performance incentives, and the paper reports data on a wide variety of outcomes.
The primary conclusion of the paper is that these grants have little or no effect on outcomes.
The estimates are fairly small and mostly insignificant.
       To implement the experiment, the government approached provinces, giving them the op-
portunity to take part. Five provinces volunteered to participate. Within these provinces, the
richest 20% of districts were excluded from participation, as were the 28% of districts which
did not have access to the rural infrastructure project through which the program was admin-
istered. Among the remaining districts, 20 were randomly selected, and sub-districts within
these were eligible for the program if they were less than 67% urban. There were 300 eligible
sub-districts and these were randomized into one of two treatment groups - with or without
incentives - or the control group. The experimental sample is clearly not a simple random
sample, and as the authors note the sub-districts eligible for inclusion in the experiment differ
on some observable dimensions from the overall population.


Target Population Data To apply our approach, we need to identify a set of characteristics
from the target population. The concern is that the sub-districts in the experiment are not
representative of all of Indonesia. We therefore focus on sub-district-level characteristics. The
data collected in the experiment did not include comparable information about the target
population. However, we can extract these data from a nationally representative survey of
Indonesia (SUSENAS) which we merge at the level of the sub-district with the data used
in Olken et al (2014). The target population corresponds to all of Indonesia.30 This is an
example of how our approach might be used in a setting like this, where an experiment includes
a subset of locations within a country or region, and external data is available for the entire
region.
  30
    The set of covariates we use do not include those on which the sample is constructed, so the common support
assumption remains plausible here. For example, as shown in Appendix Table 5 the differences between the
means of the covariates in the sample and target population are of the same order as the variability within the
sample.




                                                      34
Results Appendix Table 5 shows summary statistics both for Indonesia overall and for the
sub-districts in the study. Relative to the country overall, households in districts in the sample
are more likely to have a dirt floor and to receive cash transfers (consistent with having lower
income on average) but also have higher rates of vaccination and contraceptive use.
    Table 6 shows the results. As noted, the baseline impact is insignificant for most outcomes.
However, a notable feature of this setting is that in all cases but one correction for participation
on observables increases the estimated size of the effect. Consequently, most of the sensitivity
measures in Column 5 are negative. Under our baseline assumptions, these results suggest
that the effects in the trial population may actually understate the overall effects in the target
population in many cases.
    This is made most concrete by Column 4 of Table 6, which shows bounds under the
assumption that Φ ∈ [1, 2]. For all of the outcomes, the bounds are substantially more en-
couraging about the impact of the experiment than are the baseline effects. Based on the
confidence intervals, many of these adjusted effects are significantly different from zero. In
this case, our analysis casts doubt on the conclusion that this intervention does not change
outcomes. It may simply be that the population used for the trial is not the one for which
this intervention was most effective.


7    Discussion

While our primary focus in this paper is on external validity of ATEs estimated from random-
ized trials, one could potentially apply analogous approaches in regression discontinuity and
instrumental variables settings. In this section we briefly discuss these possibilities, as well as
application of our results to estimate non treatment-effect moments in the target population.


Regression Discontinuity Regression discontinuity estimates are identified from behavior
at the discontinuity; this leads to concern that treatment effects may differ for individuals
distant from the discontinuity (Bertanha and Imbens, 2014; Angrist and Rokkanen, 2015;
Rokkanen, 2015). Consider a sharp RD design with running variable Ri for individual i,
where Di = 1 {Ri ≥ r∗ } is an indicator for Ri exceeding some threshold r∗ . The regression
discontinuity approach estimates the treatment effect by a regression of Yi on Di in a small


                                                35
neighborhood of Ri around r∗ . We can define the observations in an infinitesimal neighborhood
of r∗ as the trial population. The target population is the population for the full range of
Ri. We can then treat this problem as in the experimental case above.31 Note, however, that
relative to approaches proposed in the literature, our approach does not exploit additional
structure from the regression discontinuity setting and so may yield less precise results.


Instrumental Variables The central component of the LATE critique is that instrumental
variables approaches identify the ATE and other quantities only in the population of compliers,
which may differ from the population of interest. In the language of this paper, we can
define PS as the distribution in the population of compliers and P as the distribution in the
overall population, including compliers, never takers and always takers. It is then possible to
proceed in the same way as above. Unlike recent work on external validity in instrumental
variables models by Kowalski (2016), Brinch et al ( 2017), and Mogstad et al (2017), however,
our approach again does not exploit the additional structure imposed by the instrumental
variables setting, and so again may yield less precise results.


Non-Treatment Effect Moments We focus on cases where the unknown moment of
interest in the target population is an ATE. However, as should be clear from the development
of the theory in Section 3, our approach is not limited to estimating ATEs. Of particular
interest may be cases where the object of interest is the mean of some variable in the target
population.
      An example of this sort is polling data: surveys collect voting intentions in a trial popu-
lation and the object of interest is the voting intentions in a target population. It is common
to reweight polling data to match observable demographics in the target population. Our
approach could be used in concert with such reweighting to think systematically about possi-
ble participation on unobservables (for example: people who respond to polling calls may be
more passionate about the election, or have a lower value of time).
 31
      For our absolute continuity assumption (Assumption 2) to hold, Ci must not include Ri .

8    Conclusion

This paper considers the problem of external validity when the trial population for a study
differs from the target population of interest. We focus on the case where participation in
the trial population is driven, at least in part, by characteristics which are unobserved by
the researcher. We analyze this problem through the lens of reweighting. We show that this
framework can be used to bound the target population moments under assumptions about
the relative importance of observables and unobservables in explaining participation.
    Our approach is straightforward to implement. The only added data requirement beyond
what would be used in the main analysis in a paper is knowledge of some characteristics of the
target population. In many cases we could use, for example, demographic variables, where the
moments in the target population are available from standard public datasets. In designing
experiments going forward the range of application for this technique might be improved by
either collecting some minimal data on a target population or by structuring data collection
in the trial population to ensure comparability with known features of the target population.

Notes: This table illustrates the evidence from the constructed example in Section 4. The sample is constructed based
either on the predicted treatment effect (Panel A) or the Mandal-level average of teacher training (Panel B). We then
calculate the average value for Φ which would match the target population treatment effect, treating different sets of the
covariates as unobserved.

Appendix A: Proofs
Proof of Lemma 1 This result is immediate from Bayes Theorem. Note, in particular,
that for any measurable set A,
                                                       Z
               P rPS {Xi ∈ A} = P rP {Xi ∈ A|Si = 1} =   pX (x|Si = 1) dµ
                                                                      A

while by Bayes Theorem we can take

                                                     EP [Si |Xi = x]
                                pX (x|Si = 1) =                      pX (x) .
                                                        EP [Si ]

Thus,
                                                      EP [Si |Xi = x]
                                                 Z
                           P rPS {Xi ∈ A} =                           pX (x) dµ.

Proof of Lemma 2 Assumption 2 implies that PX is absolutely continuous with respect
to PX,S , and the density of PX with respect to PX,S is given by ppX,S
                                                                    X
                                                                       . The result follows
immediately. 2

Proof of Corollary 1 By the definition of the covariance,

                                   EP [f (Xi )] = EPS [Wi f (Xi )]
                            = CovPS (f (Xi ) , Wi ) + EPS [f (Xi )] EPS [Wi ] .

As noted in the text, however, EPS [Wi ] = 1 by Lemma 2, so the result follows. 2

Proof of Lemma 3 Let Vi ∼ N (0, 1) , noting that this distribution satisfies the conditions
assumed in the Lemma. Let g (Ci , Ui ) = FN−1 (EP [Si |Ci = c, Ui = u]) , for FN−1 the standard
normal inverse cdf, and note that P r {g (Ci , Ui ) ≥ Vi |Ci , Ui } = EP [Si |Ci = c, Ui = u] by con-
struction. Note, finally, that

                                   FN−1 (ν) ≤ g (Ci , Ui ) ≤ FN−1 (1 − ν)

by construction, which completes the proof.2

Proof of Lemma 4 If we apply Lemma 2 with (Ci , Ui ) in place of Xi , we see that for any
function f (Ci , Ui ) ,

                                                              p(C,U ) (Ci , Ui )
                                                                                             
           EP [f (Ci , Ui )] = EPS [Wi f (Ci , Ui )] = EPS                        f (Ci , Ui ) .
                                                             p(C,U ),S (Ci , Ui )

Moreover, from Lemma 1 with (Ci , Ui ) in place of Xi , we see that

                p(C,U ) (Ci , Ui )      EPS [Si ]          1 − E [FV (g (Ci , Ui ))]
        Wi =                        =                    =                           = w (g (Ci , Ui ))
               p(C,U ),S (Ci , Ui )   EPS [Si |Ci , Ui ]     1 − FV (g (Ci , Ui ))


                                                      50
for FV the distribution function of Vi . Our assumptions imply that w (·) is continuously
differentiable, as desired.
    To complete the proof, note that since (Yi (0) , Yi (1)) ⊥ Si |Ci , Ui , for all f (·) we have

                               EPS [f (Xi ) |Ci , Ui ] = EP [f (Xi ) |Ci , Ui ] .

Thus,

        EPS [w (g (Ci , Ui )) f (Xi )] = EPS [w (g (Ci , Ui )) EP [f (Xi ) |Ci , Ui ]] = EP [f (Xi )] ,

which completes the proof. 2

Proof of Proposition 1 We first show that

                        CovPS (Wi , f (Xi )) = CovPS (Wi∗ , f (Xi )) + O κ2 .
                                                                           


Recall from the proof of Lemma 4 that

                                           1 − E [FV (κ · h (Ci , Ui ))]
                                    Wi =                                 ,
                                             1 − FV (κ · h (Ci , Ui ))

where only the denominator depends on h (Ci , Ui ).

Mean-Value Expansion of Wi : For brevity of notation, let hi = h (Ci , Ui ) . Let us consider
a mean-value expansion of Wi around EPS [hi ] :

                1 − EP [FV (κ · hi )]    1 − EP [FV (κ · hi )]             ∗
         Wi =
                1 − FV (κ · EPS [hi ])
                                       +                ∗   2 κ · fV (κ · hi ) (hi − EPS [hi ]) ,
                                          (1 − FV (κ · hi ))

for h∗i a value between EPS [hi ] and hi . Note that Wi∗ is of the same form, but substitutes
EPS [hi ] for h∗i . Since Vi is continuously distributed, for any ε > 0 there exists κε such that
for all κ ∈ [0, κε ] ,
                          P rP {FV (κ · hi ) ∈ [FV (0) − ε, FV (0) + ε]} = 1.
Thus, for such κ we know that

                              1 − EP [FV (κ · hi )]  1 − EP [FV (κ · hi )]
                                                 2 ≤                       .
                                             ∗
                               (1 − FV (κ · hi ))     (1 − FV (0) − ε)2

If we consider the difference
                                                Wi − Wi∗ =
                                                                                            !
  1 − EP [FV (κ · hi )]                       1 − EP [F V (κ · hi )]

   (1 − FV (κ · h∗i ))2                     (1 − FV (κ · EPS [hi ]))2




                                                      51
note that this is bounded in absolute value by
                                                         
                 1−EP [FV (κ·hi )]    1−EP [FV (κ·hi )]
                                2 −                     2   κ · fV (κ · h∗i ) (hi − EPS [hi ])
                 (1−FV (κ·h∗i ))    (1−FV (κ·EPS [hi ]))
                 1−EP [FV (κ·hi )]

               (1−FV (κ·EPS [hi ]))

The fact that fV (v) is Lipschitz implies that for κ ∈ [0, κε ] the second term is bounded in
absolute value by
                          1           2                  2   2                   2

                  (1 − FV (0) − ε)

for K the Lipschitz constant and K2 another constant. For the first term, note that another
mean-value expansion yields

1 − EP [FV (κ · hi )]   1 − EP [FV (κ · hi )]       1 − EP [FV (κ · hi )]              
                                                                                           ∗
                      −                         = 2                       κ·fV   κ · h̃i (hi − EPS [hi ])
 (1 − FV (κ · h∗i ))2 (1 − FV (κ · EPS [hi ]))2      (1 − FV (κ · h∗i ))3

for h̃i a value between h∗i and EPS [hi ]. Since fV (v) is Lipschitz and integrates to one we know
that it it bounded above by K, and thus that the first term is bounded in absolute value by

                               1 − EP [FV (κ · hi )] 2 2              2
                                                3 κ K (hi − EPS [hi ]) .
                                (1 − FV (0) − ε)

Thus, we see that
                                      |Wi − Wi∗ | ≤ κ2 K ∗ (hi − EPS [hi ])2
for a constant K ∗ .
    Next, for some function f (Xi ) , let us consider the approximation error

               CovPS (Wi , f (Xi )) − CovPS (Wi∗ , f (Xi )) = CovPS (Wi − Wi∗ , f (Xi ))

                     = EPS [(Wi − Wi∗ ) f (Xi )] − EPS [Wi − Wi∗ ] EPS [f (Xi )] .
Using our bounds above, for κ ∈ [0, κε ] the first term is bounded in absolute value by
                                        h                         i
                          κ2 K ∗ · EPS (hi − EPS [hi ])2 |f (Xi )| ,
                                           h                 i
while the second is bounded by κ2 K ∗ · EPS (hi − EPS [hi ])2 |EPS [f (Xi )]| .
   This almost completes the argument, except that these terms we have used as bounds
themselves depend on κ, since they are calculated in the target population. Thus, we next
show that these terms are well-behaved for small κ.

Completing the proof of first statement: Combing these results, we see that under our
assumptions above,
                         CovPS (Wi − Wi∗ , f (Xi )) = O κ2
                                                           

as κ → 0.


Proof of Second Statement             We next show that
                                      CovPS (Wi , f (Xi ))
                                                            → 1.
                                      CovPS (Wi∗ , f (Xi ))

By the argument above we know that

                     CovPS (Wi , f (Xi ))       CovPS (Wi , f (Xi ))
                                           =                                .
                     CovPS (Wi∗ , f (Xi ))   CovPS (Wi , f (Xi )) + O (κ2 )

   Next, note that by Corollary 1,

                      CovPS (Wi , f (Xi )) = EP [f (Xi )] − EPS [f (Xi )] ,

which we can re-write as
                                                                         
                                          1 − FV (κ · hi )
                           EP        1−                              f (Xi ) .
                                        1 − EP [FV (κ · hi )]

Note that the assumption that fV (·) is Lipschitz, together with the fact that it is positive

                                                  53
and integrates to one, implies that it is bounded. The dominated convergence theorem thus
             ∂
implies that ∂κ EP [FV (κ · hi )] = EP [hi fV (κ · hi )] , and that

    ∂    1 − FV (κ · hi )          hi fV (κ · hi )        1 − FV (κ · hi )
                             =−                      +                         EP [hi fV (κ · hi )] .
    ∂κ 1 − EP [FV (κ · hi )]    1 − EP [FV (κ · hi )] (1 − EP [FV (κ · hi )])2

Since this quantity is bounded for small κ, another application of the dominated convergence
theorem implies that
                                    ∂
                                      CovPS (Wi , f (Xi )) =
                                   ∂κ
                                                                                      
                  hi fV (κ · hi )        1 − FV (κ · hi )
       EP                          −                         EP [hi fV (κ · hi )] f (Xi ) ,
              1 − EP [FV (κ · hi )] (1 − EP [FV (κ · hi )])2
and thus that CovPS (Wi , f (Xi )) is continuously differentiable in κ on a neighborhood of zero.
Evaluating this derivative at κ = 0 yields
                                                                                       
       ∂                                        hi fV (0)         EP [hi fV (0)]
          CovPS (Wi , f (Xi ))|κ=0 = EP                       −                    f (Xi ) .
      ∂κ                                     1 − EP [FV (0)] 1 − EP [FV (0)]

Thus, we see that this derivative is nonzero so long as hi is correlated with f (Xi ) and fV (0) 6=
0, which we have already assumed. The result follows immediately. 2

Proof of Lemma 5 Note that by the law of iterated expectations and the fact that
EP [T Ei |Ci , Ui ] = EPS [T Ei |Ci , Ui ] ,

                           EPS [g (Ci , Ui ) |Ci ] = α1 EPS [T Ei |Ci ] + gC (Ci ) .

Thus, by another application of the law of iterated expectations

CovPS (EPS [g (Ci , Ui ) |Ci ] , EPS [T Ei |Ci ]) = α1 V arPS (EPS [T Ei |Ci ])+α1 CovPS (T Ei , gC (Ci ))

where the second term is zero by assumption. Likewise,

CovPS (g (Ci , Ui ) , EPS [T Ei |Ci , Ui ]) = CovPS (g (Ci , Ui ) , T Ei ) = α1 V arPS (EPS [T Ei |Ci , Ui ]) .

Appendix B: Additional Results
This appendix details several results mentioned in the main text. We first discuss a model,
mentioned in Section 5.1 of the main text, under which Φ can be interpreted as the share of
relevant factors captured by the observed covariates. We then provide additional details of
and justification for our inference procedures.

Appendix B.1 Interpretation of Φ Under Random Selection of Observables
To build intuition for the behavior of Φ we consider a model in which the observable covariates
represent a random subset of a larger collection of latent factors.
   Similar to Altonji et al. (2010), let us suppose that both the covariates Ci and the
unobservables Ui are driven by a set of J unobserved factors Fi , with J = dim (Ci ) + dim (Ui ).
Let us also suppose that the factors Fi are conditional mean independent, in the sense that

                          EPS [Fi,j |Fi,1 , ..., Fi,j−1 , Fi,j+1 , ..., Fi,J ] = 0

for all j, so knowing the values of the other factors doesn’t help us predict the value of the
jth factor.
    Suppose that FC,i and FU,i collect non-overlapping subsets of the factors, of size JC and
J − JC respectively, and that Ci and Ui are then generated as

                                         Ci = µC + ΛC FC,i

                                         Ui = µU + ΛU FU,i ,
where ΛC and ΛU have full rank. Note that EPS [Ui |Ci ] = µU and EPS [Ci |Ui ] = µC , so the
observables and unobservables are conditional mean independent.
   Finally, let us suppose that both g (Ci , Ui ) and EPS [T Ei |Fi ] are linear in the factors,

                                       g (Ci , Ui ) = µg + γF0 Fi

                                  EPS [T Ei |Fi ] = µT E + δT0 E Fi .
This implies that the conditional expectations of these variables given covariates are linear in
Ci as well
                               EPS [g (Ci , Ui ) |Ci ] = µ̂g + γC0 Ci ,
                                  EPS [T Ei |Ci ] = µ̂T E + γC0 Ci .
   For SC and SU are the selection matrices corresponding to FC,i and FU,i ,

                                   (FC,i , FU,i ) = (SC Fi , SU Fi ) ,

the coefficients above are defined as

                               (γC , δC ) = Λ−1         −1
                                                                          
                                             C SC γF , ΛC SC δF

and
                                              (µ̂g , µ̂T E ) =


                                                    55
                                    µg − γC0 µC , µT E − δC
                                                          0
                                                              
                                                            µC .
   Under these assumptions, the fact that Ui and Ci are orthogonal implies that

                                           γC0 ΣC δC + γU0 ΣU δU
                                    Φ=
                                                 γC0 ΣC δC

for ΣC and ΣU the variance matrices of Ci and Ui .

Random Selection of Factors: Thus far, we have treated the mapping from factors to
variables as fixed. To obtain restrictions on Φ, let us instead model the selection of observable
factors as random. In particular, suppose that non-overlapping sets of factors of size JC and
J − JC are drawn uniformly at random. Again denote vectors containing these factors by FC,i
and FU,i , respectively. Suppose that Ci and Ui are then generated as

                                             Ci = ΛC FC,i

                                            Ui = ΛU FU,i ,
where ΛC and ΛU again have full rank but may be random conditional on the set of factors
selected.
    Denoting expectations over the variable construction step by E F , note that
                                                JC 0
                                  E F γC0 ΣC δC =
                                     
                                                   γ ΣF δ F
                                                  J F
while
                             E F γC0 ΣC δC + γU0 ΣU δU = γF0 ΣF δF .
                                                     

Therefore, we see that
                                E F [γC0 ΣC δC + γU0 ΣU δU ]   J
                                         F
                                            0              =    ,
                                      E γC ΣC δC               JC
which is simply the inverse of the fraction of factors captured by the covariates. Unfortunately,
however,

                                        E F [γC0 ΣC δC + γU0 ΣU δU ]   J
                           E F [Φ] 6=            F
                                                    0              =    ,
                                              E γ C Σ C δC             JC
since the expectation of a ratio is not generally equal to the ratio of expectations.
     This difficulty resolves if we take the number of factors to be large. In particular, let
σj2 denote the variance of factor j, and γj , δj the coefficients on this factor. Suppose that
                                                                    h                 i
  σj2 , γj , δj are drawn iid from some distribution such that 0 < E F σj2 γj2 + σj2 δj2 < ∞. If we
take J → ∞ and assume that JC /J → κC , then by the weak law of large numbers and the
continuous mapping theorem
                                                     1
                                             Φ →p      ,
                                                    κC
so Φ has a natural interpretation in terms of the fraction of the factors captured by the
covariates relative to the unobservables.

Appendix B.2 Inference Details
Here we discuss inference on the quantities we propose, including confidence sets for Φ (t∗P )
which remain valid when EP [EPS [T Ei |Ci ]] − EPS [T Ei ] is small, and the justification for the
confidence set proposed for the case when we have bounds Φ ∈ [ΦL , ΦU ] .

Appendix B.2.1 Confidence Set for Φ (t∗P )
To construct a confidence set for Φ (t∗P ), let
                                           2           
                                               σ̂1 σ̂12
                                              σ̂12 σ̂22

denote the bootstrap estimate
                                for
                                  the variance-covariance matrix of consistent and asymptot-
ically normal estimates β̂1 , β̂2 for

                                                      t∗P − EPS [T Ei ]
                                                                                 
                              β1
                                       =                                                .
                              β2               EP [EPS [T Ei |Ci ]] − EPS [T Ei ]

We can use a version of the confidence set proposed by Anderson and Rubin (1949) and Fieller
(1954). In particular, define the AR statistic evaluated at φ as
                                              2                    2
                                   β̂1 − β̂2 φ            β̂1 − β̂2 φ
                        AR (φ) =                  = 2                     .
                                                    σ̂1 − 2φσ̂12 + σ̂22 φ2
                                     
                                  ar β̂1 − β̂2 φ
                                 Vd

Note that β1 − β2 Φ (t∗P ) = 0. To construct a level α confidence set for Φ (t∗P ) we can simply
collect the set of values where AR (φ) is less than a level 1 − α χ21 critical value:

                                 CS = φ : AR (φ) ≤ χ21,1−α .
                                       


One can show that this confidence set has correct coverage in large samples even when β2
is close to (or exactly) zero. Moreover, when β2 is large this confidence set behaves like the
usual one, and so does not sacrifice efficiency in this case.

Appendix B.2.1 Confidence Set for EP [T Ei ] Under Bounds on Φ
We next justify the proposed confidence set for EP [T Ei ] under the assumption Φ ∈ [ΦL , ΦU ] .
For (σ̂L , σ̂U ) bootstrap standard errors for our estimates (γ̂L , γ̂U ) of

(EPS [T Ei ] + ΦL (EP [EPS [T Ei |Ci ]] − EPS [T Ei ]) , EPS [T Ei ] + ΦU (EP [EPS [T Ei |Ci ]] − EPS [T Ei ])) ,

we proposed constructing a level 1 − α confidence interval for EP [T Ei ] as

                  [min {γ̂L − σ̂L cα , γ̂U − σ̂U cα } , max {γ̂L + σ̂L cα , γ̂U + σ̂U cα }] ,

    To understand this procedure, note that EP [T Ei ] is contained in the bounds implied by




                                                         57
[ΦL , ΦU ] if and only if

                              min {γL , γU } ≤ EP [T Ei ] ≤ max {γL , γU } ,

or equivalently, either

                       H0a : max {(γL − EP [T Ei ]) , − (γU − EP [T Ei ])} ≤ 0

or
                       H0b : max {− (γL − EP [T Ei ]) , (γU − EP [T Ei ])} ≤ 0
holds.
   However, this is the union of two hypotheses of the sort commonly tested in the literature
on moment inequalities. Standard arguments in that literature show that the test that rejects

                       H0a : max {(γL − EP [T Ei ]) , − (γU − EP [T Ei ])} ≤ 0

only if                                                                        

has size at most α in large samples (where σ̂LU is the bootstrap estimate of the covariance
between ΦL and ΦU ). Since we are interested in testing H0a ∪ H0b , we thus consider the test
which rejects only if our tests for H0a and H0b both reject. For a given hypothesized value
EP [T Ei ], this test rejects if and only if

To form a confidence set, we can collect the set of non-rejected values, which is exactly

                  [min {γ̂L − σ̂L c∗α , γ̂U − σ̂U c∗α } , max {γ̂L + σ̂L c∗α , γ̂U + σ̂U c∗α }] .

Thus, this gives us a (conservative) level 1 − α confidence interval for EP [T Ei ] .
   The confidence interval stated in the text is obtained by further noting that for all c,

                       P r {max {ξ1 , ξ2 } > c} ≤ P r {ξ1 > c} + P r {ξ2 > c} ,

which implies that c∗α ≤ cα for cα the two-sided level α normal critical value. Thus, we can
form our confidence intervals with conventional critical values, though we will obtain better
power by instead using the alternative (slightly more computationally intensive) critical value
c∗α .

the study. Standard errors are bootstrapped. This table shows an alternative approach to adjusting for covariates, by
regressing the outcome on covariates separately for treatment and control and generating the difference in predicted
values to estimate the average treatment effect.
