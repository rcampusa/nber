Firm Performance and the Volatility of Worker Earnings

                                         ABSTRACT

Using linked employer-employee data for the U.S., we examine whether shocks to firm revenues
are transmitted to the earnings of continuing employees. While full insurance is rejected, the
elasticity of worker earnings with respect to persistent shocks in firm revenues is small and
consistent with the notion that firms insulate workers from idiosyncratic shocks. Exploring
heterogeneity of effects, we find the largest elasticity in professional services, among employees
in the top 5% of their employers’ earnings distribution, suggesting that in certain jobs
performance pay may be a countervailing force to wage insurance.

I. Introduction

       What role do firms play in generating earnings volatility for workers? Earnings

volatility—within-worker fluctuations in earnings from year to year—contributes to cross

sectional earnings inequality. The seminal paper by Gottschalk and Moffit (1994) showed that

nearly one-third of the increase in male earnings inequality over the 1970-1987 period was due

to a rise in within-worker volatility in earnings. The evidence for more recent decades has been

mixed. Papers based on the Panel Study of Income Dynamics find further increases (Shin and

Solon (2011)) while other papers find little change or even a declining trend using other data sets

(Gathright and Monti (2013), Celik, Juhn, McCue, and Thompson (2012), Dahl, DeLeire, and

Schwabish (2007)).

       If not fully anticipated, earnings volatility is one source of financial risk for workers.

There is some concern that American families may now be more subject to financial risk, given

trends such as the shift in retirement benefits from defined benefit to defined contribution plans,

rising health care costs, rising housing prices in certain areas of the country and even rising

college tuition rates (Hacker (2006)). Given this context, one question of interest is whether

fluctuations in demand faced by employers are an important source of worker earnings volatility.

That is, are shocks to firm performance transmitted to worker earnings?

       A rich literature on implicit contracts posits that firms will shield workers from

fluctuations in demand (Baily (1974), Azariadis (1975), Rosen (1985)). This makes sense from

the perspective of risk, as entrepreneurs or stockholders are likely to have better access to capital

markets than workers, and to have more expertise in diversifying risk. According to Baily

(1974), firms offer workers a joint product: employment and insurance. Guiso et al. (2005) test
                                                1
for wage insurance using matched employer-employee data from Italy and find that firms insure

workers against temporary shocks but not permanent shocks. Other papers have followed using

employer-employee data from other European countries and found similar results.1

        In contrast, employers might favor variable pay as a way to provide incentives when

worker effort is unobserved. In such cases, performance pay based on worker output may

increase productivity (Lazear (1986), Lazear (2000)). Performance pay may also have desirable

sorting effects and so attract higher quality workers. During a period of rising skill demand,

firms may institute performance pay in order to attract more skilled workers (Lemieux,

MacLeod, and Parent (2009)). These models focus on performance pay based on individual

output. Firms may also vary pay with firm or group-level performance based on different

reasoning. In the CEO pay literature, tying CEO compensation to firm performance will help

solve the principal-agent problem. Lazear (1999) and Oyer and Schaefer (2005) argue that tying

compensation to firm performance may help the firm sort workers who are more optimistic about

the firm’s prospects or have private information about the value of the firm. Whether incentives

or sorting motivate firm compensation practices, these arguments suggest that variable pay is

likely to be more prevalent for managers and other workers who have a more direct impact on

firm performance.

        The literature on wage insurance is also closely related to rent-sharing literature, which

explores the extent to which equally qualified workers are paid higher wages in firms that

 The list of papers include Fagereng et al. (2016), Cardoso and Portela (2009), Katay (2009), Guertzgen (2014),and
Le Barbanchon and Tarasonis (2011). These papers generally find no transmission of temporary shocks and a partial
transmission of permanent shocks which range from 0.03 to 0.10.

                                                        2
command economic rents.2 More recently available employer-employee data linking individual

workers to firms has allowed for estimation of rent sharing parameters that control for worker

fixed effects. This approach essentially uses evidence on stayers and hence avoids difficulties

associated with highly able workers sorting into higher productivity firms. Card, Cardoso and

Kline (2016) use linked employer-employee data from Portugal to estimate responses of worker

earnings to changes in firms’ value added. They find a small positive coefficient relating three-

year changes in firm value added to three-year changes in worker earnings. They interpret the

pass-through estimate mainly in terms of rent sharing. While motivated by different theories,

empirically, the insurance story is the opposite of the rent-sharing story. A low elasticity

suggests more insurance and risk-sharing between workers and firms. A higher elasticity

suggests less risk-sharing and more rent-sharing. Card, Cardoso, Heining and Kline (this

volume) provides a survey of studies that relate wages to measures of firm performance. They

find that parameters estimated from job stayers are smaller than parameters estimated from job

movers. Wage insurance for workers who remain with the firm may be one reason for this gap in

the two types of estimates.

        In this paper we make two contributions. First, we document the extent to which changes

in worker earnings are influenced by shocks to firm outcomes using a set of matched employer-

employee data for the U.S. Previous papers examining wage insurance have examined evidence

from European countries with high levels of unionization and collective wage bargaining



2
 See, for example, Hildreth and Oswald (1997), Blanchflower, Oswald and Sanfey (1996), Abowd and Lemieux
(1993), and Van Reenen (1996).

                                                     3
agreements. With a centralized wage bargaining process, firms may not be able to adjust worker

wages to idiosyncratic firm-level shocks. These factors are less of an issue in the U.S., so U.S.

data may provide more fertile ground for testing wage insurance models.3

         Our second contribution is to explore important aspects of heterogeneity—by nature of

the shock and by worker and firm characteristics. We examine whether the extent of wage

insurance varies by the size of the shock and whether the impact of positive and negative shocks

differ. The performance pay literature suggests that the trade-off between insurance and

incentives should be most stark for employees who have a large direct impact on firm

performance. We test whether this prediction is borne out by comparing effects for highly paid

(top 5%) versus the low-paid (bottom 20%) workers in the firm. Finally we explore

heterogeneity by worker tenure. While wage insurance predicts little or no transmission of firm-

level shocks to worker earnings, a competing explanation is that labor markets are competitive

and firms have little leeway in setting wages. This is more likely to be true for just-hired workers

who have no accumulated firm-specific human capital. The just-hired provide a counterfactual

for pay adjustments in a more competitive setting. To the extent that the coefficients differ

substantially across these worker types, we may conclude that mobility of workers across firms

is more important than any considerations of insurance.

         Our findings show that the OLS coefficient on short term (1-year) changes in firm

revenues on worker earnings is close to zero, ranging from 0.007 for manufacturing and 0.013


3
 It may also be that lower firing costs in the U.S. induce firms to lay-off workers more readily so that focusing on
wage insurance provided to stayers may provide an incomplete picture of the overall insurance provided to workers
by firms.

                                                          4
and 0.015 for retail and professional services respectively. We find the coefficient to be -0.003

and insignificant in finance. Estimates are generally larger for 3-year and 5-year changes which

may be due to either reduced measurement error or isolating more persistent shocks. IV

estimates, which are an alternative method for correcting for measurement error and isolating

permanent shocks, produce small and positive coefficients which range from 0.02 in

manufacturing to 0.05 in professional services. While full insurance is rejected, the elasticity is

small and consistent with the notion that firms insulate workers from idiosyncratic shocks. We

find that the elasticity varies by sector and also by relative earnings rank of the worker in the

firm. We find the largest coefficient—0.09—among highly paid workers (the top 5%) in

professional services. For lower paid workers in professional services (those in the first

quintile), the coefficient is close to zero.



II. Related Literature

        Guiso et al. (2005) use matched employer-employee data from Italy to test for wage

insurance. Other papers have followed their methods using matched employer-employee data

from other European countries. However, we are not aware of other papers which have used

matched employer-employee data for the U.S. with linked information on firm performance such

as revenues or value-added to examine this question. While our paper is the first that we know

of to conduct this exercise, other papers examining the U.S. are nevertheless closely related to

our paper. Comin, Groshen, and Rabin (2009) investigate the extent to which volatility of firm

revenues are transmitted to average wages of workers in the firm using a sample of large

publicly-traded firms in the COMPUSTAT data. They find that the relationship between firm
                                           5
and wage volatility has become more positive over time which they attribute to a shift in the

composition of jobs towards those with more bonus pay. They also investigate variation across

industries and find that the relationship is stronger in services than in manufacturing. One

drawback to their study is the use of average firm wages, for which variation could be driven by

changes in worker composition. Using matched employer-employee data bypasses this difficulty

by measuring earnings changes for individual workers who remain employed in the firm.

       Strain (2013) examines the relationship between firm employment volatility and volatility

of worker earnings and finds a robust positive relationship. But one difficulty for his findings is

the use of firm employment as the measure of firm performance. While shifts in firm

employment may reflect exogenous shifts in product demand, employment is more likely to be

affected by firm choices. Firm performance measures such as revenues or value-added are

arguably more exogenous and so it is more likely that the direction of causality goes from firm

volatility to volatility of worker earnings.

       Barth et al. (2016) use the U.S. data from the Census’s Longitudinal Business Database

and economic censuses to estimate the relationship between establishment average payroll per

employee and revenues per worker. Since they use establishment average earnings rather than

changes in individual-level earnings, they find a somewhat larger positive coefficient relating

firm revenues to worker earnings. As with Card, Cardoso, and Kline (2016), the authors interpret

the coefficient as a rent-sharing parameter. Nevertheless, the authors conclude that the rent-

sharing model accounts for only a small portion of the rise in earnings inequality between

establishments.

III. Data

       We base our empirical analysis on revenue data collected from samples of firms which

we link to administrative records on the earnings, work histories, and demographics of their

employees. Here we first describe the firm and employee data separately and then discuss how

we join them.



Firm data

       The results presented here are based on data from three Census annual business surveys

that collect information on revenues for a particular industry or industry group:

   The Annual Retail Trade Survey (ARTS) collects information on sales and expenses for a

    panel of firms sampled from retail trade (NAICS 44-45) and accommodation and food

    services (NAICS 72).

   The Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM) collects information from employers in a wide

    set of manufacturing industries (NAICS 31-33).

   The Services Annual Survey (SAS) collects data from selected industries in other sectors.

The coverage of the SAS has expanded over time, so while it now covers a large portion of the

services sector broadly defined, many of the currently included industries have relatively short

time series. Rather than pooling all of the available data, we have produced estimates for selected

industries, and only present two of them here: what we will refer to as finance (though it is based




                                                 7
on a subset of industries in that sector)4 and professional services.5 We included finance based

on the hypothesis that compensation practices in that industry would be more influenced by pay

for performance and less influenced by wage insurance than most. Professional services was

selected because it has substantial employment, and because we found a nontrivial relationship

between worker earnings growth and firm revenue growth for workers in that industry.6

        The designs of these surveys share several common elements that influence our samples.

The purpose of collecting these data is to support timely estimates of aggregate activity, so firms

with more revenues have higher probabilities of selection. For this reason, our sample is

primarily made up of larger firms, making our results more representative of employment than of

the population of firms.7

        For each of the survey panels, a new sample is drawn every 5 years, once new

information from the quinquennial Economic Census is incorporated into the sampling frame.

Over the span of years in our data, new samples for ARTS and SAS started in 2001, 2006, and

2011, while new ASM panels began in 1999, 2004, and 2009. While new firms appear in the

  The sample we use is made up of firms from NAICS 5231 (securities and commodity contracts intermediation and
brokerage) and 5239 (Other financial activities).
5
  This samples from NAICS 541 (Professional, scientific, and technical services). A few examples of detailed
industries in this sector are legal services, architectural and engineering services, and computer system design.

  The other SAS industries that we produced estimates for but do not include were NAICS 621 (Ambulatory Health
Care), 622 (Hospitals), 623 (Nursing and Residential Care), and 811 (Repair and Maintenance). Results based on
data from those industries generally showed small and often insignificant coefficients.
7
  For example, economic census statistics from 2012 show that the average firm in the industries sampled for the
ARTS survey (NAICS 44/45 and 72) had $4.3M in revenues in 2012, while the employment-weighted average for
those industries was $14M. This compares to a linked-worker weighted firm average in our broadest ARTS sample
of $119M in revenues in $2012 (see Appendix Table 1). For professional services, those statistics are $1.9M (firm
mean), $48M (worker weighted population), and $1,687M (our sample). For manufacturing: $22M (firm average),
$135M (worker-weighted population), and $788M (our sample). For finance, they are $9M (firm), $101M (worker
weighted population) and $6,165M (our sample).

panel primarily in those years, large firms may be selected again in subsequent panels and so

remain in our data set for more than five years.8 The ARTS and SAS surveys sample firms, or in

some cases the part of a firm that operates in an in-sample industry. The ASM differs from the

other surveys in that it samples establishments (individual locations) rather than firms.

            We use data from these annual business surveys primarily to measure changes in firm

revenues. While some firms in the ARTS and SAS report sales separately for different parts of

their organization or broken down by detailed industry, we use total sales reported for the firm

within a three-digit NAICS industry as our measure of firm outcomes. In manufacturing, where

we have information on revenues by location, we sum revenues up to the firm/state level, which

is the most detailed level at which we can combine data on firms and their employees.



Employee data

            Our data on employees come from Census’s Longitudinal Employer-Household

Dynamics (LEHD) database, which draws much of its data from complete sets of unemployment

insurance (UI) earnings records for U.S. states. Workers' quarterly UI earnings records have been

matched to characteristics of their employers drawn from quarterly administrative UI reports and

to demographic and employer information from other Census data sources. Earnings covered by

UI reporting include wage and salary income, commissions, tips, and bonuses.




8
    We also use prior year revenue information, where available, to provide a 6 th year of data.


                                                              9
         While all states provided data for the LEHD program, the availability of data from earlier

years varies by state. Our primary analysis sample of workers is selected based on their

employment by the firms in our business samples, as detailed in the next section. To provide

some context for the variation captured in our primary analysis, we also draw a 1% sample of all

UI-covered workers in 39 states for years 2000-2011, and use that sample to estimate overall

levels of earnings volatility.



Linked data

         To construct our linked data set, we first take all of the firms (or, in some cases, industry

segments of firms) in the business samples that have non-missing and non-zero sales measures.

Firms with multiple locations (“multi-unit”) firms may file information using more than one

federal Employer Identification Number (EIN), so we pull all EINs used by the firm from

Census’s Business Register.9 The UI employer records also include EINs, so we then use the set

of EINs from the business surveys to select UI employer records for sampled firms, finding EIN

match rates of 84-90 percent for the industries we use.

         Once we have a list of UI employer identifiers, we select all employees aged 25-59 who

are employed by a sample firm in at least one year during the period that the firm is in sample,

and having at least one “full-quarter” of employment in that year. In tables below, we refer to



9
  The Business Register (BR) contains information on essentially all businesses with employees who are subject to
federal withholding. It serves as the sampling frame for all three surveys we use here. Firms do not always use the
same tax identifiers in filing federal payroll taxes (the primary source of EINs for the BR) and state UI taxes (the
source of EINs for the LEHD files). As a consequence, it is likely that our sample of employees is incomplete for
some of the firms included in our analysis.

                                                         10
this set of workers as our cross-sectional sample. As is standard in using the LEHD earnings

data, we treat quarter t as a full quarter if that worker has earnings reported in quarters t-1, t, and

t+1 at that employer. This definition is based on the notion that the individual was likely

employed for the full 13 weeks of the quarter if they had earnings with the same employer both

right before and right after the quarter. We use only full-quarter observations in measuring

earnings. This restriction serves to eliminate variation in earnings due to the number of weeks

worked, but note that we cannot eliminate variation due to changes in hours an individual works,

as we do not have data on worker hours. We do have establishment-level measures of hours in

manufacturing, which we use in a robustness check discussed later in the paper.

        Our regression analysis requires that we further restrict our sample of workers to those

with two consecutive full years of earnings with a sample employer (“stayers”) so that we can

measure the relationship between changes in worker annual earnings and the annual firm

outcomes from the business data. In the least restrictive sample we use for our primary analysis,

we define stayers in year t as those having positive earnings with the same employer for each

quarter in two adjacent calendar years (t and t+1), plus two quarters on either end of that spell

(the fourth quarter of year t-1 and the first quarter of year t+2). When we examine longer

changes, we must further restrict our sample—for example, using those who are in the data for

six adjacent calendar years when looking at five-year differences. Results presented here are

primarily based on samples of jobs lasting long enough to use for either three-year or five-year




                                                  11
changes, which we will refer to as our 3-year and 5-year samples (though they require 4 and 6

years of data, respectively).10

         The length of the panel datasets we analyze depend on the availability of both LEHD and

firm data. Our linked retail and manufacturing samples span years 1998-2011.11 For finance,

our sample includes years 2002-2011, and for professional services it includes years 1992-2011.

Because more states are included in the LEHD data in more recent years, our samples are larger

for more recent years, and so our estimates weight recent years more heavily. We should also

note that the fact that samples are refreshed every 5 years means that the 5-year samples are

particularly large for intervals starting with the first year of data for a new panel.



Summary statistics

         Table 1 shows summary statistics for our analysis sample for the long-run stayers that are

included in our regression analyses, alongside two other comparison samples (appendix table 1

gives additional detail). One comparison sample—the cross-sectional sample described above—

includes all workers aged 25-59 linked to our sample of firms in that industry group with at least

one full quarter of earnings. We include these statistics to serve as a point of comparison for the

more restrictive samples we use for our primary analysis. The age restriction and the requirement

of one full quarter of earnings eliminates many transient and low earnings jobs. Annual average



10
   Note that it is possible for an individual to be employed by more than one sample employer in the same time
period, but the restriction to stayers generally eliminates most such cases. In samples restricted to those who stay for
at least one full year, 0.1 percent of individuals are in our sample more than once.
11
   We have manufacturing data for all of the years with LEHD data, but have only used 1998 forward; including
earlier data becomes computationally burdensome and limits comparability with other industry sectors.

                                                          12
earnings for these cross-sectional samples range from $51,300 in retail to over $200,000 in

finance.12 The ranking of pay by industries probably conforms with most readers’ expectations,

but the levels may seem surprisingly high. Part of the high average is explainable by the sample

restrictions—for example, staying with the same retailer for many years is probably much more

common among store managers than cashiers. But in addition, these means are based on the full

distribution of UI-covered earnings and are not topcoded, and so will be influenced by workers

with very high earnings such as executives. Because the statistics are worker-weighted, averages

for firm-side variables such as revenues reflect the characteristics of larger firms.13

         The rows labeled “1-year difference” further restrict the samples to observations on

stayers at firms in-sample for adjacent match years.14 Restricting to stayers raises the average age

by approximately 2 years, and raises average annual earnings substantially. Further restricting

our samples to allow estimation based on longer-run changes of course reduces observation

counts, and further raises average earnings in all sectors except finance. The 5-year samples are

also more affected by the cycle of sample refreshment, which for our retail and finance samples

means that a large portion of the 5-year sample observations fall in the interval 2005-2010, and

so reflect variation during the great recession.15




12
   Amounts are expressed in $2012, and are rounded to the nearest 100.
13
   More precisely, they are weighted by matched employment for jobs that meet sample exclusion requirements, and
so are informative only about the characteristics of our sample.
14
   Mean levels for the 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year change samples are respectively based on values for years 1, 2, and
3 of those intervals, so each in-sample change contributes a single observation to calculation of mean levels.
15
   The professional services sample is on the same sampling schedule, but covers a longer period of years.


                                                         13
IV. Earnings Volatility of Stayers and Non-stayers

       In estimating the effects of firm shocks on worker earnings in annual data, we end up

with selective samples based on stayers, and in some instances only quite long-term stayers.

From a broader perspective, while shocks to firm outcomes potentially affect earnings volatility

through their effects on earnings changes among continuing employees, they also affect volatility

by changing the likelihood that employees stay on their current job. Even for continuing

employees, it may be that shared industry or local area shocks have more substantial effects than

shocks that are idiosyncratic to the firm. But volatility among stayers provides an upper bound

on how much individual firm outcomes could plausibly contribute to volatility. A

straightforward accounting approximation gives the variance of earnings changes as the

weighted average of variances for the stayer and non-stayer sets, with the weights equal to the

relevant employment shares, as in



where Vt is the variance of earnings growth for the relevant set and St is the stayer share. In

forming this decomposition we use residualized earnings (net of age effects) and base our

estimates on a separate one percent sample of workers drawn from the LEHD data without

regard to industry, but satisfying our basic inclusion requirements. We plot trends separately for

younger workers (ages 25-34) and older workers (ages 35-59).

       Our stayer definition is based on having 10 quarters in a row with a single employer. For

stayers in this sample who work for more than one job, we also require that their highest earnings

job in year t and t+1 are with the same employer. We term other workers meeting our basic


                                                 14
inclusion restrictions and having positive earnings “non-stayers,” as “movers” would be

inaccurate given that that set includes many different possible employment patterns. We

summarize the results of two decompositions meant to give a sense of the bounds on the relative

importance of earnings variation among stayers versus non-stayers, holding our stayers definition

constant. In both sets we use the standard deviation of the change in log earnings as our measure

of volatility, and so include only workers with earnings in both t and t+1. In the first set, we

compute the difference in log average full-quarter earnings on the individual’s highest paying job

between year t and year t+1, and then calculate the variance of that log difference for groups

defined by year, two age groups, and whether they are a stayer. By dropping any quarters with

zero earnings, and any in which someone worked less than a full quarter, we exclude much of the

effects of non-employment from our volatility measure, and also increase the share of stayers by

treating some non-stayers as out of scope because they have no full quarters of earnings. Time

series graphs of the volatility components are shown in Figure 1.

       As shown in Table 2, volatility among stayers averages about 14 percent of overall

earnings volatility for those aged 25-34, and about 19 percent of overall earnings volatility for

those aged 35-59 (columns 2-4). These are substantial shares, even if they are considerably less

than half. Unsurprisingly, stayers account for a larger share of volatility among older workers,

primarily because older workers are more likely to be stayers. Age differences in the volatility

of earnings are small when conditioned on whether or not the individual changes jobs. In

contrast, if we include any workers with positive earnings in both t and t+1, adding in the full

effects of non-employment spells among those with some labor force activity in both years,

stayers account for only two or three percent of overall volatility (columns 5-7). While the
                                                15
relationship between firm shocks and job losses or job changes is clearly important, we leave it

as the topic of future research. In this paper we focus on firm shock transmissions to stayers as

an interesting topic in its own right.



V. Empirical Framework for Regression Models

        Our basic empirical approach is to regress innovations in worker earnings on innovations

in a measure of firm performance. We motivate this regression using a simplified version of

Guiso et al. (2005), adapted to include measurement error in revenues.



Firm shocks

        Revenues are presumed to act as firm-side drivers affecting worker earnings. Letting j

index firms and t index time, log revenues Rjt follow

                                                                                                 (1)

The       term captures time-varying observable factors, the    term captures unobserved firm

fixed effects, and the error term captures other factors (including measurement error in

revenues). First differencing eliminates the fixed effects,

                                                                                                 (2)

Since our conceptual framework stresses wage insurance, we include industry, state and year

controls in our specifications. The aim is to net out aggregate and industry-level shocks to isolate

idiosyncratic shocks which are more likely to be insurable. For instance, industry and year

controls help net out the effects of common input Tcost shocks.


                                                 16
Permanent versus temporary shocks

       It is useful to specify permanent and temporary components to the innovations      , and

to distinguish true from measured values. True error shocks    incorporate a random walk to

capture a permanent component and a moving average process to capture transitory effects,

                                                                                                 (3)

                                                                                                 (4)

where L denotes the lag operator. Together these imply a permanent-transitory distinction for the

true shocks     ,

                                                                                                 (5)

Adding measurement error mjt to the true     implies

                                                                                                 (6)

Unless noted, error components are uncorrelated with each other and are serially uncorrelated,

and we denote variances in obvious ways, so that                 ,                   ,

  , and so forth.



Worker earnings

       Log earnings for worker i are presumed to depend on time-varying observable factors,

permanent and temporary firm-side shocks, worker fixed effects       , and a shock   ,

                                                                                                 (7)



                                               17
Here the Pjt and Tjt reflect the idiosyncratic permanent and temporary firm outcomes, and are

implicitly defined to difference down to the components of (5). First differencing eliminates the

worker fixed effects,

                                                                                                  (8)

where the composite error term         includes terms related to the permanent and temporary

firm shocks and the idiosyncratic wage shock,

                                                                                                  (9)

Estimation

       Estimating (9) directly is difficult since firm side revenue growth includes measurement

error and both temporary and permanent innovations. Earnings growth does not depend on the

measurement error part of firm revenue growth, but even with no measurement error we would

have difficulty distinguishing the α and β responses as we do not directly observe the separate

components of      . We adopt two complementary approaches which we think offer sensible

information, particularly about α. In this section we relate our proposed OLS and IV model

estimates to the parameters in the stochastic setup above.

       One approach involves estimating OLS regressions of wage growth on firm sales growth,

for various lengths of change (we estimate models for 1-, 3-, and 5-year changes). The idea is

that correlations among longer differences should more heavily reflect the impact of permanent

shocks rather than transitory shocks or measurement error. Consider an OLS regression on 5-

year changes from (t-3) to (t+2), an interval that spans the one-period changes above. The

stochastic setup implies

                                                18
                                                                                                           (10)

                                                                                                           (11)

The OLS coefficient is a ratio of the relevant covariances

                                                                                                           (12)

                                                                                                           (13)

Shorter changes look similar, but with fewer accumulated                       permanent terms in (10)-(11),

and smaller leading terms in (12)-(13). In particular, coefficients on the leading terms in (12)-

(13) equal the difference length, in this case 5.16

           If there were no measurement error, the OLS coefficients would reflect a weighted

average of α and β, with α more heavily weighted for longer changes. If there were no

measurement error, and α equaled β, the ratio of (12) to (13) would give the common parameter

α=β. Measurement error biases coefficients toward zero, but less so as the difference length

increases. Generally speaking, there is a difficulty in distinguishing between the effects of

measurement error and different responses to permanent and transitory firm shocks (                  =0 and

α>β could look the same in the data as             >0 and α=β). This seems intuitive since measurement

error is transitory in the setup.

           In our second approach, we follow Card, Cardoso, and Kline (2016) and use revenue

growth at different dates as instruments, in particular choosing instrument dating that overlaps




16
     The 1-period changes also have an additional component θ to the   term.


                                                          19
the independent variable but without common endpoints. For instance, the IV coefficient in a 1-

period change model using the 5-period change                              as an instrument is

                                                                       =               = α.                  (14)

If the instrument spans a long enough horizon and overlaps with but does not share endpoints

with the independent variable, then the instrumentation filters out any variation having to do with

the transitory terms, true or mismeasured, and the IV coefficient measures the earnings response

to permanent shocks. One gets the same outcome from a 5-period change model when

instrumenting with the one-period change              , since

                                  .17

        Instrumenting with a just-barely-overlapping change would return α if θ=0, but not

otherwise. For example, a 3-period earnings growth model instrumented using a 5-period change

in firm revenues returns


                                                                                                             (15)


Instrumenting with a just-barely-overlapping change filters out the measurement error and the

part of the transitory shock that disappears in one period, but not the part of the transitory shock

with a lingering effect into a second period. If α=β this would return the common parameter.

        To summarize, we expect OLS coefficients to rise with difference length, and to give a

better measure of the earnings response to permanent shocks for longer changes. However, we


17
  This is a general symmetry result from this setup. For instance, the model suggests that estimating a 3-period
growth model with a 1-period change as instrument would return the same parameter as running a 1-period growth
model with a 3-period instrument (provided changes are dated so as to overlap but not share endpoints).

                                                       20
cannot determine how much of any observed pattern in OLS coefficients to attribute to

measurement error versus different responses to transitory and permanent shocks. We expect the

IV strategies identifying α to return larger coefficients because they avoid the variation

associated with measurement error and the transitory shocks (assuming                            ). Higher IV

coefficients are consistent with both measurement error in firm revenues and with a greater

response to permanent than transitory shocks. Finally, we would take similar OLS and IV

coefficients as some evidence in favor of small measurement error along with                             , meaning

earnings responses to transitory and permanent shocks are similar.



VI. Results

         As described above, our basic framework for analyzing the effect of firm shocks on

worker earnings growth is a simple set of regressions of the form

                                                                                                                    (16)

where j indexes firms, i indexes workers, and t indexes time. The dependent variable is the

change in log annual worker earnings and the independent variable of interest is                          , the change

in log firm revenues.18 Taking differences nets out worker-firm fixed effects. Other controls

include separate dummies for worker age for men and for women, 4-digit industry dummies,

year and state dummies, and 3-digit industry dummies interacted with year dummies.19


18
   Various firm performance measures are possible. Value added is an attractive measure because it approximates
the relevant pool of funds that is subject to rent capture or bargaining by labor. But revenues are likely to be better
measured, as value added is typically derived from revenues by subtracting costs.
19
   Our manufacturing and retail samples span multiple 3-digit industries but the other samples do not.


                                                           21
   a. Baseline Results

       Table 3 presents OLS regression results for four industries—manufacturing, retail,

professional services and finance (as defined in section III). The table shows estimates for 1-

year, 3-year, and 5-year changes. In order to compare shorter and longer-run changes on the

same sample of workers and firms, we restrict our sample to firms and workers who remain in

the sample long enough to be included in 5-year changes. The OLS estimates indicate that very

little of the firm-level shocks in revenue are passed to worker earnings. In manufacturing, shown

in the top left panel, the estimate is a highly significant 0.007 for 1-year changes. The estimates

for 3-year and 5-year changes are larger (0.012 and 0.013) but still quite small. Estimates for

professional services and retail are generally a bit larger than those for manufacturing, but still

small. While we expected to find larger effects for finance because that is where we thought

variable pay should be most important, there is little evidence that firm-level performance is

transmitted to worker earnings in the finance sector.

       Table 4 reports results for instrumental variables models where the change in firm

revenues is instrumented with non-overlapping shorter or longer changes. The columns refer to

changes in worker log earnings (the dependent variables) while the rows refer to the changes in

firm log revenues (the instruments). For example, the coefficient 0.023 reported for

manufacturing is the estimate obtained from regressing 1-year changes in log worker earnings on

1-year changes in firm log revenues, with the 3-year change in log revenues used as an

instrument. The IV estimates for manufacturing are generally larger than the OLS estimates

shown in Table 3, and are now generally roughly 0.02. The IV estimates are also larger for
                                              22
professional services where some of the estimates are now close to 0.05. There is no clear

pattern for retail although one of the estimates (the 1-year change instrumented with the 5-year

change) exhibits the largest coefficient yet obtained: 0.073. Again, we find little evidence of

transmission of firm level shocks to worker earnings in finance.

       It is useful to compare our results for the U.S. to others in the literature. Our estimates

are in the neighborhood of those found by Arai (2003) for Sweden, Margolis and Salvanes

(2001) for Norwegian manufacturing, and Martins (2009) for Portuguese manufacturing; these

form the lower end of the range of estimates identified by Card et al. (this volume). There are

many reasons related to both data and measurement that could account for the lower rates we

estimate in the U.S. compared to those from European countries. But issues of measurement

aside, lower pass-through of firm-level shocks to workers is somewhat unexpected given the

existence of greater labor market flexibility in the U.S. For example, the U.S. has the lowest

rates of unionization and collective bargaining agreements among OECD countries (Freeman

(2007)).

       One explanation is that while unionization and collective bargaining may reduce wage

flexibility at a more aggregate level, the presence of such institutions may not necessarily

preclude wage adjustments at the firm level (Cardoso and Portugal (2005), Teulings (1997)).

Another possibility is crowd-out of private insurance by public insurance (Ellul, Pagano and

Schivardi (2014)). The U.S. offers less generous unemployment and disability insurance

benefits compared to most OECD countries (OECD (2010), OECD (2016)). This type of crowd

out is unlikely, however, since these benefits are tied to non-employment rather than to wage


                                                 23
cuts. Another possible explanation is that U.S. firms provide less employment insurance and are

more likely to lay off workers in the event of a negative productivity shock.

       In our paper as well as in Guiso et al. (2005), the focus has been on earnings changes

among workers who are continuing with the firm. We show that stayers are a select sample

when compared to a broader sample of employees working at least one full quarter. Thus a focus

on earnings risk, conditional on employment, leaves open the important question of whether

firms readily transfer employment risk by laying off workers even as they reduce wage risk for

the workers who are retained. Lamadon (2014) finds that a significant fraction of earnings risk is

due to unemployment and job mobility. We view exploring employment risk in conjunction with

wage insurance parameters as important topic for future research.

       In the results reported above, we have restricted our sample to the 5-year change sample

in order to compare shorter and longer-run changes holding sample composition constant. In

doing so, however, we lose a large share of our original sample, particularly in the retail sector

where the average tenure of workers is shorter. One concern is that our 5-year change sample is

not very representative of typical workers or firms in the industry. We have examined how

much this restriction affects our results by repeating our analysis of 1- and 3-year changes on a

sample that requires staying in our data for 4 consecutive years (our 3-year change sample)

rather than 6 consecutive years. These results are reported in Appendix Tables 2 and 3. The

results using this more robust sample are qualitatively similar to those reported in Table 3 and

Table 4. One difference is that in retail, the IV estimates for 3-year changes (0.035 and 0.029)

are now larger than the corresponding 3-year OLS estimate which is now zero.


                                                 24
         a. Heterogeneity by Size and Direction of Shocks

         While we find small effects overall, it is possible that our estimates of mean effects

obscure different patterns at other parts of the distribution of firm-level shocks. In particular, it

seems relevant to ask whether firms insure workers from particularly large shocks or are more

likely to insure workers against negative shocks but allow earnings to vary with positive shocks.

We explore this possibility in Figure 4 by graphing mean changes in log worker earnings against

changes in log firm-revenues.20 We utilize the more robust 3-year change sample for this

exercise. We order the firm revenue changes and divide them into 50 bins with approximately

equal numbers of firm/year observations, and then average the changes in log revenues and

changes in worker earnings within each bin. We have omitted the lowest and highest bins from

the figure.

         The figure shows suggestive evidence that firms insure workers against very large shocks

in manufacturing and professional services. This seems to be true for both large positive shocks

and for large negative shocks. The slope relating firm revenue shocks to changes in worker

earnings is flatter at the extremes than in the middle. The pattern is less clear for retail and for

finance; those figures do not point to obvious asymmetric effects of positive and negative

shocks. We verify this by running regressions for the 3-year changes allowing the coefficients to

differ for positive and negative shocks, which we report in Table 5. The coefficients are slightly

larger for negative shocks although in the case of manufacturing, the difference is minimal (and


20
   We first residualize changes in both firm revenues and worker earnings by regressing out the set of controls used
in our regressions: age dummies separately for men and women, year and state dummies, 4-digit industry dummies,
and 3-digit industry dummies interacted with year dummies (for those sectors spanning multiple 3-digit industries).

                                                         25
in finance, none of the coefficients are significant). While we do not interpret our estimates as

rent-sharing parameters, this type of asymmetry would be hard to reconcile with a rent-sharing

story alone. The expectation is that firms do not cut wages in the case of negative shocks

because workers may leave while they are likely to share the rents generated by positive shocks.

One caveat is that we cannot separately identify hours variation in our data.21 It is possible at

least in the retail sector where part-time employment is common that firms cut hours for stayers

in the case of negative demand shocks.



         b. Heterogeneity by Worker Characteristics

         Wage insurance and incentive pay are likely to be more relevant motives for structuring

pay for some jobs than others. Given what can be measured in our data, grouping workers by

relative position in their firm’s earnings distribution seems the most useful way to try to

distinguish groups that might be more or less affected. To do this, we pool information on all

workers (stayers or not) who work at least one full quarter for a firm in the sample. We then

regress log quarterly earnings on dummies for single years of age and a full set of year*quarter

dummies to adjust for differences in the age and time periods in which earnings are observed.

We take residuals from this regression and average them across all quarters that an individual is

in sample. We use these average residuals to rank workers within each firm. While our analysis

sample is again based on the 5-year change sample, we assign workers in the sample to quantiles


21
  Unfortunately we do not have hours data for the retail, finance, or professional services. We do have total hours
worked by production workers in manufacturing. We present results controlling for hours in manufacturing in a
later robustness section.

                                                         26
based on order statistics calculated including any non-stayers that worked one or more full

quarters. Therefore our quantiles do not split the sample of stayers into equal fractions, but they

do preserve a reasonable ordering of our in-sample observations.

       Table 6 shows the results for quintile 1, quintile 3 and for the top 5% of the distribution.

The table reports OLS estimates based on 5-year changes and IV estimates that instrument 5-year

changes in log revenues with 3-year changes in log revenues. There is clear evidence that the

coefficients are larger for higher wage workers in manufacturing and professional services. This

is only mildly true in the manufacturing sector where the IV coefficient increases from being

close to zero and insignificant for quintile 1 workers to 0.029 for the top 5% workers. The

pattern is much more pronounced in professional services where the IV coefficient goes from

being insignificant and close to zero for quintile 1 workers to 0.091 for the top 5%. The near

10% elasticity is the largest coefficient estimate we find in any of our specifications. Given

shifting employment from manufacturing to professional services and from less-skilled jobs to

higher skilled jobs, these patterns suggest that volatility of worker earnings attributable to firm-

level shocks could be expected to rise. The result for the retail sector is puzzling in that the size

of the OLS coefficient is uniform across the wage categories while the IV coefficient (0.041) is

the largest for quintile 1 workers. One possibility is that low-wage workers in the retail industry

are more likely to work on commission. Another possibility is that in retail where part-time

employment is common, hours adjustments play a bigger role.

       While we generally find small estimates and interpret this as evidence of partial wage

insurance, a competing explanation is that labor markets are effectively competitive and firms

have little leeway in setting wages. This is more likely to be true for workers who have just been
                                                27
hired and have no accumulated firm-specific human capital. We examine whether workers with

greater tenure in the firm (and presumably more firm-specific human capital) experience larger

transmission of firm-level shocks compared to the just hired. To the extent that the coefficients

differ greatly across these worker types, we might conclude that mobility of workers across firms

is more important than any considerations of wage insurance.

       We explore these differences in Table 7. We use our 3-year change sample here because

requiring the longer 5-year interval is likely to have particularly large effects on the number of

new hires who remain in sample. We distinguish between just-hired employees and longer-term

employees, where the latter category is defined as workers who have 4+ quarters of tenure in the

first year of the 3-year change. Table 7 shows that in retail and professional services, workers

with more tenure experience larger changes in their earnings in response to firm shocks than do

the just hired, but in both cases the differences are small (roughly .01). Estimated differences for

both manufacturing and finance are small and insignificant. It thus appears that even for workers

with greater tenure, there is little transmission of firm-level shocks to worker earnings suggesting

that wage insurance is still a compelling explanation for the small size of the elasticities.



       c. Robustness to Adding Controls for Employment and Hours

       We have focused on revenues as our measure of firm performance, presuming that

revenue changes are driven by demand shocks or productivity changes so that the prospect of

profits to be shared with workers grows. However, mergers or acquisitions could also lead to

revenue increases without necessarily reflecting improved firm performance. To examine

whether this is an important concern, we use an alternative measure of firm performance for
                                               28
manufacturing—revenue per worker—that should be less sensitive to such reorganizations.22

We run the same regressions shown in Tables 3 and 4, now using revenue per worker as our firm

performance measure. We also include specifications that add a control for hours: log

differences of the ratio of total production worker hours to production worker employment. We

do this to see whether adding hours reduces our estimates, which would suggest that part of the

adjustment is due to changes in hours rather than wages. The top panel of Table 8 reports OLS

results while the bottom panel reports instrumental variables results. We find that most of our

estimates increase by about .01 using this alternative firm performance measure. Although this

is not a large difference, it does suggest some future lines of inquiry, for example with respect to

the effects or measurement surrounding mergers and consolidations. We find that adding hours

has very little effect on our estimates. This suggests that the interpretation of our estimates as

referring to wage insurance is still valid and that, at least in manufacturing, the elasticity

parameters do not simply reflect an hours adjustment.



VII. Conclusions and Future Work

        U.S. evidence on the extent to which changing firm conditions affect the earnings of

continuing employees is scant, largely because data to address this question has only recently

become available. In this paper, we use firm level data in manufacturing, retail and selected




22
  Unfortunately, the ARTS and SAS surveys do not collect employment data. While it is possible to obtain
employment measures from Census’s Business Register, uncertainty about the relationship between the sampling
units used for these surveys and the units on the BR mean that using such a measure as a denominator for sales per
worker would add considerable measurement error.

                                                        29
service industries to examine this question. IV estimates which isolate persistent shocks and

correct for measurement error are small and positive—ranging from 0.02 in manufacturing to

0.05 in professional services. We find that in professional services the relatively large number

masks significant heterogeneity, with the coefficient being essentially zero among the lowest

wage workers in the first quintile of the firm earnings distribution while the coefficient is 0.09

among those in the top 5%. The highest paid workers in professional services, however, are

likely to be in precisely the sort of jobs in which we would expect performance pay objectives to

override insurance concerns. While our finding of non-zero estimates is technically a rejection of

the notion of full insurance, these coefficients are economically small enough that it seems

sensible to conclude that the transmission of firm-level shocks to earnings of stayers is minimal

in the U.S. labor market.

       To what extent have firms contributed to the recent increases in financial risk

experienced by American families? Our evidence here, based on workers who remain with the

firm, suggests that firms had a relatively limited role. Even if firms offer less wage insurance to

workers than in the past, our estimates suggest that even in the 2000s, very little of the volatility

in firm performance is passed through to workers. However, there is an important caveat, in that

our paper focuses on earnings changes among workers who are continuing with the firm. It is

possible that firms are more likely to lay-off workers in adverse circumstances and employment

risk has increased for American workers. We view this as an important topic for future research.

Notes. Samples are for workers aged 25-59 who stayed with the same employer for 6 years. Samples are
consistent across specifications. Statistics are IV coefficients from regressions of log earnings growth on firm log
revenue growth over the same interval. Column headings indicate whether growth is calculated as 1-, 3- or 5-
year changes. The length of the change in the instrument varies across rows; instrument dating is chosen so that
the midpoint of the instrument change coincides with the midpoint of the independent variable change. Additional
controls include single year of age indicators for men and for women; state, year, and four-digit industry
indicators; and, in Manufacturing and Retail, interactions between year and three-digit industry indicators.
Standard errors are clustered at the firm level and reported in parentheses (** p<0.01 *** p<0.001).

Notes. Samples are for workers aged 25-59 who stayed with the same employer for 4 years.
Statistics are OLS coefficients from regressions of log earnings growth on firm log revenue growth,
interacted with indicators for whether the change in firm revenues is positive or negative. Growth is
calculated as a 3-year change. Additional controls include single year of age indicators for men and
for women; state, year, and four-digit industry indicators; and, in Manufacturing and Retail,
interactions between year and three-digit industry indicators. Standard errors are clustered at the
firm level and reported in parentheses (** p<0.01 *** p<0.001).

Notes: Results are for workers aged 25-59 who stayed with the same employer for 6 years;
samples are split by workers' earnings rank within the firm, determined after controlling for age and
time. The dependent variable is the 5-year change in log worker earnings. Statistics are estimated
coefficients on the log change in revenues over a 5-year interval. The IV results instrument using
the 3-year change in log sales. Additional controls include single year of age indicators for men and
for women; state, year, and four-digit industry indicators; and, in Manufacturing and Retail,
interactions between year and three-digit industry indicators. Standard errors are clustered at the
firm level and reported in parentheses (** p<0.01 *** p<0.001).

Notes. Plots show binned averages (scatter points) and local polynomial regression smoothed values (red lines) for 3-year
changes in worker log earnings as related to 3-year changes in firm log revenues. Samples are for 4-year stayers. Each
point represents 2 percent of the relevant sample; the smallest and largest revenue change values are not plotted. The
(rounded) number of firm/year observations per bin for these figures are 5,900 for manufacturing, 2,500 for retail, 1,300
for professional services, and 140 for finance. Rounded worker/year observations are 437,100 for manufacturing, 39,800
for retail, 45,300 for professional services, and 6,300 for finance.

Notes. Samples are for workers aged 25-59 who stayed with the same employer for 4 years.
Samples are consistent across specifications. Statistics are OLS coefficients from regressions of log
earnings growth on firm log revenue growth. Column and row headings indicate whether growth is
calculated as 1- or 3-year changes. Additional controls include single year of age indicators for
men and for women; state, year, and four-digit industry indicators; and, in Manufacturing and
Retail, interactions between year and three-digit industry indicators. Standard errors are clustered
at the firm level and reported in parentheses (** p<0.01 *** p<0.001).

Notes. Samples are for workers aged 25-59 who stayed with the same employer for 4 years.
Samples are consistent across specifications. Statistics are IV coefficients from regressions of log
earnings growth on firm log revenue growth over the same interval. Column headings indicate
whether growth is calculated as 1- or 3-year changes. The length of the change in the instrument
varies across rows; instrument dating is chosen so that the midpoint of the instrument change
coincides with the midpoint of the independent variable change. Additional controls include single
year of age indicators for men and for women; state, year, and four-digit industry indicators; and, in
Manufacturing and Retail, interactions between year and three-digit industry indicators. Standard
errors are clustered at the firm level and reported in parentheses (** p<0.01 *** p<0.001).
