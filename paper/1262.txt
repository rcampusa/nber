           Incentive Effects of Taxes on Income from Capital:
                   Alternative Policies in the 1980's


                               ABSTRACT

   In this paper, we evaluate existing tax law as of 1980, President
Reagan's tax reform initiatives as enacted in the Economic Recovery Tax
Act of 1981 (ERTA) and the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of
1982 (TEFRA), as well as other proposals that were not enacted. For
each law, we measure marginal effective total tax rates for capital in
the corporate sector, the noncorporate sector, and the owner-occupied
housing sector. These rates include taxation under the corporate income
tax, the personal income tax, and property taxes, in order to capture
the full distortion of individuals' choices between present and future
consumption as well as the distortions in the choice of investment.

   Effective tax rates in 1980 were perceived as high in the corporate
sector, at least partly because of inflation, and especially when
compared to the tax-free treatment of imputed rents from owner-occupied
housing. In contrast, we find that (1) the total effective tax rate in
the corporate sector was only 35 percent, about half of the rate in some
previous estimates; (2) the total effective tax in the noncorporate
sector was 36 percent, higher than in the corporate sector; (3) the
total effective tax in owner-occupied housing was 19 percent, because of
a higher relative property tax rate; and (4) under either 1980 or 1982
law, the marginal effective total tax rate does not rise with inflation
in any sector or for the economy as a whole. By 1982 the rate in the
corporate sector fell to 30 percent, by more than in other sectors.

   A major goal of tax policy in recent years has been to increase

saving, investment, and the productivity of American workers.       To a

great extent, the perceived success of President Reagan's tax program

will depend upon its long run effects on total capital formation. Many

economists and an increasing number of policymakers, however, are

becoming concerned not just with the total amount of capital but with

the efficiency of its use.


   The amount of capital formation is influenced by the overall rate of

taxation of capital income. By imposing a wedge between the gross and

net returns to a capital asset, taxes lower the incentives to save and

invest. Taxes thus impose an intertemporal distortion, since a given

sacrifice of current consumption provides less return in the form of

future consumption than would be true in the absence of taxation.


   Examination of the effectiveness of the Reagan tax cuts, however,

should also focus on their impact on the efficiency of the allocation of

capital across assets and industries. If there were no taxes, investors

would tend to seek the most productive investments and combine them

efficiently. By contrast, the current tax system contains many diverse

features that create very high effective rates of tax on some

investments and very low rates of tax or even subsidy on others.

Investors are attracted to lightly taxed investments at the expense of

highly taxed investments, and the otherwise efficient use of capital is

disrupted. Tax differentials tend to change the allocation of capital

away from its most productive allocation. As a result, the total value

of output is reduced. Moreover, these efficiency costs arise even if
                                  -2-

overall incentives increase the total stock of capital in the long run.


   Some of these distortions involve the allocation of financial

capital. Corporations receive deductions for interest payments but not

for retained earnings or dividends, so they have an artificial incentive

to use debt rather than equity finance.      Within equity, because of

additional personal taxes on dividends, corporations may have an

artificial incentive to retain rather than distribute their earnings.

Individuals have incentives from the tax system to invest in municipal

rather than corporate bonds and to save through pensions rather than

regular savings accounts. All of these misallocations bear costs, as do

misallocations in terms of who saves and who bears risk.


   In this paper, we largely ignore these distortions in the allocation

of financial capital, in order to concentrate instead on distortions in

the allocation of real capital.         We investigate corporate and

noncorporate firms' or individuals' decisions regarding the use of

various kinds of equipment, structures, inventories, land and rental or

owner-occupied housing.   Differential tax rates on •such assets arise

because only equipment receives an investment tax credit, because

inventories and land receive no special allowances, and because there is

no taxation on the imputed return to owner-occupied housing. Effective

tax rates may differ even within one of these categories, as when the

same rate of investment tax credit is granted to machines with different

useful service lives, or when the same depreciation schedule is assigned

to assets that actually wear out at different rates.         Because of

different taxes in the corporate and noncorporate sectors, further

distortions arise in the allocation of real capital between sectors or
                                  -3-

among the various industries.


   In this paper, we evaluate existing tax law as of 1980, President

Reagan's tax reform initiatives as enacted in the Economic Recovery Tax

Act of 1981 (ERTA) and the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of

1982 (TEFRA), as well as other proposals that were not enacted.        For

each law, we measure marginal effective total tax rates for capital in

the corporate sector, the noncorporate sector, and the owner-occupied

housing sector. These rates include taxation under the corporate income

tax, the personal income tax, and property taxes, in order to capture

the full distortion of individuals' choices between present and future

consumption as well as the distortions in the choice of investment.'


A. General Results about the Taxation of Capital


   We obtain four rather surprising results regarding the taxation of

capital.   First, we find a lower effective tax rate on capital than

might have been predicted on the basis of previous studies. The average

effective total tax rate in the corporate sector, including all observed

taxes on past investment, has been estimated at about 70 percent prior

to the Reagan tax cuts.2 Several studies have indicated that the

marginal effective corporate tax rate in 1980, including only corporate

taxes on equity-financed marginal investments, was about 33 percent.3 In



 This study emphasizes changes in capital cost recovery and in the
 investment tax credit under ERTA and TEFRA. These laws also lowered
 marginal personal income tax rates and affected other features of the
 tax law regarding saving. We do not consider these other effects in
 this study.

2 See Feldstein, Dicks-Hireaux and Poterba (1983) and also Feldstein and
  Summers (1979).
                                    -4-

the current study we add personal taxes and property taxes and we assume

that the marginal investment is financed by the average mix of equity

and debt. Here, the corporate sector has an overall rate of about 35

percent in 1980," but the low taxation of the large owner-occupied

housing sector pulls the marginal rate for the economy down to 29

percent. Under 1982 law, these rates are 30 percent for the corporate

sector and only 26 percent for all capital income in the economy.


     Second, while any given asset would be taxed more in the corporate

sector than in the noncorporate sector, the mean rate in the
noncorporate sector is higher than the mean rate in the corporate

sector. This reversal occurs because the noncorporate sector has more

weight on highly taxed assets such as land and structures.


     Third, we find a tax rate on owner-occupied housing of 19 percent.

This is contrary to the common perception that owner-occupied housing

faces zero taxation as a result of exemption of imputed rents. While

this feature certainly serves to lower the effective tax rate in this

sector, property taxes are levied at a higher rate on housing than on

industrial capital. With the lower-than-perceived tax rate on corporate

capital and the higher-than-perceived tax rate on housing, our study

suggests that the differential between tax rates in the two sectors was

less dramatic than some architects of ERTA might have believed.




     See Gravelle (1982), and Hulten and Robertson (1982), and Fullerton
     and Henderson (1983).

'4
     Our finding for the corporate sector is close to the 37 percent rate
     found by King and Fullerton (1984). Fullerton (1984) catalogues
     reasons why average total tax rates may differ from marginal total tax
     rates.
                                   -5-

  Fourth, inflation adds to taxes in the corporate sector because of

historical cost depreciation, taxation of nominal capital gains, and tax

rules for insurance companies, but it subtracts from total taxes because

the corporate rate for nominal interest deductions exceeds the personal

rate at which nominal interest is taxed. Here, as in King and Fullerton

(1984), we find that taxes on corporate equipment and structures

increase with inflation.     When we add assets that do not receive

depreciation allowances, such as corporate land and owner-occupied

housing, we find that nominal interest deductions are important. Total

taxes in the economy are invariant to inflation, even though disparities

in the tax treatments of different assets increase with inflation. The

approximate constancy of capital taxation contrasts with the findings of

Feldstein and Summers (1979), who found sharp increases in tax rates as

a result of inflation.


B. Summary of Tax Rates in the 1980's


   We find that the 1981 law, if it had been left in place through 1986,

would have greatly reduced the cost-of-capital in all industries except

owner-occupied housing. This law would have caused major reductions in

intertemporal distortions, thus promoting expansion of the capital stock

in the long run.    Capital costs for most types of equipment, however,

would have been reduced much more than costs for structures, land, or

inventories.    As a result, the 1981 law would have introduced major

interasset     distortions which   increase with   the elasticity    of

substitution among assets. The 1982 law abortd the transition to lower

capital costs. Effects are similar to those of the ultimate 1981 law,

but they are smaller.      Nevertheless, the reductions in the cost of
                                  -6-

business capital are still significant.      The overall reduction in

taxation should help to spur investment in the long run, as intended by

the architects of the Reagan program.5


   Our study also examines tax reforms that have been advanced by others

in recent years. The Auerbach-JorgenSOfl (1980) proposal, because it

allows economic depreciation at replacement cost, would result in

uniform capital costs across assets.     Interasset distortions would be

eliminated1 and the efficiency gain from this reform could be expected

to increase with the assumed substitution elasticity among assets.

Corporate firms would still be taxed differently from noncorporate

firms, so intersectoral distortions would      remain dependent on the

intersectoral substitution elasticity.


   If the corporate income tax were repealed, corporations would no

longer receive investment tax credits,         accelerated depreciation

allowances, interest deductions, or property tax deductions. As in King

and Fullerton (1984), we find that elimination of the corporate tax

would reduce taxes in the corporate sector by 2 percentage points under

 l98O law, but it would raise effective tax rates and capital costs under

 1982 law.   Thus the corporate "tax" is really a marginal subsidy, but

 variations in capital costs remain high.      Integration with personal

 taxes, on the other hand, does not eliminate credits and deductions.



   Our aim is to measure the long run consequences of tax reform.
   Changes in monetary policy between 1980 and 1982 might have altered
   observed interest rates and inflation rates, and therefore might have
   offset (or reinforced) the impact of the accelerated cost recovery
   provisions on effective tax rates. We are not concerned with such
   factors, however, because we do not attempt to measure tax rates in
   1982 as opposed to 1980. Rather, we look at the difference between
   the tax laws, holding all other economic variables constant.
                                  —7—

All taxable corporate income would be passed through to the stockholders

and would be taxed only at their personal rates. Overall capital costs

would fall slightly, but the variation among capital costs would fall

dramatically.


C. The Rest of the Paper


   Section II discusses each alternative tax regime in more detail.     It


refers to the Technical Appendix for a discussion of the uses of cost-

of-capital data in examining economic efficiency and for a derivation of

capital cost formulas for each asset in each sector.      These capital

costs, or required pre-tax rates of return, are sometimes difficult to

interpret by themselves. For this reason, when we report the results of

our calculations we always compare this pre-tax return to a fixed real

after-tax return. The difference, as a fraction of the pre-tax return,

 is an effective tax rate measure which includes corporate taxes,

personal taxes, and property taxes. Section II includes results for all

 assets in the corporate sector under each tax regime, and Section III

 goes on to consider the noncorporate sector and housing. Section IV

 then investigates the sensitivity of results to alternative assumptions.

 We measure the effect of inflation by plotting the overall effective tax

 rate as a function of the inflation rate. Section V is a conclusion.




                       II. Alternative Tax Regimes


    We use cost-of-capital formulas like those in Hall and Jorgenson

 (1967) to measure the marginal cost of capital for each asset under each

 tax regime. These formulas are derived in the Technical Appendix, but
                                 -8-

they can be summarized here. We also introduce notation in the text, in

order to discuss the values of the parameters needed to calculate

capital costs.


   In general, we consider a hypothetical firm that is trying to decide

whether or not to buy a particular asset. This asset may be any one of

the 38 assets listed in left-hand column of Table 1. These definitions

are combinations of more diverse asset types, but they still provide

considerable disaggregation.    We treat each of these assets as
individually homogeneous, in the sense that each has a single tax

treatment and economic depreciation rate (ô). The first 20 assets are

types of equipment, the next 15 are types of structures, and the last

two are inventories and land.6 Our values for 5 are shown in column 1 of

Table 1.   These rates of depreciation were estimated by Hulten and

Wykoff (1981), and their availablity provides the major reason for using

this particular set of asset definitions.1 The estimated depreciation

rates range from a low of .015 for housing to a high of .333 for

automobiles. Inventories and land do not depreciate (nor are they given

depreciation allowances under any tax regime).


   Upon purchasing the asset, our hypothetical firm receives an

investment tax credit at rate k. Discussion of these values is deferred




6 The firm may also earn income on intangible assets such as knowledge
  acquired through research, or goodwill acquired through advertising.
  Because we do not have adequate estimates for the stock of these
  assets in each industry, they are excluded from this study.

  For assets 27 through 31, the depreciation rates come from Jorgenson
  and Sullivan (1981). They use the Hulten-Wykoff methodology to obtain
  estimates for these additional assets. The rate for housing is an
  unpublished estimate of Hulten and Wykoff.

to the section for each tax regime, but we always assume that the firm

has enough tax liability to make use of the credit.


   Out of the return to the asset, the firm must pay a wealth tax (at

rate w) on the value of the asset each year. These state and local

property tax rates vary among thousands of jurisdictions, so we estimate

average rates based on data from the Advisory             Commission on

Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR), as found in Harriss (1974). These

data provide property taxes paid in 1972 on business realty (land and

structures), business personalty (equipment and inventories), public

utility structures, and household realty (rental and owner-occupied

housing). We scale each of these tax amounts upward to 1977, using

Commerce Department data on total property taxes in 1977 and 1972; we

then divide each 1977 estimate by the corresponding 1977 capital stocks

as described below.     The resulting rates, applied either to the

corporate or noncorporate sector, are         .00768 for equipment and

inventories, .01126 for business land and structures, .01550 for public

utilities, and .01837 for household realty (land and structures).


   On its return net of property taxes, the corporation is taxed at the

statutory rate u. We use .46 for the federal statutory rate on marginal

corporate income, since this top bracket rate applies to the largest

firms with essentially all of the corporate capital stock.            The

weighted-average of the statest top-bracket rates is .0655, including

zeros for states without corporate taxes and using personal income to

weight the fifty states.     The total statutory rate, accounting for

 deductibility of     state taxes     at   the federal   level   is   then

 .46 + .0655(l-.46). We use this value, .495, for u.
                                  -10-

   The noncorporate firm is taxed at the statutory rate t1.          We   use

.365 for this parameter, obtained as the weighted average of marginal

statutory tax rates on entrepreneurial income of 25,000 individual tax

returns in the TAXSIM data file of the National Bureau of Economic

Research (NBER).


   The after-tax return to this hypothetical firm is expected to grow in

nominal terms at the rate of inflation (it),   generally   set at 7 percent.

For most tax -schemes, the firm also receives future depreciation

allowances that are specified in nominal amounts for a fixed number of

years. We calculate the present value of these depreciation allowances

(z), and the present value of the nominal after-tax returns, using the

nominal after-tax discount rate for the firm. These discount rates are

discussed in the Appendix, but they are derived such that the real

after-tax return to the average investor is a parameter s, set to 5

percent.


   In considering this investment, our hypothetical firm compares the

acquisition cost (net of investment tax credits) to the present

discounted value of after-tax returns and tax savings from depreciation

allowances. In equilibrium, the net outlay would just equal the present

value of net returns from the marginal investment. We then use this

equality to solve for the gross-of-tax return that the asset must earn

in order to cover taxes and still yield the minimum required after-tax

return. The required pre-tax return net of depreciation (p) is the

cost-of-capital for that asset.


   Because firms can make certain choices about depreciation lifetimes

and schedules, actual capital costs may be affected by those choices.
                                —11—

When accelerated depreciation was first introduced, for example, Vasquez

(1974) found that firms were slow to adopt the more advantageous

schedules. Because there is no procedure to predict actual choices for

untried tax schemes, however, we compare all schemes under the

assumption that firms make choices that minimize their taxes.      This

approach has the further advantage that it allows us to calculate

comparable capital costs based only on tax provisions rather than on

actual practices. We extend this assumption to firms' choices with

respect to inventory accounting. Under all tax regimes we assume that

firms minimize their taxes by using only last-in-first-out (LIFO)

inventory accounting. This method allows the firm to avoid taxes on

purely nominal accounting profits, but it does not avoid taxes on real

profits associated with investing in inventories.8


   Our parameter s, the real return after personal taxes, is defined as

a weighted-average of returns to different individuals who finance the

marginal investment. In the corporate sector, the asset's purchase is

financed by new share issues, retained earnings, and debt, in the

proportions c5, cre, and cd respectively. King and Fullerton (1984)

provide information on these three proportions for each of three

different corporate industry groups.     When we weight by corporate

capital stock, we obtain overall proportions of .0490 for new shares,

.6143 for retained earnings, and .3367 for debt.




  An equity-financed investment in inventories must yield a return in
  the form of real corporate profits that is at least as high as the
  return that could have been earned on an alternative investment.
  These real corporate profits are taxed at the .495 corporate rate.
                                       -12-

  Investments financed by new shares earn a return which is paid out in

dividends and taxed at rate 't            .   The TAXSIM data file of the NBER
                                     ns
provides a tax rate of .475 for marginal dividend income, including

state taxes and averaged over 25,000 households.             King and Fullerton

(1984) provide additional tax rates and weights for dividends received

by tax-exempt institutions and insurance companies. When marginal tax

rates for these three categories are weighted together, we obtain .356

fortns

   Investments that are financed by retained earnings provide owners of

equity with accrued nominal capital gains that are taxed at the

effective accrued rate 'r        .   The NBERts TAXSIM file is again used to
                            re

find the weighted-average statutory rate on marginal capital gains of

households, incorporating the 60 percent exclusion on long-term capital

gains.   This 28 percent rate is further reduced to account for the

deferral advantage and the increase of basis at death. Following King

and Fullerton (1984), the final 7 percent rate for households is

averaged with zero for tax-exempt institutions and .14 for insurance

companies to obtain .058 for t
                              re

   Finally, investments financed by debt earn a return which is paid out

as interest and taxed at rate                 The TAXSIM file places the average

householdts marginal rate at .325, including state taxes, but King and

Fullerton (1984) reduce this rate to .284 to account for interest that

is paid to banks and received by households in the form of tax-free

banking services.     Insurance companies' tax rates increase with

inflation because of the complex tienge Formula, but the net effect is

summarized in the estimate (.149 + 3.88ir), where ii is the rate of
                                -13-

inflation.8 When households, tax-exempts, and insurance companies are

weighted together, the overall value for Td comes to (.196 + .595'n).

This rate changes as we vary n, but td is .238 in the standard case
where inflation is seven percent.


   Of marginal investments in the noncorporate sector, a fraction d is

financed by debt, and n is financed by equity of the entrepreneur.

Little evidence    is   available on the complicated financing of

noncorporate business in the U.S., but our rough estimates suggest that

it is not dissimilar in aggregate to the financing of corporate

business, that is, one-third debt.1°


   Finally, for owner-occupied housing, we need a fraction hd for debt

and he for equity. New homes are financed with a very large proportion

of debt, but we are considering a permanent change in the steady state

allocation of capital. The loan to value ratio typically falls as the

house ages, and we want total mortgage debt as a fraction of total

market value. Unpublished estimates from the Census Bureau suggest that

this ratio is again very close to one-third.1 As a consequence, we use

the same fraction for debt financing in all three sectors.




  The estimate of the effective tax rate on life insurance companies
  summarizes a complex set of rules. For a description of this aspect
  of the tax code and discussion of modeling choices, see King and
  Fullerton (1984).   Revisions in the tax treatment of insurance
  companies are under discussion in Congress at the time of this
  writing, but we have not included any new proposals in this paper.

 10 The ratio of noncorporate interest payments to an estimate of the
    share of noncorporate income attributable to capital, from the July
    1982 Survey of Current Business, is almost identical to the ratio of
   corporate interest payments to corporate income from capital.

   We are grateful to Peter Fronczek for providing these numbers.
                                 -14-

     The weighted-average marginal tax rate for these homeowners is

estimated at .26 by the TAXSIM model of NBER. Data in Fullerton and

Gordon (1983) suggest that 44.8 percent of property taxes are deducted,

so      the    effective   homeownerst      property   tax    rate    is


[1-(.448)(.26)](.0l837), which equals .01623.


     The required pre-tax returns from each tax scheme are important

parameters in that they summarize the cumulative impact of personal

taxes, property taxes, and corporate taxes. Because they are numbers

like .06 or .08, however, they are sometimes difficult to interpret by

themselves. The parameter s represents the real return after all taxes,

so the difference (p-s) is due solely to taxes.         This difference,

expressed as a fraction of the pre-tax return, is a measure of the

ttmarginal effective total tax rate" in the terminology of Fullerton

(1984). These numbers are presented in the tables below because they

are comparable to tax-inclusive ad valorem tax rates such as the 46

percent statutory corporate rate.       They are reduced relative to the

corporate rate because of investment tax credits and accelerated

depreciation allowances, but they are raised relative to the corporate

rate because of property taxes and personal taxes.


     The rest of this section describes relevant aspects of (A.) the tax

law in the United States as it stood in 1980, (B.) the ultimate version

of the 1981 tax law (ERTA), if phased reductions had been allowed to

continue through 1986, (C.) current tax law as it stands after TEFRA,

the 1982 tax law, (D.) an alternative reform suggested by Auerbach and

Jorgenson (1980), (E.) the integration of corporate and personal income

taxes, and (F.) the elimination of the corporate income tax. For each
                                -15-

tax regime, we present marginal effective total tax rates for each asset

and for each industry.


A. Tax Law as of 1980


   The investment tax credit was introduced in 1962, repealed in 1969,

reintroduced in 1971, and raised in 1975. As of 1980, the credit stood

at a ten percent rate for all public utility structures and for

equipment with tax lifetimes of at least seven years; two-thirds of that

for equipment with lifetimes of at least five years; and one-third for

equipment with lifetimes of at least three years. Since we treat each

of the assets in Table 1 as individually homogeneous, column 2 assigns a

ten percent credit to all public utility structures (assets 27-31) and

to any type of equipment that has a tax lifetime of at least seven

years. Tractors (asset 4) and trucks (asset 14) have five year lives

and 6.67 percent credits, while autos (asset 15) have a three year life

and 3.33 percent credit.


   Our lifetimes for each asset are shown in column 3.         The 1962

Guideline lifetimes applied to many diverse assets, and these were

aggregated by Jorgenson and Sullivan (1981) to the 35 depreciable asset

types shown here. The Asset Depreciation Range (ADR) System, introduced

in 1971 and still effective in 1980, allowed firms to use 80 to 120

percent of these Guideline lifetimes for equipment and public utility

structures.   Because firms minimize their taxes by assumption, they

would use the shortest available lifetimes unless that choice had the

effect of raising taxes by lowering the investment tax credit.        We

reduce the Guideline lifetime estimates accordingly.     Computers, for

example, may be depreciated over 5, 6, or 7 years under 1980 law. Firms
                                  -16-

would choose 5 years if not for the credit, but they choose 7 years (as

shown in column 3 of Table 1) in order to receive the 10 percent credit

and minimize taxes.12


   The 1980 tax scheme, like most others, has separate depreciation

rules for different kinds of assets. Double declining balance (DDB) and

surn-of-the-years'-digits (SYD) can be used for equipment, public utility

property,     single-purpose agricultural structures,   and residential

structures.    If we define L as the asset's lifetime for tax purposes,

then DDB allows depreciation equal to 2/L of the remaining basis each

year.   Because of the half-year convention, however, all assets are

assumed to have been purchased on July 1. They receive half of the DDB

amount, (i/L), in the year of purchase and 2/L of the remaining basis,

(l-l/L), in the first full year of ownership. At this point, as shown

in Fullerton and Henderson (1983), the firm would minimize taxes by

switching to SYD. If there are 3.5 years left (as for a 5 year asset),

the firm takes the basis remaining at the time of the switch and divides

it over the remaining years according to the fractions obtained by using

a denominator of 8.0 and numerators of 3.5, 2.5, 1.5, and 0.5.


   For other structures, firms could use 150 percent of declining

balance (l.5/L of remaining basis each year), with an optimal switch to




12 Lifetimes for many of the 35 assets are actually averaged over more
   diverse asset categories. As a result, only some of the assets in
   one of our categories may need their lifetimes adjusted to receive
   higher credits.    Since the aggregation to 35. assets provides
   considerable detail, however, it seems appropriate to treat each
   asset as individually homogeneous.      One example of where this
   treatment may be less appropriate is in mining, shafts and wells.
   The 6.8 year life here reflects an average of intangible drilling
   with a zero life and other structures with a longer life.
                                —17—

straight-line after one-third of the life of the asset. The firm must

begin straight-line depreciation at the start of a tax year, however,

and we assume that they make this choice to take the earliest allowable

deductions (to minimize taxes). We also assume that the firm buys only

new assets and holds them forever, so that we can abstract from problems

with recapture taxes or scrap values.


   These depreciation allowances, specified by law over a finite number

of years for each asset, are discounted by the firm's nominal after-tax

rate of return because allowances are based on historical cost. The

present value of allowances per dollar of original basis is the

parameter z in equation (A2) of the appendix. Since the entire purchase

price was depreciable in 1980, we use 1.0 for the parameter a.'3


   We have now specified enough information to calculate effective tax

rates under 1980 law for each asset, and rates for the corporate sector

are shown in column 1 of Table 2. Note that the first twenty assets,

types of equipment, have rates that vary from a subsidy of 27 percent

(for computers) to a tax of 22 percent (for ships and boats). Public

utility structures (assets 27-31) also receive investment tax credits,

but they have longer depreciation lifetimes and tax rates that are all

about 33 percent.      Other structures receive no credits, longer

lifetimes, and depreciation at only 150 percent of declining balance, so




 13 Fullerton and Henderson (1983) provide more thorough descriptions of
    depreciation allowances and discounting.    particular, the formulas
   in that paper indicate that while the depreciation allowances are
   discrete amounts for each year, we discount them continuously over
   the course of the year. This procedure recognizes the fact that the
   basis declines annually, not continuously, and that deductions
   earlier in the year are worth more than those at the end of the year.

their tax rates vary from 44 to 56 percent.         With inflation, these

allowances are sometimes less than economic depreciation at replacement

cost. Business land and inventories, which actually receive economic

allowances since they do not depreciate, have

of 40 and 36 percent, respectively. These rates include property taxes

that differ by asset and personal taxes that do not differ by asset.

The wide disparities, from -27 to +56 percent across all assets,

indicate the potential for significant misallocation of capital.

B. The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981


  While many provisions of the 1981 Tax Act were to phase-in over

several years, the investment tax credit changed immediately to a six

percent rate for automobiles and ten percent for all other equipment and

public utility property. These credit rates are shown in column 4 of

Table 1.   Because of our assumption of no carryover problems, both sets

of credit rates reflect statutory credits and do not reflect any

increase in availability of the credit through the 1981 law's extended

carryover and leasing provisions.


   Column 5 displays lifetimes of each asset under the Accelerated Cost

Recovery System (ACRS), assuming again that each asset is homogeneous.

The law assigns a three year life to autos, light trucks, R&D equipment,

certain racehorses, and personal property with an ADR midpoint of four

years or less. Our level of aggregation shows autos with a three year

life, but none of the other assets has an (average) ADR midpoint of four

years or less.     Thus, all other equipment gets a five year life.

Similarly, for public utility structures, we assigned a ten year life to

any asset category with an ADR midpoint between 18 and 25 years, as

provided in the law. All other structures have a 15 year life, except

mining, shafts, and wells which we reduced from a 6.8 to a 5 year life.


    Although these shorter lives were effective immediately, depreciation

 of new equipment was scheduled to accelerate from 150 percent of

 declining balance to 175 percent of declining balance during a five year

 phase-in period. After 1985, new equipment was again to be depreciated

 by double declining balance, again with an optimal switch to sum-of-the-
                                -20-

year's-digits.'5 We evaluate only this final set of rules, originally

scheduled to begin in 1986. All structures immediately received a 175

percent declining balance rate, replacing both the 150 percent rate for

nonresidential property and the 200 percent rate for new residential

property. All structures switch at the optimal time from 175 percent

declining balance to straight-line, after three-sevenths of the life of

the asset.16


   The 1981 law also provides phased reductions of personal marginal tax

rates. While the top marginal rate fell from 70 percent to 50 percent

immediately, all other rates are reduced by 23 percent over three years.

After 1985, personal rate brackets are scheduled to be indexed for

inflation. We wish to compare 1980 with the ultimate (1986) version of

ERTA, but we cannot simply reduce personal rates by 23 percent.

Inflation after 1980 will erode at least some of these rate cuts by the

time indexing starts in 1985. In fact, King and Fullerton (1984) find




15 An interesting difference, however, is that depreciation of the last
   half year is moved up. The five year asset in the earlier example
   receives DDB for 1.5 years as before, but SYD over only 3 remaining
   years instead of 3.5. Thus, even where the asset's lifetime was not
   shortened (as for assets 5 and 14), the present value of allowances
   (z) is still higher under 1981 law.

16 The optimal switch point for 175 percent of declining balance is
   calculated as (1.75 - 1.0)/1.75 as shown in Fullerton and Henderson
   (1983). Rather than specify allowable schedules and let the firm
   choose, however, the 1981 and 1982 laws provide tables with
   depreciation amounts for each year. These amounts are calculated for
   the tables by using the rules described in the text, assuming that
   firms want the earliest possible deductions. We thus effectively use
   the tables for the new laws, and we use comparable tax-minimizing
   choices for the old law. The new law is less flexible, however,
   because it mandates the earliest possible deductions. If the firm
   did not expect a steady stream of positive taxable profits, as is
   assumed in this paper, it might prefer to delay some deductions by
   using a longer life or by making an early switch to straight-line.

that it would take an annual inflation rate of only about seven percent

over those six years to completely negate the 23 percent cut.   For this

reason, we ignore personal tax changes specified     in ERTA.   We also

abstract from changes related to tax-free "all-savers' certificates" for

individuals, charitable deductions for nonitemizers, reductions in the

marriage penalty for two-earner families, and other provisions that do

not pertain primarily to business income from real capital assets.


   Effective tax rates under ERTA are shown for each asset in column 2

of Table 2.    Rates for equipment are all negative, while rates for

structures range up to 45 percent. Since land and inventories receive

no credits or deductions anyway, their effective tax rates are unchanged

from 1980.    Because the relatively high 1980 rates for these assets

remain high while the relatively low 1980 rates for equipment are

reduced, it appears that the potential for capital misallocations would

be worse under ERTA.


   Previous estimates of the marginal effective corporate tax rate under

ERTA have consistently been negative for all types of equipment. The

implication is that credits and accelerated depreciation deductions

outweigh the corporate tax and provide a net subsidy on income from

marginal investments in these assets. Yet Table 2 indicates that the

marginal effective total tax rates are negative. The implication here

 is that the subsidy at the corporate level is so large that it

 completely offsets property taxes and personal taxes, even though

 personal taxes apply to nominal income.17



    This marginal subsidy can be received by any corporation with
    sufficient taxable profits against which to take the credits and
                                  -22-

     Since depreciation schedules were to be the same in 1986 as they were

in 1980, we can also see how sensitive tax rates are to lifetimes and

credits. When only the lifetime for computers (asset 11) changes from 7

to 5 years, the total effective tax rate changes from a -27 percent to a

-233 percent. When only the credit for autos (asset 15) changes from

.033 to .06, its effective tax rate changes from a positive 11 percent

to a negative 104 percent.'8


     The corresponding industry tax rates are shown in column 2 of Table

3.    The fact that all these rates exceed zero reflects weights on

structures, inventories and land in all industries.        These averaged

rates still reflect more variance than they did in 1980.


C. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982


     The scheduled increase for depreciation of equipment was never

allowed to take place, since TEFRA effectively repealed the transition

to double-declining balance. It retained the investment tax credits and

the shorter lives of ACRS, but it left equipment with 150 percent of

declining balance and an optimal switch to straight-line.       Structures

had no transition in the 1981 law, so they are left at 175 percent of



      deductions.   These taxable profits might include a.) the normal
      return to old investments upon which taxes were deferred, b.) normal
      returns to taxed investments like land and inventories, c.)
      unexpected returns, or d.) monopoly profits. The investing firm
      need not even have its own taxable profits if there is a mechanism
      for the transfer of tax benefits between firms.   The safe harbor
      leasing provisions of the 1981 Tax Act provided  such a mechanism.
      Still, the large subsidies found in this paper      indicate great
      potential for the marginal investment to receive asymmetric treatment
      in firms with and without taxable profits.

 18 These rate reductions also incorporate the fact that ERTA moves up
    the last half year of depreciation.
                                -23-

declining balance with a switch to straight-line. These specifications

provide enough information to calculate z, the present value of

allowances per dollar of basis. Also, however, TEFRA reduced the basis

for depreciation by half of the investment tax credit.             As a

consequence, we set the depreciable proportion parameter (a) to .95 for

equipment and public utility property with a ten percent credit and to

.97 for autos with a six percent credit.


   Again we abstract from other changes in TEFRA that are not related to

the taxation of income from real business assets, including newly

introduced excise taxes, medical and casualty loss deductions, and

individual minimum tax provisions. Since our hypothetical firm always

has sufficient tax liability to use all of its credits and deductions,

it is unaffected by TEFRA's restrictions of safe-harbor leasing.


   The resulting tax rates for equipment are mostly negative, as shown

in column 3 of Table 2.    Although they use the ACRS lifetimes of the

1981 law, their overall levels are closer to 1980 law.     In fact, for

many of the assets (e.g., tractors, some types of machinery, computers,

trucks, aircraft, and electric utility property), 1982 tax rates are

higher than 1980 rates (for the same expected rate of inflation). For

these assets, the tax-raising effect of the basis adjustment outweighs

the tax-reducing effect of shortened tax lives. The tendency for tax

rates to be higher under 1962 law is stronger when the comparison is

made under the assumption of low inflation rates in both periods. When

tax rates are computed under the assumption of four percent inflation,

for example, more types of equipment show higher tax rates under 1982

 law than under 1980 law. Real depreciatibn allowances (z) are greater
                                    -24-

at low inflation rates, so the tax-increasing basis adjustment is more

important at low inflation rates.


  Taxation of structures is the same under the 1982 law as under the

1981 law. Column 3 of Table 3 shows tax rates by industry, reflecting

their asset compositions.


D. The Auerbach-Jorgenson Proposal


   Next, our study evaluates other investment incentive plans that were

not adopted. The Auerbach-Jorgenson (1980) first year capital recovery

plan gives the firm one depreciation deduction at the time the asset is

purchased, equal to the expected present value of economic depreciation

at replacement cost. Since future economic depreciation is discounted

at a constant real after-tax discount rate, this proposal effectively

indexes depreciation allowances for inflation.    It treats all assets

symmetrically in the sense that it provides a high first year deduction

for equipment with a high 6, a low deduction for structures with a low

6, and no deduction for land and inventories which do not depreciate.


   If a.) there is no investment tax credit, b.) Hulten-Wykoff

depreciation rates are used to determine economic depreciation, and c.)

the firm's real discount rate is used to calculate the first year

recovery, then estimates of the marginal effective corporate tax rate

are equal to the statutory 49.5 percent rate for all assets.    If this

depreciation is well measured, then this plan removes all inter-asset

distortions in the corporate sector.9 Similar allowances in the



 19 On the other hand, if actual depreciation differs from Hulten-Wykoff
    estimates or if the government does not use the firm's discount rate
                                    -25-

noncorporate sector can remove interasset distortions there, but

intersectoral distortions may remain if the noncorporate sector

continues to be taxed at a lower rate. Interindustry distortions remain

              industries    are                          incorporated,    and
if     some                        disproportionately

intertemporal    distortions
                            20
disproportionately taxed.


     Column 4 of Table 2 shows the marginal effective total tax rate for

each asset under this plan. Although corporate taxes and personal taxes

on these assets are uniform, property taxes are imposed at a .8 percent

rate on all kinds of equipment, a 1.1 percent rate on nonresidential

structures, and a 1.55 percent rate on public utility property.

Marginal effective total tax rates vary little, but they are ordered

across these assets according to these property tax rates. Industry

effective tax rates in column 4 of Table 3 vary even less.


E. Integration of Corporate and Personal Taxes.


     Because of the potential for distortions when extra taxes are imposed

on the corporate sector, many have suggested integrating the corporate

 and personal tax systems. Some have suggested partial integration plans

 such as allowing corporations to deduct dividends, such that this income




     when it sets the first-year allowances for each asset, then effective
     tax rates can still vary among assets.

 20 Brown (1981) suggests an investment credit that is proportional to
    the difference between the acquisition cost of the asset and its
    first year allowance.    This particular choice of asset-dependent
    credits and first year write-offs results in uniform effective
    corporate taxes at a rate lower than 49.5 percent. This uniform tax
    rate can be as high or as low as desired, or even zero, equivalent to
    immediate expensing of the entire acquisition cost.
                                 -26-

is taxed only at the personal level. Here, we evaluate only a full form

of integration, and we compare it to current 1982 tax law.      Further

discussion of many such plans and their effects is provided by ticLure

(1979).


    Our specification of this reform involves retaining investment tax

credits and depreciation allowances, just as these features exist in

1982 for the noncorporate sector. We then trace all taxable corporate

income through to be taxed only at the level of the individuals who own

the corporations.    Interest is still taxed at the rate 'td but all

retained or distributed corporate profits are taxed at         the full

personal rate of corporate stockholders.     Intersectoral distortions

remain to the extent that these personal tax rates differ from the

personal rate of entrepreneurs, and interasset distortions may remain to

the extent that credits and depreciation allowances have differential

impacts on assets.

-

    Column 5 of Table 2 shows the marginal effective total tax rates on

assets in the corporate sector with integration. These rates are very

similar to those of the noncorporate sector in 1982. Rates on equipment

are reduced from 1982 corporate numbers which vary around zero to

numbers which are all negative. Thus, with integration, personal taxes

and property taxes are effectively offset by credits and accelerated

depreciation deductions for these assets.     Rates on structures are

reduced from numbers around 38 percent to numbers around 30 percent.


    Because industries use these assets in different proportions,

industry tax rates still vary in column 5 of Table 3.       Some inter-

industry distortions thus remain, in contrast to previous models where
                                  -27-

all industry distortions are based on extra corporate taxes and

differential degrees of incorporation. Intertemporal distortions remain

as well.


F. Elimination of the Corporate Income Tax


   The last set of calculations does not represent a serious or even

necessarily desirable policy proposal. Instead, we are merely trying to

help evaluate the overall impact of the corporate tax in any of the

first four regimes described above.      Since personal taxes and property

taxes are constant across all of those simulations, any of the first

four sets of tax rates (1980, 1981, 1982, AJ) can be compared to those

from a world with just the personal and property taxes.


   Elimination of the corporate tax, by this definition, involves

concomitant elimination of the corporationst investment tax credits (k),

depreciation deductions    (z),   and interest deductions.              The IRS

undertakes no interactions with corporations, but it continues to

collect personal taxes as before on all nominal interest receipts,

dividends, capital gains, and noncorporate income. In equations of the

appendix, these specifications merely imply that k =   u   =   z = 0.


   Column 6 •of Table 2 exhibits fairly high effective tax rates,

differing only to the extent that property taxes differ by asset.           Tax

rates for equipment are higher than those for any other tax plan except

the Auerbach-Jorgenson plan.21 These findings are consistent with



 21 While the AJ proposal effectively taxes all equity-financed
    investments at the 49.5 percent statutory rate of the corporation, it
    still allows deductions for nominal interest payments.   It also
    allows a first-year recovery for depreciation.    Repeal  of the
                                 -28-

previous findings that the corporate tax system amounts to a net subsidy

for equipment. Other assets, however, receive no investment tax credits

and less accelerated depreciation.      Because inflation may reduce the

real values of allowances to less than economic depreciation, effective

total tax rates on structures under the 1980 law and 1982 law are about

50 and 38 percent, respectively. Under either law, taxes on land and

inventories are 40 and 36 percent. The elimination of the corporate tax

more than offsets the elimination of nominal interest deductions in

these cases, because these rates fall to 33 percent for structures, 33

percent for land, and 30 percent for inventories.


   When weighted by the use of assets in each indutry, marginal

effective total tax rates under repeal are shown in column 6 of Table 3

for each of our 18 industries.




               III. The Noncorporate Sector and Housing


   The noncorporate entrepreneur is taxed by rules similar to those for

the corporation but has a .365 personal tax rate rather than the .495

corporate rate. Effective tax rates therefore vary in a similar manner

across the 38 assets, but the overall level is different.       For this

reason, we do not provide noncorporate rates on all assets under each

scheme.   Instead, table 4 provides some summary statistics on the




   corporate tax, on the other hand, would allow no investment tax
   credits, no interest deductions, and no allowances for depreciation
   —  even economic depreciation. The estimated effective tax rates
   reflect the fact that the personal tax applies to nominal interest
   receipts, since they are designed to include all taxes as a fraction
   of real income from the asset.

overall levels of tax for the twenty kinds of equipment averaged

together, the nine types of business structures averaged together, and

the five public utility structures averaged together, as well as for

land and inventories.


   Under the 1980 law, shown in column 1, we obtain the surprising

result that the 35.8 percent overall tax rate in the noncorporate sector

exceeds the 34.5 percent rate in the corporate sector. A noncorporate

firm would not reduce its taxes by incorporating, however, because on

any one activity, the corporate rate exceeds the noncorporate rate.   In

the corporate and noncorporate sectors, respectively, equipment is taxed

at rates of +5 and -2 percent, structures are taxed at iates of 50 and

39 percent, while land is taxed at rates of 40 and 36 percent. The

explanation of the overall tax rates is that noncorporate firms use much

more of the highly taxed structures and land.


   Still, the difference between the two sectors is not great. The fact

that the corporate statutory rate exceeds the entrepeneur's rate implies

higher taxes on some assets but higher interest deductions and subsidies

on other assets. Additional personal taxes on corporate income are very

small. The 5.8 percent capital gains rate applies to the large share of

finance through retained earnings, and the 35.6 percent dividends rate

applies only to the tiny share of financing through new issues.


   The overall rate in the noncorporate sector includes 39 and 40

percent effective tax rates, respectively, on structures and land in

rental housing. By contrast, the effective tax on structures or land in

owner-occupied housing is only 18.6 percent. This rate represents only

state and local property taxes, reduced to the degree that they are
                                  -30-

deducted from personal taxes. The rate is further reduced to the degree

that mortgage interest is deducted at a rate greater than the rate at

which interest receipts are taxed.


   When averaged over the entire economy, the marginal effective total

tax rate in 1980 was 28.8 percent, reflecting an after-tax return of .05

and a pre-tax return of .070.        Though we have not yet measured

misallocations associated with variations of this cum-tax cost-of-

capital across assets and sectors, the weighted standard deviation of

.017 indicates potential for excess burden.


   The second and third columns of Table 4 indicate that the Economic

Recovery Tax Act would have reduced corporate taxes dramatically but

that the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act removed about half of

that tax cut.       Equipment in either sector would have been heavily

subsidized under ERTA but is now only slightly subsidized. The tax cuts

for public utility structures were almost completely removed, while the

tax cuts for structures were not touched by TEFRA. In contrast, neither

law provided any changes for taxes on inventories, land, or owner-

occupied housing.


   Because the largest tax cuts in ERTA applied to equipment, the assets

with the lowest existing tax rates, the standard deviation among capital

costs would have increased from .017 to .020 at the same time that the

average capital cost would have fallen from .070 to .066. TEFRA removed

tax cuts for equipment in particular, so the standard deviation returns

to .017 while the overall pre-tax returns climbs half-way back, to .068.


   The Auerbach-Jorgenson plan, in column 4, would leave inventories and
                                    -31-

land unchanged, raise slightly the 1982 tax on structures and raise

significantly the 1982 rate on equipment.     There remain interasset

differences due to the property tax, and intersectoral differences due

to the unintegrated corporate tax system and the exclusion of imputed

net rents. Relative to 1982, effective tax rates rise by 9 percentage

points in the corporate sector, 4 points in the noncorporate sector, and

4 points overall. The cost-of-capital rises to .072, but its weighted

standard deviation falls to .014.


   Integration of corporate and personal taxes, the way we have defined

it, does not remove interasset distortions attributable to investment

tax credits and differential allowances.    It does remdve almost all

differences between the corporate and noncorporate sectors, however.

These differences turn out to be important, because the standard

deviation of capital costs falls to .009. Each individual asset would

be taxed at the same rate in either of the two sectors, but the

noncorporate sector includes highly taxed rental housing and therefore

averages to a higher overall tax rate.22


   Asset tax differences in the corporate sector would be greatly

reduced by repeal of the corporate tax, as shown in column 6 of table 4.

Asset differences remain in the noncorporate sector, as do intersectoral

differences. Elimination of corporate subsidies raises the corporate



22 Tax rates for noncorporate business and housing are slightly changed
   from column 3 to column 5, even though "integration't does not affect
   tax rules applicable to those sectors. We use the ceteris paribus
   assumption that the weighted-average after-tax return to capital is
   constant across tax schemes, however. The higher personal •taxation
   of corporate income necessitates a higher interest rate to maintain
   that fixed after-tax return, and the higher market interest rate
   affects discounting in the noncorporate and housing sectors.
                                -32-

rate from 30 percent in 1982 to 32.1 percent.23 It raises the overall

tax rate to 30.5 percent, capital costs to .072, and the standard

deviation to .019.




                       IV. Sensitivity Analysis


A. Inflation


   The sensitivity of tax rates to inflation is among the most

significant findings of our study.      Under 1982 law we find that

inflation has far from uniform impact on the taxation of different

assets: it raises some tax rates and lowers others.     Tijese differing

impacts result in interasset distortions that become quite sizeable at

some levels of inflation.     Specifically, we find that double-digit

inflation is associated with sharply higher dispersion in the cost-of-

capital than is inflation in the zero to five percent range. Although

we cannot measure the associated efficiency losses without performing

general equilibrium simulations, these results are indicative of

potential misallocations of captial at high rates of inflation.21'




23 Corporations may not actually experience this subsidy because the
   size of their earnings puts a limit on use of deductions and credits.
   The assymetric treatment of taxes and subsidies is accentuated when
   the tax law allows marginal subsidies as is currently true for
   equipment.

21' As we discuss below, there is also some uncertainty about the
   robustness of these results on dispersion when we vary modeling
   assumptions. The pattern that some tax rates rise with inflation and
   others fall seems to be general, however. Finally, although we do
   not present inflation sensitivity results for 1980 law in this paper,
   they are similar to those for 1982 law (under a given set of modeling
   assumptions).
                                 -33-

   There are four influences of inflation that our model captures.

First, even though tax lives are sharply reduced under the accelerated

cost recovery system, the basis for depreciation is still original cost

rather than replacement cost.   As a consequence, with higher rates of

inflation, the present discounted value of depreciation allowances

falls, and the cost-of-capital rises.


   Second, equity holders are taxed on nominal rather than real capital

gains, and debt holders are taxed on nominal rather than real interest

receipts. A constant rate of tax on nominal income thus results in a

rising real burden as inflation increases. The magnitude of this effect

depends on the hypothesized increase in taxable income for each

additional point of inflation. As described in the Technical Appendix,

our model assumes that the real after-tax rate of return is constant,

when we look at different rates of inflation.      As a result, taxable

income rises by more than point for point with inflation.


   A third reason that the cost-of-capital rises with inflation lies in

the taxation of insurance companies. The ?Ienge Formula determines the

deductibility of reserves in such a way that inflation raises the

insurance company's rate of tax as well as its taxable income (see King

and Fullerton, 1984, Chapter 6). After accounting for the proportion of

debt that is held by insurance companies, we find that each point of

inflation adds about 0.6 points to td the tax rate on interest income.


   Offsetting the first three influences of inflation is            the

deductibility of nominal interest payments.   In the corporate sector,

firms deduct interest payments from taxable income at their 49.5 percent

rate,   while   interest   recipients    include   it   at   the   rate

td = .196 + .595ir.   As we vary inflation from zero to fifteen percent in

our sensitivity analysis, the tax rate for interest recipients rises

from .196 to .285, which indicates a subsidy per dollar of interest (u-

td) that diminishes with inflation. Thus, as inflation increases the

nominal interest which receives the subsidy (u_rd), it also reduces the

rate of subsidy.


   Because the marginal tax rate of noncorporate entrepreneurs is .365,

there is also a subsidy on the use of debt in that sector. In our third

sector for homeowners, marginal tax rates average 26 percent.        Each

dollar of interest is thus subsidized at rates of inflation below 10.8

percent (where td reaches .26) and taxed at rates of Jnflation above

10.8 percent.


   The list of influences of inflation explicitly excludes any bracket

creep for individuals. Since we look at the long-run impact of current

law, we assume the indexing provisions currently scheduled to begin in

1985. In the absence of this measure, inflation would have a greater

tendency to push tax rates upward. We also exclude FIFO inventory

accounting when we look at only the tax-minimizing firm. If FIFO were

required in some way, inflation would increase taxes for this reason as

well.


   We use two figures to display the net effects of the four included

influences of inflation under 1982 law.      Figure 1 plots selected tax

rates as a function of inflation, and figure 2 plots the weighted

standard deviation of capital costs across all assets and sectors as a

 function of inflation. One striking fact in figure 1 is the relative

 constancy of aggregated marginal tax rates on capital.   The economy-wide

tax rate is .282 at zero inflation, reaches a low of .262 at about ten

percent inflation, then rises back to .270 at 15 percent inflation. The

corporate rate is even more constant, staying between 29.5 and 30.5

percent!


   This remarkable stability of mean tax rates,         however, masks

underlying differences in the effect of inflation on the taxation of

various individual assets.     Figure 1 provides a glimpse at this

diversity, since it includes a plot of the tax rates in the corporate

sector for the aggregate of the twenty types of equipment, for the nine

types of structures, and for inventories. The effective tax rate on

equipment rises monotonically from -.359 at zero inflaton to +.312 at

15 percent inflation.   In the cost of equipment, then, the erosion of

depreciation allowances is more important than the net addition to

nominal interest deductions. Inflation also reduces the real value of

depreciation on structures and raises the effective tax rate on that

asset.     Because of the relatively long tax lives for structures,

however, a given inflation-induced increase in the discount rate has

less impact on the present value of allowances than it does in the case

of equipment. For assets that do not depreciate, such as inventories in

figure 1, inflation adds to the nominal interest which is deducted at a

rate greater than the rate at which it is subsequently taxed. This

subsidizing effect of further inflation eventually offsets the tax on

this asset.    Finally, figure 1 indicates that the tax rate on owner-

occupied housing is a U-shaped function of inflation. Initial inflation

 increases the nominal interest subsidy since Th is greater than td but

 subsequent inflation raises the latter rate for interest receipts above

 the former rate for interest deductions. Inflation then adds to the net
                                 -36-

tax in housing. Because this sector comprises a third of the total

capital stock, the rate for the economy also exhibits a slight U-shaped

pattern.


   Figure 2 summarizes information about the effect of inflation on the

spread in the cost-of-capital among assets and sectors. The standard

deviation of p is about 1.5 percentage points when inflation is 5

percent and under. At 10 percent inflation it is one-fourth greater,

and at 15 percent it is fully twice as great. In section D below, we

explore the sensitivity of these results to specifications of the model.


   To summarize, high inflation seems to add more to interasset and

intersectoral distortions than it adds to intertemporal distortions via

overall capital costs. Because of offsetting effects from the taxation

of interest and historical cost depreciation, a rise in inflation does

not affect the overall tax rates on capital.   A rise in inflation does,

on the other hand, discourage investment in depreciable assets, thereby

 affecting efficiency in the use of capital.


 B. Debt Finance


    As the previous section on inflation points out, investments financed

 by debt are subsidized because firms that deduct interest payments are

 in a higher marginal tax bracket than the individuals who include

 interest receipts. Because the debt-to-capital ratio is about one-third

 in each of our three sectors, this subsidy can have a major impact on

 the cost of capital. This hypothesis is confirmed in our analysis of

 the 1982 law assuming all equity finance. These results employ the

 standard seven percent inflation rate and are reported in column 2 of
                                 -37-

table 5. Without debt, the overall tax rate in the economy would rise

from 26 to 38 percent. The largest increase, from 30 to 64 percent,

would occur in the corporate sector for two reasons.           First, the

differential between the statutory corporate rate and the personal tax

rate on interest is a large 26 percentage points.       Second, in the

absence of debt, a larger fraction of the corporate capital stock would

be taxed at the high rate for dividends. Under the assumption of no

debt finance, the combination of the investment tax credit and

depreciation allowances for equipment (in both the corporate and

noncorporate sectors) would no longer be sufficient to offset other

features of the income tax system, and these assets woul face positive

rates of tax.


   Column 3 of table 5 presents, for contrast, marginal tax rates under

the assumption of 100 percent debt finance at the margin. We find that

the subsidies to investment in the corporate sector and in noncorporate

equipment are sizeable, and that investment in other depreciable assets

in the noncorporate sector faces very low rates of taxation.


C. Property Taxation


   In column 4 of table 5 we show estimates of current law tax rates in

the absence of the property tax. These may be useful for two purposes.

First, the results highlight the relatively large importance of the

property tax in measuring the cost-of-capital. This point is especially

striking in light of the fact that many published measures of marginal

tax rates on capital do not include taxes on wealth.           Second, the

estimates provide an alternative assessment of the tax system, under the

view that property taxes are exactly offset at the margin by additional

local public services.   If taxpayers are sufficiently mobile and have

sufficient choice among jurisdictions, then local property taxes are

merely voluntary payments for local services and thus do not distort the

marginal investment decision. We apply this Tiebout hypothesis to both

residential and nonresidential capital.


   For homeowners, whose implicit rents and capital gains go untaxed,

the property tax is the only source of taxation. Without the property

tax, the effective tax rate on owner-occupied housing drops from +18.6

percent to -2.1 percent. The remaining subsidy is due to the fact that

mortgage payments are deducted by owner-occupants at a rate slightly

higher than the rate at which they are included by holdrs of mortgage

debt.


   Nonresidential property taxes were estimated to be a lower fraction

of the value of capital than were residential property taxes: rates

ranged from 0.77 percent for equipment to 1.55 percent on public

utilities, as opposed to 1.84 percent for housing.          As a result,

elimination of the property tax has a somewhat smaller effect in non-

housing sectors. Still, the impact is large enough to produce a drop in

the overall tax rate in the economy from 26 to 9 percent.    In addition,

without differential property tax rates, the standard deviation in the

cost-of-capital would fall from 0.17 to .015.


D. Assumptions about Arbitrage


   Our standard model assumes that arbitrage takes place at the firm

level: firms in all sectors compare the return to debt with the return

on real capital, and they use the after-tax interest rate as the
                                -39-

required after-tax return on all investments. The rate of return, net

of personal taxes, averages .05 in the economy, but differences in the

taxation of equity capital across the three sectors precludes the

possibility of the same return, net of personal taxes, to all forms of

investment. As described in the Appendix, an alternative model assumes

arbitrage at the personal level. An investment in any sector would then

earn a common return of .05, net of all taxes. In column 5 of table 5,

we present the tax rates under this alternative model, using a universal

net return of .05.     All provisions of the tax law and all other

assumptions are identical to those used in our standard estimates for

1982 law, which appears in column 1.


   The most important message from this exercise is that the set of

rates of return or rates of taxation is not invariant to model

assumptions. We cannot find "the" 1982 marginal tax rates. Tax rates

under the alternative model are somewhat higher than under the standard

model: 33 percent as opposed to 26 percent for the economy as a whole.25

The previously reported subsidy of corporate equipment becomes a tax of

17 percent. It is encouraging, however, that the ranking of tax rates

for different assets and sectors is invariant to the choice of

assumption about arbitrage. Equipment still faces the lowest tax rates,

for example, and corporate inventories and land the highest.


   Two other differences in results are worth mentioning briefly.

First, in the alternative model, elimination of the corporate income tax

results in a 2-point cut in the rate of taxation in the corporate sector



25 At other rates of inflation, however, the alternative model implies
   tax rates that are less than those in the standard model.
                                 -40-

(as opposed to a 2-point increase).     Second, the variability in the

overall cost-of-capital as a result of inflation is much less than in

our standard model.


E. Assumptions about the Rate of Return


   In another set of experiments, we use the standard model and vary s,

the mean net-of-tax return. These results do not appear in the table.

The overall tax rate falls from 36 percent at s.02 to 25 percent at

s.06, which in part reflects the division of the tax wedge by a larger

value of p. This result again underscores the fact that the measurement

of tax rates is not unique. The sensitivity of the tax rate to the

assumed after-tax rate of return appears to be especially large in the

case of a subsidy: the tax rate on corporate equipment varies between

-128 percent at s.02 to - .3 percent at s.06.


   The study of sensitivity to s reveals a couple of pitfalls in judging

relative tax rates for different assets. In a result reminiscent of the

earlier inflation sensitivities, relative tax rates change as s changes.

For example, while the tax rate for corporate land is 2 percentage

points higher than the tax rate for corporate structures at our standard

value for s, it is 45 percentage points lower when s is .02. Another

case illustrates dramatically the sensitivity of the dispersion of asset

tax rates to the choice of s. When s is .04, we find that all corporate

equipment depreciated over five years is taxed at exactly the same rate,

even though economic depreciation still varies among these assets. This

anomalous result occurs because the corporate discount rate associated

with an s of .04 happens to produce an equality between (1-u) and (1-k-

uaz). Equations of the Appendix indicate that 6 no longer enters in the
determination of p under this condition.




                             V. Conclusion


   This paper has examined the marginal effective total tax rates on

capital as they have changed in the early 1980's. It has also looked at

these rates under alternative reforms and under alternative rates of

inflation. Our study covers many diverse assets and industries, as well

as aggregates for the corporate, noncorporate, and owner-occupied

housing sectors and the economy as a whole.


   The tax law of 1982 results in a lower overall effective tax rate on

capital than existed under 1980 law.          It thus provides a larger

incentive to invest in real capital. At 26 percent, this overall tax

rate is also significantly lower than would be predicted by previous

studies that looked at average rather than marginal tax rates or that

emphasized equity finance at the margin.


   An equally important aspect of recent tax changes is that they have

not, on the whole, reduced tax differentials among different assets and

industries. Our measure of the weighted deviation in the costs-of-

capital across the economy remains unchanged from 1980 law. In other

words, there has been no apparent improvement in the efficiency with

which capital is allocated across its various uses, despite the fall in

overall tax rates. We also find that the corporate tax system makes

significant contributions to tax rate differences, even though it makes

negative contributions to the overall tax on marginal investments under

our standard set of parameters. Additional inflation also contributes
                                -42-

to tax rate disparities without adding to the overall tax burden. There

is a lower weighted deviation, however, for reforms such as the

Auerbach-Jorgenson first year capital recovery plan and integration of

personal and corporate taxes.
                          TECHNICAL APPENDIX


  Part A of this appendix describes potential uses of the tax rates of

this paper in examing intertemporal, intersectoral, and interasset

features of tax reforms in the 1980's.     Part B describes the exact

computation of the tax rates presented in this paper.




A. The Use of Tax Rates to Measure Efficiency Gains and Losses


   It is easiest to explain the applicability of our study in the

context of previous efforts to measure the effects of tx distortions.

In particular, we follow the tradition of Harberger (1962,1966), who

used an analytical general equilibrium model            to measure   the

misallocation of real capital between the corporate and noncorporate

sectors. He found that the cost in efficiency from this distortion

amounts to about a half of one percent of GNP. This cost is a small

fraction of a number as large as gross national product, but it amounts

to between ten and twenty percent of the revenue obtained from the

additional tax on the corporate sector.


   Shaven and Whalley (1972) showed how to incorporate taxes in a

computational general equilibrium model with more consumer groups and

production sectors, and this method is used in the larger more recent

general equilibrium model of Fullerton, Shaven and Whalley (FSW, 1978,
                                 -44-

1983). This model measures the misallocation of capital among eighteen

industries, where tax differences arise because corporations make up a

larger fraction of firms in some industries, and because corporations

use different combinations of interest, dividends, and retained

earnings. The model also measures the misallocation of resources over

time that are due to extra taxes on saving for future consumption.


  Tax rates in the FSW model are measured by the total of observed

corporate taxes, property taxes, and personal taxes as a fraction of

capital income in each industry. These tax rates can be revised to

capture the effects of each alternative tax scheme, but rates are then

held constant as the model calculates a new (counterfactua1) allocation

of capital among industries.    For this reason, the model does not

capture firms' efforts to affect their taxes by changing their mix of

assets or by changing their corporate status.


   Another problem is that these "average" effective tax rates, measured

for existing assets, are applied to marginal uses of capital. Fullerton

and Henderson (1983) amend the FSW model to measure "marginalt' effective

tax rates explicitly for each asset, using the cost-of-capital approach

of Hall and Jorgenson (1967). A further advantage of these marginal

rates is that they can easily reflect changes in investment tax credits

and depreciation allowances such as those introduced with the

Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS) in 1981. Yet the model in that

paper assumes that each industry uses the different assets in fixed
                                -45-

proportions. Thus, while it measures intertemporal and interindustry

distortions, it still omits interasset distortions.


   Misallocations among assets are measured in papers by Hendershott and

Hu (1980) and Gravelle (1981, 1982). They calculate the marginal cost-

of-capital in the corporate sector for each asset, and they assume Cobb-

Douglas demands. By changing the cost-of-capital to reflect a new tax

law, or even to remove all asset distortions, they can simulate the new

economy-wide demand for each asset and measure the gain or loss in total

output. The new allocation reflects equilibrium in the market for real

capital but it is not a general equilibrium. Their models apply only to

corporate capital, not total capital.    They do not cature industry

misallocations, and they do not capture intertemporal misallocation

associated with the overall taxation of income from capital.


   In this paper we compute tax rates that could be used in a more

general model that incorporates all of these decisions simultaneously.

When efficiency costs from all of these misallocations are combined,

they can add to substantially more than a half percent of GNP.


   First, in such a model, a marginal effective total tax rate

(including corporate, personal, and property taxes) affects individual

choices between present and future consumption.       Saving for future

consumption affects the total available supply of capital in subsequent

periods. Second, in any one period, a marginal cost-of-capital formula

is used to determine the demand for capital in each of the eighteen
                                 -46-

industries.   Third, within each industry, separate cost-of-capital

expressions are used to determine the division between corporate and

noncorporate sectors.   Fourth, within each sector of each industry,

individual cost-of-capital calculations are used to determine demand for

each of the different asset types.


   We could simulate the change in any tax parameter such as a statutory

rate, credit rate, or depreciation lifetime, and we could calculate new

user costs for each asset in the general equilibrium model that we

envisage. These user costs depend endogenously on the real after-tax

rate of return determined in equilibrium. A composite of those costs

applies to each sector of a given industry, and an additional composite

of corporate and noncorporate costs applies to the overall use of

capital for that industry. Each industry has a different mix of assets

in each sector, as well as a different mix of sectors, all determined

endogenously. When the total use of capital equals the total available

supply, we have equilibrium in the capital market; when other markets

clear as well, we have a general equilibrium.


   In a generalized model, we would not be limited to a unitary

elasticity of substitution among assets, as implied by the Cobb-Douglas

functional form.   Instead, capital in the corporate sector or in the

noncorporate sector of each industry would be a different Constant

Elasticity of Substitution (CES) composite of the 38 assets.        The

elasticity of substitution among assets ()           may   be specified
                                   -47-

exogenously. Capital in each industry would be another CES function of

composite capital stocks from each sector of that industry.            The

elasticity of substitution between corporate and noncorporate capital

Cc)    would also be pre-specified. When these elasticities are set to

zero, the generalized model would reduce to the one in Fullerton and

Henderson (1983). When they are unity, the model would be very similar

to that of Gravelle (1981,1982).          This generalization is important

because the choices for t      and c have much bearing on the relative

attractiveness of alternative proposals.




B. Measurement of the Cost of Capital and Effective Tax Rates


      We start with a cost of capital formula like that developed by Hall

and Jorgenson (1967). The underlying premise behind this formula is

that the profit maximizing firm will undertake a marginal investment

project if it earns a return net of tax such that the present value of

cash flows is at least equal to the initial outlay. Under competitive

equilibrium conditions the two will be exactly equal.


      Consider a marginal investment with an acquisition cost q, a rental

price c, and wealth tax rate of w per dollar of asset. The rental price

is the amount for which the asset could be rented if the owner covers

maintenance, depreciation, and taxes.          If the statutory marginal

corporate income tax rate is u, and if the property tax is deductible,
                                       -48-

then the rental net of property taxes and corporate taxes is (l-u)(c-

wq). This return is treated as certain, and it grows in nominal terms

at the rate of inflation, ir.           Further assume that the quantity of

capital embodied in the investment declines at the economic depreciation

rate .      As a consequence, the net-of-tax rental receipts from the

investment at time t will equal (l_u)(c_wq)eó)t. To derive the
present value of such a stream, these nominal cash flows would be

discounted at the nominal after-tax rate, r.


      Capital cost recovery provisions affect the equilibrium rental rate

in two ways. First, an investment tax credit at rate k lowers the

acquisition cost of the asset from q to (l-k)q.            Se1cond, the firm

receives a reduction in taxes as a result of depreciation allowances.

Let     a denote the fraction of purchase price that is eligible for

depreciation allowances. The present value of this deduction per dollar

of basis will be denoted by z, so the total tax reduction is uazq. The

particular value for z will reflect the discount rate, the tax lifetime

for the asset, the depreciation schedule, and whether allowances are

based on historical or replacement cost.          With the inclusion of all

these features of the tax code, the equilibrium condition is expressed

as:



           (1 —   k)q   =
                            J(l — u)(c — wq)e   tetdt + uazq            (Al)




From this expression we can solve for the rental rate c/q as a function
                                       -49-

of the tax parameters as well as r, 6, and n. Finally, since cjq is

gross of depreciation, we subtract 6 to obtain the corporationt s real

rate of return net of depreciation:



                                                                         (A2)
                      1—u          (1_k—uaz)+W6
              q


This crucial expression is used to find the cost to the corporate firm

of employing any of the 38 assets. The discount rate, inflation rate,

and corporate tax rate do not vary by asset, but parameters such as 6,

k, a, z, and w are asset-specific. None of these parameters is specific

to any industry.                                               I




   In the noncorporate sector, we assume that the firm must earn at

least its own discount rate r in nominal terms, after taxes at rate tnc

on any alternative investment. The noncorporate firm may use any of the

38 assets, and each has an equilibrium condition analogous to equation

(Al) above.



       p
        nc= ______ [1
             1 — T
                           —   k   —   taz]   + W   —
                                                                         (A3)



Corporate and noncorporate parameters are identical for depreciation

 rates (6), investment tax credits (k), property taxes              (w), basis

 adjustment (a), and depreciation schedules.            Discount rates differ,

 however, so the present value of depreciation for any one asset (z)

 depends on the sector.
                                       -50-

  A final cost-of-capital forumla applies to owner-occupied housing.

This asset earns a rental rate c, minus property taxes, of which X are

deducted from the personal income tax at rate Th•              The return

c -              is not subject to income tax, but the investor receives no
      (l-Xt)wq
credits or depreciation allowances. The return grows in nominal terms

at rate ir, depreciates at its own rate ó and is discounted at the

individual's- nominal after-tax rate r. Logic similar to that of (Al)

and (A2) implies the equilibrium condition:



        q =
              fEc
                    —   (1   -
                                 xT)wq]e
                                           —
                                               ó)trtd                  (A4)




and the required rate of return:




        phC6=r+(1_AT)w                                                (A5)




  The deductibility of mortgage interest is captured in the fact that

these flows are discounted by an after-tax rate of return.


1. Arbitrage at the Firm Level


  Next we outline two possible models for the choice of discount rates.

In one model, as in Bradford and Fullerton (1981), we assume that the

firm arbitrages between debt and real capital. Instead of making this

investment, the firm can always use the marginal dollar of funds to
                                    -51-

retire a dollar of debt, an action which would earn the after-tax

interest rate for the firm.     Therefore, each alternative asset must

yield the after-tax interest rate. If i is the nominal market interest

rate, then the discount rate in the corporate sector is i(l-u), in the

noncorporate sector it is i(l-t), and in owner-occupied housing it is

i(l_'rh). In any one sector, the discount rate does not depend upon the

actual sources of finance.


     A proportion cns of corporate investment is financed by new shares

sold to individuals with tax rate r             .    These investments earn i(l-u)
                                           ns
after corporate taxes, and this return is paid as dividends to the

owners who receive i(l-u)(1-t   )   after           all taxes. A prDportion cre is

financed by retained earnings, and the return i(l-u) is retained by the

corporation. Individual owners are taxed at t
                                                          re ,
                                                                 the   effective accrued

rate on capital gains, and they receive i(l_u)(1_tre) after taxes. A

final proportion Cd is financed by debt sold to individuals with tax

rate td The firm pays interest at rate i and the individual receives

i(l_td) after taxes. When these different individuals are aggregated,

however, the average real net-of-tax return in the corporate sector is

defined as:



Sc     cd[i(lTd)] + Cre[1(1_U)(1_Tre)] + C [i(l—u)(l_T5)} —                   Tr    (A6)




When we compare the pre-tax return pC to this average value of sC, we
implicitly assume that the marginal investment is financed by the
                                  -52-

average proportions of debt, retained earnings, and new shares.


   In the noncorporate sector, a fraction rid of investment is financed

through the market for debt.      The noncorporate firm pays the same

interest rate i, it deducts interest at rate tnc ,        and the interest

recipient earns i(l_td) after taxes. The remaining share ne is financed

by equity of the entrepreneur, who earns i(l-c) after taxes. The

average real net return in the noncorporate sector is


        S     d11 — Td)]      + et1(1 —           —                    (A7)




   Owner-occupants finance a fraction hd through debt, pay the market

interest rate i, and deduct interest payments at their statutory rate

th. The equity-financed share he must therefore earn i(lth) and the

average real net return is



             hd[i(l —   Td)] + h[i(l - Th)]
                                              -                       (A8)



The average real net return for the economy is



            cc +Kncnc
           Ks      S    hh
                      +Ks
        S=                 '                                          (A9)
             KC+K+Kh


 where K refers to the stock of capital in each sector.
                                 -53-

  All calculations could proceed by setting the single market interest

rate i.   In the corporate sector, for example, the discount rate would

be i(l-u), the pre-tax return would be given by (A2), and the after-tax

return would be given by (A6).    Instead, we wish to use the ceteris

paribus assumption that the average real net return s is constant across

alternative tax regimes and different inflation rates. For this reason,

we set s at .05 in each case and then calculate the interest rate

compatible with above equations. We substitute (A6)-(A8) into (A9) and

solve for i as a function of s,         n, tax rates, finance shares, and

capital stocks. Under 1982 law with 7 percent inflation, for example, i

is .181. Because nominal income is subject to tax, infltion adds more

than proportionately to nominal interest in order to maintain the fixed

real after-tax return s. This relationship between 'ii and i is not based

on empirical observations but is a necessary consequence of the ceteris

paribus assumption on s.


2. Arbitrage at the Individual Level


   The assumption of arbitrage at the firm level precludes the

possibility of arbitrage at the personal level.       Individuals receive

i(l_td) if they purchase debt, i(l_u)(l-c)          if they purchase new

shares, i(l-t) if they invest in a noncorporate firm, or i(l_th) if

they invest in housing. In an alternative model, we could assume that

individuals would adjust their portfolios until all these returns were

equal to the real net return from holding debt, s, redefined as
                                        -54-

i(l_td) -   r.    The corporation's discount rate for debt is still i(l-u),

but a new share issue would have to earn a return after corporate taxes

such that dividends could be taxed at rate 'r     and still provide i(l_Td)

to the saver.              The discount rate for new shares thus     equals

iLtd/(lt)• By a similar logic, the discount rate for retained

earnings finance is i(l_rd)/(l'r). A weighted-average discount rate

for the corporation may be defined as:




      Cd[l(l -       u)J   + c[i( rs + e[i('                          (AlO)




We can set s at .05, calculate i as (s+Tr)/(.l_Td), and use (AlO) for

corporate discounting.


   By analogy, the entrepreneur's cost of deductible debt finance is

i(1-t). The equity-financed investment must earn enough that the

entrepreneur as an individual can pay taxes at rate         and still match

the return to holding debt, i(l_td). The weighted discount rate in the

noncorporate sector is thus:



                 —           +      —
                     To)]               Td)]                          (All)




By further analogy, the weighted discount rate in housing is
                                 -55-




     hd[i(l —   Tb)] + h[i(1 — Td)]                              (A12)




  This second model has the advantage of a single after-tax return, but

this time the assumption of arbitrage at the personal level precludes

the possibility of arbitrage at the firm level.      The corporationTs

marginal investment earns a certain return after taxes given by (AlO),

an amount which exceeds 1(1-u). The firm thus forgoes the opportunity

to make pure profits by issuing one more unit of debt and undertaking

one more unit of investment.


   It would be possible to reconcile these alternative models by

introducing a risk premium on equity and a portfolio choice model for

individuals.    Instead, for this perfect certainty model, we choose

reconciliation through market segmentation.   Firms arbitrage between

debt and real capital, as in the first model, and equilibrium is

established as in Miller (1977). Because some individuals hold only

debt and others hold only equity, there is no arbitrage at the personal

level.   Thus we use the first model for primary calculations in this

paper, but we test the sensitivity of these results by providing

calculations based on the second model.


   A final note regards the presentation of each tax law in our tables.

The relevant information is embodied in various values of p, the gross-
                                           -56-

of-tax returns, but we sometimes find it easier to interpret effective

tax rates. Since the various values of s represent the returns net of

all taxes, the differences p-s represent the combination of corporate

taxes, property taxes, and personal taxes.             If this difference is

expressed as a fraction of p, we have a marginal effective total tax

rate. These effective tax rates can be measured for each corporate

                          c c     a
                                          for
asset by using (p -s )/p              ,    each noncorporate asset by using
  nc nc   nc                                     .         .    h h h
(p -s )/p        ,   or   for owner-occupied housing by using (p -s )/p . For
                                                .




notational simplicity, we suppressed the index for assets (i1.. .38) in

all expressions above. If we use p to denote pC for asset i, and use


K. to denote the stock of that asset in the corporate part of industry


j,   then the effective tax rate for the corporate part of industry j may
be defined as:




       tCE iij
                          — gC)
                      1                                                (A13)
        j        1 13 1




We calculate similar tax rates for the noncorporate sector, replacing

all a superscripts with nc superscripts.            An overall rate for that

industry is defined as the sum of the numerators from t and

divided by the sum of the denominators. (The housing industry combines

rental and owner-occupied housing instead of corporate and noncorporate

sectors.) An overall rate for the economy is similarly defined as the

sum of the numerators from all industry tax rates divided by the sum      of
the denominators.
