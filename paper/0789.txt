                                   Abstract


         A heated debate has arisen
                                      over what Modigliani has dubbed the
 Macro Rational Expections (MRE)
                                   hypothesis. This hypothesis embodies two
 component hypotheses: 1) rational expectations and 2) short—run neutrality

 ——i.e., that anticipated changes in aggregate demand will have already been

 taken into account in economic
                                  agents' behavior and will thus evoke no out-

 put or employment response. Together these
                                               component hypotheses imply that
 deterministic feedback policy rules will have no effect on business
                                                                     cycle
fluctuations. The irrelevance of these types of policy rules is inconsis-

tent with much previous macro
                                theorizing as well as with the views of
policymakers. It is thus an extremely
                                         controversial proposition which
requires a wide range of empirical research.

        This paper is a sequel to a previous paper by the author. That

paper developed a methodology for testing the MRE hypothesis and found that

anticipated money growth does matter to the business cycle. This paper

extends the analyses to cases where the rate of nominal GNP growth or the

inflation rate, rather than money growth, is the aggregate demand variable.

The empirical results are also negative on the MRE hypothesis and its

corresponding policy ineffectiveness proposition.

      A heated debate has arisen
                                    over what Modigliani has dubbed the Macro
 Rational Expectations (MRE) hypothesis.
                                             This hypothesis which is associ-
 ated with the work of Robert
                                 Lucas, Thomas Sargent, and Neil Wallace, em-
 bodies two component hypotheses:
                                     1) rational expectations and 2) short—run

 neutrality——i.e., that anticipated changes in aggregate demand will have

 already been taken into account in economic
                                                agents' behavior and will thus
 evoke no output or employment
                                 response. Together these component hypothe-
 ses imply that deterministic feedback
                                         policy rules will have no effect
 on business cycle fluctuations. The irrelevance of these types of
                                                                    policy
 rules is inconsistent with much
                                 previous macro theorizing as well as with
 the views of policymakers. It is thus an extremely controversial proposi-

tion which requires a wide range of empirical research.'

     This paper is a sequel to a previous paper by the author. That paper

developed a methodology for testing the MitE hypothesis and applied it to

the case which has received the
                                  most attention, where money growth is the
aggregate demand policy variable. However, other research has focused on

cases where the rate of nominal GNP growth2 or the inflation rate,3 rather

than money growth, is the aggregate demand variable. The results in these

cases have been mixed in their support of the
                                                MRE hypothesis and further
evidence seems necessary if we are to come closer to a resolution of the

debate. This has led to this paper's
                                        empirical analysis of whether antici-
pated values of these aggregate demand variables matter.

                                       II. THE METhODOLOGY

       The methodology for the empirical analysis to follow is only outlined

briefly here. My earlier paper has a more extensive treatment of the
methodology and the reader is referred there for more details.

         The tests here are based on a model of the form

                               N
(1)
                   =       +   E(Xt1 -       x.) +
where
               = unemployment or real output at time t

                               level of unemployment or real output at time t,
         y = natural
                                   demand policy variable, either nominal GNP growth
         X = aggregate
                   or inflation, at time       t,
               = anticipated X conditional on information at time t—l,

               =   coefficients

         Rational expectations implies that the anticipations of                will be

                                                                and as is usual in this
formed optimally, using all available information,

literature, models are assumed to be linear.               A forecasting equation which

can be used to generate these anticipations is

where

               = a vector of variables used to forecast X. which are available

                   at time t—l,

          y = a vector of coefficients

               = an error term which is assumed to be uncorrelated with any

                   information available at t—l (which includes Zk,t or uk ,t3.

                   for all i         1 and hence tlk,.t is serially uncorrelated).

               An optima], forecast for
                                        then simply involves taking expectatjo5 of
      equation (2) conditional on information
                                                     available at t—l. Hence:

      (3)


     and
            substituting into equation (1), we have
                      =    +

              There   are two identification problems that occur in the equation (4)
     nxdel. Some assumption on the correlation of the error term,
                                                                    c, and the
     right—hand side variables is necessary in order to identify the 8—coefficients.
     The usual assumption, and the one that is
                                               used in the tests here as well as
     In previous empirical work on this subject, holds that all the
                                                                    right—hand
 side variables are exogenous and hence are uncorrelated with the
                                                                    error term.
 This assumptjon,that (4) is a true reduced form,implies that least
                                                                      squares
 estimation methods will
                         yield consistent estimates of the t3's.
      The above assumption is more tenuous for the analysis in
                                                                this paper
 than was true for previous work
                                 where money growth is taken as the aggregate
 demand policy variable.        Although the exogeneity of money growth in

 output or unemployment equations is by no means uncontroversial,
                                                                  econo-
 mists are more willing to assume the exogeneity of
                                                    money growth than the
 exogeneity of nominal GNP growth or inflation
                                                         in these equations. For
 this reason we must be more
                                   cautious in interpreting the results to follow.4
 However, they are of Interest because they do confirm the previous

            The other identification

Estimation       Is sues
        There are two methods that have been used to estimate the equation (4)
 model. Barro (1977) uses a two—step procedure where the forecasting equation
 (2) is estimated by ordinary least squares                  (OLS) over the sample period and

 the residuals from this regression are then                  used as the unanticipated aggre-

 gate demand variable in (4). Tests of the neutrality proposition then involve

                                                  of the aggregate demand variable to (4) and
 adding current and lagged values
                                                      that their coefficients are equal to
 testing with OLS the null hypothesis

       Although this procedure generates
                                                 consistent parameter estimates, it
  does not yield correct test statistics. It implicitly
                                                        assumes that the
  covarlance of the 8 and Y estimates
                                              are zero. When there are
                                                                         off—diagonai

                                             of the joint estimates, as there will
  be here, then ignoring them as in the two—step procedure leads
                                                                 to test
  statistics that do not have the
                                          correct 4symptotjc distributions.   This
 can lead to inappropriate inference.
                                               As was shown in my earlier paper,
 if anything, the two—step
                                   procedure is biased against the MRE hypothesis.
      A joint nonlinear estimation
                                           procedure discussed in more detail in my
 earlier paper avoids this problem
                                           by allowing for off—diagonal elements in
 the information matrix. It also produces more efficient parameter
                                                                              estj--
 mates because each equation makes
                                           use of information from the other in the
 estimation process. Another advantage is that it allows tests of both

 the neutrality and rationality implications of the MRE hypothesis,
                                                                    while
 the two—step procedure can test for
                                             neutrality only.
      The joint nonlinear estimatjon procedure is used to estimate the

(2) and (4) system, imposing the

        In the models estimated here,
                                        the number Of lags in the unemploy-

   ment or output equations is so
                                   large that spurious rejections might occur be-
   cause the small sample distributions of the test statistics differ substantially

   from the asymptotic distributions. In order to be certain that any rejections

  of the MRE hypothesis are valid, the models discussed in the text are estimated

  with the smoothness restriction that the coefficients of the unanticipated

  and anticipated aggregate demand variables lie along a fourth order polynomial

  with an endpoint constraint. This particular polynomial distributed lag (PDL)

  specification was chosen because it is rarely rejected by the data,8 it makes

  interpretation of the coefficients easier, and it has the advantage of using

  up few degrees of freedom. As the comparison of the text and Appendix II

  indicate, use of the PDL restriction leads to similar
                                                        statistical inference
  on the validity of the MRE hypothesis, so we can be confident that there
                                                                           are
  no spurious rejections of the MRE hypothesis
                                                   because of small sample bias.

         Granger and Newbold (1974) have pointed out the danger of conductjna

 inference in a regression model where
                                            the serial correlation of the error
 term is ignored. To avoid this "spurious
                                               regression" phenomenon i the out-
 put and unemployment equations a correction for serial correlation is
                                                                       necessary
 that results in white noise residuals. Here the error term
                                                               of (4) and (6)
 is assumed to be a fourth—order AR
                                      process because fourth—order autoregressions
 are usually successful in eliminating serial correlation from quarterly,

 macro time series. This serial correlation correction is indeed Successful

 in reducing the residuals to white noise.



 Specification Issues

     It is difficult on theoretical
                                      grounds to exclude any piece of informa-
tion available at time t—l as a useful predictor of a policy variable.

Policymakers might react to this information even though there is no theoreti—

cal model that suggests that this should
                                            occur. Thus it might end up being a
                                      8



useful predictor of policy and should be included in the Z—vector in (2).

This reasoning suggests that an atheoretical statistical procedure based

on the predictive content of information is the appropriate way to specify

the variables belonging in the forecasting equatiofl)0 The procedure used

here and in my previous work amounts to running multivariate, Granger

tests. The policy variable X, is regressed on its own           four   lagged values

(again to insure white noise residuals) as well as on four lagged values

of a wide ranging set of macro variables, such as:           the quarterly Ml or

M2 growth rate, the inflation rate, nominal      GISt?   growth, the unemployment

rate, the treasury bill rate, the growth rate of real government expendi-
                                      the growth rate of the federal debt and
ture, the high employment surplus,

 the balance of payments on current
                                      account. The four lagged values of

 each of the variables are retained in the equation only if they are

 jointly significant at the five percent level. One advantage of this pro-

 cedure is that it imposes discipline on the researcher that prevents his
                                                            that lead to results
 searching over forecasting equation specifications

 confirming his priors.

      Earlier research on the MRE hypothesis with an equation (4) model

  [for example, Robert Barro (1977, 1978), Robert Barro and Mark Rush,

  Jean Grossman and Leonardo Leiderman] has used a fairly short lag

  length——two years or less——on the anticipated and unanticipated X

  variables. This paper looks at longer lag lengths for two reasons.
                                          restrictive models that have

                                        III. THE RESULTS


      The estimated models in the text use seasonally adjusted,
                                                                postwar
 quarterly data over the 1954—76 period and
                                                                the methodology Outlined
 in the previous section. The sample starts with the first quarter of
                                                                        1954
 because this was the earliest
                               possible start date when models with long
 lags are estimated. The data are discussed
                                             in more detail in the data
 appendix. In pursuit of information
                                                      on robustness, both output and unem—
 ployinent models are estimated in this
                                                       paper with nominal GNP growth and
 inflation as the aggregate demand
                                                  variable. The natural level of unem-
ployment or output,
                        y, is estimated here as a simple time trend as in
Barro (1978). A more complicated Barro
                                                            (1977) specification has been
avoided because, as is Indicated by David Small and Barro (1979), its

validity is doubtful.

       The first step in pursuing the MRE tests is to specify the
                                                                  variables
entering the forecasting equations for nominal GNP growth and inflation.

The multivariate, Granger procedure Outlined in the previous

            The   likelihood ratio tests in Table 7 indicate that the MRE
                                                                          hypothesis
  is    not supported for the models with
                                             inflation as the aggregate demand van—
  able.    The joint hypothesis is rejected for both models
                                                                  at the 5% Signi-
  ficance level, with the neutrality hypothesis the major
                                                                 contributor   to
  these rejections. The
                             neutrality constraints are rejected at the .001
  marginal significance level for the output model and .01 for the
                                                                   unemployment
  model. The rationality constraints
                                      again fare better with the marginal
  significance levels equaling .si     for   the output'model and .04 for the unemploy-
 ment model. The evidence then again seems to be quite negative
                                                                on the
 neturality implication of the MRE hypothesis, but far less so on the
                                                                               rationality
 implication.

          Tables 8 and 9 show that, contrary to the NRE hypothesis, the effects

 from unanticipated inflation are not stronger than anticipated inflation.
                                                                                    Not
 only   are the coefficients Ofl anticipated
                                           inflation Substantially larger than
 the unanticipated coefficients, but their asymptotic t—statistjcs are sub-
 stantially   larger as well.

          Overall then, the Lucas supply model estimated here is not successful.

 It has coefficients with the "wrong" sign, fits the data worse than
                                                                     a cor-
responding model with money growth as the aggregate demand variable as in
Barro and Rush and my earlier paper, and leads to strong rejections of
neutrality with     anticipated inflation proving to be more significantly

correlated with output and unemployment
                                              than unanticipated inflation.



                                 IV. CONCLUSION

       The empirical evidence here does not support the proposition implied
by the MRE hypothesis that only
                                unanticipated aggregate demand policy matters.
This is consistent with the findings in my earlier paper. With the

aggregate demand policy variable       specified to be either nominal GNP growth

or inflation, anticipated policy seems to matter a lot. Anticipated
                                                                    aggregate

variables in the estimated models, and the constraints implied by

rejected in every test in this paper.      Furthermore, these rejections are

frequently at exceedingly small marginal significance
                                                            levels. For example,

in one test the probability of finding that

statistic under the null hypothesis of neutrality is only 1 in 200,000.

         The hypothesis of rational expectations, the other element in the

MRE hypothesis, fares much better in the empirical tests here. Although the

rationality hypothesis does not come out unscathedthere is one rejection

                                        barely—--it is not rejected in any other
at the five percent level, but just

tests in the text at the 5% level.1       Rejections of the joint hypothesis of

rationality and neutrality are thus seen to occur primarily because of the
                                         rationality. This result might give
rejections of neutrality rather than

 some encouragement to those who are willing to assume rationality of expecta-
                                                     are unwilling to assert the

 short—run neutrality of policy.

                                              previous research in this area by
 cussion. This paper has followed
                                      that the output and unemployment equations

  It is not clear whether the invalidity of this assumption might lead to
                                                                      in
  rejections of the MRE hypothesis even if it were true. Some caution
                                                             However, this work
  interpreting these results is therefore warranted.

Chicago and Research Associate, National Bureau of Economic Research.

I thank an anonymous referee; the participants in the money workshops at

the University of Chicago and the University of Virginia for their helpful

comments; and the National Science Foundation for research support. The

usual disclaimer applies.

        1Some of the recent work on this proposition is as follows:

Robert Barro (1977, 1978, 1979), Robert Barro and Mark Rush, Jean Grossman,

David Germany and S. Srivastava, Robert Gordon, Leonardo Leiderman,and

David Small.

        2Jean Grossman and Robert Gordon.

        3momas Sargent (1976a) and Ray Fair.

        4Note that the endogeneity of the aggregate demand variable does

not necessarily produce invalid test statistics for this model. For example,

In th case where only contemporaneous M_Me enters In equation (4), test

statistics are valid even if the exogeneity of X is assumed when this is

untrue. See Andrew Abel and the author. However, it     is not clear that
this desirable result——that the above assumption does not matter to the
tests of Interest here——carries over to the case where lagged M_Me enter
equation   (4).

           5Because of the observational equivalence problem Grossman cannot,

 and does not, test using Barro's (1977) procedure whether the anticipated

 nominal GNP growth variables significantly add to the explanatory power

 of his equation (4) model. Instead Grossman reports results supporting the

 MRE hypothesis which rely on flimsy grounds for identification, namely the

 assumption that the lag length on nominal GNP growth cuts off at six quarters.

           6Goldfeld—Quandt tests do not reveal the presence of hetero—

 scedasticity within the (2) and (4) equations estimated here and it is only

necessary to correct for it across equations,as in my earlier paper.

           7The constrained—system is estimated with iterated non—linear least

squares and it thus approaches full information maximum likelihood (FIML).

The unconstrained system is estimated using the variance—covariance matrix

estimate from the constrained system in order to correct for one small sample

problem. This results in a likelihood ratio statistic that is slightly

more conservative: i.e., it will be less likely to reject the null hypothe-

sis. See my earlier paper for a more detailed explanation of why this

procedure was followed.

           8The PDL constraints are not rejected in models where inflation is

the aggregate demand, X variable. For example, in model 6.1 x2(14) = 20.54

and in model 6.2 x2(l4) =   10.62:   the critical x2(14) at 5% is 23.7. The

PDL constraints receive less support in the models using nominal GNP as the

X variable. They are not rejected for the 2.1 output model at the 5% level,

but are nearly so: x(l7) = 26.95, while the critical 2(l7) at 5% is

27.6. However, they are rejected at the 1% level in the unemployment equation:
       =   34.91, while the critical 2(l7) at 1% is 33.4. I did pursue
experiments with an 8th order PDL to see if this would fit the data sub-

stantially better, but it did not. Although this rejection of the PDL con—

straints is bothersome, the fact that the unrestricted models in Appendix

II yield such similar results to those in Tables 2 and 3 indicates that

imposing or not imposing the PDL constraints does not change any conclusions.

        9The Durbin—Watson statistics for      range from 1.82 to 2.15, none

of which indicates the presence of first—order serial correlation. Further-

more, the Ljung and Box adjusted Q—statistics for the first twieve auto—

correlations of      cannot reject the null hypothesis that these autocorrela—
                                      F3



tions are zero. The Q(12) statistics range from 5.84 to 15.0, while the

critical Q(12) at 5% is 15.5.

       10See Thomas Sargent (1981).

       Note that a stepwise regression procedure might miss significant

explanatory variables because of the order that it chooses to run the

regressions. Thus some judgment must be exercised in conducting a more

general search to find a specification that includes any variables with

significant explanatory power.

       12Because rejections of the null hypothesis are less likely when

the power of the test is reduced by the addition of irrelevant variables,

a rejection at a standard significance level in a less restrictive model

is even stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.

       13Chow tests which split the sample in equal halves indicate that

the nominal GNP growth forecasting equation does have the desirable property

that the stability of the coefficients cannot be rejected. F(9,74) = .60

while the critical F at 5% is 2.0. However, stability of the coefficients

of the inflation equation is rejected: F(13,66) =   3.40 while the critical

F at 5% is 1.9.

       14The F tests here are not meant to describe what regressions

were run in order to achieve the final specification. They only show

how much marginal explanatory power each variable has, once the first

specification was decided upon. The specification was approached by running

regressions with many more variables than in (7) or (8) and paring the

specification down by eliminating variables with little explanatory power,

as well as building up the specification from regressions with fewer ex-

planatory variables. In cases where two variables were so highly correlated

that each but not both had significant explanatory power, the one that
                                       F4


 produced a lower standard error of
                                       the equation was chosen. An example of
 this is the choice of M2 over Ml
                                    growth in both equations (7) and (8).
          15As in my earlier paper, the long lags for the
                                                          unanticipated
 and anticipated nominal GNP variables are critical to the negative find-

 ings in the MRE hypothesis. For
                                    example, an output model with only seven
 lags of nominal GNP growth with the
                                       lag coefficients freely estimated does
 not reject the joint hypothesis: x2(15) = 23.07 while the critical

        at 5% is 25.0. As explained in
                                            my earlier paper, this failure to
 reject is probably due to misspecifying the lag length as too short.

         16Although these rejections are Consistent with the rsults
                                                                    using
money growth in my earlier paper, they are
                                                substantially stronger.
One possible explanation for this finding is that the higher correlation

of this aggregate demand variable with
                                            output or unemployment leads to
tests with greater power.

        17As reported in footnote 13, the stability over time of
                                                                 the co-
efficients of the inflation forecasting
                                            equation was rejected. Thus we
should be somewhat more cautious in
                                      interpreting the results here which
make use of this equation. However, as discussed in my earlier paper,

the specification of the forecasting equation is probably not a critical

issue in the findings because the
                                    errors—in—variables problem from mis—
specification of the forecasting equation is probably not severe,

        l8 do not cite the rationality test results in
                                                       Appendix II because,
as the discussion in my earlier paper indicates,
                                                     they may not be reliable
because of small sample bias.
