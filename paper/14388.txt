                                           ABSTRACT

Using 1995–2011 Current Population Survey and 1970–2000 Census data, we find that the fertility,
education and labor supply of second generation women (US-born women with at least one foreign-born
parent) are significantly positively affected by the immigrant generation’s levels of these variables,
with the effect of the fertility and labor supply of women from the mother’s source country generally
larger than that of women from the father’s source country and the effect of the education of men from
the father’s source country larger than that of women from the mother’s source country. We present
some evidence that suggests our findings for fertility and labor supply are due to at least in part to
intergenerational transmission of gender roles. Transmission rates for immigrant fertility and labor
supply between generations are higher than for education, but there is considerable intergenerational
assimilation toward native levels for all three of these outcomes.

I. Introduction


         A steady flow of new immigration has resulted in an increase in the foreign-born share of

the US population from 4.8 percent in 1970 to 12.5 percent in 2009. Perhaps more dramatically,

the composition of the foreign-born population has changed markedly. In 1970, 70.4 percent of

the foreign born came from Europe or North America; by 2009, 80.8 percent were from Asia and

Latin America (US Bureau of the Census: http://www.census.gov). An additional feature of this

shift that is less frequently noted is that the immigrant population increasingly comes from

countries with a more traditional division of labor by gender (i.e., relatively lower female

participation rates) than the United States, and this tends to be reflected in their US labor supply

behavior (Antecol 2000; Blau, Kahn and Papps 2011; Blau and Kahn 2011). Immigrant women

also tend to have more children than native-born women, mirroring their countries of origin

(Blau 1992), although the immigrant-native difference has declined among the most recent

immigrants as fertility levels have fallen around the world (Blau, Kahn and Papps 2011). As the

share of the US population that is foreign born has risen, an increasing fraction of the population

consists of second generation immigrants—native-born individuals with at least one foreign-born

parent. 1

         These trends highlight the fact that the assimilation process of immigrants has an

important intergenerational component. If a traditional division of labor by gender among

immigrants is transmitted to their children, the growing immigrant share in the population and

the shift toward a more traditional division of labor among immigrants (relative to natives) can

have substantial effects on the future labor supply and fertility behavior of women born in the


1

quarter (23 percent) by 2008 (Fortuny 2010).
United States. Alternatively, however, the children of immigrants may assimilate toward native

levels of labor supply and fertility as they become acculturated to work and family size norms in

the United States or as they respond to labor market opportunities here. If so, the current

immigrant-native gaps in these outcomes will not have large long-term effects.

       In this paper, we use data on second-generation women from the March Current

Population Surveys (CPS) from 1995 to 2011 linked to data on immigrants in the parental

generation from the 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000 Censuses to study the transmission of first-

generation immigrants’ education, fertility, and labor supply to second-generation women. We

focus particularly on women’s labor supply and fertility due to the salience of the gender role

issue and the smaller amount of previous research on this subject. The study of the

intergenerational transmission of values and behavior among immigrants is also relevant to a

broader literature examining the impact of “culture,” or preferences and beliefs developed in a

different time or place on current economic behavior (Fernández 2008).

       Our research design estimates the outcome of three related processes. First, immigrant

parents, like parents in general, may directly pass on their own characteristics and behavioral

traits to their children. Second, they may pass on their ethnic or cultural characteristics. Third,

both these effects may be moderated as immigrants and their descendants experience some level

of assimilation toward US native behavior. While we cannot distinguish between these three

types of effects, it might be argued that their combined effect is the most relevant “bottom line”

assessment of the extent of intergenerational transmission.

       Unlike earlier work on the descendants of immigrants, we examine the impact of the

characteristics of both mothers and fathers in the immigrant generation on second generation

women. We also investigate differences across “family types,” that is second generation women




                                                  2
who had two foreign born parents, only a foreign-born mother, and only a foreign-born father.

This disaggregation, made possible by the richness of the CPS data, potentially yields a richer set

of hypothesis tests about culture and assimilation than more aggregated approaches. For

example, data on women from the mother’s source country may proxy for both the effects of

mothers as role models and source country culture, while, controlling for the effect of mother’s

parental characteristics, data on women from the father’s source country may reflect the

incremental effect of source country culture. With regard to family type, it may be that coming

from a family with two immigrant parents represents a larger “treatment” than coming from a

family with only one.



II. Relationship to Previous Literature and Contribution of the Study



       Our analysis builds on some recent papers that have studied the impact of source country

or parental characteristics on the education, fertility or labor supply of immigrants’ descendants

in the United States. Using 1970 Census data on US-born women with foreign-born fathers,

Fernández and Fogli (2009) found that source country female labor supply and fertility each had

a positive effect on the corresponding outcome of second-generation women. Two other studies

have found evidence of positive effect of source country labor force participation (Antecol 2000)

and fertility (Fernández and Fogli 2006) on the these outcomes for US-born women based on the

respondent’s self-reported ancestry. Finally, using 1994-2003 CPS data, Blau and Kahn (2007)

found that current Mexican immigrant women had far lower levels of schooling and labor

supply, as well as higher fertility levels, than native non-Hispanic whites. However, gaps were




                                                 3
much smaller in the second-generation, suggesting assimilation but also some persistence. 2

         Also relevant to our work are two papers that study intergenerational transmission using a

similar methodology to ours, although neither explicitly examined gender roles. First, Borjas

(1993) found evidence of intergenerational transmission correlating the wages of 1940

immigrant generation fathers with second-generation sons in the 1970 Census. Card, DiNardo

and Estes (2000) expanded on these findings, examining the intergenerational transmission of

earnings, education and marital assimilation, for two cohorts of second generation respondents

(identified as individuals with foreign-born fathers) matched to characteristics of their immigrant

fathers in earlier Censuses. The second-generation from the 1970 Census was matched to 1940

data on immigrant men; and the second-generation from the 1994–1996 CPS was matched to

1970 Census data on immigrant men. The authors found that there was significant

intergenerational transmission of education and wages, with a roughly similar rate of

intergenerational transmission for each cohort.

         We contribute to the literature on gender and intergenerational transmission of immigrant

behavior in several ways. First, as discussed above, the CPS has information on the country-of-

birth of both parents, permitting us to gauge the relative importance of the characteristics of

immigrant mothers versus immigrant women from the fathers’ source country, as well as the

strength of intergenerational transmission for individuals with two foreign-born parents

compared to those with only one. In contrast, Card, DiNardo, and Estes (2000), Borjas (1993),

and Fernández and Fogli (2009) are only able to match second-generation individuals with their




2
 In a recent paper, Alesina, Giuliano and Nunn (2011) test the hypothesis that traditional agricultural practices,
namely the utilization of plough agriculture, influenced the development of this culture across societies. In one
application they find evidence of cultural transmission, based on the use of the plough in the source country, for
second-generation immigrants in the United States.

fathers, due to the incomplete Census data on the birthplace of foreign-born mothers. 3 In

addition to being unable to examine the differential effect of immigrant mothers compared to

fathers on the second generation, work that uses data only on the respondent’s father misses

about one quarter of the second generation sample (Table A1). If gender role transmission from

mother to daughter is especially strong, this omission could be particularly important for a study

of the transmission of gender roles. The CPS information on the actual birthplaces of the

respondent’s parents is also an improvement on the data on self-reported ancestry of US-born

respondents used by Antecol (2000) and Fernández and Fogli (2006). Data on self-reported

ancestry are less precise in that they include information on second and higher order generations.

Further, Duncan and Trejo’s (2007) study of Mexican-Americans suggests that the more

successfully-assimilated native born are less likely to report a foreign ancestry.

        Our comparison of the impact of mother’s and father’s country-of-birth also contributes

to the literature on intergenerational transmission of immigrant education, where previous results

have been mixed. Gang and Zimmermann (2000) find no effect of parental education for second

generation immigrants in Germany, 4 while Van Ours and Veenman (2003) and Bauer and

Riphahn (2007) find that mother’s and father’s education had similar effects on second

generation individuals’ educational attainment in the Netherlands and Switzerland, respectively.

In contrast, studies of the general issue of intergenerational transmission of education usually

find larger effects for fathers than mothers (for a review, see Pronzato 2012).

        Second, while Fernández and Fogli (2009) also looked at the second generation, they

focused on the impact of source country characteristics on the behavior of second generation
3
  When both parents were foreign-born, the 1970 Census reported only the father’s country of birth. While Card,
DiNardo and Estes (2000) used the same CPS data we do for their recent cohort (although for fewer years), they
used information only on the father’s country of birth in order to make their analysis of 1970 to 1994–1996
assimilation consistent with their 1940 to 1970 analysis.
4
  However, Gang and Zimmerman found that parental education did matter for native-born Germans and that
fathers’ education had a larger effect than mothers’.

immigrants. In contrast, we examine the process by which source country culture gets

transmitted to future generations in the host country by looking explicitly at intergenerational

transmission from immigrants to their children born in the United States, although we also

examine the impact of source country characteristics. One of the purposes of our paper is to shed

light on the rate of assimilation across generations and we provide estimates of transmission

rates. In addition, our current data on the second generation from the 1995–2011 CPS provides

an updated consideration of the issues of gender and culture compared to the 1970 Census data

employed by Fernández and Fogli (2009). (The 1970 Census was the last Census to collect data

on foreign parentage.) Since 1970, there have been considerable changes in the composition of

immigrant parents by source country, as well as in aggregate female labor force participation and

fertility rates in the United States that might affect the findings. Gender roles in the 1990s and

2000s were considerably different from what they were in 1970, with far higher levels of female

labor force participation now, as well as lower fertility rates (Blau, Ferber and Winkler 2010).

And, as mentioned earlier, immigration to the United States has shifted from being a largely

North American and European phenomenon to a largely Asian and Latin American one. Further,

there is a growing gap between the labor supply of US-born and immigrant women today than in

earlier years (Blau, Kahn and Papps 2011). Thus, the process of assimilation of second

generation women into the US labor market may very well have changed since 1970.

       Third, we include three tests of intergenerational transmission that may shed light on the

potential role of the intergenerational transmission of gender roles compared to other

unobservables. In the first test, we estimate our basic models for second-generation men. An

effect of immigrant women’s labor supply behavior that is unique to or stronger for second-

generation women than men suggests that the effect for women reflects parental or cultural




                                                 6
gender roles rather than other unmeasured factors that may be expected to have a similar effect

for both men and women. 5 Of particular interest is that we may contrast our finding for female

and male transmission for labor supply, a potentially gender-linked variable, to those for

education, a plausibly more gender neutral variable. (We are not able to meaningfully examine

fertility for men in our data sets because it is measured by number of children present, and

women generally retain custody of children when a marriage breaks up or children are born out

of wedlock.) Second, we expand our basic specification, which controls only for parental

generation characteristics and respondent’s age (as well as CPS survey year), to include controls

for other individual characteristics like education, location and marital status (this is similar to

the specification employed by, e.g. Antecol 2000 and Fernández and Fogli 2009). Our preferred,

parsimonious specification excludes these potentially endogenous controls and allows parental

generation characteristics to influence respondent’s outcomes both directly and indirectly

through their effects on respondent’s education, location, and marital status. However, finding

an effect of parental characteristics even with controls for these individual characteristics

provides suggestive evidence that they do affect individuals’ preferences. Third, again similar to

Antecol 2000 and Fernández and Fogli 2009, we examine the impact of source country

characteristics (rather than the characteristics of parental generation immigrants) on second

generation behavior. This more directly tests the hypothesis that source country characteristics

influence the behavior of second generation immigrants in the United States.

        Finally, while our study is methodologically similar to Card, DiNardo and Estes (2000),

they did not examine the variables of primary interest here, fertility and labor supply. Moreover,

they used a single year to compute parental characteristics, e.g., matching their second

5
 In a working paper version of Fernández and Fogli (2009), the authors examined the impact of their source country
variables for men’s hours worked and presence of children and did not find an effect (see, Fernández and Fogli
2005).

generation CPS sample to immigrants in the 1970 Census. In contrast, we use information on the

age of second-generation individuals in the 1995–2011 CPS to match them to the parent

generation in the appropriate Census.



III. Data and Descriptive Patterns



         The 1995–2011 March CPS files comprise our basic data source on second generation

women (i.e., US-born women with at least one foreign parent). The CPS sample is restricted to

ages 25–49: age 25 was selected to focus on individuals who have generally completed their

education; age 49 to focus on individuals still potentially in their prime working years and for

whom children present is likely to be a good estimate of fertility. 6 We match second generation

women to their parents’ generation by calculating the year the respondent would have been 10

years old, a likely formative age. 7 We then use 1970-2000 Census data to simulate the

immigrant parents’ behavior, linearly interpolating across adjacent Censuses if needed; these

Census-based outcomes are themselves age-adjusted to age 40 to take into account compositional

effects among immigrants (see the Appendix). 8 (If immigrants from a particular country in a

Census year are especially young or old; their current labor supply may not be representative of

their lifetime behavior.) We go back only to the 1970 Census in collecting immigrant

characteristics because the 1960 Census data are relatively poor for matching source countries

compared to later Censuses. Respondents who turn 10 prior to 1970 are matched to the 1970

Census. We are able to construct 69 country groups, far larger than Card, DiNardo and Estes’

6
  To the extent that the number of children present differs from fertility—e.g., older children may have left home,
our control for age addresses this issue, since older women are more likely than younger women to have had
children that are no longer in the household.
7
  Results were similar when we used age 14.
8
  Card, DiNardo and Estes (2000) also age-adjusted immigrant and second generation outcomes.


                                                          8
(2000) sample of 33 countries. 9

         Table 1 provides some motivation for the study by comparing the outcomes of interest

adjusted to age 40 for immigrant and native women in 1980 (when many immigrant parents

would have been surveyed) based on Census data, and for immigrant, native, and second

generation women in 2000 based on CPS data. 10 As may be seen, immigrants had a substantial

education deficit in 1980 of 1.4 years (11 percent), and also worked 75 (7.3 percent) fewer hours

and had on average 0.14 (8.3) percent more children than natives. One motivation for our study

is to find out how persistent such differences are across generations. Table 1 shows that, while

immigrants’ educational deficit remained roughly constant over time, immigrant-native labor

supply and fertility differences increased—to 113 hours (14.3 percent) for hours and 0.2 (15.9

percent) for number of children. Thus, traditional work and family patterns have become more

pronounced among immigrants (relative to natives). This highlights the importance of learning

the extent to which these patterns will be transmitted by immigrants to their children.

         Table 1 also shows that, on average, second generation women currently have very

similar levels of schooling, labor supply, and fertility to those of natives with native parents (see

also Table A1); in fact, second generation women’s education and labor supply are actually

slightly higher and their fertility is slightly lower than those of natives. 11 Thus, in the aggregate,

all of the 1980 immigrant-native differences have been erased in one generation. However, there

is considerable variability in education, labor supply and fertility across immigrants and second

generation women from different countries. These differences provide us with an opportunity to


9
  In addition to having fewer years of the CPS available, Card, DiNardo and Estes were also limited by the need to
maintain comparability with the 1940 Census data. Note that, although Puerto Rico is a US territory, it is treated as
a foreign birth place for the purposes of our analyses.
10
   In order to make the CPS and Census data comparable, natives are defined as all US-born women regardless of
parental birthplace in Table 1. However, the means for natives with native parents for 2000 from the CPS data
(results not shown) are virtually identical to the means for all natives for 2000.
11
    Second generation men’s schooling and labor supply levels are also very similar to natives (Table A1).


                                                          9
test the impact of source country culture on the behavior of future generations. Table 2

illustrates this variability by showing data on immigrant and second generation outcomes for

three major source regions: (i) Europe and Canada; (ii) Latin America and the Caribbean; and

(iii) Asia. 12 In 1980, immigrants from Europe and Canada were quite similar to natives in their

education, fertility and labor supply, while immigrants from Latin America and the Caribbean

were a less educated group, with low annual work hours and high fertility, and immigrants from

Asia had high levels of education and labor supply (although their fertility is somewhat higher

than that of natives). Data on immigrants in 2000 suggest broadly similar differences across

immigrant groups. Comparing second generation women in 2000 to immigrants in 1980 to get a

rough idea of intergenerational persistence, we see that, while there has been considerable

intergenerational assimilation, second generation women from Latin American and the

Caribbean still lag behind natives in education and have higher fertility, while second generation

women from Asia, like their immigrant parents, are more highly educated and have higher

annual hours than natives.

        Appendix Table A1 provides further descriptive information for natives with native

parents and second-generation women and men. As noted earlier, the incidence of second-

generation women and men with both parents foreign born is slightly under half, with the

remainder divided between mother-only and father-only foreign-born. Thus, previous work

which focuses on individuals with foreign-born fathers misses over a quarter (26-27 percent) of

second-generation individuals. Among second-generation women and men with both parents

foreign-born, the parents come from the same source country in the vast majority (87–88

percent) of the cases. Tabulations of the source countries of the immigrant parents of the second

 The Middle East, which is located partially in Asia and partially in the Northern Africa, is not included in Asia.
With only 578 second generation women from the Middle East we do not include it as a separate region in Table 2.

generation in our 1995–2011 CPS data (results not shown) highlight the shifting composition of

the second generation over time. Compared to the 1970 Census data analyzed by Fernández and

Fogli (2009), in which 71 percent had fathers born in Europe, this was true of only 30 percent of

contemporary second-generation women. 13



IV. Empirical Procedures and Regression Results

        A. Empirical Procedures

        We analyze intergenerational transmission of fertility, labor supply and education for

second-generation women from the 1995–2011 March CPS files by estimating models of the

following form:

(1)     𝑦𝑖𝑡 = 𝐵′𝑍𝑖𝑡 + ∑𝑐 𝑎𝑐 𝑋𝑐𝑖𝑡 + 𝑢𝑖𝑡


where for each individual 𝑖 in year 𝑡, 𝑦 is an outcome variable including education (years of

schooling), fertility (number of children present), or labor supply (annual work hours including

zero hours); 𝑍 is a vector of controls to be discussed shortly, 𝑋 is a vector of immigrant parent

characteristics with 𝑐 indexing each characteristic (for example, average labor supply of

immigrant women from the mother’s country), and u is a disturbance term.

        The vector 𝑋 includes age-adjusted characteristics of immigrants in the parents’

generation, including education (years of schooling) of women from the mother’s source country

and of men from the father’s source country, 14 and measures of fertility (number of children

present) and labor supply (annual hours including zeroes) for women from the mother’s source

country and women from the father’s source country. Fertility and labor supply are included to

13
   Fernández and Fogli (2009) excluded women with fathers born in Russia or countries that became centrally
planned around World War II, as well as countries with fewer than 15 observations.
14
   Beginning in 1994, the CPS coded education in categories, as did the 2000 Census. We mapped these into years
of schooling attained by using Jaeger’s (1997) suggested algorithm.


                                                       11
measure the effects both of the home environment and cultural gender role attitudes. For this

reason we focus on female behavior and include the fertility and labor supply of immigrant

women from both the source country of the respondent’s mother and the source country of the

respondent’s father. Labor supply of women, in particular, is perhaps the key indicator of gender

roles. In contrast male labor supply is less variable across groups and expected to be less

informative about gender roles. We include education of women from the mother’s source

country and of men from the father’s source country as proxies for the home environment and the

socio-economic status of the respondent’s family. There is a large literature documenting the

positive correlation between parental and children’s education, with possible causal mechanisms

including the effect of parents’ education on parental time allocation and parental productivity in

activities that enhance child quality, as well as its effect on the socioeconomic status of the

family (Black and Devereux 2010). Educational differences in the parental generation may also

be correlated with cultural preferences for education. 15 Our parental education variables broadly

measure the impact of such effects.

        These six parental characteristics variables are designed to capture the most important

and relevant characteristics of the parental immigrant generation. It would be possible to include

some additional parental characteristics for immigrants from mothers’ and fathers’ source

countries. However, the very high correlation between the education of women and men from

the mother’s (father’s) source country make it difficult to include additional education variables

and obtain meaningful results. 16 And, as expected, we did not find parental generation male

labor supply informative for female labor supply and fertility, but we do discuss some results for

   Among respondents who have an immigrant mother, the correlation between immigrant men and women from the
mother’s source country is .98; for respondents with an immigrant father, the comparable correlation is also .98.

specifications including this variable. We note that we already include more controls than is

standard in this literature, which has previously focused only on the father’s source country and

the matching variable—e.g., source country female labor supply in a female labor supply

regression (see, Antecol 2000; Fernández and Fogli 2009). 17

           As previously noted, we locate the Census (Censuses) nearest to the time the respondent

was age 10, interpolating between Censuses where necessary. Thus, second-generation CPS

respondents from the same origin country can have different values for these variables depending

on their age: older respondents are matched with immigrants from earlier Censuses. The

relevant parental characteristics variables are set to 0 for respondents with a native-born mother

or father. Because we include variables for family type (described below), we interpret the

parental characteristics variables as interactions between the indicated characteristic and having a

foreign father (mother). Standard errors are clustered based on the parents’ birthplace and the

years of the Census used to match parents with second generation respondents. Suppose, for

example that the mother was born in Mexico, and the Censuses used for computing her

characteristics are 1970 and 1980. Then this country-Census combination would form one

cluster. If the mother was born in the United States, we use the father’s birth country and Census

years.

           In the results presented below, the vector 𝑋 generally includes all three types of

immigrant behavior for which we have measures—schooling, fertility, and labor supply—or

what we term the “full specification.” This specification may be appropriate in that it reduces

the likelihood of spurious correlation. So, for example, a positive association between first- and

second-generation fertility might be due to lower education levels of women in both generations

rather than to intergenerational transmission of fertility per se. On the other hand, immigrant
17
     Note that these studies do include extensive controls for the respondent’s individual characteristics.


                                                             13
fertility (or plans for family size) may be the fundamental cause of immigrant schooling and

immigrant labor supply levels. If so, including immigrant labor supply and schooling in the

fertility equation could lead us to underestimate the full impact of immigrant fertility on the

second generation. Therefore, we also present some results for the “matching specification,”

models with only the matching behavior on the right hand side (e.g., immigrant fertility in the

second-generation fertility equation).

       The vector 𝑍 includes two dummy variables among the three possible parent

combinations in our regression sample: (i) immigrant father and native mother and (ii)

immigrant mother and native father (the omitted category is both parents immigrants); it also

includes age, age squared, and year dummies. We do not include in our main specification the

respondent’s marital status, education or location variables. Part of the assimilation process

involves children’s marriage, education and location decisions; therefore, by excluding these

variables, we are allowing the full effects of parental behavior to be observed. For example,

more assimilated second-generation individuals may be less likely to live in ethnic enclaves.

Nonetheless, since these channels are of interest, we also discuss some results with these

controls. We also do not include controls for race and ethnicity. We believe that this is

appropriate because race and ethnicity may be proxies for “regional” ethnic capital (for example

the Latin American region). On the other hand, minority individuals may face discrimination or

other barriers in labor markets or in education that could affect their decisions about schooling,

fertility, or labor supply. Since minority immigrants tend to come from particular source country

areas, failure to control for race and ethnicity could induce a spurious correlation between

parental and child behavior that could instead be due to the common treatment in the United

States of members of minority groups. Thus, we also discuss results from a model that includes




                                                 14
race and ethnicity measured by dummies for black, non-Hispanic; Asian or Pacific Islander, non-

Hispanic; and Hispanic of any race (the omitted category is white non-Hispanic). 18

           Our main approach estimates equation (1) on the full sample of second generation

women, which pools all second-generation family types. These yield the average effects of

parental behavior. Later, we stratify by second-generation family type, another departure from

earlier work. We also provide results for the three additional specifications, described earlier,

designed to test whether our findings are consistent with a role for culture.

           B. Basic Regression Results

           Our basic results for the impact of parental generation behavior on second generation

women’s outcomes are shown in Table 3, Panel A for all women and Panel B for married

women. The table presents regression coefficients and hypothesis tests for two specifications.

The matching specification examines the impact of only the matching parental characteristics on

the dependent variable (e.g., fertility of immigrants from the mother’s and father’s source

country on the respondent’s fertility). The full specification includes measures of all three types

of parental characteristics.

           We first consider the results for all women beginning with parental education in columns

(1) and (2). In both specifications there is strong evidence of intergenerational transmission of

education, with stronger effects through immigrant fathers than immigrant mothers. In the

matching models, both parental effects are significantly positive, but the coefficient on father’s

schooling (.29) is nearly twice as large as the coefficient on mother’s schooling (.17). When

additional parental variables are added, the coefficient on mother’s schooling becomes small and

insignificant, whereas the coefficient on father’s schooling is not appreciably changed. In both

specifications, the difference between the coefficients on father’s and mother’s education is
18
     A small number of non-Hispanic individuals of other races (0.46 per cent of the sample) were omitted.


                                                          15
highly significant. The larger effect of father’s education may be because it better captures the

socio-economic status of the family than mother’s education and it is the family’s socio-

economic status that is the source of the intergenerational effect. As we have seen, this finding

of a larger effect of fathers’ than of mothers’ education is consistent with the broader literature

on intergenerational transmission of education.

        The sum of the education effects for fathers and mothers is an estimate of the impact of

one additional year of education for each parent in the first generation on the educational

attainment of second-generation for women with both parents foreign born; this sum is highly

significant in both specifications. The larger estimated transmission rate, .46, is obtained for this

sum in the matching specification (column 1). This effect implies that a three year difference in

parental education between immigrants and natives, approximately the difference in schooling

between native women and immigrant women from Latin America and the Caribbean in 2000

(see Tables 1 and 2) and almost twice the overall immigrant-native difference in Table 1, results
                                                       19
in a second-generation difference of 1.4 years.

        When additional parental characteristics are added (Table 3a, column 2), an interesting

finding that emerges is that higher levels of fertility of immigrant mothers lead to lower levels of

second-generation education. Effects for the fertility of immigrant women from the father’s

source country are smaller in magnitude and insignificant, although the difference in coefficients

for mothers and fathers is not significant. The negative impact of immigrant family size on

second-generation education is consistent with a quality-quantity tradeoff in fertility (Becker

1991) and a comparison of the results for columns (1) and (2) suggests that a mechanism for

intergenerational transmission of immigrant mother’s education is through family size.

19
   Our summed transmission effects in the matching specification for women and men (see Table 4 for men) of
0.45-0.46 are similar to the effects obtained by Card, DiNardo and Estes (2000) of about 0.4 for educational
transmission, although they used information only on the father.


                                                       16
       The magnitude of the effect of parental generation family size on second generation

education is large. To illustrate its magnitude, we computed the mean and standard deviation of

the number of children of immigrant mothers aged 35–45 in the 1980 Census (an age group

centered around the 40 year figure used to construct the parental generation explanatory

variables and a Census year in which many of the immigrant parents would have been surveyed).

We find that, among this group, fertility averaged 2.32 children with a standard deviation of

1.26. Since about half of our sample consists of second generation women both of whose parents

were foreign born, it is of interest to estimate the impact of immigrant fertility for this group.

When we add the mother’s fertility effect to that for immigrant women from the father’s country,

we find that a one standard deviation increase in immigrant women’s fertility from both the

mother’s and father’s country lowers second-generation women and men’s education by about

1.47 years. This is an economically important effect that is highly statistically significant.

Previous research (Blau, Kahn and Papps 2011) has found falling immigrant fertility levels for

recent cohorts, as fertility has been declining sharply around the world. If this lower level

continues or further decreases occur, our results predict important increases in the education

levels of second-generation immigrants.

       Finally, there is some suggestive evidence of a positive effect of mother’s working on

education for women; however the effect of hours worked of women from the father’s source

country is negative, though not significant. Adding the employment effects for both parents

leads to an insignificantly positive impact on schooling.

       Turning now to the results for fertility in columns (3) and (4), we again find considerable

evidence of intergenerational transmission. In the matching specification, the fertility of female

immigrants from both the mother’s and father’s source countries significantly positively affects




                                                  17
second-generation fertility. When we control for other parental characteristics, the effect of

mother’s fertility remains significant but of decreased magnitude, while the effect of the fertility

of women from the father’s source country is greatly reduced and loses statistical significance.

In both specifications, however, the sum of the effects of fertility from the mother’s and father’s

source countries is highly significant. We also find that in both specifications mother’s fertility

has a stronger effect than the fertility of immigrant women from the father’s source country,

although the difference is not statistically significant in either specification. The reduction in the

magnitude of the coefficients on fertility in the immigrant generation between the matching and

full specification appears related to the inclusion of work hours of women from the mother’s

source county and years of schooling of men from the father’s source country, both of which are

negatively related to second generation fertility. The sum of the two fertility effects is

considerably larger in the matching specification (.731) than in the full specification (.403).

          Finally, we consider the results for annual work hours. We again see considerable

evidence of intergenerational transmission in both specifications (columns 5 and 6), with

statistically significant positive effects for the sum of the coefficients on work hours of mothers

and women from the father’s source country that are only slightly larger in the matching model

(0.50) than in the full specification (.47). In addition, the impact of mother’s labor supply

behavior is larger than the effect of women from the father’s source country, nearly significantly

so in the full specification. The results also indicate a highly significant positive effect of years

of schooling of men from the father’s source country on second generation women’s labor

supply.

          Returning to the magnitude of the labor supply transmission rates, Table 1 shows that

immigrant women’s labor supply fell relative to natives between 1980 and 2000. Specifically, in




                                                  18
1980, evaluated at age 40, native women worked about 7 percent more than immigrants; by

2000, this had risen to 14 percent higher work hours for natives. 20 Suppose instead that

immigrant women had closed the work hour gap with natives over this period. To do so they

would have had to work 213 additional hours in 2000. Our results suggest that this would raise

(future) second-generation women’s labor supply by 107 hours (using our transmission rate of

about .5), or by about 10 percent of the 1497 hour mean for native women. Put differently, we

expect the disparity in labor supply between immigrants and natives in 2000 to have only minor

consequences for future second-generation women’s relative labor supply.

        Table 3b shows results for married women. They are very similar to those for the full

sample of second generation women. Results for the intergenerational transmission of education

are about the same for married women, although the quality-quantity tradeoff effect on education

is somewhat larger for married women. In the full specification, the intergenerational

transmission effect for fertility and labor supply is larger for married women, although this is not

the case in the matching specification and the differences are not large for labor supply. These

comparisons of married and all women are weakly consistent with more persistence of cultural

norms among those who have married.

        C. Intergenerational Transmission and Culture

        Our findings for the impact of immigrant women’s labor supply on second-generation

women’s annual hours may be due to the impact of culture, i.e., the intergenerational

transmission of women’s roles, but they may alternatively be due to other unobservables, such as

unmeasured human capital. In this section, we consider additional specifications designed to test

whether our results are consistent with culture playing a role.


20
  Blau, Kahn and Papps (2011) show the native-immigrant labor supply gap increased 32 percent among married
women.


                                                     19
       First, we examine results from estimating our basic specification on men. Arguably,

gender-neutral parental characteristics would be expected to affect both sexes similarly, while

those associated with gender roles should have a larger effect or women. Table 4a shows

intergenerational transmission regressions for men for years of schooling, which plausibly fall in

the first category, and annual hours, which plausibly fall in the second. The specifications are

the same as for women. For years of schooling, as expected, we see a strikingly similar level and

pattern of intergenerational transmission for men as for women, with positive intergenerational

transmission and larger effects for men’s than for women’s education in the immigrant

generation. We also find strong evidence consistent with a quality-quantity tradeoff. These

findings are consistent with a pattern of intergenerational transmission that is not related to

gender roles. The results for labor supply are somewhat ambiguous in that we do find a positive

effect of the labor supply of women in the mother’s generation on second-generation men in the

matching specification. There are however three important differences in the results for women

and men that suggest that at least part of the impact of labor supply of women in the immigrant

generation for women reflects gender-specific cultural factors. One is that the transmission rate

for men in the matching specification, 0.33, is smaller than the transmission rate for women of

0.5. The second is that, in this specification, the impact of mother’s labor supply is roughly the

same as the effect of women from the father’s source country, whereas for women the effect of

mother’s labor supply is larger, though the difference is not statistically significant—this gender

difference is suggestive of a “role model” effect for women. Third, and most importantly, in the

full specification, the female labor supply coefficients and their sum become small and

insignificant for men, while, for women, the transmission effects remain highly significant

individually and summed.




                                                 20
       The inference that our results for males are supportive of the notion that intergenerational

transmission of immigrant female labor supply is related to gender roles is reinforced by the

results for women and men presented in Table 4b, which add variables measuring parental

generation work hours of men from both the mother’s and father’s source countries. Our

findings for educational transmission remain quite similar to those presented in Tables 3a and 4a,

excluding these variables, although there is some evidence for both groups of a positive and

significant effect of male work hours and their sum on second generation education. This may

operate through the effect of male employment on the socio-economic status of the family. In

strong contrast however, male work hours are insignificant, both individually and jointly, in the

female hours regressions, but positive and significant, both individually and jointly, in the male

regressions. For women, we continue to find positive and significant effects for the annual hours

of women from the mother’s and father’s source countries and their sum, while these variables

are insignificant in the male regression. The finding of an impact of immigrant male labor

supply on second generation men’s labor supply is intriguing; it may represent the transmission

of unmeasured human capital or work orientation, or some combination of the two.

       The contrasting findings for men and women in the labor supply transmission equations

are consistent with female annual hours capturing cultural factors associated with gender roles of

women. We also investigated fertility transmission for women including male labor supply in

the immigrant generation as an explanatory variable. As in the case of annual hours, male labor

supply was not significant and its inclusion did not affect the results for the other variables.

Based on these findings and our interest in the transmission of female labor supply and fertility

as two variables particularly related to gender roles, we focus our subsequent analyses on the

transmission of these variables for second generation women and continue to employ the basic




                                                  21
specification used in Table 3a.

       Second, in Table 5, we present fertility and labor supply models for all women and for

married women that control for the potentially endogenous variables of the individual’s

education and location of residence (i.e., state). The findings for the key variables are similar to

Tables 3a and b. Evaluating the transmission coefficients as the sum of the coefficients for

mother’s and father’s parental characteristics, we find that the transmission coefficients reported

in Table 5 are only slightly lower than those reported in Table 3a for all women and actually

somewhat higher than those reported in Table 3b for married women.

       Third, in Table 6, we look directly at the impact of source country characteristics on the

fertility and labor supply behavior of second generation women in the United States. We report

results for the fertility rate and the labor force participation rate ratio (women’s labor force

participation rate divided by men’s labor force participation rate) in the parental countries of

origin. The regressions also control for source country GDP per capita and female primary and

secondary enrollment rates, as well as the respondent’s age (quadratic), family type and year

fixed effects. (See the Appendix and Blau, Kahn and Papps 2011 for more information about the

source country variables.) As in the case of our analysis of parental characteristics, respondents

are matched to source country characteristics at the time they are 10 years old. For number of

children, when the labor force participation rate ratio is not included, we find a statistically

significant positive effect of fertility rates in the mother’s source country on second generation

women; the sum of the coefficients on fertility in the mother’s and father’s source country is also

positive and significant. When the labor force participation rate ratio, which has a significantly

negative effect on fertility, is included, however, the coefficient on mother’s source country

fertility is reduced and is no longer significant, nor is the sum of coefficients on the mother’s and




                                                  22
father’s source country fertility rate. For annual hours, the coefficient on the labor force

participation rate ratio from the mother’s source country is positive and significant in both

specifications, as is the sum of the coefficients on mother’s and father’s source country activity

ratios. This is suggestive evidence that source country characteristics do indeed influence the

behavior of second generation immigrants. We note too, that there is stronger evidence of source

country effects for both variables for mother’s than for father’s source country, although the

differences are not significant. 21

         D. Results by Family Type

         The regression results presented above pool all family types, and may be interpreted as

representing the overall average effects of the parental variables. However it is also of interest to

explore these relationships within each family type. Thus, in Tables 7, we present results for

fertility (Panel A) and labor supply (Panel B) in the matching and full specification separately by

family type: both parents immigrants (both parents); mother only immigrant (mother only); and

father only immigrant (father only). Before discussing the results we note that, in the

specification that is limited to both parents foreign born, there is a very high correlation between

the mother and father variables that measure the same characteristic (i.e., education, fertility, and

labor supply) due to the very high proportion of such families (87 percent) in which both mother

and father come from the same source country (see Table A1). 22 This is particularly problematic

in the full specification, where we thus focus our discussion the sum of the mother’s and father’s

coefficients.


21
   We also examined the impact of contemporary (2000) source country characteristics on these outcomes. We
found statistically significant positive effects for both mother’s and father’s activity rate ratios on respondent’s
annual hours, and for their sum. The effects of mother’s and father’s source country fertility were positive, but not
statistically significant; the sum of the coefficients on these variables was also insignificant.
22
   Specifically, for second generation women with both parents foreign born, the correlation between mom_f_edn
and dad_m_edn is .924; between mom_f_nchild and dad_f_nchild .942; and between mom_f_hours and
dad_f_hours .956 .


                                                          23
       Looking first at the matching specification, the results are broadly consistent with those

we presented earlier. We see statistically significant evidence of positive transmission of fertility

and labor supply for all family types, with the mother’s and father’s coefficients all individually

significant, and, for the both parent immigrant family type, their sum is significant as well. In

addition, for both dependent variables, the sum of mother’s and father’s coefficients in the both

parent immigrant family type is greater than the corresponding coefficients for mother only and

father only families. So, for example, the fertility transmission effect in families where both

parents are immigrants is .688 (=.389+.299) compared to .475 for mother only families and .444

for father only families, with the former difference significant at the 10% level, although the

latter is not statistically significant. Similarly, the labor supply transmission effect in families

where both parents are immigrants is .542 compared to .188 for mother only families and .255

for father only families, with both differences highly statistically significant. This accords with

the intuitive notion that the “treatment” is stronger in families where both parents are immigrants

than in families where just one parent is foreign born. Finally, there is some evidence for a

stronger effect of mothers’ than of fathers’ characteristics on second generation women for

fertility: in families where both parents are immigrants, the coefficient on mother’s fertility is

larger than the coefficient on the fertility of women from the father’s source country (although

not significantly so), and the coefficient on immigrant generation fertility is somewhat higher in

mother only than in father only families (although again the difference is not significant).

However, in the labor supply regressions there is no evidence of larger transmission from

mothers than fathers.

       Moving on to the full specification, for fertility, we find evidence of positive transmission

of number of children in the immigrant generation to the second generation for all three family




                                                  24
types, although among women with both parents foreign-born, the sum of the parental fertility

effects (.233) is significant at only the 12 percent level. In line with our previous results, we find

that the transmission of fertility is stronger for the mother-only than for the father-only families,

although not significantly so. In fact, the transmission effect is larger for the mother-only and

the father-only families than it is for those with both parents foreign-born (i.e., the sum of the

effects for women from the mother’s and father’s source countries), although these differences

are not statistically significant. For labor supply, in the both-parent sample, we find statistically

significant evidence of positive transmission of labor supply from women from the mothers’ and

the fathers’ source countries (the sum) on second generation labor supply, with a fairly

substantial transmission rate (0.59). However, in the mother-only and father-only foreign born

samples, we find no evidence of an effect of the labor supply of mothers or of women from the

fathers’ source country on the labor supply of second-generation women. The differences in the

transmission effects between the both parent and other two family types are highly significant.

Thus, in the case of labor supply, both the matching and full specifications suggest that having

two immigrant parents is a stronger treatment than having only one.

       E. Alternative Specifications

       We attempted several types of robustness checks for our basic sample of all second

generation women. First, we experimented with the age at which second generation respondents

in the CPS were matched to their immigrant generation parents in the Census, changing the age

from 10 to 14. The results were similar to the findings shown in Table 3a. Second, we estimated

models including controls for race and ethnicity, again obtaining results that were similar to our

basic findings.

       Third, our basic results may reflect the impact of parental generation control variables,




                                                  25
however, alternatively they could be due to unmeasured country-specific factors that are

correlated with these variables. To probe this issue further, in one specification, we included

mother’s and father’s country dummies (recall there are 69 source countries), in effect relying on

within-country variation in parental behavior to identify intergenerational transmission effects.

While we continue to obtain positive and significant transmission of mother’s generation work

hours in the labor supply regression, the schooling and fertility results are weaker and even in

instances wrong-signed. This suggests that there is insufficient variation within countries to

successfully identify such effects and that between-country variation in parental fertility and

education is what drives second generation education and fertility decisions. On the other hand,

in another specification, we included mother’s and father’s dummies for five regions: i) Europe,

Canada, New Zealand and Australia; ii) Asia, except the Middle East; iii) Latin America and the

Caribbean region; iv) Sub-Saharan Africa; v) Middle East, including North Africa. The results

for each of the parental characteristics in this specification were qualitatively similar to those in

Table 3a. Evidently, within regions, there is enough variation across countries to identify the key

transmission effects from the parents’ to the children’s generation. These results give us more

confidence that our basic results do not reflect the impact of unmeasured factors, at least at the

regional level.



V. Conclusions



       In this paper, we have studied the transmission of first generation immigrant women’s

education, fertility, and labor supply behavior to the second generation, defined as US-born

women with at least one foreign-born parent. Our research design used the March Current




                                                  26
Population Surveys (CPS) from 1995 to 2011, which contain information on each woman’s

country of birth and the country of birth of each of her parents. We then used Census data from

1970, 1980, 1990 or 2000 to attach information on labor supply, fertility and schooling of

immigrants from the relevant source country(ies) when the second generation respondent was 10

years old. Using this information on immigrants as explanatory variables, we estimated

regression models of the schooling, fertility, and labor supply of second-generation women.

       Overall, we found that second-generation women’s education, fertility and labor supply

are significantly positively affected by the immigrant generation’s levels of these variables, with

the effect of mother’s source country fertility and labor supply generally larger than that of

women from the father’s source country and the effect of the education of men from the father’s

source country larger than that of women from the mother’s source country. Moreover, second-

generation women’s schooling levels are negatively affected by immigrant mother’s fertility,

suggesting a quality-quantity tradeoff for immigrant families.

       We present a number of pieces of evidence that suggest our findings for fertility and

labor supply are due at least in part to intergenerational transmission of gender roles, rather than

other unobservables. First, for education and labor supply, we compare our female results to

analogous results for men. For immigrant generation education, a plausibly gender neutral

variable, we find strikingly similar results for second-generation men and women. For

immigrant women’s labor supply, a potentially gender-linked variable, we find evidence of a

stronger effect on labor supply for second-generation women than for second-generation men,

and for immigrant men’s labor supply we find evidence of an effect on second-generation men’s

labor supply and no evidence of such an effect for second-generation women. Second, we

expand our basic specification, which controls only for parental generation characteristics and




                                                 27
respondent’s age (as well as CPS survey year), to include controls for other individual

respondent’s characteristics like education, location and marital status. We continue to find

strong, statistically significant evidence of the parental characteristics variables, suggestive

evidence that these variables do affect individual preferences. Finally, we find statistically

significant evidence of the impact of source country characteristics (rather than the

characteristics of parental generation immigrants) on second generation behavior. This more

directly tests the hypothesis that source country characteristics influence the behavior of second

generation immigrants in the United States.

       While our results suggest an important role for intergenerational transmission, they also

indicate considerable convergence of immigrants to native levels of schooling, fertility, and labor

supply across generations. In our “full” specification, which controls for all parental

characteristics simultaneously, we find intergenerational transmission rates for those with both

parents foreign born of 0.30 for education, 0.40 for fertility, and 0.47 for work hours. At these

transmission rates, half or more of any difference in the immigrant generation has been

eliminated by the second generation. Moreover, since the fertility of immigrant women is

rapidly falling relative to natives in the most recent immigrant cohorts due to world-wide fertility

declines (Blau, Kahn and Papps 2011), little future excess fertility in the second generation is

anticipated. And, even though immigrant women’s labor supply has decreased relative to

natives, our relatively low estimates of intergenerational transmission suggest that this reduction

will not have major consequences for the second and subsequent generations of the future.

        Immigrant parent characteristics by source country are estimated using the 1970, 1980,
1990, and 2000 Census public use microdata samples obtained from the Integrated Public Use
Microdata Series. The 1970 data is a combination of the 1 percent Form 1 state sample, the 1
percent Form 1 metropolitan area sample, the Form 2 state sample, and the Form 2 metropolitan
area sample; the 1980, 1990, and 2000 data are the 5 percent state samples. We take a 1 percent
random sample of households where all members are white and native-born and retain the full
sample of all other respondents. Means of parent characteristics for each source country and
Census year are adjusted to age 40 based on a model including source country fixed effects, age,
age squared, the interaction of immigrant and age, and the interaction of immigrant and age
squared. The regression sample for mothers (fathers) consists of women (men) between ages 18
and 64, excluding people of other race, with an allocated source country, or from a country that
does not correspond to the set of countries available in the CPS. 23
        Second-generation immigrants in the CPS are matched to their immigrant “parents” in the
Census by source country based on the year when the respondent was 10 years old. If this year is
exactly a Census year (1970, 1980, 1990, or 2000), we use data from that Census. If it is an
interior year, we use linear interpolation to compute a weighted average between the two nearest
Censuses. For example, if the respondent was 10 years old in 1984, the parent characteristics
would be a weighted average of the estimates from 1980 (.6 weight) and 1990 (.4 weight). If the
respondent was 10 years old before 1970, we use immigrant parent characteristics from 1970.
Since we use an age range of 25-49 for our second generation sample, every respondent turned
10 years old before 2000.
        The source of the source country variables used in Table 7 were: fertility: total fertility
rate from United Nations Statistics Division, Series 13700 (2006); GDP per capita: GDP data
from World Bank, World Development Indicators, accessed May 16th, 2007, population data
from United Nations Population Division, Annual Estimates and Projections, accessed May 16,
2007; female/male labor force participation rate: economic activity rate for ages 15 and up
from United Nations Statistics Division, Series 4270 and 4230 (2006); and primary and
secondary female school enrollment rates from World Bank World Development Indicators
CD-Rom, Series SE.PRM.ENRR.FE (2002). GDP per capita was collected annually, the
remaining variables were collected at five or ten year intervals and interpolated annually; see
also Blau, Kahn, and Papps (2011).

 The 1994 CPS is not included because fewer source countries are listed than in later years. U.S. citizens who
were born abroad to native parents are not included since they may have lived abroad during their formative years.

equal weight.
