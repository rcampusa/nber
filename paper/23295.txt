Citywide Effects of High-Occupancy Vehicle Restrictions: Evidence from the Elimination

                                           ABSTRACT

In cities worldwide, the widespread use of single occupancy cars often leads to traffic congestion
and its associated ill effects. Using high frequency data from Google Maps, we test whether high-
occupancy vehicle (HOV) policies can be an effective tool to combat congestion. Using the
unexpected lifting of Jakarta’s HOV policy, we show that after the policy was abandoned delays
rose about 39 percent on affected roads during the morning peak—and nearly 69% during the
evening peak. Importantly, this was not due to simply a substitution from other roads to the
former HOV routes: the lifting of the policy led to worse traffic throughout the city, even on
roads that had never been restricted or at times of the day when restrictions had never been in
place. The increase in traffic persisted long after the policy was lifted. In short, we find that HOV
policies can greatly improve traffic conditions.

I.     INTRODUCTION

Traffic congestion is a scourge of cities everywhere. In congested U.S. metropolitan areas like

New York, Washington, and Atlanta, people spend, on average, over an hour a day commuting

to and from work (Census, 2009). In many developing countries the figures are similar or even

worse, with individuals spending on average 50 minutes daily in Mumbai, and over 1.5 hours per

day commuting in São Paolo and Rio de Janeiro (Baker et al 2005, Pereira and Schwanen 2013).

In addition to wasted time, traffic congestion can greatly affect urban economic activity,

affecting important decisions from where to live to which jobs one would be willing to take.

Moreover, it can lead to environmental damage from wasted fuel, as well as being a substantial

cause of air pollution.

       A commonly cited reason for congestion is the inefficiency of single-occupancy vehicles,

which use a substantial amount of road capacity for each passenger transported. In response, one

policy prescription is to restrict certain lanes or roads to vehicles carrying multiple passengers.

First begun in the 1970s, so-called “high-occupancy vehicle” (HOV) lanes were introduced in

Washington, New York, and California, and they have spread throughout metropolitan areas

both in the US and, somewhat, internationally (Fuhs and Obenberger 2002).

       Yet, the benefits of HOV restrictions are very unclear, with the HOV restrictions

remaining quite controversial. The main concern is that HOV lanes are underused (Dahlgren

1998, Kwon and Varaiya 2008). By restricting certain lanes or roads to HOV traffic, these

policies reduce the amount of available road space available for regular, single-occupancy traffic.

If not enough people are induced to carpool by the existence of the HOV lane, these policies

have the potential to make traffic worse on the remaining roads, since they reduce the capacity

available on these roads. They may also have spillovers, either positive or negative, on other
routes, depending on how drivers change their routes in response to the change in congestion on

the HOV lanes. Equilibrium traffic responses are notoriously difficult to predict theoretically as

they depend on the full traffic network and the full network of drivers’ origins, destinations,

times of departure, and preferences. Indeed, the well-known Braess’ Paradox states that adding

more roads can actually increase equilibrium congestion (Steinberg and Zangwill 1983), so what

happens in practice is ultimately an empirical question.2

        We examine this question by analyzing the elimination of perhaps the most extreme

HOV restrictions anywhere in the world: the “3-in-1” policy in Jakarta, Indonesia. Under the 3-

in-1 policy, first introduced in 1992, all private vehicles during the morning and evening rush

hours on the main streets of Jakarta’s Central Business District were restricted to those carrying

at least 3 passengers. This included all private vehicles on the 12-lane Jalan Sudirman, the city’s

main artery and home of the stock exchange, the education ministry, large shopping malls, and

numerous corporate headquarters, as well as several other main thoroughfares. In a developing

country adaptation of standard 2+ HOV restrictions, the policy required at least three passengers,

rather than two, since many private car owners would also employ a driver anyway.

        Jakarta is an ideal setting to study the impact of traffic congestion policies. With a

population of over 30 million, Jakarta is the second-largest metropolitan area in the world,

second only to Tokyo (Indonesian Census 2010, BPS 2015a, BPS 2015b). Virtually all

commuters in the region use the roads in some form or another: the city has no subway or light

rail system, and only a very limited commuter rail network.3 Not surprisingly, then, it has some



2
  In fact, many other traffic policies aimed at reducing congestion and pollution, such as even-odd license plate
policies, have been found to be ineffective in practice due to unexpected human behaviors (see, for example, Davis,
2008; Gallego, Montero, and Salas, 2013).
3
  The commuter rail network carries 224 million passengers per year in the Jabodetabek region, compared to 961
million per year by the Delhi metro, 1.7 billion on the New York subway (BPS Jakarta 2014, DMRC 2015, MTA
facts http://web.mta.info/nyct/facts/ridership/ridership_sub_annual.htm)
of the world’s worst traffic: a recent study of cities around the world using GPS data found that

the typical Jakarta driver experienced an average of 33,240 “stops and starts” in traffic per year,

the worst in the world. By this metric, traffic jams in Jakarta are more than twice as severe as the

worst-ranking U.S. city, New York, where drivers average only 16,320 stops and starts.4

        In this paper, we study the elimination of the 3-in-1 policy on traffic speeds throughout

the city using innovative, high-resolution data collected via Google Maps. On Tuesday March

29, 2016, the Jakarta government unexpectedly announced the abolition of the 3-in-1 restrictions,

effective 7 days later. To study the impact of this change, starting two days after the

announcement (Thursday afternoon, March 31), we began collecting real-time data on driving

speeds on several main roads in Jakarta – including some roads affected by the 3-in-1 policies,

and several alternate unaffected routes – by querying the Google Maps API for each route, every

20 minutes, 24 hours per day. We expanded our data collection to include additional alternate

routes suggested to us by the Government of Jakarta, as well as even finer time frequency,

several weeks later.

        To study the effects, we rely on two alternative counterfactuals. First, we use pre-period

data from the 2-3 days before the policy took effect. Second, we take advantage of Google’s own

innovative prediction algorithms by asking Google to predict the expected trip duration, for each

route, day of the week and departure time, under typical traffic conditions. These predictions

essentially use all of the data on average road speeds Google has been collecting. We show both

counterfactuals are virtually identical: the speeds we observe during our pre-period correspond

almost exactly to the typical “predicted” speeds from Google Maps, suggesting that the use of

Google Map predictions on the routes for which we did not observe pre-period data are likely

quite accurate.

       We begin by documenting the impact of the elimination of the HOV restrictions on the

affected roads. Not surprisingly, elimination of the HOV restrictions led to an increase in delays

in areas and during the time intervals where the restrictions had been in place. Delays – which

we measure as the typical number of minutes required to travel each kilometer (i.e. the inverse of

speed) – rose by between 39-45 percent during the morning peak period and by between 69 to 85

percent during the evening peak period, depending on which counterfactual we use. This

translates into a decline in average morning rush hour speeds from 28 km/h to 20 km/h in the

morning and a decline in evening rush hour speeds from 21 km/h to 12 km/h. This is extremely

congested: by comparison, typical walking speeds are about 5 km/h.

       Even more surprising, the elimination of the HOV restrictions during the morning and

evening rush – from 7-10am and 4:30-7pm – also led to increases in congestion at other times of

the day. In particular, on the main HOV road in the hour after the evening peak (i.e. from 7-

8pm), which was never restricted even during the HOV policy period, we find increases in

delays of 50-53 percent. For the middle of the day, which was again never restricted, depending

on the specification, we either find no change in average delay, or an increase of 17 to 30

percent.

       We then turn to examine whether there were any positive or negative spillover effects of

the HOV restrictions on other roads. We examine two roads in particular, each of which

parallels part of Jalan Sudirman and were thus considered primary alternate routes during the

HOV period. One would expect that, after the elimination of the HOV restrictions, congestion

should decrease on these alternate routes, as traffic induced to use these routes would substitute

back to Sudirman once it became open. Yet we find the opposite: delays on the two main
alternate routes also increase – by around 13 percent during the evening commute. The delay

during the middle of the day also goes up by about 23-27 percent on one of the alternate roads,

and does not change on the other. In short, the direction of these spillovers suggest that the

removal of the HOV policy had a negative general equilibrium effect on traffic.

         These negative effects appear to persist over time, and are robust when we expand to an

even larger sample of both former HOV roads and never HOV roads. We continue our main

analysis through June 3, which is the start of the holiday of Ramadan.5 The results look similar:

substantially more traffic not just on the roads where restrictions were eliminated, but

substantially more traffic on other alternate routes when restrictions were never in place, and at

other times of day when restrictions were not in place.

         There are, broadly speaking, two potential reasons why eliminating HOV restrictions

could lead to a general equilibrium increase in congestion. The most parsimonious explanation is

that substantially more people are induced to drive once the HOV restrictions are eliminated:

once these people have their cars at work, they drive them at other times of day, creating more

traffic. The other potential reason is through the feeder aspect of the road network: it is possible

that some people are trying to get to the now-congested CBD, and the congestion in the CBD

spills back to other parts of the network. Although our data do not allow us to disentangle these

hypotheses directly, the data seem most consistent with an increase in the overall quantity of cars

being responsible: we find an increase in traffic even on one alternate route that heads away from

the CBD, where such upstream congestion effects would be unlikely.

         The magnitude of the effects is remarkable, and significantly larger than typical effects in


5
  We end our main analysis with the start of Ramadan, since traffic patterns change during the month of Ramadan;
in particular, the last 1-2 weeks of Ramadan are effectively a national holiday, and since virtually all businesses shut
down there is never any traffic during this period. These patterns are visible in Figures 4A and 4B, which includes
data until August 18.
the literature. For example, in the 7-8 pm time period – when 3-in-1 was never in effect – we

find that eliminating 3-in-1 led to increases of delays of 1-1.9 minutes per kilometer, even on

alternate roads. By contrast, estimates are that London Congestion Charge led to a decrease in

delay of 0.6 minutes per kilometer (TfL 2006). Anderson (2014) finds that a public transport

strike in Los Angeles leads to an increase of between 0.2 and 0.4 minutes of delay per mile

during peak hours on highways throughout the city. Kreindler (2016) studies the introduction of

short-term driving restrictions based on license plate numbers in Delhi, and using similar Google

Maps data finds an improvement of around 0.2 minutes per kilometer across the city.

       These relatively large effects are even more notable given the challenges of implementing

HOV policies in a developing country context. In particular, in Jakarta, there was a widespread

practice of hiring people, known as “jockeys,” to serve as extra passengers in order to enter the

3-in-1 restricted areas (hiring a jockey cost around Rp. 15,000 (US$1.20) each way). Had the

widespread use of jockeys compromised the policy, we would expect little or no effect of the

lifting. The evidence emphatically rejects this view, as the lifting of 3-in-1 made a large

difference to traffic congestion. Instead, the presence of jockeys still created a substantial

additional marginal cost for entering the 3-in-1 area, which reduced congestion. The large impact

of lifting 3-in-1 we observe, combined with the presence of jockeys during the 3-in-1 period, is

indicative of a large demand elasticity of single-occupancy vehicles, a large marginal rate of

congestion, or both.

       The remainder of paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the policy in more

detail and describes the data. Section 3 presents results, and Section 4 concludes.
II.      SETTING AND DATA

A. Setting

Rising incomes in many developing and emerging nations has led to a dramatic increase in car

ownership: in Jakarta, Indonesia—the setting of this study—the number of registered passenger

cars doubled between 2004 and 2014, from 1.64 to 3.26 million vehicles (Statistik Transportasi

Jakarta 2009, 2015).6 Much of the travel throughout the city is on the roads, as the city has no

subway or light rail system, and only a very limited commuter rail network. In fact, “more than

10 million motor vehicles roam Jakarta each workday, even though roads and highways

constitute less than 10 percent of its total land area”.7 As incomes rise, cars are also more likely

to carry fewer passengers. In Jakarta, from 1985 to 2000 the average private car occupancy rate

went from 1.96 to 1.75 (Susilo et al 2007).

        In response to heavy traffic, the Jakarta government instituted the “3-in-1” policy in

March 1992. The policy requires cars to have at least 3 passengers (including the driver) in both

directions on the major corridors Jalan Sudirman – Jalan Thamrin and Jalan Gatot Subroto (See

Figure 1). Initially, the policy only applied in the morning, between 6AM and 10AM between

Monday and Friday. In December 2003, enforcement of the policy was improved, and the

evening peak was included; the operating hours changed to 7-10AM and 4:00-7PM (JICA 2004).

The evening hours were changed to 4:30-7PM in September 2004, and from 2004 to 2016 there

were no changes in the system. Disobeying the 3-in-1 rule fell under disobeying road signs, the

fine for which is a maximum of IDR 500,000 (approximately USD 37.5) or 2 months in prison.8

  Over the same period, the number of motorcycles more than tripled, from 3.94 to 13.08 million vehicles.

national Law 22/2009.
         The policy was not necessarily popular, with many believing that it did little or nothing to

help reduce Jakarta’s notorious traffic (Mochtar and Hino 2006).9 Moreover, the policy has led to

the development of professional passengers, called “jockeys.” Jockeys stand by the road near 3-

in-1 access points, and provide an additional passenger in exchange for a payment to the jockey

of about the equivalent of US$1.20. In fact, a single driver in need of two additional passengers

can hire a mother and child standing on the side of the road to provide another two bodies in the

car.10

         In late March 2016, the Jakarta government announced that the 3-in-1 policy would be

temporarily lifted. This surprise announcement was motivated by an unrelated development,

where the Jakarta police uncovered a ring of beggars that drugged children.11 The focus soon

moved to mother jockeys and their infant children standing by the roadside, prompting Jakarta

Governor Basuki Purnama (also known as Ahok) to denounce the 3-in-1 policy on March 29,

2016 and announce that it would be lifted effective 7 days later, for a one-week trial period.12

The initial one week trial was first extended for another month and then the policy was

permanently scrapped on May 10, 2016.13

B. Data

Our primary data on traffic congestion levels comes from Google Maps, specifically from

repeated queries we made to the Google Maps Distance Matrix API. Google Maps uses real-time

data collected from hundreds of millions of Android phones to estimate speed conditions on

roads around the world.

        We obtain two types of data from the Google Maps system for our selected routes. First,

we query “live” traffic data for each route every 20 minutes in order to construct a measure of

road speeds. This data captures current travel conditions based on real-time reporting of traffic

conditions from Android smartphone users, and is intended for real-time navigation.14 We report

these metrics in terms of “travel delay,” defined as the number of minutes that are necessary to

advance 1 kilometer, on average over the course of a route.

        In addition to the “live” data, we also collected data on “predicted” business-as-usual

traffic. This captures typical travel time on a given day of the week and at a particular time of the

day, based on historical data captured by Google. Specifically, for this type of query, we set the

departure time on a particular time of day and day of the week, but on a distant date several

weeks in the future. Since the date is far in the future, this estimate incorporates all historical

averages, but no real-time data. We show below that these predicted business-as-usual traffic

numbers are indeed accurate forecasts of traffic conditions prior to the 3-in-1 lifting, and also

appear to be very stable over time. In particular, this means that “predicted” queries made after

the policy was lifted continue to accurately represent the pre-policy lifting counterfactual.

        We collected data in two phases. Starting on March 31 at 2pm WIB, approximately 48

hours after the announcement but 2.5 “weekday" days before the 3-in-1 policy was lifted, we


14
  We obtain this type of data from the Google Maps API by setting the desired trip departure time to “now” at the
time when the query is made.
began collecting the traffic data in both directions on three main roads (see Figure 1): Jalan

Sudirman, Jakarta’s main artery and a road subject to the HOV policy, and two alternate roads

that run parallel to parts of Jalan Sudirman that were never subject to the HOV policy: Jalan

Rasuna Said (another main CBD road with many office towers), and Jalan Tentara Pelajar (a

main artery leading into the CBD from the southwest). For these roads, we collected “live” data

by querying the Google Maps API every 20 minutes, 24 hours per day. Thus, we have data from

both before and after the policy was lifted. As discussed above, we also collected predicted data

on the same routes, separately for every day of the week and for the same departure times as the

real-time data queries.15

        Starting on April 28, 2016, we expanded our dataset to include an additional previously

HOV road, Jalan Gatot Subroto, as well as 10 alternate routes that had never been subject to

HOV restrictions. These 10 alternate routes were suggested to us by the Jakarta Government

Department of Transportation.16 At this time, we also increased our data collection frequency to

one query every 10 minutes. As with the earlier roads, we also queried the “predicted” data for

comparison.17

        Appendix Table 1 provides some summary statistics for the traffic delays on both the

former HOV road of Jalan Sudirman (Panel A) and its alternate roads (Panel B and C), using live

data before the policy was lifted. Traffic is clearly bad, averaging 2.8 minutes per km on the


15
   The departure date was chosen between April 18 and April 20 for weekdays, and May 21-22 for weekend. The
queries themselves were made both before and after the lifting of the policy, between April 3 and April 12. We show
in Appendix Figure 6 that “predicted” Google Maps data changes very slowly. In other words, the algorithm used to
predict typical travel times is only slowly influenced by recent developments.
16
   Following the recommendations of the Jakarta Government, the revised data for Jalan Sudirman and Jalan Rasuna
Said collected after April 28 included very slight modifications of the start and end points of the routes, to better
match the standard route definitions they use. We collected data on both the original, and revised, definitions for
these two routes for an overlap period from April 28 to May 6. In Appendix Figure 4 we show that on the period of
overlap, the two sets of queries agree for both the live and predicted values despite the very small differences in
exact origin and departure locations.
17
   The departure date was chosen between May 16 and 22. The queries were made on May 2, 3 and 4.
former HOV road from 7am – 8pm, and 3.3 and 2.2 minutes per km on the two alternate roads.

Certain time intervals have significantly worse congestion, up to 3.6 and 4.4 minutes per km. By

comparison, average delay is 0.7 minutes per kilometer (53 mph) on the Los Angeles highways

studied in Anderson (2014). In Delhi, another congested city, delays are 2.6-2.7 minutes per km

on average between 8am and 8pm over many routes across the city (Kreindler 2016).

         The pre-data also contains suggestive evidence that the HOV policy was effective in

reducing traffic at the restricted times of the day. Specifically, on Jalan Sudirman, the delay is

lower during the morning and evening peaks, relative the mid-day off-peak and the hour after the

evening peak, respectively. On the two non-restricted roads, the opposite pattern holds. While

suggestive, these results could be due to underlying travel demand differences across the three

roads. Moreover, we do not know if the HOV restrictions simply diverted cars to other roads or

time periods, or reduced the number of cars on the road. To explore these issues more rigorously,

we next study the effect of the unexpected lifting of the 3-in-1 policy.



III.     RESULTS

A. Effect of Lifting “3-in-1” on Jakarta’s main arterial CBD roads (Jalan Sudirman) and its

alternate roads

We begin our analysis by comparing traffic both right before and after the policy. In Figure 2, we

graph the average delay in minutes per kilometer on the weekdays for the former HOV road

Jalan Sudirman (Panel A), as well as two alternate roads (Jalan Rasuna Said in Panel B and Jalan

Tentara Pelajar in Panel C). We average over both road directions (North and South) since there

are strong traffic flows in both directions at both times.18 The dashed-line denotes the pre-period


18
  In Appendix Figures 1A and 1B, we disaggregate the data by North- and South-bound respectively. The results
are very similar to the averaged figures. Traffic is worse after the policy is lifted in both the morning and evening
days of March 31st (from 2pm onwards), April 1 and April 4, while the solid-line denotes the

post-period from April 5th to May 4th.19 Note that, here, we only examine what occurred during

the first month after the policy change in order for our post-period to be as comparable as

possible to the pre-period, as we worry that factors—e.g. city-wide changes in school schedules,

income, weather, etc.—may eventually change over time (we will lift this restriction in Section

III.B. to explore what happens over time). Bootstrapped 95 percent confidence intervals,

clustered by date and direction are shown shaded. For convenience, we also denote the rush hour

times during which the 3-in-1 policy was in effect during the pre-period.

         Traffic clearly increased after the HOV policy was lifted. On the former HOV road

(Panel A), we observe traffic increasing in both the morning and evening peak. This could be

due to one of two factors: (1) after the abolition of the 3-in-1 policy, the number of trips

increased and there are more cars on the road (e.g., people stopped carpooling, stopped using bus

transit, or increased their likelihood of travel to and from the CBD) or (2) the number of cars on

the road is the same, but people changed the times of day when they travel, or their route. Figure

2 also shows that (2) is unlikely. If anything, we observe an increase in traffic on the former

HOV road during non-peak hours (Panel A) – especially after 7pm, when HOV restrictions were

never in place. Moreover, we do not observe any changes in traffic on the alternate routes in the

rush hours on the former HOV road (Panel A), albeit the effect is most pronounced in the evening peak heading
Southbound, which is consistent with slightly more residential areas being located south of the CBD than north of
the CBD. Traffic is also higher in the non-rush hour periods on the former HOV road. For the alternative road of
Jalan Rasuna Said (Panel B), traffic is worse in the midday period in the Northbound direction and in the midday,
evening peak and evening in the Southbound direction, and otherwise the same. For the alternative road of Jalan
Tentara Pelajar (Panel C), traffic is slightly worse in the evening rush hour, but clears up in the morning rush hour
northbound, after the policy is lifted.
19
   As soon as the policy experiment was announced, we began to collect data. However, this means we only have 2
full days of traffic data before the policy was lifted (the Friday and Monday before). This is a problem if traffic is
significantly different on different days of the week, since we are comparing the pre-days of Monday and Friday
with all potential weekday days after the policy change. Thus, as an additional robustness check, we can constrain
our entire analysis to just Monday and Fridays both pre and post the policy. As shown in Appendix Figure 2, the
results are near identical. The sign and magnitude of impacts by road and time interval is very similar to Figure 2,
with the exception of the mid-day off-peak on Jalana Surdirman, where we find no effect. This analysis implies that
overall our findings are not driven by just having two days of pre-data.
morning peak hours and actually observe an increase in traffic on the alternate routes in the

evening rush hour. This implies that individuals are not just changing their travel time or routes,

but rather there must be more cars on the road, leading to more traffic overall throughout the

city.

         Table 1 formalizes Figure 2. Specifically, we estimate, separately for each road segment

and time period, the following equation:

                                                      ⋅              ⋅

where               is the average travel delay in minutes per kilometer for segment , on date                     and

for departure time ,               is an indicator for whether segment is northbound, and                         is an

indicator for dates after the lifting.20         is the coefficient of interest, providing the difference in

average delays after the policy is lifted. Each column in Table 2 restricts the sample of departure

times . We provide            for both the morning (Column 2) and evening rush hours (Column 4)

where 3-in-1 restrictions were in place in the pre-period, as well the non-peak periods (Columns

1, 3, 5 and 6) which were always unrestricted on all roads. Standard errors are clustered by date

and direction.

         The results in Table 1 echo the graphical findings from Figure 2. Table 1, Panel A shows

that traffic is worse on the former HOV road once the policy is lifted. Specifically, we observe a

0.96 minutes/km increase (45 percent increase over control mean of 2.14 minutes/km) in travel

delay during the morning rush hour (significant at the 1 percent level, Column 2) after the policy


20
   We perform several robustness checks. Appendix Table 2 provides the same regression analysis, but using the
average delay over both directions for each road. The results are virtually identical to Table 1. In Appendix Table 3,
we constrain the analysis to Thursday afternoons, Mondays and Fridays (since we only have pre-data for these
days). Again, the results are qualitatively similar—traffic is worse on the former HOV road during peak hours and
is generally the same or worse at alternative times on the HOV road or on alternative roads—although we lose
statistical precision in some cases due to the much smaller sample sizes. We also do not observe any impact during
the mid-day off-peak on Jalan Sudirman. Finally, Appendix Table 4 replicates Table 1 using a regression
discontinuity specification, restricting the sample to one week after the policy lifting, and including a linear control
for the number of days relative to the lifting. Again, the results are very similar to Table 1.
is lifted and a 2.4 minutes/km (85 percent) increase in the evening rush hour (significant at the 1

percent level, Column 4).

        The impacts on excess travel delay are remarkably large. Excess travel delay is defined as

the travel delay above and beyond the delay under free-flow condition. The logic of this measure

is that the delay corresponding to free-flow is not affected by policies such as 3-in-1. We

approximate free-flow conditions using night-time delay, which is around 1.7-1.9 minutes per

kilometer for all three roads. Using this metric, on Jalan Sudirman excess travel delay goes up

3.5 and 2.5 times during the morning and evening peak hours, respectively.

        The increase in delay occurs at other times when no HOV restrictions were in place even

in the pre-period. Specifically, traffic delays also increase during the hour immediately after the

evening rush hour by 1.9 minutes/km (53 percent) (Column 5). We observe any change in traffic

neither in the hour before the morning rush hour (Column 1) nor at night (Column 6). Traffic

delay increases by 0.54 minutes/km during the midday period.21 This implies that individuals are

not simply substituting away from travelling at other time periods once the 3-in-1 policy is lifted.

        Similarly, we do not observe a substitution away from alternate roads once the policy is

lifted (Panel B and C of Table 1).           In fact, traffic actually increases on alternate routes,

particularly in the evening rush hour where we observe a 0.57 minutes/km (13 percent) increase

in delay on Jalan Rasuna Said and a 13 percent increase in delay on Jalan Tentara Pelajar. In

short, these spillovers to other time periods and the alternative roads imply an overall negative

effect on traffic congestion when the HOV policy is lifted.




21
  Note that in Appendix Table 3, which includes day of week fixed effects and restricts to the same weekdays
(Monday and Friday) in both pre- and post- periods, there is no change in delay in the midday period.
B. Extending the Analysis across Time and Location

The analysis in Section III.A. suggests that traffic increased from the immediate period before

and after the policy change on Jakarta’s main arterial road and its associated alternate roads. We

can now extend the analysis in two ways: (1) we can explore what happened to traffic over time,

as individuals learned that traffic conditions worsened over time, and (2) what was happening in

the rest of the road network.

Constructing and validating counterfactuals for additional routes

As Jakarta’s 3-in-1 policy experiment was announced shortly before it occurred, we have limited

data prior to the policy lifting—2.5 days of pre-period data for the former HOV road of Jalan

Sudirman and two alternate roads, at 20 minute intervals. Starting on April 28, we began to

collect data on Jalan Sudirman at 10 minute intervals with a slight change in precise route

definition,22 as well as data for another HOV road (Jalan Gatot Subroto) and 10 total alternate

routes to Jalan Sudirman and Jalan Gatot Subroto suggested by the Jakarta government. For

these routes and dates, we do not have comparable pre-policy lifting “live” data.

         Instead, to extend the analysis to these additional routes, we can rely on Google Maps’

predicted travel time data as a counterfactual of what would have happened in the absence of the

policy lifting. Due to time-lags and smoothing in their prediction algorithm, this predicted data

does not take into account the change in policy.23 In order to rely on this data, we must first be

convinced that the “predicted” data provides an accurate counterfactual. Therefore, we conduct a

number of checks to determine whether this is the case.
22
   We show in Appendix Figure 4 Panel A that this change in definition produces very similar results. Specifically,
during the overlap period April 28-May 6 when both queries were running at the same time, the travel delay we
obtain is very similar regardless of the definition.
23
   We show this in Appendix Figure 6, where we compare the predictions for our three main roads from data
obtained 2 days before the policy lifting, one week after the policy lifting, and one month after the policy lifting
(which is when we obtained the predictions on the alternative routes). These three predictions are virtually identical,
except for a very slight increase in traffic on Sudirman (Panel A) in the evening rush period. In any case, any
adjustment would tend to bias our results towards the null of finding no effect.
          First, in Appendix Figure 3, we compare our “live” pre-period data for the former HOV

road of Jalan Sudirman and its alternate roads with the predicted data. For Jalan Sudirman

(Panel A), the live and predicted data track each other perfectly in the pre-period. For the

alternate roads, the live and predicted data track each other perfectly, except for a total of two

time period-road pairs: the evening rush hour on Jalan Rasuna Said (Panel B) and the morning

rush hour on Jalan Tentara Pelajar (Panel C), where in both cases the live data is slightly above

the predicted.

          Second, we can examine how our previous results would have looked had we used the

predicted data. To do so, we can re-run Table 1, but use the predicted data rather than the live

pre-data as our comparison group. Specifically, we run the regression

                                             ⋅        1       ⋅

where              denotes delay on route on date         for departure time , and live or predicted

for       0 and      1, respectively. In the sample, we include all weekdays between April 28 and

June 3 for the live data (     0), as well as the five weekdays of predicted data (         1). Once

again, we restrict the departure time   in different columns of the table.

          Appendix Table 5 provides these results, and shows that our findings would be the

same—the lifting of the 3-in-1 policy led to increased traffic both on the former HOV road

during rush hours, but also at other hours and on the alternate roads. Altogether, this implies that

the historical traffic prediction provides a valid counterfactual of the absence of the policy.



Results

We now use the predicted data to explore the effect of the policy over a larger network of roads

and over time. Figure 3 graphs the live post-data against the predicted traffic data for the
extended set of HOV roads (Panel A) and alternate routes (Panel B) for April 28th to June 3rd.24

Table 2 provides the corresponding set of regressions. As before, we observe an increase in

traffic for both the morning and evening rush hours for the former HOV roads after the policy is

lifted—the evening rush hour delay is nearly 70% higher than the predicted delay (Column 4 of

Table 2, Panel A). Again, we also observe both an increase in traffic in the non-rush hour times

of the former HOV roads (Panel A of Table 2), as well as a significant increase in traffic on the

alternate routes (Panel B of Table 2). In fact, the alternate routes experience a 21% increase in

traffic delays in the midday period, a 28% increase in the evening rush hour and a 34% increase

in the hour after rush hour.

         We can also look more closely at how the effect changes over time. In Figures 4A and

4B, we plot the average traffic delays each day, as well as the predicted travel delay, from April

28 to August 16th for the morning rush hour, the mid-day off-peak, the evening rush hour, and

the hour after the evening peak. Figure 4A does so for the former HOV roads, while Figure 4B

does so for the alternate routes.25 The figures show that the effect of the policy persists over time

on both the HOV and alternate roads, drops during the holiday of Lebaran (when many Jakarta

residents travel to their native regions), and increases again relative to the predicted after the

holidays, albeit smaller in magnitude after the holiday ends.



IV.      CONCLUSION

In this paper, we show that the lifting of Jakarta’s 3-in-1 policy not only had effects on traffic on



24
   Appendix Figure 5 shows the results separately by direction. The results are similar, with a slightly more
pronounced evening peak in the southbound direction.
25
    Appendix Figures 7A, 7B and 7C show the equivalent figures for Jalan Surdirman and its alternate routes from
April 1 to August 16. They show similar patterns: a stark increase in traffic delays the day after the policy is lifted,
followed by a continued increase in traffic, a decline in traffic during the holiday of Lebaran, and an increase again
in the post period (although slightly lower in magnitude than before the holiday period).
former HOV roads, but had spillovers to alternative roads and time periods. In short, more cars

were on the road.      Quite notable is the speed of the adjustment to this new equilibrium:

essentially, within a couple of days the delay pattern corresponding to the new equilibrium was

achieved.

        We cannot decisively say whether the 3-in-1 policy improved welfare. This depends on

how commuters with cars value the alternatives to single occupancy cars (e.g. carpooling, taxi,

public transport, or not travelling). However, given the extremely high congestion levels, we can

infer that the wedge between private and social cost is also high, making it likely that the

equilibrium after the lifting is severely inefficient.

Notes: Columns 1-6 explore how traffic delay, measured in minutes per kilometer, changed following the lifting of the 3-in-1 policy. The sample is panel data for
routes and departure times. Departure times cover 20 minute intervals on weekdays between Thursday, March 31 and Wednesday, May 4, with two observations
per route, corresponding to the two road directions. The sample in each column is restricted to the departure time interval (open on the right) indicated in the
column header. Only evening data are available for March 31, our first date of data collection. In Columns 1-4, where only pre-data from April 1 and April 4 are
used, standard errors reported in paratheses are adjusted for 48 clusters at the level of date and road direction . In Columns 5 and 6, where March 31 pre-data are
also included, standard errors are adjusted for 50 clusters at the level of date and road direction.

Notes: This table replicates Table 1 for a sample including all former 3-in-1 roads and ten alternate routes to 3-in-1 roads for weekdays between Thursday,
April 28 and Friday, June 3. Since data were not gathered for all alternate routes before the 3-in-1 policy was lifted, predicted data is used to provide a
control. Standard errors reported in paratheses are adjusted for 54 clusters at the level of date and road direction. See Table 1 Notes.
