Medicaid Expansions and Welfare Contractions: Offsetting Effects
on Prenatal Care and Infant Health?

                                             ABSTRACT


        Evaluations of changes to the Medicaid program have focused on increases in the generosity
of income cutoffs for Medicaid eligibility. Previous research shows that despite dramatic increases
in the number of births paid for by the Medicaid program, women often enroll in Medicaid at the
point of birth rather than before. States have addressed this problem by adopting administrative
measures designed to simplify the Medicaid application process and encourage the use of prenatal
care.   At the same time, recent declines in welfare caseloads may effectively increasing
administrative barriers to obtaining care.
        We examine the effects of these three types of policies (changes in income eligibility,
administrative reforms, and changes in welfare caseloads) on the use of prenatal care and infant
health using data from birth certificates covering all U.S. births between 1990 and 1996. We find
that increases in income cutoffs increased the use of prenatal care, while decreases in welfare
caseloads reduced the use of prenatal care, especially among blacks. The administrative reforms we
consider had little effect. The changes in the utilization of prenatal care that were induced by
increases in income eligibility cutoffs and decreases in welfare rates led to small but statistically
significant reductions in the incidence of very low birthweight among whites.
