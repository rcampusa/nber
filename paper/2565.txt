                        Real   Exchange Rate Variability
           Under Pegged and Floating Nominal Exchange Rate Systems:
                             An Equilibrium Theory




    This paper proposes a new explanation for the greater variability of real
exchange rates under pegged than under floating nominal exchange rate
systems. The explanation hinges on the propensity of governments to use
international   trade restrictions and financial restrictions for

balance—of—payments purposes under    pegged exchange rates.   In particular.

these restrictions become   more likely during periods of time when countries
suffer   losses of international reserves than might, without policy changes.
lead to a balance—of—payments crisis. This covariation of restrictions with
reserve changes implies that real exchange rates will vary less under pegged
than under floating exchange rates.

Introduction
   Most   economists and policyiinkers believe that economic perforrce
differs across alternative exchange rate systems. Moreover, nany
economists   believe that   there are clear policy implications that can be
drawn from observations about past behavior under different exchange
rate systems and from economic theory.1
   There is substantial evidence that the variability of real exchange
rates differs across alternative nominal exchange rate systems. A
simple   contrast of the variability before and    after 1973, when
widespread   floating was adopted,   is   insufficient evidence for this

proposition because   the latter period nay have been characterized    by

greater   variability of real underlying disturbances.2 But Stocloian
(1983) studied monthly exchange rate and price series over a 23 year
period for a sample of 38 countries and used observations on countries
and time periods of floating exchange rates prior to 1973 and of
countries with pegged exchange rates after 1973 to try to isolate the
effects of the exchange rate system ner se from the effects of
                                                                                  2

(possibly)       greater variability of exogenous disturbances in the 1970s.

The paper concluded tMt, although theperiod from 1973 through 1979

(the last year covered in the study) was characterized by greater

variance of disturbances to real exchange rates than the previous

period under Eretton Woods. the nominal exchange rate system itself was

associated with significantly greater variability of real exchange

rates.      A typical   country    that continued to peg its nominal exchange

rate   to   the U.S. dollar after 1973. for example, experienced an

increase in real exchange rate variability that was about 40 percent as

large as that experienced by countries that adopted floating rates, and

the difference was significant at the 1 percent level. This

relationship, of course, does not establish causality, but is

consistent with the view that pegged exchange rate systems lead to less

real exchange rate variability for any given set of underlying shocks.

Mussa (1986) examined this evidence further, adding some             additional
observations      and episodes that support this conclusion. In addition,

Mussa adopted the usual argument that the explanation for this

statistical relation is the sluggish adjustment of nominal goods

prices.

   This paper presents an alternative model, not based on sluggish

nominal price                explain the greater variability of real
                   adjustment,     to

exchange rates under floating than under pegged nominal exchange rate
systems.3     The basic    argument is the    following.   Real disturbances, to
supplies    or   devands   for   goods, alter real exchange   rates. Under a

system    of floating exchange      rates,   these disturbances   also affect the
                                                                                3


nominal   exchange   rate    (which creates a correlation between nominal and
real exchange    rates •   as observed    in the data). But    wider   pegged
exchange                  disturbances cause changes in the level of
            rates, the same

international reserves (and nominal money and prices). Countries that
choose   a system of pegged exchange     benefit from increases in
                                           rates

reserves as a result of real disturbances that would otherwise (under
floating    rates) create a real and nominal appreciation, and suffer
losses    of reserves from real and nominal depreciation.

   Then countries suffer losses of international reserves, they are

more likely to impose trade restrictions such as tariffs and quotas, or

exchange controls and capital controls —            or   the equivalent taxes —     to
prevent further losses in reserves that might otherwise create a

balance—of—payments        crisis and   "force" a devaluation. With some

intertemporal substitution, so that increases in expected future prices

tend to increase current prices, it turns out that the expectation that

policies to stem reserve losses will be followed also tends to

stabilize the real exchange rate. This sakes the response of the real

exchange rate to a given real disturbance snmller under a system of

pegged exchange rates than under a system of flexible exchange rates.

This   conclusion is obtained regardless of whether the underlying shocks
are changes in productivity or changes         in   tastes (or household
productivity).
   Essentially, a disturbance that would raise the relative price of

foreign goods in terms of domestic goods by 10 percent wider a system

of floating rates has the same effect under a system of pegged exchange
                                                                              4

rates, but also has an additional effect. Under floating rates, the

domestic currency would depreciate by about 10 percent. (This result

must be predicted by any reasonable model of exchange rates, because

empirically nominal and real exchange rates move together very

closely.) Under pegged exchange rates, however, the domestic central

bank will lose reserves (as it       acts   a residual buyer/seller to peg its

currency). The loss in reserves raises the probability of future

tariffs, quotas, and exchange and capital controls. This raises the

expected future (world) relative price of domestic goods.

Intertemporal substitution, whether operating through storage and

investment, substitution of labor effort, or direct substitution by

consumers of goods now rather than goods later, tends to raise the

current relative price of domestic goods. But this effect partly

offsets the direct effect of the disturbance, which was to raise the

relative price of the foreign good. As a consequence, the same

underlying disturbance has a smaller relative price effect under pegged

than under floating rates.

  The argument is reasonably robust to alternative parameter values.

The key assumption is that changes in the level of reserves, i.e.

balance of payments deficits and surpluses, lead to changes in the

conditional probability of future trade and financial taxes and

controls. While there are parameter values for which, for example, a

higher tariff might     reduce   rather than raise the world relative price

of the   domestic   good, these parameter values are    generally    fairly
special and not     likely   to characterize most economies   most   of the time.
                                                                                  S


    It is important that the argument presented in this paper            not be
 particularly   sensitive to parameter values or characteristics of the

economy,    because the observations that       the   paper   seeks to explain

appear to    characterize a wide variety of countries. Aside from the
sluggish—nominal—price explanation of the greater variability of real
exchange    rates under the floating nominal rate system, I laiow of no

explanation   other than   the   one proposed   here that is robust to many

variations   in parameter values or characteristics of the economy.
   The explanation proposed in this paper works regardless of whether

the nain sources of exogenous disturbances to the economy are from

shocks to technology that affect current output of narket goods or

shocks to tastes or household production functions that affect             consumer
valuations   of goods even if supplies are unaffected. That is. the

explanation is consistent with the predominance ofeither aggregate
supply shocks or aggregate demand shocks. It does not rely on a

particular narket structure or on the absence of uarkets for certain
types of risk—sharing. The model below, however, makes the assumption
of complete narkets for analytical convenience. Finally, the argument
does   not imply that the average level of tariffs or capital controls            be
greater under   pegged exchange rates;    instead,      it is based on the

differentcovariation of trade and payments restrictions with various
exogenous disturbances that accompanies the pegged rate system.
   As Karl   Brunner and Allan Meltzer (1986) say, in counenting on the

greater variability of real exchange rates under floating exchange rate

systems, "The findings raise a question about whether the            additional
                                                                                        6


variability     is an excess burden, borne under fluctuating rates, a

response to policy differences in a fluctuating rate regime, or a

substitution of exchange rate variability for other effects of

underlying variability." This paper is an attempt to work out the

implications of what seems to be a clear and almost universal policy

difference under the two regimes, and to argue that this policy

difference can, without strong restrictions on parameters of the model,

in principal account for the observed difference in variability.



A Model of Flexible Exchanze Rates

     Consider a model with two countries, each producing a different

internationally—traded good. Denote the goods X and Y, with the home

country producing X and the foreign country producing Y. The home

country   has   access to a technology that creates 9t+1            ct+i) units        of

good X at    date t+1 if k+i units of X were invested as an                 input   at date
t.   where ft is a positive stationary random variable represented by a

Markov process.4 Assume that E(8) =         1   and E[(8-'1)(6t+i—1)] > 0. This

positive autocorrelation in 0 will tend to induce positive

autocorrelation in the real exchange rate,           as    shown below. The foreign

country   has   access   to a technology that     turns an investment of

units   of   good Y at date t into e1 ,M(k1) units of Y at date t+l.

where        is also a positive random variable with E(OM) =            1    and

                      > 0. The deterministic parts of the production

functions t and          are   increasing and   concave.     It   is assumed that the

Invested input depreciates completely after one period of use.
                                                                                      7

   There is a representative household in each country that isaximizes
an intertemporally separable utility function defined over consumption
of X and Y. Tastes ny differ across countries, but the discount rate
  will be assumed to be counon to the two countries. The
representative       domestic household naximizes discounted expected

utility.

where B(s) and F(s) are contingent claims to deliveries of domestic

or foreign moneys       at date       t   in state—of—the—world s, (to   be defined

below)   and            F are the prices of the state contingent claims at

The exogenously—imposed restriction on available narkets. is one that

allows money to have positive value: only claims to physical payments

of moneys (or other assets) are permitted, while claims to physical

deliveries of goods X and Y are not permitted. Instead, these goods

must be purchased    with    money obtained in advance. The money that a

household   has   available for spending on goods at date t is given by



                        +   p(s                  +
     M(st) =   m(s_i)                1 •(k._i)       B(s)   + w(s)         (3)

where m(s_j) and n(s_i) are the quantities of domestic and foreign

the quantity of domestic money the household receives as principal or

interest on previously acquired state—contingent assets, and w(s) is a

lump sum transfer from the domestic government. In (4). F is divided

by 1+r, where t is      (as in Stoclain and Ilernandez. 1968)        a tax on

acquisitions of foreign currency, which will be referred to as a

"capital control" or "exchange control." because it could be replaced

in    the model with an economically equivalent quantitative restriction.
     Variables are dated according to the timing convention.that each
period   consists   of two subperiods: MI for "asset narket," followed by
                                                                          9

PM for "product uarket." At period—t AM. households trade assets and
moneys, and all payments required by previously—held assets are
completed. The domestic government mekes transfer payments
                                                                 w(st) in
state s to domestic households and collects any taxes that it levies on

asset trades, interest payments, etc. (These taxes will be discussed

below.) Then, during period-t PM. the household uses money that it

held at the end of period—t Alit to buy goods. Domestic money, M, must

be used to buy domestic goods, while foreign money. N, Is required for

foreign goods. Because narkets are complete except for the restriction

that    assets must unke    payments in moneys rather than in goods, trading

at    each AM is redundant.     Instead, payments required by previously-held

assets are made at each AM. The budget constraint (2) describes the

representative domestic household's opportunities to buy or sell assets

at the date-O asset market. Then, at each PM, households buy and

consume goods. The constraints faced by the domestic households at

each Pit are the cash—in—advance constraints. With the usual assumption

that all transactions use the seller's currency, these cash—in—advance

constraints are



     rn(s) =   it(s) — p(5t)Nd(5t) + K(s)]       0,                 (5)

Equation (5) states formally the definition of rn(s): the amount of

money that the representative domestic household held when it left

The   household's spending on            goods has two components. First, it buys

goods for consumption purposes. Second. it                         buys   goods at date t                for

investment purposes (for the "firm" owned by the household). Nominal

investment spending            at   date t is p(s)K(st) where K(s) goods are                               used
for investment. It is assumed that                  domestic households own and                        buy

investment        goods for domestic firms, while foreign households                                 own   and

buy investment goods for              foreign firms.5 Then

The household pays a price q(l+T) for the foreign good, where I is a

In the absence of investment, the solution for allocations is discussed

in Stoclainn and Hernandez (1968). As discussed in the introduction,

investment is included in the model for purposes of intertemporal

substitution so that higher expected future prices raise prices

currently.

   Equations (17) and (19) imply



             =                                                    (36)
                                         i(k+i).


   Stockman (1981) and Abel (1985) discuss effects of inflation on

capital accumulation in models related to the one in this paper. But

inflation will typically differ across alternative exchange rate

systems, and this difference could then cause differences in capital

accumulation and other features of the equilibrium. In order to focus

on other issues, I assume that under flexible exchange rates the

domestic money supply is chosen such that the domestic (production

price index) inflation rate t+1't+2 is deterministic, and (without

loss of generality) equal to unity. This corresponds to a type of

nominal interest rate rule.6

   Then (36) becomes



   ul(x'(s)) =                                                    (37)
                 fl2Jul(xc¼st+2))et+lr(st+2Ist)dst+2,l(x(st)).

If monetary policy were set so that the nominal interest rate were zero

then equation (37) would reduce to the standard condition.
                                                                            16



  Similarly, if foreign monetary policy were determined so that                  =

   for   all t,   then   equations (23) and (25) would imply



  v7(y) =         pEv1(4+2)e+1}        7(k÷1).                   (38)




  The world relative price of Y In terms of X is



           =                                                     (39)




where P/P8 is the exchange rate. Equations (15) and (16) imply that

this "real exchange rate" 1? can be written as




  if(s) =      v(yd(s))/u(xd(s))(l+g)                            (40)



   Alternatively, equations (21) and (22) give another expression for

the real exchange rate:




   U(s) =      (l)v(y(s))/u(xd3t(s)).                                (41)



   An    approximation to the variance of if(s) can be obtained by   taking

a first—order Taylor series approximation of U, around the mean of s,



                             —   ______
   U(s)        if(s) +
                                   o                                 (42)

Then, using the facts that          r   and T affect IT only through g. defined in

equation (20). and        defining



            P(a_j)                              • cov(z. z_j).                 (43)

This expression can be used to determine the variance of the real
exchange rate as a function of the variance of the exogenous variables
and the autocovariances of 0 and C.              The   expression involves
properties      of the   function if(s) evaluated at i,        and   these properties

   Although it can be assumed that both governments choose monetary

policies so as to keep p and q constant over time under flexible

exchange rates. it is not possible to make that assumption when the

exchange rate is pegged by monetary policy. Cenerally, pegging the

nominal exchange rate will turn out to require variations in either p

or q or both. But these price variations will have effects on capital

accumulation and other features of the equilibrium, including relative

prices. In order to emphasize the new points to be nade in this paper.

and not confound these points with effects of the exchange—rate system

that operate through effects of inflation on investment decisions. I

will make four assumptions. First, the one—period domestic and foreign

nominal interest rates are strictly positive in all states. As in

Lucas (1962). this amounts to a restriction on the stochastic processes

on exogenous variables. In contrast to Lucas's model, this assumption

does        imply a unit velocity of money in this model, for the reasons

explained in Stockrsan and Hernandez (1988). The purpose of this first

assumption is to guarantee feasibility of the following two

assumptions. Second, domestic monetary policy is chosen to keep p

constant. (This prevents effects on domestic investment of the kind

discussed   by Abel (1985).) Because the nominal interest rate is
strictly,positive,   rn(s) is identically zero. Consequently, increases

or decreases in Pt can be engineered by increases or decreases in M.

so it is feasible to vary the domestic money supply    to   keep Pt
constant.    Third. foreign monetary policy is chosen to wake q constant
under   a flexible—exchange rate system, and (instead) to sake the
                                                                             19


nominal   exchange rate e constant under a pegged    exchange—rate   system.
That   is. the foreign country is entirely responsible for pegging the

exchange rate. Fourth. I will assume that the foreign capital stock is

fixed —    it   does not depreciate and cannot be augmented. This

assumption     guarantees   that the differences in foreign nominal price

behavior under flexible and pegged exchange—rate systems do not affect

foreign   investment. Any differences in the behavior of real exchange

rates, then, will be due to features of the model other than the

non—superneutrality of money. (One reason this is desirable is that.

for moderate levels of inflation, these non—superneutralities are

probably, of negligible ngnitude empirically. See, e.g.. Danthine.

Donaldson. and Smith (19ff?).)

   With these assumptions, equation (35) determines the         function.

and xd and K are to be determined from equations (34) and (37). and the

transversality condition.

respond in the same direction to a change in 0 (or a change in
                But it is straightforward to show, via differentiation, that

          is    indeterminate in sign. While a rise in      raises   total

current resources for consumption and investment, the assumption that 0

is positively autocorrelated implies that the (conditional) expectation

of future B also rises. This increase in the prospective rate of

return to current investment can (depending on parameter values) lead

households to reduce current consumption in order to invest more. The

effect of a rise in 0. on the real exchange rate U depends on which

case applies: if a rise in                        raises   x' then           rises, otherwise it

falls. For concreteness of discussion, assume that &4iae                             >


Similarly, investment can rise or fall in response to a rise in e.

Because       the expected future rate of return to capital is higher,

expected future output is higher even if investment is unc ed.

    Consider next a rise in any lagged exogenous variable. Lagged e or

lagged C          affect      d and 1< only through their effects on the initial

capital stock. It is straightforward to show that a rise in the

initial capital stock in place at date t. k, raises both consumption

4    (and 4") and investment Kt. Let be(O.l) denote the fraction of an
increment to the initial capital stock that is invested when all random

domestic productivity at date t. i.e. a high realization of 6. raises

current consumption of the good in both countries and can either raise

or lower domestic investment, but (because utility is additively

separable) it has no effect on consumption of Y   in   either country. An

increase in the initial capital stock has the same effects as an

increase in 6 except that, because it does not affect future

productivity (i.e. 6) prospects, it unambiguously raises domestic

investment. An increase in the supply of domestic output, whether due

to a rise in productivity or a higher initial capital stock, raises the

relative price of the foreign good. An increase in domestic tariffs or

taxes on acquisitions of foreign currency lowers domestic consumption

of the imported good Y and raises foreign consumption of Y. without

changing consumption of X or domestic investment. The real exchange

rate U falls with a rise in g because the increase in g raises dM

lowering v?. without changing anything else on the right hand side of

equation (41). An increase in foreign tariffs or taxes on acquisitions

of foreign currency reduces foreign consumption of X. raises domestic

consumption of X, and lowers the narginal cost of domestic investment.

which raises investment. The increase in domestic consumption of X,

given consumption of Y. implies that the real exchange rate if rises

   A change in the real exchange rate, resulting from an exogenous

change in productivity or from exogenouS government tax policies, can

occur either through changes in •     q,    B"13F' or a combination of

changes in these variables. Generally, the effects of a change in

output on the nominal exchange rate e =                 can be divided into two

effects (see Stockman, l987a). First, tiven nominal domestic producer

prices p and q. the entire change in the real exchange rate would occur

through a change in the nominal exchange rate. In the case of an

exogenous rise in domestic output, the fall in its relative price would

occur as a domestic currency depreciation. Second, the nominal output

prices p and q are usually not given, but are affected by changes in

output: an exogenous rise in domestic output raises the demend for

money and — given the nominal money supply — reduces the level of

nominal domestic—money prices. Given the real exchange rate, this

leads to a domestic currency   appreciation. If the first. "relative
price,"   effect on the nominal exchange rate dominates the second.
"money—denmnd," effect, then domestic currency depreciates with an
exogenous rise   in the supply of domestic output. In this case, changes

in nominal   and real exchange rates are positively correlated, This
positive correlation is clearly borne out by the data           on   changes in
real and nominal exchange rates.
                                                                                24


     The relative price effect will dominate the money demand effect.

when the nominal money is fixed, if the elasticity of substitution

between foreign and domestic goods is sufficiently snall. so that the

relative price effect is large, or if the income elasticity of money

demand is snail, so that the money demand effect is snall. The

relative price effect will also dominate the money demand effect,

leading to a postive correlation between changes in real and nominal

exchange rates, if the nominal money supply changes endogenously so as

to prevent the large countercyclical swings in nominal prices that

would otherwise accompany changes in output (given that those changes

affect the demand for money). For example, a monetary policy of

"accommodating" changes in output would lessen or prevent the fall in

nominal prices when output rises exogenously, which would lessen or

eliminate   the "money demand effect" of the change its output on the
nominal exchange rate. This would make    it more   likely that      the

"relative   price, effect" would dominate. The assumptions made above —

that   monetary policies are adjusted to keep p and q constSit — are

sufficient for the relative price effect to dominate. With these

assumptions, the entire change in the real exchange        rate U,    in response

to   any disturbance, occurs through a change in the nominal exchange
rate e =   B'F'    The strong assumptions nude here are not necessary to
obtain a positive covariance of real and nominal     exchange rates,       as
observed in the data. All that is necessary is that the
countercyclical   effect of exogenous output   shocks    on nominal   prices    is
not the dominant effect on nominal exchange     rates.     As will be seen
                                                                                25

below,   the gain argument in this paper rests on this positive

covariation of real and nominal exchange rates which, as noted above,

is clearly supported by the data. The point to be cede is that, while

the assumptions of fixed p and q are very special, the results of those

assumptions are much more general. As argued earlier in the paper, the

point of this paper is to present a theory explaining differences in

real exchange rate variability across nominal exchange rate systems

that does not rely on special assumptions that would neke it unlikely

to account for a wide variety of experiences.

   A property of the model to be used below is the following. The

foreign money supply required to keep q constant does not depend on

realizations of 0. To see this, notice that equations (4). (5). (11).

(12), (16). (18). (22), (24). (29). and (31) determine n, rim, N. NW. F.

F'. yi, ydM, ,        Pr.. and q for given initial conditions (including a

choice of numeraire for P3. F' A, A', X. and C, and exogenously given

on A/f or xAW) Similarly, the domestic money supply required to

keep p constant does not depend on realizations of 0.



Pened Exchange Rates

   The model   is the same   as above, but there   are   two   modifications.
First, the government of the foreign country pegs its nominal exchange
rate to the currency of the home country (the "reserve—currency
country") by acting as a residual buyer or seller of its own currency
using a class of assets called "international reserves." These
reserves nay consist of interest—bearing assets, or foreign currency.
                                                                                   26


The division between assets owned by the central bank into

"international reserves" and "other assets" is largely arbitrary.

Because   the   foreign country's currency is pegged, the foreign country

no   longer conducts changes of its money supply to keep q fixed. In

fact, because the home      country   continues to choose its money supply so

as   to keep p fixed1 and because the nominal exchange      rate is pegged.

all variations in the real exchange rate occur through changes in q.
     Second.    the government uses a variety of policies to prevent losses

in its reserves. In particular. when the foreign country loses

reserves, the probability distribution of future tariffs and future

exchange controls and      capital controls   shifts, making   these   taxes and

controls   more likely. In particular,



     Pr[gM(s) < aIR" =       R]       Pr["(s) < a111" =   R]                (52)


for   all t,    j   >0, a, R and ?>     R.    This states that   a   lower level of

international reserves held by the foreign country implies a lower

probability that       future foreign composite tax rates            will   fall

below any   arbitrary level. i.e. a higher probability that they will be
above   any arbitrary level. Note that inequality (52) implies nothing
about   the level of g under alternative exchange rate systems. Instead.
it imposes a particular covariance of g with exogenous disturbances
that affect the level of reserves.
   There is substantial justification for the assumption in equation
(51) in the descriptive and analytical literature on government
                                                                                   27


policies   under pegged exchange rates. Countries frequently imposed

trade restrictions in the forms of tariffs, quotas, licensing

requirements. and so on. and controls, regulations, and taxes on

acquisitions of foreign currencies of interest—bearing assets

denominated in foreign currencies.7 Edwards (1987) has recently

studied eighteen devaluations by Latin American countries and concludes

that "Typically, the authorities will try to stop this process [loss of

reserves] by imposing exchange controls, hiking tariffs, and imposing

quantitative controls." He shows that

           in   the great najority of cases the devaluation was preceded by
           an important piling up of exchange controls and trade
           restrictions. In some episodes, such as Columbia in 1962 and
           1967. Ecuador in 1961. and Peru        in 1975, the initial    conditions

           (two years prior to the crisis) were already extremely

           restrictive. and became even tighter as the erosion of reserves

           became severe... .     (Edwards 1987)
(Many of these countries had price controls, so losses in reserves were

accompanied by apparent       real appreciations rather than depreciations.)
Park and Sachs (1967) have shown that           capital   controls can delay.

though not prevent, the collapse of a peg. As they state,              there has
been   "widespread use of capital       controls to    forestall exchange   rate

changes."       Marston   (1967) concludes that on the basis of historical
                                                   •



evidence, "Fixed exchange       rates   cannot   be .aintained   without extensive

aggravated the      external     disequilibrium'. The Report conceded,

furthermore,      that   these   delays have fostered the use of trade and

recent period of exchange rate flexibility, by no coincidence, has

witnessed the progressive disnantling of controls.. ," Taiwan, for

example, has reduced restrictions on international capital flows,

capital controls, and exchange controls (and most observers expect

additional reductions in controls in the near future), as a consequence

of its accumulation in recent years of additional foreign exchange

reserves. (Taiwan's reserves have risen to about 60 billion U.S.

dollars in mid—1987 from less than 10 billion in 1980.) Nations in the

European Monetary System, however, have continued to use restrictions

to       reduce losses of reserves. Marston concludes that         "controls were

the      norm during the Bretton Woods period. They are also a prevalent
feature of the European          Monetary Sys tem.' These   conclusions have also
been reached      by   Rogoff (1985) and Ciavazzi and Ciovannini (1986).
Clearly, not      only   current policies but     expectations of   future trade and
financial      restrictions are important in this regard. As Edwards notes.

   Although   the assumption in equation (52) seems to describe
accurately the behavior of governments under pegged exchange rates •            it
raises the question of why governments choose pegged as opposed to
floating exchange rates.         This paper   does not attempt to answer that

question. The explanation of why a particular exchange rate system is

chosen might be an important component of an explanation of the

different behavior of real exchange rates under alternative nominal

exchange rate systems. But there is not a priori reason to assume that

we must answer the question of why the system is chosen before we can

analyze the effects of the system, or as a part of that analysis. It

might be, for example, that pegged exchange rates are chosen as

discipline devices for monetary policy (which subsequent governments

attempt, often but not always successfully, to avoid). The different

behavior of nominal money and prices under pegged rates might have

different redistributive effects, so that a political equilibrium model

might be required to explain the choice. But these determinants of the

exchange   rate   system are not necessarily related in any important way

to the behavior of real exchange rates or economic aggregates that
result under that system.
  Consider    the following example, which outlines a simple model of the

choice   of an exchange rate     system. Assume      that the   population of the

foreign   country (which chooses the exchange rate system) consists of
two types of households, called p and f. Each type j = p.f             unximizes




                  pt   [U"(xt)   +   U*(4M) —   c]

where c is a utility cost representing foregone leisure due                    to   certain

transactions costs. Consider first households of type                   p. These
households incur time     costs of converting nominal              values in one
currency      into nominal values in terms of the other currency, and these
time costs of multiplying or dividing by the exchange rate is
particularly          high when the exchange       rate is floating rather than
pegged. For           simplicity, assume        c = 0 if the exchange rate     is pegged

but c >0 if the exchange rate is                   floating.   Households of   type   p.
then, prefer a pegged exchange rate system to a floating exchange rate
system because of these time costs of currency conversion.
   Next, consider households of type f. Assume that these households
bear little time costs from calculations involving the exchange rate.
but instead bear time costs from unexpected changes in the price
That    is.    these households prefer floating exchange            rates to pegged
rates   because the floating rate system relaxes a constraint on monetary

policy and permits it            to   achieve a preferred path of inflation (which I

have assumed          above   to be zero, for simplicity).

Aside    from the c term, the utility function in expression (54) is the

same as in expression (8) with the function VTM                 replaced   by uTM. The

reason for this assumption is to u-eke                utility homothetic.    Then.

conditional on the exchange               rate system, the     equilibrium is the same as

that when households naximize expression (8), except for the level of

foreign utility. The homotheticity assumption implies that

redistributions of wealth between the two types of households leaves

all equilibrium prices unchanged.

     The exchange rate system can be thought of as the outcome of a

political process, determined by the relative numbers of households of

each type (which uny change over time), the nngnitudes of        and

and other exogenous variables associated with political skills, and so

on. One special case of this would be a political process that

minimizes some weighted average of        and . which   would correspond to

the choice of an exchange rate system to aiaximize a social welfare

function.

     If the political process results in a pegged exchange rate system.

it   will   be optimal, under a wide variety of circumstances, for the

government to choose a stochastic process for g that      corresponds   to

inequality (52). Typically, a fall in the level of international

reserves sakes a future balance of payments crisis more likely, because

the excess of reserves, above the minimum level consistent with no

crisis, becomes     smaller.8   Cenerally. there are several policies that

governments     could vary in order to mitigate a loss in reserves. Two

types   of   policies, tariffs or taxes on acquisitions of foreign

currency.     nrc discussed above. In addition, a government might raise
spending     on domestic goods in order to raise the relative price of
those goods. (The relative price of the domestic good would rise as

exceeds that of households who pay the higher taxes to finance the

spending.) As long as all such policies have costs (e.g. if the goods

purchased by the government have little utility value to households).

fall in the foreign nominal money supply to keep the exchange rate

the foreign central bank conducts open uarket sales of those reserves

Conclusions

   An   equilibrium model of exchange rates has been developed to explain
the observation that real exchange rates vary less under pegged than
under floating nominal exchange       rate   systems. The explanation is
intended   to be robust to the specific assumptions made in        the
presentation     of the formal model. Aside from explanations that rely on
                                                                       36


sluggish    nominal price adjustment — which have the problems mentioned

in the introduction — no (or few) alternative explanations have been

proposed.

     There are several problems with the sluggish—price explanation of

the difference in real exchange rate variability across nominal

exchange rate systems. The nain problem is that, however important

sluggish nominal price behavior might be for explaining business

cycles, the timing and the observed dynamics in real exchange rates

appear inconsistent with most reasonable stories of sluggish price

adjustment. Studies of the real exchange rate show that it is very

close to a random walk, though there is some weak evidence of

mean—reversion (see. e.g. Huizinga. 1987).10

     I want to imke three distinct arguments. First, the length of time

before the real exchange rate returns part way toward a mean is too

long, on a priori grounds, for plausible nominal price rigidity.

(Huizinga finds evidence of a mean—reversion only after about 3—6 years

in the recent floating—rate period, and in longer data samples

mean—reversion is slower still). It is difficult to see how menu costs

or other rationale for sluggish nominal prices could mice them adjust

so slowly.

     Second, if nominal disurbances in the presence of nominal price

rigidities accounted for most of the variation in real exchange rates

under flexible rate systems, the exchange rate would eventually return

to   roughly its original starting point. If the nominal disturbance   had

no pernnnent real effects, the real exchange rate would return exactly
                                                                             37


to its original position. But temporary real effects of nominal shocks

might have pernanent effects on the distribution of wealth. etc., so

that there could be perianent effects on the level of the real exchange

rate. Nevertheless, one would expect the return to be closer than

suggested in the evidence."

     Third. the length of the average business cycle provides a guide as

to the duration of nominal price slugg:ness (on the assumption that

business cycles involve this sluggishness). The typical length of a

recession is an overestinate of the length of time that it takes

nominal prices to adjust most of the way back to equilibrium following

a disturbance. It is an overestimate because there are tinny reasons

(associated with adjustment costs in labor markets, inventories. etc.)

that changes in output and employment would tend to persist, once

started, even if the original disturbance to the economy has vanished.

Observations on the lengths of typical business cycles suggest that, if

nominal price rigidities were also responsible for most variations in

real exchange rates, we would see real exchange rates return most of

the way toward their means, following a shock, after a period of no

more than about      two years.
     Of course, the assertion that real exchange rate variability      is not
(mainly) explained by nominal     price   rigidities does jgj   imply that

those   rigidities   do not play major roles in busienss cycles. As long

as business cycles are highly correlated across countries — as they
are — and nominal prices adjust toward their equilibrium values with
roughly the   same   speed in different countries, short—run price
                                                                        38


rigidities that are coimnon across countries nay play unjor roles in

business cycles without playing any najor role in fluctuations of real

or nominal exchange rates.

   There are other explanations of the difference in real exchange rate

variability across regimes that do not (necessarily) involve sluggish

nominal price adjustments; some of these were discussed in Stocknn

(1983). Some arguments base the difference in real equilibria under

alternative nominal exchange rate systems on incomplete narkets.

Recent work with these implications includes }lseih (1984). Greenwood

and Williamson (1987) and Persson and Svensson (1987). In the absence

of complete narkets. the state—contingent pattern of monetary policy

can affect the real equilibrium.

   Similarly, in models in which money is not superneutral, the

difference of inflation paths across alternative exchange rate systems

can affect the real equilibrium (as in Greenwood and Williamson. or

Aschauer and Greenwood, l982).12 The real equilibrium can also differ

across alternative exchange rate systems in the absence of Ricardian

equivalence, as in Helpmen and Razin (1987).13

   While these models correctly analyze channels through which the

nominal exchange rate system can affect characteristics of equilibria.

no model along these lines has been developed to try to explain the

systenatically    higher variance of real exchange rates under flexible
exchange   rate   systems. Explanations could probably be constructed
based   on any of   these models, but it appears likely that the
explanations   would be   sensitive to special properties of the model or
                                                                         39


parameter values. For example, the absence of uinrkets for certain

types of contingencies can clearly affect real equilibrium allocations,

but the effects on the variance of relative price changes would seem to

depend on the sources of disturbances, the state—contingent path of

monetary policy, and so on. It seems unlikely that arguments like

these could account for the wide range of evidence on real exchange

rate variability. The explanation presented in this paper, in

contrast, does not rely on any specific parameter values but on a

general property of government behavior under pegged exchange rate

systems, namely the propensity to implement policies that help prevent

reserve losses, arid the greater propensity to implement these policies

when their benefits —   in   terms of preventing a run on the currency —

are   greater.

   The model in this paper assumed that tariffs and taxes on

acquisitions of foreign currency are imposed independently, under

flexible exchange rates, of the other exogenous disturbances that

effect the exchange rate. On the other hand, equation (52) implies

that these policies are correlated with exogenous disturbances under

pegged exchange rates. It is easy to generalize the model to allow g

         to be correlated with e and   C under flexible   exchange rates.

Fornally, this results in some additional terms in equation (44). But

the conclusions of this paper are still obtained as long as higher g

(higher tariffs, and so on) tends to accompany domestic currency

appreciation. This is the likely pattern of covariance under flexible

exchange rates: countries with real and nominal appreciation
                                                                       40


experience complaints from businesses about losses in international
"competitiveness."   and this raises the probability of tariffs and

similar measures. But, as long as the imposition of a tariff raises

the world terms of trade, an increase in the probability of a tariff

exacerbates the real appreciation, and raises the variability of real

exchange rates in the flexible rate system. As a result, the model

continues to predict lower variability of the real exchange rate under

the pegged rate system.

   It is straightforward to apply the results of this paper to a mixed

exchange rate system such as the EMS. To the extent that governments

intervene in exchange nnrkets and experience changes in the level of

international reserves, such systems resemble pegged exchange rates.

and should be associated with less variability in relative prices.

Realipunents   of exchange   rate bands alter the expected path of future

losses in reserves and, by so altering the probability of future

restrictive government policies, these realignments should be

accompanied by changes in real exchange rates.

   The model discussed here has a number of subsidiary implications.

For example, the model implies that a disturbance to productivity has a

larger effect on investment under pegged exchange rates than under

flexible rates, While this implication is testable, it relies on the

particular way that intertemporal substitution was built into the

model. The model was developed with stationary productivity shocks and

government policies. As a result, it implies that the real exchange

rate is stationary. There is evidence that the real exchange rate is
                                                                                41



nonstationary, and      it is   not difficult to modify the assumptions about

the   probability laws for B and C to produce a nonstationary real
exchange rate.
     The model assumed that, under flexible exchange rates, the
governments   followed monetary policies that        resulted in constant p and
q.    This assumption can be relaxed, without any         najor   changes in the

model's implications, at the cost of introducing additional

complications associated with the nonsuperneutrality of money.

Similarly, investment in the foreign country could be introduced in the

model, but the different behavior of foreign inflation under pegged             and

floating   exchange rate systems would add        terms   associated with the

nonsuperneutrality of money. As long         as   those effects are relatively

snail in nngnitude. all of the implications discussed above would

continue to be obtained, Disturbances to productivity could be

replaced by disturbances to tastes in the model with little effect on

its implications.

      It would be useful to extend the analysis in this paper to

incorporate a better model of the choice of an exchange rate system.

It    would also be   useful to examine a broader range of government

policies    that   might   be followed in response to a toss in reserves under
pegged exchange       rates.    Perhaps policy   responses   other than those
discussed in this paper        reinforce the conclusions reached here.
                                would

These policies could include changes in government spending, taxes, or
monetary    policy (with real effects). Similarly, additional

implications       could be obtained by adding     nontraded goods to   the model.
                                                                                 42


to determine how the relative price of nontraded goods should behave —

under the assumptions above — under alternative exchange rate systems.
Drazen and Helpnnn (1967. forthcoming) examine          some related   issues.

Further work needs    to   be done   to   develop these other implications of

the model and to     test them   empirically.14

     One interesting implication of the model (with some auxiliary

assumptions) is that the      probability     distribution of snail real

exchange   rate changes nay be nearly the same under the two exchange
rate systems.     Snail disturbances nay be associated with only

second—order effects on expectations of future policy changes, so that

the resulting changes in real exchange rates would be independent of

the system. Large disturbances, in contrast, would have sizable

effects on expectations of future policies to stem reserve losses and

so would have siraller effects on the real exchange rate under the

pegged exchange rate system.

     Direct   empirical   tests of the model would require the construction

of   time—series of aggregate measures of barriers to international trade
and payments.      A time—series is required because the model's key
implications     follow from the different covariances between these

barriers and other exogenous disturbances under alternative exchange

rate systems. While sc"e of          the additional variability of real
exchange rates     under the flexible rate system      nay   be attributable to
nominal price     sluggishness, it is difficult to view that as the najor
part of the explanation for the reasons 1 have outlined. This paper
has suggested another explanation that seems          consistent. with the actual
behavior of governments when faced with reserve losses and seems robust

to nnny variations in parameter values and sources of disturbances.

An earlier draft of this paper was presented at the November, 1987

Carnegie—Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy in honor of

Allan H. Meltzer. I wish to thank participants in that conference and

in seminars of Arizona State. Boston University. Northwestern, New York

University. Princeton. and the University of Pennsylvania. and

particularly Karl Brunner. Allen Brazen, Marvin Coodfriend,

Elhann HelpnEn. and Robert Hodrick. for helpful comments. The usual

caveat strongly applies. Support from the National Science Foundation

and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation is gratefully acknowledged.



1. There have, however, been few attempts to categorize differences in

nacroeconomic behavior across exchange rate systems in a systenatic

way. See Baxter and Stocknnn (1987).



2. This increase in variability nay even have led nations to adopt

floating exchange rates.



3. This paper develops fonvally an argument that was loosely outlined

in   Stoclaimn (196Th). The model used here is a variant of that        in

Stoclcnan and -Hernandez   (1988). which   is based on Stocloian   (1960). Lucas

(1982).   Svensson (1985a). and Stockzmn and Svensson (1967).


4. The model ignores subsequent resale, by import—specialists, of
 imported goods.
5. See   Stockmen and Svensson (1987).           In contrast to   that paper, this
paper imposes the assumption that only domestic households work as

purchasing agents for     domestic firms, and vice—versa. Because
state—contingent bonds     can be used        to duplicate exactly the returns on
investments, this assumption          is   unimportant.


6. See    Coodfriend   (1987)   and   Barro (1987).


7. Besides the references in the text,            see   Friedmen (1951).   Johnson

(1972),    and Xreuger (1981). Qiriously. there seems not to have been
any   fornal studies    of the effects of balance of payments         deficits on

the aggregate level of protectionism and financial restrictions.



8. See. e.g.. Krugman (1979). Flood and Carber (1983. 1984), Calvo

(1986). and Baxter (1987).



9. The model can be generalized easily to include nonzero transfer

payments of newly issued foreign money under pegged exchange rates.



10.        Also see. e.g.. Roll (1979). Adler and Lehacnn (1983). Meese

and Rogoff (1983a.b), (1985). and Mark (1986).



11.        See. Huizinga (1987).



12.        However, real effects of expected inflation seem to have been

too   snaIl to estinate empirically in most             cases.
13.    Some other explanations based on the absence of Ricardian

equivalence face the problems that most reserves are held in interest

bearing form, and. in any case, are a snail fraction of private wealth.

Also, life—cycle models of non—Ricardian equivalence generate results

that are quite close to Ricardian models when reasonable parameter

values are used, as Poterba and Suniners, 1987, have shown. Finally,

the results of Backus and Kehoe (1987) could be applied to show that

absence of Ricardian equivalence is not sufficient for differences in

real equilibria across alternative exchange rate systems.



14.     There have been few attempts to categorize systenatically the

differences in the behavior of vain economic aggregates under

alternative exchange rate systems. Baxter and Stocknn (1987) have

found little in the way of systenatic differences. However, their

results do not necessarily falsify the predictions of this model

regarding variables other than the real exchange rate, such as

investment. Indeed, it seems difficult to reconcile their results with

models based on sluggish nominal price adjustment, since most of those

models imply substantial differences in the behavior of aggregates

across alternative exchange rate systems.
