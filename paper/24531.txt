Knowing the elasticity of taxable income (ETI) is crucial for understanding the effects of taxation
on taxpayer behavior and consequently on tax revenues. Previous research finds that high-income
individuals are the most sensitive to tax policy changes. However, these individuals have more
opportunities to defer income to future tax bases by altering the composition of their
compensation than lower-income individuals. This paper considers the taxable income elasticity
when individuals can shift income across tax bases and thereby defer taxation. We decompose the
elasticity of taxable income into a real response as well as an income shifting response. We
measure the tax rate on deferred income by the expected tax gain from deferring income using
stock options as developed by Hall and Liebman (2000). Our results demonstrate that income
shifting is an important component of previous estimates of the ETI. Because shifted income is
taxed at future dates, income shifting decreases the welfare loss from personal income taxation
associated with previous estimates.

      1. Introduction



      The elasticity of taxable income (ETI) is an important parameter for understanding the

behavioral implications of tax policy changes. Feldstein (1999) showed that under certain

conditions, the ETI is a sufficient statistic for the deadweight loss of taxation. Given the

importance of this elasticity, there is an extensive body of research that has estimated its

magnitude. While much of this research has estimated relatively low elasticities, some studies

find that the ETI is significantly larger near the top of the income distribution. 1 In other words,

higher income households exhibit greater responsiveness to tax changes. This finding is relevant

for our study which focuses on executive compensation. Bebchuk and Grinstein (2005) and

Frydman and Saks (2010) document that there has been a dramatic growth in compensation of

executives largely driven by increases in stock options and other incentive-based pay that give

executives the ability to defer some portion of their current pay into the future. In an earlier

paper, Gorry et al. (2017) we find that executives respond to tax changes by changing the form

of their compensation. By substituting from cash towards equity-based compensation, executives

can defer taxation on their income in high tax years. This ability to defer income taxation has

implications for the overall elasticity of taxable income.

      Given that estimates of the ETI play a central role in our understanding of the welfare effects

of taxation, it is important to understand how this ability of executives to time their

compensation influences estimates of ETI and the resulting welfare effects of taxation. Studying

the 1993 tax increase, Goolsbee (2000) found significant reductions in taxable income in

response to the tax change. However, he showed that much of this change in taxable income was

a short-run response in executives choosing to exercise their stock options in advance of the tax

change rather than from a long-run reduction in taxable income. In contrast, Gorry et al. (2017)

find that executives not only change the timing of option exercise in response to tax changes but

also that they change the form of their compensation in response to taxes. That is, the share of

deferred income in total income responds significantly to current tax rates. In particular, if

current tax rates are high, then the share of stock options in the compensation package increases

significantly, while the share of salary and other cash compensation decreases. This result

implies that there are more substantial long-run responses beyond the exercising of stock options

documented by Goolsbee (2000).

    These long-run and short-run responses of taxable income can be thought of as income-

shifting responses. In other words, executives respond to anticipated tax rates by shifting

incomes to periods of lower tax burdens. In addition to income shifting responses, executives

may also have other real responses, in terms of reduced labor supply, both at the extensive and

intensive margin. In this paper, we decompose the overall elasticity of taxable income into an

income shifting response as well as a real response.

    To capture these two responses, we first adapt the theory developed in Devereux, et al.

(2014), Piketty, et al. (2014), and Harju and Matikka (2016) to measure ETI when there are

opportunities to shift income to other tax bases. While we use a static theoretical framework,

income deferral is a dynamic process. 2 To address this issue, we used the approach in Hall and

Liebman (2000) and Gorry et al. (2017) to measure total expected tax rates on current and

deferred income for executives in each year. Using measured differences between the tax rates

on current and future income allows us to estimate ETI and decompose the total elasticity into


2
  There are many motives for an individual to defer current year income. First, stock options allow the individual to
avoid capital gains taxes on future returns. In addition, this gain could be greater if tax rates vary over time
(generating an option value to realize income in low tax years) or are progressive (allowing the individual to shift
income to years when the earn less).

                                                         2
real responses (reductions in total reported income due to a reduction in labor supply) and

income shifting across tax bases and over time.

   We then use data from COMPUSTAT to distinguish between these two effects. We find that

in the specification that accounts for income shifting, the overall ETI is higher than in previous

studies, and is estimated at 2.24. This estimate compares to an estimated elasticity of 0.80 for our

sample when not accounting for income deferral. Decomposing this overall response, the income

shifting response is estimated to be 1.93 and the real response only 0.31. In other words, much

of the behavioral response to taxation comes from the income shifting response, rather than the

real response.

   Finally, we assess how our ETI estimates, which account for income shifting, change our

understanding of the change in welfare from a change in the tax rate. Accounting for income

shifting implies that the reduction in welfare from an increase in taxes is almost half the size of

the reduction in welfare implied by ETI without accounting for income shifting, because some of

the income shows up in later periods.

   We are not the first to note that income shifting has implications for the welfare loss of

taxation. Slemrod (1998) pointed out that if current revenue loss is made up for by tax revenues

in future years then the deadweight loss associated with a particular elasticity of taxable income

would be misleading. His suggested approach is to look at the present discounted value of

government revenue to get a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of taxation. This

idea has been further developed by Saez (2004) and Chetty (2009).

   Income shifting responses have been documented in papers by Gordon and Slemrod (2000)

and Devereux, et al. (2014). The focus of these papers has been the shifting of income across the

corporate and personal tax bases in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively.



                                                  3
Gordon and Slemrod (2000) show that following the Tax Reform Act of 1986, taxable income

shifted out of the corporate sector and towards the individual sector. Devereux, et al. (2014)

document the income shifting by small business owners from the corporate base to the personal

tax base. Our paper studies income shifting across the current tax base and the deferred tax base.

In other words, by shifting income to a different form, such as from salaries to stock options in

the current period, individuals reduce their current tax base and defer taxation to a different time

period. Therefore, by developing measures of current and future tax rates applicable to the

current and future tax base, one can estimate the elasticity of taxable income in the presence of

income shifting, using the static approach developed in Devereux, et al. (2014), Piketty, et al.

(2014), and Harju and Matikka (2016).


   Other papers that have estimated significant income shifting effects across tax bases and over

time, using periods of tax reform to identify the behavioral response, are le Maire and Schjerning

(2013), Kleven and Schultz (2014), Harju and Matikka (2016), Pirttilä and Selin (2011) and

Kreiner, Leth-Petersen and Skov (2016). For the United States, Goolsbee (2000) shows that in

anticipation of the 1993 tax hike, executives responded by realizing income in low-tax years

through the exercising of options. Parcell (1995) and Sammartino and Weiner (1997) similarly

document the large shift of taxable income into 1992 from 1993 in response to the tax hike on

high income earners enacted in 1993. Kreiner, et al. (2016) also document intertemporal shifting

of wage and salary income in response to a large tax reform in Denmark, which reduced the

marginal tax rate on earnings from 63 percent to 56 percent between 2009 and 2010. They find




                                                 4
that individuals in the 95th -99th percentile shifted 15 percent of their average monthly income to

2010, while for the top one percent of wage earners, the number was 30 percent. 3

    In Section 2, we describe a theoretical framework that separates the real responses from

income shifting, and we describe our empirical specification that accounts for this income

shifting by connecting this theoretical model to the empirical specifications in the existing ETI

studies. In Section 3, we describe how to measure the total tax rates on current and deferred

income and discuss the measured rates. Section 4 discusses the data that we use and presents our

results. Section 5 concludes.




    2. ETI and Income Shifting: Theoretical Foundation



This section applies the framework developed in Devereux et al. (2014), Piketty et al. (2014),

and Harju and Matikka (2016) to measure the elasticity of taxable income when there are

opportunities for executives to shift income to other tax bases. While income deferral is

inherently dynamic, the static framework provides us with the key equations to estimate the

taxable income elasticity if we can measure the expected tax rate on deferred income, 𝜏𝐷 . We

consider measurement of this tax rate in the next section.



    a. Basic Static Model of Income Shifting




3
  They suggest that this type of income shifting likely happened with the cooperation of the employer. Although this
is not illegal in Denmark, such cooperation would be illegal in the United States.


                                                         5
    We assume that there are two personal tax bases available for the individual. Total income

earned in each year is given by 𝑌 = 𝑍 + 𝑁, where 𝑍 is taxable income and 𝑁 is income that the

individual defers to a future year. Deferral can occur using stock options or tax-deferred

retirement accounts to move current income into the future. Let 𝛼 be the share of income that the

worker chooses to defer. We assume that the current tax rate for income earned is given by 𝜏 and

the expected tax rate on deferred income is given by 𝜏𝐷 . Executives can legally shift income to

future years with the use of stock options, and the expected tax gain of doing so will be measured

by the difference in the tax rates: 𝜏 − 𝜏𝐷 .

    Following Harju and Matikka (2016), we assume that the utility for individual 𝑖 takes the

following form:

                                  𝑢𝑖 (𝑐, 𝑌, 𝛼) = 𝑐 − 𝜃𝑖 (𝑌) − 𝜙𝑖 (𝛼) ,                          (1)

where 𝑐 is period consumption, 𝜃𝑖 is individual 𝑖′𝑠 disutility of earning income 𝑌, and 𝜙𝑖 is

individual 𝑖 ′𝑠 cost of deferring income to a future period. This cost could include time preference

or any additional risk that such shifting entails. Individuals want to maximize their utility by

choosing their income, consumption, and share of income to defer. Deferral in our setup can be

thought of as the benefit of shifting income across tax bases net of any costs.

    With this setup the individual budget constraint can be written as:

                           𝑐 = (1 − 𝜏)(1 − 𝛼)𝑌 + (1 − 𝜏𝐷 )𝛼𝑌 + 𝑅,                              ( 2)

Here 𝑐 captures the total value of after tax earnings where 𝑅 is virtual income that adjusts

income to account for non-linearity in the tax schedule – that is virtual income from paying

lower rates on income taxed at less than the marginal rate under consideration. Substituting the

budget constraint into the utility function implies that the individual chooses total income 𝑌 and




                                                   6
the share of deferred income 𝛼 to maximize utility. This problem generates the following first-

order conditions:

                                (1 − 𝜏)(1 − 𝛼) + (1 − 𝜏𝐷 )𝛼 = 𝜃𝑖′ (𝑌),                                      (3)

and

                                    (𝜏 − 𝜏𝐷 )𝑌 = 𝜙′𝑖 (𝛼).                                                   (4)

Equation (3) gives the first-order condition with respect to income and states that marginal take

home pay, given share 𝛼 is deferred, is equal to the marginal disutility of earning additional

income. Equation (4) is the first-order condition with respect to 𝛼 and states that the tax gain

from deferring income should equal the marginal cost of shifting additional income. Note that

when 𝛼 = 0, the model reduces to the standard ETI framework for wage income, in which the

ETI is a sufficient statistic for the cost of taxation.

      Next, we can derive the elasticity of current taxable income in the presence of deferral. To do

so, we follow Devereux, et al. (2014), and Piketty, et al. (2014), and Harju and Matikka (2016).

For this exercise consider a change in 𝜏 given by 𝑑 𝜏 > 0. Note that because the measured tax

rate on deferred income depends on the current tax rates, we cannot hold 𝜏𝐷 fixed as done in

previous papers. Traditionally, the elasticity of taxable income is defined as:

                                             1 − 𝜏 𝜕𝑍
                                      𝜖𝑍 =                .                                                (5)
                                               𝑍 𝜕(1 − 𝜏)

To derive this elasticity, we first take the derivative of ln 𝑍𝑡𝑖 with respect to the current tax price,

which yields the following expression:

  𝜕𝑍𝑡𝑖 (1 − 𝜏𝑡𝑖 )          𝜕(1 − 𝜏𝑡𝑖 )(1 − 𝜏𝑡𝑖 )          𝜕(1 − 𝜏𝑡𝑖 )(1 − 𝜏𝑡𝑖 ) 𝜕(1 − 𝜏𝐷𝑡𝑖 )(1 − 𝜏𝑡𝑖 )
                    = 𝜖𝑌                         + 𝜖1−𝛼 [                      −                       ]   ( 6)
  𝜕(1 − 𝜏𝑡𝑖 )𝑍𝑡𝑖           𝜕(1 − 𝜏𝑡𝑖 )(1 − 𝜏𝑡𝑖 )         𝜕(1 − 𝜏𝑡𝑖 )(1 − 𝜏𝑡𝑖 ) 𝜕(1 − 𝜏𝑡𝑖 )(1 − 𝜏𝐷𝑡𝑖 )

and

                                                              𝜕(1 − 𝜏𝐷𝑡𝑖 )(1 − 𝜏𝑡𝑖 )
                                    𝜖𝑍 = 𝜖𝑌 + 𝜖1−𝛼 [1 −                                ].                  ( 7)
                                                              𝜕(1 − 𝜏𝑡𝑖 )(1 − 𝜏𝐷𝑡𝑖 )

                                                          7
   This setup implies that the elasticity of taxable income can be separated into two separate

components. First,   𝜖𝑌 represents how much income changes in response to a change in the tax

rate. Second, 𝜖 1−𝛼 denotes the elasticity of the wage tax base with respect to the net of tax rate,

capturing the individual income shifting effect when the tax rate changes. These two elasticities

combine to generate the overall behavioral response that has typically been measured in the

empirical literature as 𝜖𝑍 . Our equation (7) varies from the work of Harju and Matikka (2016), in

which they derive ETI as simply the summation of 𝜖𝑌 and 𝜖1−𝛼 . They can derive this specific

relationship because their tax bases are taxable wage income and dividends. Hence, the tax on

                                                                                        𝜕 (1−𝜏 𝐷𝑡𝑖 )
dividends is independent of the tax rate on wage income. With this independence,                       = 0,
                                                                                        𝜕 ( 1−𝜏 𝑡𝑖 )


leaving 𝜖𝑍 = 𝜖𝑌 + 𝜖1−𝛼 . However, as measured in the following section, the deferred tax rate in

our model is not independent of the current tax rate. Thus, the elasticity of taxable income is the

combination of the real response of income to changes in the tax rate, the income shifting

response, and the sensitivity of the deferred tax rate to changes in the current tax rate.



   b. Welfare



Next, we consider the welfare implications of deferring income. Feldstein (1999) argues that the

elasticity of taxable income is a sufficient statistic for understanding the excess burden of income

taxation. However, Slemrod (1998) points out that the ability to shift income to different tax

bases by realizing income in a different year means that estimated ETI can be misleading if

revenues are made up in future years. Following Chetty (2009), who considers the case in which

tax avoidance is costly and hence may influence the excess burden, this section calculates the




                                                  8
marginal excess burden assuming government revenues are rebated lump sum to individuals.

This implies that the marginal excess burden is defined by the behavioral response to taxation.

    Again, following Harju and Matikka (2016), we denote welfare with the following equation:

      w = [(1 − τ)(1 − α)Y + (1 − τD )𝛼𝑌 − 𝜃𝑖 (𝑌) − 𝜙𝑖 (𝛼)] + (1 − 𝛼)𝑌𝜏 + 𝛼𝑌𝜏𝐷 . #(8)

The bracketed first term is individual utility, and the second and third terms represent

government revenue from the income tax base and deferred income tax base respectively.

    Now, we consider how a change in the current income tax rate, 𝜏, influences welfare if we

assume no income shifting. Because the individual is making optimal choices with respect to the

tax rate, the envelope theorem applies to the individual’s utility, so only the first- order effects

from the tax change have any effect on welfare. This observation implies that the change in

welfare from a change in the tax rate can be expressed as:

                             𝜕𝑤          𝜏
                                = −𝑌 [       𝜖 ].                                                    ( 9)
                             𝜕𝜏       (1 − 𝜏) 𝑍

This expression is the marginal excess burden when there is no option to defer income, and the

elasticity of taxable income is a sufficient statistic for the deadweight loss. However, when the

individual has the option to defer income, the marginal excess burden also depends on the size of

deferral elasticity, 𝜖1−𝛼 , the size of the real elasticity, 𝜖𝑌 , (which differs from 𝜖𝑍 when deferral is

possible), the difference in the net of tax rates, 𝜏𝐷 − 𝜏, the relative size of the tax bases, 𝛼, and

the levels of each of the tax rates. We can express the change in welfare with income shifting as:

              𝜕𝑤    𝜕( 1 − 𝛼 )               𝜕𝑌
                 =𝑌            (𝜏𝐷 − 𝜏) −           [(1 − 𝛼)𝜏 + 𝛼𝜏𝐷 ].                             (10)
              𝜕𝜏    𝜕(1 − 𝜏)              𝜕 (1 − 𝜏)

    To complete the derivation of the welfare equation from equation (10), we have to be able to

define 𝜖1−𝑎 . Because 𝑍 = 𝑌(1 − 𝑎):

                                 1 − 𝜏 𝜕𝑌      1 − 𝜏 𝜕 (1 − 𝛼)
                          𝜖𝑍 =               +                  ,                                  (11)
                                   𝑌 𝜕(1 − 𝜏) (1 − 𝛼) 𝜕 (1 − 𝜏)

                                                   9
    or

                                                          1 − 𝜏 𝜕 (1 − 𝛼)
                                        𝜖𝑍 = 𝜖𝑌 +                          .                                    (12)
                                                         (1 − 𝛼) 𝜕 (1 − 𝜏)

Combining equation (7) and equation (12), we get the following:

                                  𝜖1−𝛼 =                                   .                                    (13)
                                                𝜕(1 − 𝜏𝐷𝑡𝑖 )(1 − 𝜏𝑡𝑖 )
                                            [1 − (                     ]
                                                𝜕 1 − 𝜏𝑡𝑖 )(1 − 𝜏𝐷𝑡𝑖 )

As before, if we assume that                           is small, then 𝜖1−𝛼 ≈ (                 .   Using this, we can
                                 𝜕( 1−𝜏 𝑡𝑖)(1−𝜏 𝐷𝑡𝑖)                             1−𝛼 ) 𝜕( 1−𝜏)


rewrite equation (10) as

            𝜕𝑤        ( 1 − 𝑎)                 [(1 − 𝑎)𝜏 + 𝑎𝜏𝐷 ]
               ≈ −𝑌 [          (𝜏 − 𝜏𝐷 )𝜖1−𝑎 +                   𝜖𝑌 ] .                                        (14)
            𝜕𝜏        (1 − 𝜏)                       (1 − 𝜏)

    Thus, the size of 𝜖1−𝛼 relative to the overall income elasticity determines how much of the

elasticity is due to income shifting. The overall idea is that income shifting is costly from a

welfare perspective only to the extent that there is a large difference between the tax rates in the

two tax bases, 𝜏 − 𝜏𝐷 . If the tax rates are similar, shifting income only has a small welfare effect

while larger differences will tend to leave the overall welfare cost closer to the estimated level

without the possibility of shifting.



    c. Empirical Specification



Finally, we develop our empirical specification to estimate the elasticity of taxable income as a

combination of the real response to tax changes and the income shifting response. Based on the

simple model we presented above, taxable income depends on the tax rate on current income and




                                                         10
the potential tax savings from deferring income, which depends on the relative current and

deferred tax prices.

ln 𝑍𝑡𝑖 = 𝜖𝑌 ln(1 − 𝜏𝑡𝑖 ) + 𝜖1−𝛼 [ln(1 − 𝜏𝑡𝑖 ) − ln(1 − 𝜏𝐷𝑡𝑖 )] + ln 𝜂𝑡𝑖 + ln 𝜀𝑡𝑖 .                            (15)

In this specification, ηti is the individual’s potential income in a world with no taxes.

    By substituting equation (7) into equation (15), we obtain an alternative specification:

ln 𝑍𝑡𝑖 = 𝜖𝑍 ln(1 − 𝜏𝑡𝑖 ) − 𝜖1−𝛼 ln(1 − 𝜏𝐷𝑡𝑖 ) + 𝜓𝜖1−𝛼 ln(1 − 𝜏𝑡𝑖 ) + ln 𝜂𝑡𝑖 + ln 𝜀𝑡𝑖 ,                      (16)

             𝜕(1−𝜏 𝐷𝑡𝑖)(1−𝜏 𝑡𝑖)
Here 𝜓 = [                       ],   which is the sensitivity of the deferred tax rate to changes in the current tax
             𝜕( 1−𝜏 𝑡𝑖)( 1−𝜏𝐷𝑡𝑖)


rate. We can then estimate an approximation of the elasticity of taxable income, 𝜖𝑍 , which we call

                           𝑍 is a valid approximation of 𝜖𝑍, and equation (16) can be written as:
𝜖𝑍 As long as 𝜓 is small, 𝜖̂
̂.

                            1−𝛼 ln(1 − 𝜏𝐷𝑡𝑖 ) + ln 𝜂𝑡𝑖 + ln 𝜀
         𝜖𝑍 ln(1 − 𝜏𝑡𝑖 ) − 𝜖̂
ln 𝑍𝑡𝑖 = ̂                                                  ̂ 𝑡𝑖 ,                                           (17)

where ln 𝜀̂
          𝑡𝑖 = ln[ 𝜀𝑡𝑖(1 − 𝜏𝑡𝑖 )
                                𝜓𝜖1−𝛼 ].


    Equation (15) (and equation 17)) can be estimated by applying either a first difference or a

fixed-effects approach and using firm-performance measures for 𝜂𝑡𝑖 . However, the decision of

which model to use is subject to assumptions about how compensation changes. If the executive

compensation error term in equation (15) follows a random walk, then a fixed-effects model

would display autocorrelation, so that a first-differences model is more appropriate. If the basic

approach to executive compensation is based on an already known value to the firm ηti, with

marginal deviations from this compensation base driven by performance, then a fixed-effects

model would be appropriate, as first differences would introduce autocorrelation. In our

empirical specification, we account for this possibility by estimating a fixed-effects model and

clustering over year and executive firm dummy variables to control for possible autocorrelation.

    In contrast to the standard ETI models, the first term in equation (15) allows us to estimate

the real response to changes in the tax rate, while the second term in equation (15) allows us to


                                                             11
estimate income shifting response, the elasticity of the compensation tax base with respect to the

relative tax prices on current and deferred income. Finally, we can compare our elasticity of the

real behavioral response with the elasticity estimated without income shifting to understand the

importance of the option to defer income in altering the elasticity of taxable income.



    3. Defining Current and Deferred Tax Rates



Estimating the elasticity of taxable income in the presence of income shifting requires us first to

construct measures of the tax rates on current and deferred income. However, taxes paid on

future income are not directly measured because taxation occurs in the future when income is

realized. To address this issue, we apply a methodology based on the work of Hall and Liebman

(2000) and Gorry, et al. (2017) to measure the tax gain to income deferral.

    For our analysis, we consider the marginal pre-tax payment that the firm wants to make to

the individual. Then, because the individual and firm can coordinate on the form of payment, it is

important to consider the total tax implications for both the firm and individual when

constructing appropriate tax rates. To construct our measure of taxes on current and deferred

income, we assume that on the margin the individual will save the earned income over a period

of 𝑛 years and that the saved income will appreciate at the rate of return net of corporate taxes,

𝑟(1 − 𝜏𝐶 ). Finally, for our measure, we assume that tax rates are constant, so that expected taxes

in the future are identical to the current tax rates.

    With the assumptions outlined above, the tax rate on deferred income, 𝜏𝐷 , is the same as the

current statutory marginal income tax rate, 𝜏𝑝 . All income, including the gains, are taxed as

ordinary income.


                                                    12
       Next, we need to construct the total tax rate paid on income earned in the current period.

Because the individual is saving the marginal income over a 𝑛 -year horizon, we account for both

the taxes paid on the initial income in addition to the present value of any capital gains paid on

the return. Moreover, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Section 162(m) of the

Internal Revenue Code, limits the deductibility of any non-performance-based compensation

over $1 million. This limitation, often called the million-dollar rule, leads to variation among

taxpayers with cash compensation over and under a million dollars. For taxpayers with current

income less than $1 million, the tax rate on current income is given by:
                                                                           −𝑛
                     𝜏 = 𝜏𝑝 + 𝜏𝐶𝐺 (1 − 𝜏𝑝 )[1 − (1 + 𝑟(1 − 𝜏𝐶 )) ] .                            (18)

       Under Section 162(m), cash compensation over one million dollars is no longer deductible by

the firm, so the worker faces an additional marginal burden from the corporate tax, 𝜏𝐶 . Hence,

for executives who are subject to the million-dollar rule, the tax rate on current income is:
                                                                                −𝑛
                    𝜏 = 𝜏𝑝 + 𝜏𝐶 + 𝜏𝐶𝐺 (1 − 𝜏𝑝 )[1 − (1 + 𝑟(1 − 𝜏𝐶 )) ].                         (19)

       Figure 1 shows the average (mean) marginal current and deferred tax rates for executives in

each year of our data.4 As the deferred tax rate is the same for those above and below $1 million,

there is a single deferred tax rate in each year. The current tax rate, 𝜏, for those earning above a

million dollars is significantly higher than the current tax rate for those earning below $1 million.

Following the passage of Section 162(m) in 1993, as well as the tax hike in both personal and

corporate income tax rates, there is a significant increase in current and deferred income tax

rates. Thus, for earnings exceeding one million dollars, the incentive to defer income is higher

for executives. It is also important to note that even for executives under the million-dollar

threshold, the current tax rate is above the deferred tax rate because of the higher capital gains


4
    We describe the data used to construct these measures in more detail in the next section.

                                                            13
tax rate. This relationship implies that there is still a tax advantage to deferral for executives with

compensation under $1 million, but the tax gain is much smaller when income is not subject to

the million-dollar rule.



    4. Empirical Analysis



             a. Data



To estimate the real response to taxation as well as the income shifting response, we use data on

executive compensation from the COMPUSTAT database for the period 1992-2005.5 Accessed

through the Wharton Research Data Services, the data maintained by Standard and Poor’s in the

Execucomp sub-database includes information on top executives’ salary, bonus, option and stock

awards,    non-equity incentive plans, pensions, and other compensation items found on

corporations’ annual proxy statements.

    Execucomp collects data on up to nine executives per firm per year, though most companies

report data for only the top five executives. The executives are identified by name and individual

identification variables. In addition, there is a unique executive-company variable, which links

each executive to the specific company at which he or she worked in each year. Therefore, one

can track executives and their compensation over time. Executives are an interesting group to

study because they are the most likely to have the option to defer taxation by choosing

5
  One reason we stop our sample period in 2005 is that executive compensation began to be reported differently after
2005. In 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board established a new accounting standard which requires
companies to value their employee stock options. Previously companies had a choice between expensing the options
or disclosing the valuation. Only a few companies chose the expense method. FAS123R now requires companies to
expense their stock options. In EXECUCOMP, this new FASB standard has led to a new format for reporting
executive compensation, so that the old way of reporting data has been discontinued and information on old
compensation formats is no longer being continued. (http://financialresearch.blog2blog.nl/Wharton/)


                                                        14
compensation in non-cash forms. Saez, Slemrod, and Giertz (2012) conclude that the behavioral

response to changes in marginal tax rates is likely to be concentrated at the top of the income

distribution, with less evidence of any response for the middle- and upper-middle-income

individuals. Therefore, our paper re-estimates the ETI for this important group of individuals

when their ability to shift income across years is explicitly accounted for.

   Table 1 defines each of the variables that are used in our empirical analysis, and Table 2

provides summary statistics. We define the total income of executives in our data as the sum of

salary, bonus, long-term incentive plans, options awarded, restricted stock grants, and all other

annual income. Total income has more than doubled during our sample period. In real 1991

dollars, the average total compensation increased from an $866,987 in 1992 to $1,852,074 in

2005. There is also time-series variation in personal income tax rates over this period.

   The tax rate for those with high incomes increased between 1992 and 1993. For those

individuals reporting more than $140,000 and less than $250,000 in taxable income, the marginal

rate went from 31 to 36 percent. For those earning more than $250,000, the rate rose from 31

percent to 39.6 percent. The next major change in federal tax rates accompanied the passage of

the 2001 and 2003 tax acts, respectively. Tax cuts in these acts were gradually phased in and

reduced the rate in the highest income tax bracket from 39.6 percent to 35 percent, and the rate

on the second highest income bracket from 36 to 33 percent.

   Aside from personal tax rates, our analysis shows that the capital gains tax rates are

important in determining the tax advantage of deferring income. Moreover, the corporate tax rate

affects the marginal tax rate facing an executive if their compensation is subject to the million-

dollar rule. Capital gains tax rates have varied over time with a decrease in the tax rate from 28

percent to 20 percent in 1997. The capital gains tax rate was further decreased in 2003 to 15



                                                 15
percent. For firm marginal corporate tax rates, we use firm-specific corporate tax rates

constructed by Graham (1996). In 1992, the maximum firm-specific corporate tax rate faced by a

firm was below 35 percent. Since 1992, the top firm-specific corporate tax rate has ranged from

38 percent to 40 percent, significantly higher than the tax rate in 1992.6 In our sample, about 35

percent of firms are missing a firm-specific corporate tax rate. To avoid dropping these

observations, we apply the average firm corporate tax rate for each year to the observations with

missing data.

    We define taxable income as the sum of all cash compensation such as salary, bonus, LTIP

and other income, as well as the value of options exercised. We define deferred income as the

sum of the non-taxed components of an executive’s compensation, such as stock option awards

and restricted stock grants. Again, Table 2 provides summary statistics for each of these

variables in addition to the individual components that make up the income variables.

    Over the sample period, there was a substantial increase in the share of income that has been

deferred. The share of options awarded increased from about 18 percent of total compensation in

1992 to 23 percent by 2005. There was an even larger increase in restricted stock grants, from 4

percent to 13 percent, over the same period. Figure 2 plots the share of deferred income, 𝛼, along

with the share of salary in total compensation over the sample period. The share of deferred

income begins at just above 20 percent and reaches a peak of just over 40 percent before

declining slightly at the end of our sample. The grey areas mark the significant periods of tax

reform, such as 1992 to 1993 and 2001 to 2003. As Figure 2 shows, without controlling for other

factors, that following the tax hikes in the 1990s, there was an increase in the deferred income

6
  The statutory corporate tax rates (under current law) are 15 percent, then 25 percent, then 34 percent, then 39
percent, then 35 percent, then 38 percent, then 35 percent. The 39 and 38 percent rates occur because the federal
corporate income tax imposes 5 percent and 3 percent surtaxes to eliminate the benefits of the progressive corporate
tax schedule for firms with greater corporate taxable income. Graham (1996) does not include state corporate
income taxes.

                                                        16
share and a decline in the salary share, but following the tax cuts of the 2000s, there is a slight

decline in the share of deferred income.



        b. Empirical Results



    Because both the current tax rate and the deferred tax rate are endogenous, we estimate our

model using two-stage least squares. Following the discussion in Section 3, the tax advantage to

the executive and the firm of deferring taxation is the capital gains tax rate that is avoided in the

future. Accordingly, the current tax rate (in present value terms) is the current personal income

tax rate and capital gains taxes paid on the returns in subsequent years, as shown in equation

(18). In addition, because cash compensation is subject to the Section 162(m) rule, our current

tax rate includes the firm-specific corporate tax rate as described in equation (19). The deferred

tax rate is simply the current personal marginal income tax rate.

    Current tax rates are endogenous because higher taxable incomes can lead to higher personal

income tax rates, we use as an instrumental variable the tax rate implied by the executive’s

permanent income.       As in Goolsbee (2000), we calculate the permanent income tax rate as the

personal income tax rate that would apply each year to the executive’s mean taxable income

across all years that an executive is in the sample (an executive’s permanent taxable income).7

We use this variable as an instrument for the current tax rate in each of our specifications. As an

instrumental variable for the deferred tax rate, we apply the personal income tax rate in each

year, but on average total income instead of taxable income as in Gorry et al. (2017). We do so




7
  We do not need to use an instrumental variable for the corporate or capital gains tax rate because those top rates
are not endogenous in our model.

                                                        17
because the tax rate that could have been paid on the total compensation package had that

compensation been entirely cash compensation is the relevant tax rate on deferred income.

       Our specifications also include controls to account for the financial stability of a company as

well as time trends. To control for variation across companies, we also control for a company’s

market value of its shares and the company’s total value of assets. Finally, the regressions

include executive fixed effects to account for differences across executives that may account for

why some executives are paid more than others. We use robust standard errors that are clustered

both by year and by firm-executive pair.

       Table 3 presents our main results. In estimating income elasticities, the dependent variable in

each specification is the log of real taxable income. All results are two-stage least squares where

the tax rate on permanent income is used as an instrument, as in Goolsbee (2000). Column 1

reports the elasticity of taxable income for the standard specification that does not account for

income shifting and where the independent variable is the individual tax price based on current

federal tax rates. This specification is similar to Goolsbee (2000). Our estimated elasticity is

1.07, which is close to the short-run elasticity estimated by Goolsbee (2000). Note that while the

central elasticity estimate in the existing research is considered closer to 0.5 (see, for example,

Gruber and Saez (2002)), our focus on highly paid executives generates a higher elasticity that is

consistent with some past studies. Therefore, our estimated elasticity is, not surprisingly, higher

than that estimated, on average, in previous research.8 This difference suggests that there is a

large behavioral response of reported taxable incomes to the marginal tax rate among top

executives.

       In Column 2, we take the same approach as the first column, but we use our measured tax

rate on current income as the independent variable instead of the marginal personal income tax
8
    In a recent paper, Weber (2014) suggests that the central elasticity estimate is 0.85.

                                                             18
rate used in typical estimates of the ETI. The measured tax rate on current income depends on

the capital gains tax rate and the firm-specific corporate tax rate for some individuals in addition

to the personal tax rate.    We use the personal tax rate applicable to the executive’s permanent

income as an instrument for the current tax rate because the endogeneity concern is specific to

the executive’s personal income tax rate, and not to the corporate tax rate or the capital gains tax

rate. With this specification, we still estimate a significant and positive elasticity with a

coefficient of 0.81.

   In Column 3, we also include the negative logged tax price of deferred income, consistent

with equation (17). In this specification, the estimated elasticity of current taxable income with

respect to the deferral tax price is 1.9, but it is only statistically significantly different from zero

at the 10 percent level. In this specification, the coefficient on the instrumented current tax price

is now higher with a magnitude of 2.2 and still statistically significantly different from zero at

the 1 percent level. Harju and Matikka (2016) note in this specification, the coefficient on the

current tax price still has the traditional elasticity interpretation. In other words, it measures the

total behavioral response to tax changes, capturing the combination of both the real and the

income shifting responses.

   In the fourth specification, we replicate the third specification, but we include the relative

current and deferred tax prices rather than simply adding the deferred tax rate. This specification

arises from our theory that motivates 𝜖𝑌 and 𝜖1−𝛼 . Note that 𝜖𝑌 is simply the difference between

the two coefficients in the previous specification, and we find that it is not estimated precisely.

Now, the own current tax price elasticity captures the real response, while the tax price

differential captures the income shifting response. In this specification, the estimated own tax

price elasticity is still positive, but not statistically significantly different from zero. However,



                                                  19
the income-shifting response is significant at the 10 percent level as in the previous specification.

The estimated coefficient on the instrumented differential tax prices is negative and statistically

significantly different from zero, suggesting that income shifting is a significant factor and that

the relative tax advantage to deferring taxation significantly influences the choice of how much

income to report as current taxable income. As discussed in Section 2, this specification can be

viewed as a decomposition of the total behavioral response from tax changes, the estimate of

which was statistically significantly different from zero at the one percent level, as the third

column shows.

      We also control for rates of return on the firm stock, capital gains taxes, and firm-specific

corporate tax rates independently of the constructed tax variables.9 The main results remain

similar in the presence of these additional controls, with the estimated coefficient on the deferred

tax rate reduced to 1.46 and the estimated coefficient on the current tax rate at 0.59.



           c. Welfare Implications



To put these results in context, we now evaluate the welfare implications associated with our

estimated elasticities using the formulas developed in Section 2. To understand the results and

control for variation over time, we consider how the elasticities would predict welfare in 2005,

the last year in our sample. To compute welfare, equation (9) considers the conventional case

without income shifting, while equation (14) computes welfare when income shifting is

considered. To compute welfare from equation (14), in addition to the estimated elasticities, we

need information on the current tax rate, 𝜏, the deferred tax rate, 𝜏𝐷 , and the share of income

deferred by an individual, 𝛼. By contrast, the standard welfare equation only uses the estimated
9
    We do not report these estimates here.

                                                 20
elasticity and the tax rate. For all welfare calculations in this section, we set the income variable

𝑌 = 1, which is equivalent to computing the change in welfare as a fraction of total income

earned in a year. This assumption provides a rough sense of magnitudes independent of income

and implies that the welfare calculations can be interpreted as being at the margin rather than

over the entire range of income earned.

   To obtain a sense of the magnitudes of different variables in 2005, Table 4 reports average

values of the tax rates and the share of income deferred from our sample. Note that for an

individual in the top tax bracket of 35 percent in that year, we would calculate of tax rate on

deferred income of 0.35 and a tax rate on current income of 0.377 if their taxable income was

below one million dollars and 0.566 if above. The tables show that for all executives, the

deferred tax rate is slightly lower than 0.35, indicating that some individuals in our sample are

not in the top tax bracket. The average tax rate on current income is in between the numbers for

those who have above and below $1 million in taxable income.

   The final three columns of Table 4 show results for different subgroups. First, we consider

individuals with total income under $1 million who would not be subject to the million-dollar

rule even if all of their income was taxed in the current period. Second, we consider individuals

with taxable income over $1 million, who are all subject to the million-dollar rule. Finally, we

consider the individuals with total income over $1 million and taxable income under $1 million.

We find that the average amount of income deferred increases as we move across the three

groups. The first group has a standard incentive to defer. The group with taxable income over $1

million has a strong incentive to defer, but may not be able to avoid the million-dollar rule fully

because of other costs. The final group is one that fully avoids the million-dollar rule by

deferring a large percentage of income.



                                                 21
   To explore the welfare implications of income shifting we first consider some computed

examples using statutory tax rates from 2005. For all calculations, we take the income elasticities

used for the case of income shifting from column (4) and the elasticity for no income shifting

from column (2) of Table 3, so that both elasticities reflect the same tax rates on current income.

Essentially, we compare how the change in welfare with a change in tax rates differs with our

estimated elasticities with income shifting from what one may have thought given traditional

estimates without income shifting. We report the results from our hypothetical examples in Table

5. The first column reports calculations using the average 𝛼 for all executives, when the current
                                                                             𝜕𝑤
income is not subject to the million-dollar rule. Recall that in computing        , we set 𝑌 = 1, so
                                                                             𝜕𝜏


that results can be interpreted as the change in welfare over total income. Here, the change in

welfare is -0.238 with income shifting and -0.484 without income shifting. Accounting for

shifting reduces the implied change in deadweight loss from taxation almost in half. The

remaining two columns compare results for the groups with total income under $1 million and

total income over $1 million. The group with total income under $1 million just changes the

hypothetical value of 𝛼 to 0.224, so the results are very similar. For the group with taxable

income over $1 million, the current tax rate is higher, generating larger welfare effects. The

welfare numbers are not much different when accounting for shifting as these individuals do not

shift enough income to avoid the high tax rates.

   Finally, Table 6 explores the distribution of estimated welfare changes for individuals in our

sample in 2005. Given that we can calculate the share of income that each individual defers and

have different marginal tax rates for each individual in the sample, we can calculate the implied

welfare effect for each individual in our sample. With our panel data, we just focus on the

distribution in 2005, so that we avoid issues of having multiple observations per individual.


                                                   22
Table 6 reports the mean welfare, the values at various percentiles in the distribution, and the

standard deviation of values. We compute the welfare equations with elasticities from income

shifting in the left panel and without income shifting in the right panel.

    The mean welfare change in the full sample is -0.777 with income shifting, compared with

-0.905 for estimates for which income shifting is not accounted for. While this reduction is

much smaller than in the hypothetical example, the median values are similar to those in the

example with the welfare cost being about half the size when income shifting is accounted for.

The distributional table shows that with income shifting, the top of the distribution has larger

welfare changes than the group without income shifting. This effect arises for individuals who

have taxable income over $1 million, yet still have low values of α. In each group, there is very

little variation in computed tax rates, so the distributional effects arise as different individuals

have different rates of deferral. For individuals facing high current tax rates who do not defer

much income, welfare costs can be higher than those computed due to having higher overall

elasticities in the estimates.



    4. Conclusion



Estimating the elasticity of taxable income is crucial for understanding the welfare costs of

taxation. Most estimates of this elasticity for individuals have focused on a static environment in

which individuals do not have the ability to defer income. However, for many executives, an

important subset of high-income taxpayers, the growing use of stock options means that deferred

income has become a much more prominent feature of compensation for high-income

individuals. Generally, the failure to account for deferred income implies that estimates of the



                                                  23
ETI overstate the welfare consequences of personal income taxation, as deferred income

generates tax revenue when it is realized in the future. When accounting for income shifting, we

find a much larger overall response, but that most of the response is due to income shifting rather

than real behavioral changes. Overall, our paper finds that the change in deadweight loss in

response to a change in taxes is nearly half as large when income shifting is accounted for.

        At the time of writing this paper, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has been passed, which

removes the exemption for incentive based pay under the old Section 162 (m) effective as of

December 31, 2017. The new rule extends the $1 million deduction limit to all pay, including

stock options, severance benefits and deferred compensation. Over the course of the next several

years, it will be interesting to document the implications of this change on the form of executive

compensation, given that firms no longer have a tax advantage to paying out compensation as

stock options, while executives can still benefit from the option of being able to defer income,

and taxation.

1. 𝜏 is the marginal current tax rate based on authors' calculations. All results use the permanent
income tax rate on taxable income as an instrument for the current tax rate. The permanent income
tax rate on taxable income is the tax rate applied to the average taxable income across an executive's
career at a firm.
2. 𝜏𝑝 is the marginal income tax rate. All results use the permanent income tax rate on taxable
income as an instrument for the current tax rate.
3. 𝜏𝐷 is the deferred tax rate defined as the federal marginal tax rate applicable to taxable income.
All results use the permanent income tax rate on total income as an instrument for the difference

Notes:
1. T o control for changes in tax law, all results shown are for 2005.
2. T he relevant tax rates are calculated using 2005 tax rates, with a personal marginal tax rate of 35%, a corporate tax rate
of 35%, and a capital gains tax rate of 15%. The present value of the capital gains taxes are calculated using n=10 and
r=0.05. DWL with income shifting is calculated based on equation (14), with elasticity values from column (4), Table 4.
DWL without income shifting is calculated based on equation (9), with the elasticity value from column (2), Table 4. The
deadweight loss reported is the unit (per dollar of income) deadweight loss at the margin.

     Notes:
     1. T o controlf for changes in tax law, all results shown are for 2005.
     2. T he values in the first column are for all executives in 2005. The values in the second column are for those with total in come below $1 million in 2005, who would not be subject to the additional burden imposed by Section 162(m). The
     values in the third column are for those with taxable current income above $1 million in 2005, who would certainly be subject to the marginal burden from Section 162(m).
     3. Panel A reports the number of observations in each group, as well as the average current tax rate, deferred tax rate, and deferred income share for each group.
     4. Panels B and C report the summary statistics of deadweight losses among individuals within each group.T he calculation with income shifting uses Equation 11 and the elasticity values for 𝑌 and 1−𝛼 are based on the results found in
     column (4), Table 4. T he calculation without income shifting uses Equation 9 and the elasticity value for 𝑍 based on the results found in column (2),Table 4. The deadweight loss reported is the unit marginal deadweight loss, calculated
     using equations (9) and (14) divided by total income.
