This paper examines the effect of water-borne lead exposure on infant mortality in American cities
over the period 1900-1920. Infants are highly sensitive to lead, and more broadly are a marker for
current environmental conditions. The effects of lead on infant mortality are identified by variation
across cities in water acidity and the types of service pipes that the water ran through – lead, iron, or
concrete – which together determined the extent of lead exposure. Estimates that restrict the sample
to cities with lead pipes and panel estimates provide further support for the causal link between water-borne
lead and infant mortality. The magnitudes of the effects were large. In 1900, a decline in exposure
equivalent to an increase in pH from 6.675 (25th percentile) to 7.3 (50th percentile) in cities with lead-only
pipes would have been associated with a decrease in infant mortality of 7 to 33 percent or at least 12
fewer infant deaths per 1,000 live births. This paper examines the effect of water-borne lead exposure

1. Introduction

    Today lead is a well-known environmental toxin whose adverse effects include infant

mortality, morbidity, loss of IQ, and violence. Contemporary analysis has largely focused on

lead paint and airborne lead in leaded gasoline and from manufacturing and smelting plants. In

the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, lead exposure in some locations was far higher

than in the second half of the twentieth century, but the delivery mechanism was different.

During that period, the dominant source of lead exposure was water. Water acquired lead as it

traveled from city water mains through lead service pipes to homes and businesses.1 Lead service

pipes were widely used. In 1900, 11 percent of the American population lived in cities with lead

service pipes and 23 percent lived in cities where some service pipes were lead. The amount of

lead in drinking water depended on the chemical properties of the water passing through the

pipes. More acidic water leached lead faster. Doctors and city engineers recognized that lead

was leaching into drinking water, but water lead levels were considered safe. Only in the second

half of the twentieth century did lead come to be widely recognized as a public health issue.

    This paper uses city-level data to examine the effect of water-borne lead exposure on infant

mortality over the period 1900-1920. The focus is on infant mortality, because it is a basic

measure of population health, and infants are highly sensitive to lead. 2 High levels of lead

exposure generally cause morbidity rather than mortality in adults.3

    Identification of the effect of lead comes from variation in water chemistry across cities with

different types of service pipes. Water chemistry is exogenously determined by local geology

1
  Service pipes are the pipes that connect the water main, which usually runs under a street, with a building. Most
residential service pipes were between 0.5 and 2 inches in diameter.

  See Needleman and Belinger (1991), National Research Council (1993), and Reyes (2008).
3
  Common symptoms include fatigue, reduced cognitive functioning and a decrease in gross and fine motor skills.
See Bleecker et al. (2007); Dorsey et al. (2006); and Stewart and Schwartz (2007).
                                                                                                                      2
and by whether the water source is above or below ground. The main specification focuses on

infant mortality in 1900. A number of approaches are taken to address any residual omitted

variable bias. A rich set of controls are included to address differences in city size,

characteristics, temperature, and water and milk quality. In some specifications, estimation is

restricted to cities with lead pipes, so that identification comes solely from exogenous variation

in water chemistry. The amount of lead delivered by pipes is in part a function of the age of the

pipes. Analysis using repeated cross sections and panel data provides further evidence that lead

was causing adverse outcomes.

    The paper finds that in 1900, a decline in exposure equivalent to an increase in pH from

6.675 (25th percentile) to 7.3 (50th percentile) in cities with lead-only pipes would have been

associated with a decrease in infant mortality of 7 to 33 percent. Given that infant mortality in

cities was about 180 per 1000 live births, such a change would lead to at least 12 fewer infant

deaths per 1,000 live births. Cities could have achieved this by modifying the pH of the water or

by replacing the lead service pipes with non-lead service pipes.

    This paper contributes to the literature on the adverse effect of environmental toxins on

health. The modern epidemiological literature is large, but the historical literature is very small,

despite the high levels of toxins that individuals were exposed to in some historical settings. 45

The closest paper to this work is Troesken (2008), which examined the effects of lead on infant

mortality in Massachusetts in 1900. This paper goes beyond Troesken (2008) in two important

ways. First, it shows that the adverse health effects of lead were national. Second, it documents

that the adverse effects extended over a significant period of time.

4
  The epidemiological literature is extremely large and cannot be surveyed here. Within the economics literature,
Reyes (2008) and Curry and Neidell (2005) examine the effects of toxins on infant mortality.
5
  Water-related lead exposure remains a concern, even in well-developed countries. See Hayes and Skubala (2009).
                                                                                                                3
   This paper also contributes to a related literature on the causes of decline in infant mortality.

In their pioneering book, Preston and Haines (1991) documented high infant mortality at the turn

of the twentieth century. Although they discuss possible reasons for the rapid decline in infant

mortality over time, including improvements in water and milk quality, the book did not examine

the decline directly. Cutler and Miller (2005), using data for 12 large cities for 1900-1936, show

the water filtration and chlorination had a large and lasting effect on infant mortality. They

attribute 75 percent of the reduction in infant mortality to improvements in water quality. Lee

(2007) argues that improvements in milk quality also had a significant effect on infant mortality.

This paper finds that proxies for water quality were strongly related to infant mortality. Further,

it documents the extent to which declines in the effects of lead over time contributed to declines

in infant mortality.

2. Lead Water Pipes

Use and Exposure

   Lead service pipes were widely used to connect homes and buildings to street mains. In

1900, our sample includes 172 large and medium size cities. They represented 84 percent of the

urban population. The Manual of American Waterworks, 1897 reported data on the types of

service pipes – lead. plain iron, galvanized iron, cement-lined iron, or steel – in use by city. In

1897, lead pipes were used exclusively by 42 percent of cities, a mixture of lead and non-lead

pipes was used by 25 percent of cities, and non-lead pipes were used by 33 percent of the cities.

The sample and cities’ choice of service pipes are discussed in detail in section 4.

   Evidence suggests that lead dissolved from the interior lining of service pipes was the

primary source of lead in drinking water during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.


                                                                                                       4
In its 1900 investigation, the Massachusetts State Board of Health passed water from the same

well through iron and lead service lines. Lead levels in water that passed through lead service

lines were three times higher than the levels for iron service lines and eight times higher when

the water was allowed to stand overnight.6 An experiment conducted by two New York health

officials in the 1930s found similar results.7

    The amount of lead that water could absorb from service pipes was large. The current EPA

limit is 15 parts per billion (ppb), and evidence suggests that most water is well below that limit.

The Massachusetts investigation found that in the typical household in the state, the average

amount of lead in water after normal use was 315 ppb, and the average amount after standing

overnight was 870 ppb. The largest value of a household in any town after ordinary use was

5,000 ppb, and the largest value when left standing overnight was 11,000 ppb. Data for New

York City suggest that between 1870 and 1940 lead levels in city water were also very high.8

    Water was the primary source of lead exposure during the period 1900-1920. At 10 parts per

billion, which is a little below the current EPA threshold of 15 parts per billion, water would

account for 7 percent of adult blood lead and 14 percent of child blood lead. At 350 parts per

billion – a level that would have been common a century ago – water-borne lead would account

for 90 percent of an adult’s blood-lead level.9 The relative importance of air-borne lead today is

largely attributable to the dramatic fall in water lead levels over the last century.

    The amount of lead added to drinking water by leaching of lead service lines was affected by

the chemistry of the water running through the pipes.10 Water acidity and hardness were

determined by the types of rock and soil the water came into contact with as it traveled to the city

either on the surface or in an aquifer.11 As will be discussed further, water chemistry tends to be

stable over time.

    Figure 1 shows that under laboratory conditions, lead leaching increases nonlinearly at low

levels of pH. (Note that low pHs are more acidic and that pH is on a log scale.) The historical

experience is consistent with the laboratory evidence. Troesken (2006) found similar

relationships between water-lead levels and acidity and water-lead levels and hardness using

historical data from Massachusetts and Maine.12

    Figure 1 has three testable implications with respect to infant mortality. 13 First, all else equal,

cities without lead pipes should have lower infant mortality than cities with lead pipes. Second,

conditional on having lead pipes, cities with low pH should have higher infant mortality than

cities with high pH. Third, in cities with lead pipes and pHs below 7.3, cities with lower

alkalinity should have higher infant mortality than cities with higher alkalinity. Alkalinity is not

reported in the data, but hardness, which is highly positively correlated with alkalinity, is

reported. Thus, in cities with lead pipes and pHs below 7.3, cities with lower hardness should

have higher infant mortality than cities with higher hardness.

Contemporary Knowledge of Harm



10
   Lead service pipes were 90-100 percent lead. The lead was sometimes mixed with small amounts of copper or
antimony.

12
   See Troesken (2006), Chapter 6.
13
   The precise relationship between lead and infant mortality will depend on dose-response relationship, but the
available evidence suggests that harm was increasing in lead exposure.
                                                                                                                   6
       Into the mid-twentieth century, lead in drinking water was widely believed to be harmless.

The delay in understanding the harmfulness of lead in part arose, because lead poisoning was

extremely difficult to diagnose. Lead affected multiple body systems, and the symptoms of lead

poisoning varied greatly across individuals. For children, diagnosing lead poisoning accurately

was even more problematic. In a recent social history of lead poisoning in America, Warren

(2000) describes cases of childhood lead poisoning during the early twentieth century that were

misdiagnosed as feeble-mindedness, summertime colic, appendicitis, polio, convulsions and

paralysis of unknown origin.14

       Other factors beyond the difficulty in diagnosing lead poisoning, including the primitive state

of epidemiology and the variation in outcomes associated with lead pipes, also delayed the

identification of lead as harmful. Epidemiology required data, but few cities kept systematic data

on mortality until the turn of the century. For most cities, it was only with the publication of

Mortality Statistics in 1900 that cities could compare their mortality rates to the mortality rates in

a wide range of other cities. Even if a city with lead pipes or considering lead pipes had mortality

data at hand, inference was complicated by the fact that the negative effects of lead pipes varied

with the chemistry of the water supply.

       Even as some evidence became available, the consensus remained that lead was only harmful

at extremely high levels. With the exception of a few physicians writing in England, medical

researchers and governmental authorities argued that lead was a pervasive and unavoidable part

of the natural environment and that humans could withstand all but the most extreme levels of

exposure.15 As of 1916, most engineers appear to have believed that concerns about lead service

pipes were overblown.16 In the 1940s, one can find articles in the Journal of the American

Medical Association, presumably an authoritative medical source, arguing that lead water pipes

were generally safe and that consumers had little to worry about.17

     Indeed, as late as the 1960s, public health officials believed that blood lead levels in children

six times the current acceptable level were safe. It was only in the 1970s that lead became a

significant public health concern.18 A national standard for lead in water was first set in 1975.

The 1975 standard was 50 ppb. In 1991 it was reduced to 15 ppb.

     Given that health was not a major concern, engineers choosing service pipes balanced a

variety of other factors including the upfront cost of the pipe, the durability of the pipe, the cost

of installation, and political considerations such as whether local manufacturers produced service

pipes. Lead service pipes were generally more expensive than other service pipes, but were also

more durable. Because of their resistance to corrosion, lead service pipes lasted for thirty-five

years. In contrast, plain iron or steel pipe lasted sixteen years; galvanized pipe lasted twenty

years; and cement lined pipe lasted twenty-eight years. Lead’s malleability made it easier to

bend the service main around existing infrastructure and obstructions. As one prominent trade

journal wrote: “Lead is in many respects the most satisfactory material to use for service pipes.

Its pliability and its comparative freedom from corrosive action make it almost ideal from a

mechanical standpoint.”19 Factors such as the types of pipes produced by local firms were likely

to have an impact as well, both for costs reasons – pipes were generally expensive to transport –

   Information and quotations in this paragraph come from EN, pp. 594-96 and from the Committee on Service Pipes
(1917), p. 328 (hereafter cited as CSP). The editors of the Engineering News were not alone in suggesting that lead
was the best material for service lines. A survey of the superintendents of forty-one municipal water companies
found that about half (20) preferred lead service lines to all other types of lines. This survey was conducted in 1884
by water industry expert from New London, Connecticut. The results were reported in CSP, pp. 346-47.

and because local firms were likely to lobby engineers to use their pipes.20 These issues are

examined further in section 4.

3. Ingestion and Health Effects of Lead

     In 1900 the vast majority of people living in cities were consuming water that had traveled

through service pipes. The most detailed evidence comes from federal censuses of cities in 1890

and 1915. In 1890, almost all large cities had fewer than 20 people per tap.21 This may sound

high, but a tap was a connection to a water main, not a faucet. An apartment building typically

only had one or two taps to serve the entire building. By 1915, when more detailed data

becomes available, the percentage of the population served was high. The median city had a

coverage rate of 95 percent.22 The worst cities, typically smaller southern cities, had coverage

rates of around 70 percent. Alternative water sources were scarce and typically undesirable.

Water flowing in creeks, rivers, and ponds was usually highly polluted. Bottled water was

expensive and of uncertain quality.

     Nearly all beverages routinely consumed by adults, including pregnant women, in cities with

lead service pipes would have been contaminated by lead. These include water and water-based

beverages such as coffee, tea, and beer.23 The only plausibly uncontaminated beverages would

have been fruit juice, wine, and milk, but only if these were produced outside of the city.

Running water before using it reduced the leaching of lead, but the resulting levels were still

extremely high. For example, in the Massachusetts experiments, running the water reduced the

pipes were likely to be similar.
21
   Social Statistics of Cities (1890) Table 29, p. 28. Estimates of per capita consumption in large cities were
consistently over 100 gallons per day. Even accounting for industrial use and wastage, most people would have had
piped drinking water at home or at work.

   Most beer was brewed either at home or at breweries in the city that utilized city water.
                                                                                                                   9
amount of lead in water that traveled through the lead service pipes from 800 ppb to 300 ppb.

Modern experience tells a similar story.24

     Fetuses were exposed to lead through their mother’s consumption of water, and most milk

and water consumed by infants and young children was contaminated. 25 Infants have blood-lead

levels that are highly correlated with their mother’s blood-lead level, indicating transmission of

lead from mother to fetus.26 Mothers’ milk was contaminated. Modern studies show that

maternal lead exposure is correlated with lead levels in breast milk.27 Cows’ milk was also

contaminated unless the water that the cow drank was coming from a non-lead source. Even if it

was coming from a non-lead source, cows’ milk was often diluted using water before it was fed

to infants.

     Modern studies show that lead exposure, even in relatively small amounts, can result in fetal

and infant death.28 Lead can cause mortality through anemia, neurological damage, and kidney

failure. Using data on births from 1975-1985, Reyes (2008) showed that the phase-out of leaded

gasoline reduced infant mortality rates by 3 to 4 percent.

     Lead is associated with adverse health outcomes beyond mortality. The health outcomes are

summarized in Table 1 for adults and children by blood-lead levels. At low water-lead levels,

blood-lead levels increase rapidly, whereas at high water-lead levels, blood-lead levels increase

more slowly.29 Because adults have a significantly better ability to excrete lead, their blood-lead

levels tend to rise more slowly for a comparable level of exposure. Chronic, long-term lead

exposure can, however, impair neurological and behavioral functioning among adults. At higher

levels of exposure, adults may experience convulsions, mental illness, renal failure, severe

anemia, and, in extreme cases, death.

4. Data, Identification, and the Use of Lead Service Pipes

Data

   The empirical analysis of lead and infant mortality uses city-level data on mortality,

population and demographic characteristics, the types of service pipes in use and water

chemistry. Data on infant mortality and overall mortality were collected from Mortality Statistics

for registration cities every five years from 1900, the year the data series began, to 1920.

Registration cities were cities that systematically tracked death rates. All mortality rates are per

100 in population. Infant deaths are more commonly reported relative to live births. For most of

the sample period, many cities did not have data on live births. For cities that did have data, the

death rate as a percentage of live births and the death rate per 100 in population were highly

correlated (0.98).

   Almost all large cities and many smaller cities were registration cities. In 1900, there were

330 registration cities. Only seven cities with populations over 40,000 were not registration cities

in 1900: Peoria, IL; Fort Wayne, IN; Kansas City, KS; Akron, OH; Wilkes-Barre, PA; Dallas,

TX; and Houston, TX. Over time, more cities began systematically collecting death data. By

1920, there were 662 registration cities.

   Registration cities were predominantly located in the New England, Mid-Atlantic, and East

North Central census regions. This reflects the fact that most cities with sizeable populations

were located these regions.


                                                                                                   11
     Data from the IPUMs 1900, 1910, and 1920 1-percent samples of the Census of Population

are used to control for city characteristics such as city population and shares of the population

that were white and foreign-born. 198 cities in 1900 and 263 cities in 1920 had data on both

mortality and city characteristics. Matching limits the sample of cities, primarily by eliminating

quite small cities.30

     Information on cities’ use of lead pipes in the mid-1890s is from The Manual of American

Waterworks, 1897 (Baker 1897).31 Cities were coded as 1 if they report using iron or other non-

lead service pipes, 2 if they report using a mix of lead and non-lead service pipes, and 3 if they

report using only lead service pipes. All major cities and most smaller cities in our data sets were

listed in the manual. Some cities were listed in the manual, but did not specify the type of service

pipe. These cities were not included in the analysis.

     Data on cities’ water characteristics are from multiple sources. Historical water sources were

identified using Baker (1897) The Manual of American Water Works; United States Geological

Survey (1934) The Industrial Utility of Public Water Supplies in the United States, 1932; city

websites, which sometimes have histories of the water utility; and other sources. pH and

hardness of the historical water sources are primarily taken from United States Geological

Survey (1954) The Industrial Utility of Public Water Supplies in the United States, 1952 or from

The Water Encyclopedia (Van Der Leeden 1990), which report the acidity and hardness of the

raw intake water for many water systems in the early 1950s and 1980s. Supplemental

information was drawn from USGS reports.

30
   In 1900, there were 330 registration cities and 340 cities identified in the IPUMs data. The intersection of the two
was 198 cities. The 198 registration cities had an average population of 99,924, whereas the non-registration cities
had an average population of 20,506.
31
   There were both earlier and later versions of the manual. The earlier version (1892) was incomplete, and the later
version (1915) did not list the type of service pipes.
                                                                                                                    12
     For water characteristics from the early 1950s to be relevant for predicting the extent of lead

leaching from service pipes in the early twentieth century, two things need to hold. First, the

acidity and hardness for the water source need to be fairly stable over time. Acidity tends to be

stable. For example, Davis et al (1994) provides paleolimnological reconstruction of historical

pH change in New England lakes as inferred from diatom remains. They find average changes

of 0.03 pH units over more than 300 years. 3233 Hardness is an attribute of the soil and is

extremely persistent over time.34 Second, cities have to not have been treating their water in

ways that altered the hardness and acidity of the outgoing water. Today municipalities

commonly alter the acidity, and to a lesser degree the hardness, of their water to mitigate

corrosion. This practice was uncommon before the mid-twentieth-century in America.35

     The final sample has 172 cities in 1900 and 212 in 1920. In 1900, these cities had a total

population of 18,712,950. This represented 62 percent of the urban population, where urban is

defined as towns with populations of 2,500 or greater, 84 percent of the cities identified in the

IPUMs sample, and 25 percent of the population of the United States in 1900.36 These cities were

predominantly in the New England (29 percent), Mid-Atlantic (28 percent), and East North


32
   The EPA in its report on The Response of Surface Water Chemistry to the Clear Air Act Amendments of 1990
(2003, p. 5) finds “However, an expectation of large increases in pH is unrealistic based on historical information for
sensitive lakes. Today’s acidic lakes were marginally acidic in pre-industrial times (typically pH less than 6).” For
discussion of the complex relationship between rain acidity and water acidity, see Krug and Frink (1983)
33
   Groundwater acidity could have been affected by industrial air and water pollution. Recall, however, that acidity
is a logarithmic sale. So unless industry was dumping highly acidic or highly basic substances into the water on a
large scale or very close to the water intake, the effect on the pH of the water is likely to have been fairly small.
34
   According to the United States Geological Survey (2006), “Water hardness is based on major-ion chemistry
concentrations. Major-ion chemistry in ground water is relatively stable and generally does not change over time.”

35
   Troesken (2006), especially pp. 73-75. Only 14 percent of the 172 cities in the 1900 sample report using lime to
control the pH of the water in 1932.

   Although IPUMs states that in 1900 “The city of residence is given for households in any city with 25,000+”,
http://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variableDescription.do?mnemonic=CITY, the actual data appears to code cities with
populations greater than about 2,500. East Cleveland OH is listed as having a population of 2,700. In 1920, cities
were only identified if they had populations of 25,000 or more.
                                                                                                                   13
Central (21 percent) census regions, with the remaining cities (22 percent) being located in other

census regions. In 1920, these cities had a total population of 33,415, 000. This represented 62

percent of the urban population, 88 percent of the population living in cities that were identified

in the IPUMs 1920 sample, and 32 percent of the population of the United States in 1920.

Identification

    Identification of the effects of lead exploits exogenous variation in the properties of city

water. As evidence for the appropriateness of this approach, cities with lead-only pipes were

grouped by pH quartiles and average infant death rates were computed. Figure 2 demonstrates

that cities with lower pH had consistently higher infant mortality over the period 1900-1920. The

small differences between cities with the highest pHs (i.e., the third and fourth lowest pHs) are

consistent with the leaching patterns shown in Figure 1.

    The following baseline specification is used to identify the effect of lead and pH on infant

mortality:

         morti = α0 + α1leadi + α2leadi x ln(pHi) + α3ln(pHi) + βXi + δSi+ εi                             (1)

where morti is mortality in city i in 1900.37 Lead is vector of indicator variables indicating

whether a city has no-lead pipes, mixed lead and non-lead pipes, or lead-only pipes. The omitted

category is no-lead. Because the effects of acidity are expected to differ across cities with no-

lead pipes, mixed pipes, and lead pipes, ln(pH) is interacted with two lead indicator variables and

is included as a control.38 To ensure the main effects are evaluated within the range of the sample


37
   Some authors use logged mortality rates, and we considered using them as well. The focus is on (unlogged) rates
for two reasons. First, the infant mortality rates in our sample are not very skewed (skewness<=1.1 in all years).
More importantly, from a scientific standpoint, it is not obvious that lead should have a proportionate rather than an
absolute effect on mortality.
38
   In unreported regressions, a variety of functional forms were explored. ln(pH) provided a good fit and so did the
(less parametric) linear specification that allowed different slopes above and below pHs of 7.3.
                                                                                                                    14
pH, ln(pH) = ln(pH-5.675) so that it equals 0 at a pH of 6.675, which is the 25th percentile of pH.

Most specifications will use ln(pH-5.675), but some will use a less-parametric specification. To

address concerns related to selection of cities with lead pipes, an issue which will be discussed

further shortly, some specifications will restrict the analysis to cities with lead pipes.

     To address concerns about omitted variables, a rich set of controls are included. Xi are city

characteristics computed from the IPUMs 1900 1-percent sample. These include city population

quartiles, the share of the city population that was white, foreign born, and women ages 20-40,

and regional fixed effects. Si is a vector of state climatic characteristics including average

temperature and precipitation. These are included because temperature and precipitation are

believed to influence mortality, particularly infant mortality.

     Some specifications include city-level controls for water quality, milk quality, and women’s

suffrage. Water purification can influence infant mortality directly and through the health of the

mother.39 Lee (2007) argued that the primary reason why infant mortality in American cities

declined in the early twentieth century was improving milk quality. The city death rates from

typhoid and non-pulmonary tuberculosis are used as proxies for water and milk quality. Typhoid

is a water-borne disease and a fairly sensitive marker of water quality.40 It is roughly 4 percent

of the overall death rate. Non-pulmonary tuberculosis was often the result of contracting bovine,

as opposed to human, tuberculosis. 41 The most common way to contract bovine tuberculosis

was through contaminated milk. Non-pulmonary tuberculosis was 2 percent of the overall death

   See Lee (2007), Ferrie and Troesken (2008), and Condran et al (1984).
40
   Alternatively, one could control for the timing of the adoption of water purification. The primary problem is that
water purification tended to be phased in across treatment plants and was not equally effective across cities or over
time. Typhoid is a more direct measure of water quality.

rate. Pasteurization kills bovine tuberculosis, so this is a crude marker for milk quality.42 Miller

(2008) demonstrates that suffrage led to dramatic increases in state and local public health

spending. The year that women in the state received the right to vote is controlled for through

regional fixed effects.43 Table 2 presents summary statistics for the dependent and independent

variables.

Use of Lead Service Pipes

    What determined use of lead pipes? The engineering literature suggests that larger cities

would be more likely to use lead pipes, because of their malleability, which allowed installation

around existing water, sewer, and gas mains. Interestingly, because the cities in our sample are

all fairly large, the correlation between city population and the use of any lead pipe is 0.13 and

the correlation with use of lead only is -0.02. To explore this further, cities were divided into

quartiles by size. In the lowest quartile, cities under 21,500, 26 percent of cities used only lead

pipes and 58 percent used some lead pipes. In contrast, in the highest quartile, cities over

804,000, 66 percent used only lead pipes and 89 percent used some lead pipes. The intermediate

quartiles fall between the top and bottom quartile in terms of their use of only lead pipes and

some lead pipes.

    There may also be geographic variation related to the location of pipe manufacturers. In

1899, the top four states in terms of employment for the production of lead bar, pipe and sheet

were Illinois, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New York, and the top two states for wrought



42
   As with water, milk regulations tended to get phased in over time and their efficacy varied. Cities only began to
adopt mandatory pasteurization in the 1910s. Non-pulmonary tuberculosis is likely to be a more direct (although
imperfect) measure of milk quality. Other aspects of milk quality are likely to be controlled for by the city size and
state temperature data. Bigger cities and cities in warmer places were likely to have lower quality milk, particularly
in the summer months, because the milk had to travel substantial distances under warm conditions.

   The all cities in the data in the mountain region had suffrage.
                                                                                                                    16
iron and steel pipe were Pennsylvania and Ohio.44 Evidence from the Addyston Pipe case, which

involved producers of cast-iron pipe, indicates that there was also a group of manufacturers in

Alabama and Kentucky, as well as manufactures in Ohio, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,

and Wisconsin.

     Table 3 explores the determinants of a city’s use of lead-only pipes. In column 1, the

coefficients on ln(pH-5.675) and ln(hardness) are not statistically significant. As expected, larger

cities are more likely to use only lead pipes. The main effect is for cities in the top quartile of

size, cities above 804,000 in population. 45 It also indicates that there was significant regional

variation in the use of lead pipes. (The omitted region is New England.) Temperature and

precipitation might influence the choice of pipes if heat, cold, or rain caused them to deteriorate.

Cities in states with higher average temperatures were statistically significantly less likely to use

lead pipes. The city typhoid rate is a measure of water quality and is a check on whether the

choice of service pipes was somehow associated with water quality. The coefficient on typhoid

is not statistically significant.

     Column 2 examines the determinants of cities using lead-only pipes and having water with

pH ≤	 7.3. The results look very similar to the results in column 1. The coefficient on typhoid

remains insignificant. Column 3 presents the results of an ordered logit on lead. The coefficients

on ln(pH-5.675) and ln(hardness) are not statistically significant. The coefficient on typhoid

remains insignificant. In sum, conditional on city size, region, and temperature, neither pH nor

  In unreported regression, the fit was poorer when quadratics of city population or the log of city population were
used instead of quartile indicator variables. This is not surprising, given that quartile indicator variables impose
fewer restrictions on the functional form.
                                                                                                                   17
water quality, as measured by the typhoid death rate, appear to be influencing the use of lead

pipes.

5. Lead Service Pipes and Mortality

The Effects of Lead on Infant Mortality

       The initial estimation will focus on 1900. 1900 was closest to the year in which service pipes

were measured, 1897. Cities had little data on infant mortality and the Massachusetts

experiments were being conducted. Thus cities were almost certainly unaware of adverse health

effects of lead. Very few cities were filtering and chlorinating their water or pasteurizing their

milk, both of which would affect infant mortality, and cities were not yet modifying the acidity

and hardness of their water. In later years, these conditions would change, possibly attenuating

the relationships between pH and infant mortality.

       Table 4 demonstrates lead pipes and low pH were associated with higher city-level infant

mortality in 1900. In the baseline regression in column 1, the coefficients on lead-only and lead-

only x ln(pH-5.675) are statistically significant and of the expected sign. Cities with lead-only

pipes had higher baseline mortalities than cities without lead pipes. At a pH of 6.675 (the 25th

percentile of the acidity distribution), the main effect is 0.074. Thus, a city with lead pipes and a

pH of 6.675 had infant mortality that was 19 percent higher than an equivalent city without lead

pipes.46 Further, the relationship between ln(pH-5.675) and mortality was significantly more

negative for cities with lead-only pipes than for cities without lead pipes. It was -0.049 for cities

without lead pipes and -0.124 (=-0.049-0.075) for cities with lead pipes. Adding control

variables in columns 2 and 3 improves the fit of the regressions, but does not change the main

findings.

                                                                                                     18
       Column 4 presents a more flexible functional form, which allows the effects of pH to be

linear but to differ depending on whether the pH is below or above 7.3. There are a full set of

interaction effects, and the number of observations in each cell ranges from 20 to 44. At a pH of

6.675, the main effect is 0.063. Thus, a city with lead pipes and a pH of 6.675 had infant

mortality that was 16 percent higher than an equivalent city without lead pipes. 47

       The coefficient on pH-6.675 for cities with lead-only pipes is negative, statistically

significant and large when pH ≤	 7.3. Above a pH of 7.3, the coefficient on pH for cities with

lead-only pipes in column 4 is small and not statistically significantly different than the effect for

cities with no lead pipes and pH ≤ 7.3. This is consistent with Figure 1, which suggested that

leaching increased rapidly for pH values below 7.3.

       It is worth discussing the coefficients for mixed lead. One challenge is not knowing what the

mix is. It could be 90 percent lead or 10 percent lead. If mixed lead were equal to 0.5, then one

would expect that the slope of the interaction term would be half that of the lead one. If all of the

old pipes were lead and all of the new pipes were not lead, this would shift the average lead

exposure downward. In Table 4, column 4, the pH-6.675 interaction coefficients are -0.267

(lead) and -0.073 (mixed), which suggests that exposure for mixed lead is about 30 percent. The

main effects (0.063 for lead and 0.0194 for mixed) are of the same order of magnitude.

       The coefficients on the disease control variables are also worth noting. The coefficients on

typhoid and non-pulmonary tuberculosis are both positive and the coefficient on typhoid is

statistically significant. A one standard deviation increase in typhoid would increase infant

mortality by 7.1-7.7 percent.48 This is consistent with Cutler and Miller’s (2005) finding that

water quality is an important determinant of infant mortality.

       The estimated effects of lead and pH on infant mortality are large. Because of possible

selection issues in the choice of lead service pipes, the analysis will focus on the effects of

changes in pH for cities with lead-only service pipes. These effects can be thought of in two

ways – the effect that a city would receive from directly modifying the pH of the water at the

water treatment plant – or a lower bound on the effects of replacing lead service pipes with other

non-lead service pipes. For example the coefficients in columns 3 indicate that for a city with

lead-only pipes, moving from a pH of 6.675 (25th percentile) to 7.3 (50th percentile), a change in

natural logs of nearly 0.5, would be associated with a 0.038 (=(0.062 + 0.013)*0.5) decline in

infant mortality. The mean infant mortality in cities with lead pipes is 0.409, so this represents a

decline of 9 percent. Column 4 suggests that a similar change in pH would be associated with a

decline of 0.13 (= (0.27-0.06)*0.625). This is a decline of 32 percent.

       Table 4 focused exclusively on the effects of pH, yet Figure 1 suggests that hardness, which

is highly positively correlated with alkalinity, may affect leaching and thus mortality. One

complication is that in Figure 1, increased alkalinity lowered leaching for pH below the mid-7

range and increased leaching for pH above this range. To capture this, the effects of hardness

were allowed to differ depending on whether the pH is below or above 7.3 (the median in the

sample).

       Table 5 provides further evidence on the association among lead pipes, pH, hardness, and

infant mortality. For ease of presentation, given the large number of interaction terms, the results

are presented for cities with lead-only pipes.49 Column 1 shows the effects of ln(pH-5.675). As

in Table 4, the coefficient on ln(pH-5.675) is negative and statistically significant. Column 2

adds ln(hardness) to the specification in column 1. The coefficient on ln(pH-5.675) remains

negative and statistically significant, but the magnitude has fallen by about 25 percent. Moving

from a pH of 6.675 (25th percentile) to 7.3 (50th percentile), would be associated with a 0.027

(=(0.053)*0.5) decline in infant mortality. This is a decline of 7 percent.

     Drawing on Figure 1, column 3 uses a linear specification and a full set of controls for water

chemistry, which are allowed to differ depending on whether pH is above or below 7.3, the

sample median. The coefficients on pH-6.675, hardness, and hardness x (pH-6.675) are

statistically significant and of the expected sign. The marginal effect of an increase pH is -0.271

+ 0.0018*hardness. The effect is negative but is smaller at higher levels of hardness.50 At a

hardness of 30, which is close to the median for this (sub)sample, an increase in pH from 6.675

to 7.3 would decrease infant mortality by 0.625*(0.22) = 0.14. This is a decline of 33 percent.51

The marginal effect of an increase in hardness is -0.0010 + 0.0018*(pH – 6.675).

     In sum, Tables 4 and 5 provide evidence that the use of lead service pipes was related to

infant mortality in exactly the way that science suggests that it would be. Cities with lead pipes

had higher infant mortality than cities without lead pipes. Conditional on having lead pipes,

cities with low pH had higher mortality than cities with high pH. And in cities with lead pipes

and pHs below 7.3, cities with lower hardness had higher infant mortality than cities with higher

hardness.


49
   The results are similar for the full sample.
50
   The 5-95 range for hardness for this subsample is 8-153. So for all but a few observations, the marginal effect is
negative.

                                                                                                                    21
       The effect of lead on infant mortality in absolute terms was large. In Table 5 an increase in

pH from 6.675 to 7.3 in cities with lead-only pipes was associated with a decrease in infant

mortality of 7 to 33 percent. The overall infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births in 1895 was

about 110 for whites and 170 for blacks, and the rate in cities was about 180 in 1900.52 The

estimates suggest that an increase in pH from 6.675 to 7.3 in 1900 would have saved at least 12

infants per 1,000 live births. Today the infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births is about 7. The

share of the population that could have been affected was sizeable. Eleven percent of the United

States population in 1900 lived in cities with lead-only service pipes, and 4 percent lived in cities

with lead-only service pipes and below median pH.

Further Evidence on Causality

       This section provides further evidence on the relationship between lead, pH, and infant

mortality. Thus far, only data for 1900 has been presented. If lead was causing infant mortality,

the relationships predicted by Figure 1 should hold in other years.

       The effects of lead should also decline over time and be larger for locations with more acidic

water. These declines reflect the aging of the stock of lead pipes, the increased tendency of

water systems to treat water to reduce acidity, and possible switching of the types of pipes being

used away from lead pipes. As lead pipes age, they tend to build up a coating on the inside of

the pipes that reduces leaching. Troesken (2006) showed that cities in Massachusetts with higher

shares of new lead pipes had higher infant mortality than cities with lower shares of lead pipes

and cities with new pipes of other types. Other factors also reduced leaching. After 1905, many

cities began to filter their water. Some cities began to treat their water to reduce acidity with the

aim of reducing corrosion. One byproduct was reduced leaching. Some cities may have also

                                                                                                       22
begun to use non-lead pipes in new housing and to replace broken lead pipes. There is no

systematic data on this, but anecdotal reports suggest this was occurring. All of these changes

were likely to benefit cities with lead pipes more than cities without lead pipes and cities with

lead pipes and low pH more than cities with lead pipes and high pH.

    Table 6 shows that the cross-sectional relationships observed in 1900 hold for 1905, 1910,

1915, and 1920. In all of the years except 1920, mortality was statistically significantly higher in

a city with lead pipes than in a comparable city without lead pipes. Moreover, in all of the years,

the coefficients on lead-only x ln(pH-5.675) are negative and statistically significantly different

than the coefficient on no-lead x ln(pH-5.675). Consistent with the patterns in Figure 2, the

magnitudes of the coefficients on lead-only x ln(pH-5.675) were declining over time, particularly

after 1905.

    Appendix Table 1A directly tests whether the coefficients were falling over time, by

estimating the following specification:

           mortit = α0 + α1i time x leadi + α2i time x regioni + βcityi+ εit                 (2)

mortit is mortality in city i at time t, time x lead are service pipe-specific time trends (lead-only,

mixed lead, no lead), time x region are region-specific time trends, and cityi are city fixed

effects.

    Column 1 shows that infant mortality was falling over time and that it was falling faster in

cities with lead only and mixed lead pipes than in cities with no lead pipes. This is what we

would expect, if pipes were ageing, water was being treated to increase the pH, or pipes were

being replaced with non-lead pipes. The additional of covariates in column 2 has very little

effect on the magnitude and statistical significance of the coefficients on the lead variables.


                                                                                                     23
Columns 3 and 4 allow the trends to differ among the three types of pipes and for each type of

pipe for pHs above and below 7.3. Cities with lead-only pipes and pH≤7.3 were experiencing

faster declines in infant mortality than cities with lead-only pipes and pH>7.3 and, more

generally, than cities of all types with pH>7.3.

       In sum, the cross-sectional results in Table 6 and the panel data results in Table 1A provide

additional evidence that that relationship between lead service pipes and infant mortality was

causal.

Non-Infant Mortality and Morbidity

       The relationship between lead and mortality is unclear once one moves beyond infant

mortality. On average, young children who survive high lead may be more robust than children

who faced low or no exposure. Other factors are likely to play roles too, such as (unmeasured)

heterogeneity of the health history of non-infants, (unmeasured) heterogeneity in the duration of

lead exposure arising from rural to urban migration, and the ability of older children and adults

to tolerate relatively high levels of lead exposure.

       Table 7 confirms that lead is not strongly related to non-infant mortality.53 The specifications

are similar to those in Table 4. The variable women ages 20-40 was replaced by controls for the

average age of the population, the share of the population under five and the share of the

population over sixty. The coefficients on the lead variables are not statistically significant, with

the exception of lead only variable in column 2, as are the implied differences between different

pHs for lead-only cities.

6. Conclusion



53
     Non-infant mortality is mortality of all individuals over the age of 1.
                                                                                                     24
     Using city-level data for 1900-1920, this paper presented evidence that leaching of lead from

service pipes into water caused higher infant mortality. The share of the population with

exposure to lead was high. Twenty three percent of the U.S. population lived in cities with some

lead pipes, and 11 percent lived in cities with lead-only pipes; and roughly half of these cities

had relatively acidic water. The effects of lead on infant mortality were substantial. In 1900, an

increase in pH from 6.675 (25th percentile) to 7.3 (50th percentile) in cities with lead-only pipes

would have been associated with a decrease in infant mortality of 7 to 33 percent, which

translates into 12 fewer infant deaths per 1,000 live births. City officials could have achieved

such a change either by modifying the pH of the water or by switching from lead to other types

of service pipes. In the latter case, the estimates are lower-bound estimates, since at a pH of 7.3,

some lead was still leaching into city water.

     These results make clear that the impact of environmental pollution can be large and unseen.

Few people in 1900 thought lead water pipes were anything more than an arcane engineering

decision, without any ramifications on either health or economic activity. Yet, the effects on

infant mortality were both large and enduring. Modern studies have documented the

relationships between lead exposure and IQ, human capital formation, antisocial behavior,

teenage pregnancy rates, and criminal activity.54 Thus, the adverse effects of lead were likely to

have extended beyond infant mortality.




54
  It is well-known, for example, that incarcerated populations exhibit higher blood lead levels than does the general
population, and these high levels likely preceded life in prison (e.g., Needleman et al. 1996, 2002). There are also
studies linking environmental lead levels in specific regions to antisocial behavior and criminal activity, including
homicides and violent crime (e.g., Stretesky and Lynch 2001, Nevin 2000, and Reyes 2007).

Notes: ln(pH -5.675) has a value of 0 at a pH of 6.675, which is the 25th percentile of the acidity distribution. For
ease of interpretation in column 4, pH = original pH – 6.675. (The two lead variables are both equal to zero at
6.675.) 1(pH> 7.3) is an indicator variable that is 1 if pH is greater than 7.3 and 0 otherwise. The omitted category is
lead w/pH≤7.3. All specifications include regional fixed effects, and city population quartile fixed effects.
Demographic and other controls are fraction foreign born, fraction white, fraction women of ages 20-40, state
temperature and state precipitation. A constant was estimated but not reported. Heteroskedastic robust standard
errors are shown in parentheses. ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels.

Notes: Notes: ln(pH -5.675) has a value of 0 at a pH of 6.675, which is the 25th percentile of the acidity distribution.
For ease of interpretation in column 3, pH = original pH – 6.675. (The two lead variables are both equal to zero at
6.675.) 1(pH> 7.3) is an indicator variable that is 1 if pH is greater than 7.3 and 0 otherwise. In columns 1-2, there
are 3 indicator variables for pipes (no lead, mixed, lead only). The omitted category is no lead. In column 3, there
are 6 indicators variables (no lead w/pH≤7.3, mixed w/pH≤7.3, lead only w/pH≤7.3, no lead w/pH>7.3, mixed

state temperature and state precipitation. A constant was estimated but not reported. The baseline year is 1900. The
panel covers 240 cities and is unbalanced. The number is greater than the largest number of cities in Table 6,
because some cities appear in earlier years but not in later years. Heteroskedastic robust standard errors are shown in
parentheses. ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels.

City-level mortality data: Mortality Statistics (various years). 1900 data are from the revisions in
the 1906 volume. The volumes are available from http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/vsus.htm

City-level demographic characteristics: Calculated from IPUMs 1% samples of the Census of
Population for 1900, 1910, and 1920. Values are interpolated for 1905 and 1915. The data is
available from http://usa.ipums.org/usa/

Lead pipes: The Manual of American Waterworks, 1897

pH and Hardness of the raw intake water: Historical water sources were identified using Baker
(1897) The Manual of American Water Works; United States Geological Survey (1934) The
Industrial Utility of Public Water Supplies in the United States, 1932; city websites, which
sometimes have histories of the water utility; and other sources. pH and hardness of the
historical water sources are primarily taken from United States Geological Survey (1954) The
Industrial Utility of Public Water Supplies in the United States, 1952 or from The Water
Encyclopedia (Van Der Leeden 1990), which report the acidity and hardness of the raw intake
water for many water systems in the early 1950s and 1980s. Supplemental information was
drawn from USGS reports. Data and detailed notes on source data for water characteristics of the
cities are available online at http://www.heinz.cmu.edu/~kclay/research.html

State average annual temperature and average monthly precipitation: Data on mean annual
temperature and mean monthly precipitation are from the National Climactic Data Center at the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The data are available from
http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/cirs/.

They describe the data as follows: “The statewide values are available for the 48 contiguous
States and are computed from the divisional values weighted by area. The Monthly averages
within a climatic division have been calculated by giving equal weight to stations reporting both
temperature and precipitation within a division.”55 The observations were corrected for time of
observation bias as described in Karl, et al. (1986). The annual state values for 1895-2000 were
averaged to obtain the state average.
