                                            ABSTRACT

I use changes in immigrant eligibility for food stamps under the 1996 federal law and heterogeneous
state responses to set up a natural experiment research design to study the effect of food stamps on
Body Mass Index (BMI) of adults in immigrant families. I find that in the post-1996 period food stamps
use by foreign-born unmarried mothers with a high school or lower education was 10 percentage points
higher in states with substitute programs than in states that implemented the federal ban. However,
this increase in FSP participation was not associated with any statistically significant difference in
BMI. I find that FSP participation was associated a statistically insignificant 0.3 percent increase in
BMI among low-educated unmarried mothers.

Introduction

         The nature of nutritional risk faced by low-income families in the US appears to be shifting from

food insecurity to obesity. Prevalence of obesity is high among members of low-income families

(Surgeon General 2001). In a survey of New York City shelters, Luder et al. (1990) found that 39 percent

of the homeless people were obese. Obesity poses high risk for serious diet related chronic diseases and

is the second most common cause of mortality in the country (Surgeon General 2001). In accord with

changes in nutritional risks, public health concern has also shifted from eliminating food insecurity

towards lowering prevalence of obesity.

         The primary objective of a nutrition program like Food Stamps is to reduce food insecurity and

meet the nutritional needs of low-income families. Can it cause obesity? The answer is yes if

participants spent a larger proportion of their incomes on food than they would have if in place of food

stamps they received cash. Monthly vouchers of food stamps have been found to affect quantity and

frequency of food consumption, with periods of high consumption immediately following voucher receipt

(Wilde and Ranney 2000, Shapiro 2003).1 Whitmore (2002) finds that between 20 to 30 percent of food

stamps recipients would spend less on food than their food stamp benefit amount if they received cash

instead of stamps. Increased expenditure on food, however, may not necessarily cause obesity. Food

stamps may help poor families buy healthier food based on lean meat, fresh vegetables and fruits, which

may lower obesity. Participation in the Food Stamps Program (FSP) also lowers food insecurity (Borjas

2004, Krueger 2004).2 Therefore, it should lower stress related with food insecurity and if stress causes

obesity, participation in the FSP may also lower obesity (Alaimo et al. 2002, Laitinen and Sovio 2002).

         Whether participation in the FSP improves quality of food consumed, and lowers food insecurity

and obesity, or whether it has the unintended consequence of increasing obesity is an issue of serious

public health concern. If the FSP, on which the Federal government spends around $27 billion a year, is a


1
  Shapiro (2003) found that caloric intake declines by 10 to 15 percent over the food stamp month, implying
preference for immediate consumption.
2
  Borjas (2003) found that a 10 percentage point cut in the fraction of the population that received public assistance
increased the fraction of food-insecure households by about 5 percentage points.


                                                                                                                         2
cause of obesity, the program needs to be redesigned to discourage purchase of meals that are

nutritionally inferior, or even be replaced by a cash program that does not lead to distortion in food

consumption.

        Previous studies have found that participation in the FSP is associated with obesity among

women in low-income families (Townsend et al. 2001; Gibson 2003, 2004; Chen et al. 2005). The

positive correlation between obesity and use of food stamps could be because individuals who participate

in the FSP are poor and more likely to face food insecurity, consume poor quality food and therefore be

obese (Alaimo et al. 2001). It could also be an outcome of participation in the FSP. Previous research

has not been able to adequately purge the effect of individual circumstances, such as food insecurity

resulting from poverty from the decision to participate in the FSP (Frongillo 2003). To measure the

“causal” effect of food stamps on obesity, we need a plausibly random change in FSP participation that is

unrelated to individual circumstances or societal changes in consumption patterns.

        This paper uses changes in immigrant eligibility for the FSP under the 1996 Personal

Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) and state responses to the federal

law to set up a natural experiment research design to study the effect of food stamps on Body Mass Index

(BMI) of adults in low-income immigrant families. The 1996 federal law denied immigrants access to

food stamps, resulting in a sharp decline in their food stamps participation. In response to PRWORA, a

number of states started substitute FSPs for immigrants who entered the country before the enactment of

the federal policy and a few even provided benefits to new arrivals. If FSP participation leads to obesity,

in the post-PRWORA period prevalence of obesity among immigrants should decline in states that

implemented the federal ban as compared to states that instituted substitute FSPs. Federal law

subsequently restored FSP eligibility to certain groups of pre-PRWORA arrivals. The decline in food

stamps use was also larger among the post-PRWORA arrivals. By the above logic if FSP causes obesity,

the decline in obesity should be greater among newly arrived immigrants. I examine the effect of these

changes in eligibility for the FSP on food stamps participation and BMI of adults in low-income

immigrant families. I use the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the March Current


                                                                                                          3
Population Survey (CPS) and apply a two-sample instrumental variables research design to estimate the

association between food stamps participation and BMI of foreign-born adults. Heterogeneous state

responses to the 1996 federal ban are used to instrument for food stamps participation.

        There is no previous research on the effect of the FSP on prevalence of obesity among

immigrants, a fast growing demographic group that constitutes over 12 percent of the nation’s population,

and a fifth of its poor. Research suggests that length of residency in the US increases obesity particularly

among low-income immigrants (Gordon-Larsen et al. 2003). This paper will, therefore, also address a

related issue of whether increased prevalence of obesity among low-income immigrants with longer

residency in the US is associated with participation in the FSP.



PRWORA and Immigrant Eligibility to the FSP

        Immigrant eligibility for food stamps in the US has undergone several changes over the past

decade. Before August 1996, all legal low-income immigrants were eligible for food stamps. The 1996

PRWORA denied foreign-born non-citizens access to the FSP. However, eight states initiated substitute

FSPs for immigrants who were ineligible under Federal law (Carmody and Dean 1998; Zimmerman and

Tumlin 1999, Gigliotti 2004).3 Seventeen states, including these eight, started substitute programs for

children and elderly among the pre-1996 arrivals. The 1997 Balanced Budget Act restored eligibility to

some vulnerable groups, who were in the country when the 1996 law was enacted. These groups

consisted of the elderly, children under 18, persons with disabilities and refugees and asylees.4 Finally, in

July 2002, the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act (FSRIA) restored Food Stamps eligibility to all

immigrant children; immigrants with disabilities as well as all those in the country for at least five years.

Restoring eligibility under FSRIA, however, has increased participation only marginally.




3
  These eight states were: CT, ME, MA, MN, NE, RI, WA and WI.
4
  The federal initiative was followed by Illinois and New Jersey allowing Food Stamps to the parents of children
receiving food stamps, provided they entered the US before 1996; California extending the benefit to all legal
immigrants.


                                                                                                                   4
        As expected, food stamps use by foreign-born adults fell dramatically since 1996. In 1995, 19

percent of the foreign-born adults with a high school or lower education received food stamps; by 2001,

the proportion was reduced to 8 percent.5 During the same period, food stamps use by the US born adults

with a high-school or lower education declined from 15 to 10 percent. Currie and Grogger (2001) find

that among low-income families, 20 percent of the decline in FSP participation can be attributed to lower

unemployment and 30 percent to the 1996 welfare reform. Although PRWORA did not alter FSP

eligibility rules for US citizens, it raised the transaction cost of obtaining food stamps for welfare leavers,

discouraging them to apply for food stamps even when eligible.6 Since 1996, able-bodied adults without

dependents are also subject to stiff work requirements limiting their participation in the FSP to three to six

months unless they are enrolled in a work or training activity.

        Like natives, immigrant participation in the FSP was affected by lower unemployment, minimum

work requirements and higher transaction costs. They were also affected by a fourth factor: the special

provision in PRWORA that denied immigrants food stamps, and its chilling effect that created an

atmosphere of fear and confusion among immigrants, inducing them not to apply for benefits even when

eligible (Fix and Passel 1999; Kaushal and Kaestner 2005). Surveys by the National Health Law Program

and the National Immigration Law Center indicate that fear of deportation from the US discouraged

immigrants from obtaining public benefits even when eligible (Schlosberg and Wiley 1998).



Methodology

Food Stamps Eligibility and Obesity

        The hypothesis underlying this empirical analysis is straightforward: changes in federal and state

eligibility rules for food stamps caused a random change in food stamps utilization among immigrants.

This may have induced immigrants to change quantity, quality and frequency of food consumption, which

 Since state welfare agencies also administer the FSP, the transaction cost of obtaining food stamps is high for
welfare leavers than non-leavers. Zedlewski and Brauner (1999) find that the decline in food stamps participation
was higher among welfare leavers than others.


                                                                                                                    5
may have affected their Body Mass Index (BMI is defined as weight in kilograms divided by the square

of height measured in meters). I begin the analysis by first estimating the effect of changes in federal and

state eligibility rules for immigrants on their FSP participation using the March Current Population

Survey for 1994-2002, that provides data on food stamps use for 1993-2001.7 I begin with the following

regression model computed on a sample of foreign-born low-educated adults:

       FS ijt = β j + γ t + λ Policy jt + Z jt Φ + X ijt Γ + u ijt
(1)    i = 1,..., N (persons)
       j = 1,...,51 (states)
      t = 1993,..., 2001 ( years)

In equation (1), FS ijt is an indicator of whether individual i living in state j in year t received food stamps

(equals to 1 if the person received food stamps, otherwise 0) and is a function of Policy jt (equals to 1 if

state j had a substitute FSP for immigrants in year t, otherwise 0); time-varying state characteristics ( Z jt )

namely state unemployment rate and per-capita income; individual characteristics ( X ijt ) namely age (a

dummy variable for each year of age), race (Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Asian and

others), marital status, and years lived in the US; state fixed effects ( β j ) and year fixed effects ( γ t ).

The estimated value of    λ would be positive and statistically different from zero if in the post-PRWORA
period (as compared to the pre-PRWORA level) food stamps participation among immigrants was higher

in states that instituted substitute programs for immigrants than in states that did not.

         The primary weakness of equation (1) is that there may be omitted variables that vary by state

and year that affected FSP participation of immigrants and are correlated with Policyjt . For instance,

families living in states that instituted FSP for immigrants may face different economic opportunities as

compared to those faced by families in states that implemented the federal ban. Inclusion of time-varying


7
  The March CPS started providing information on an individual’s country of birth from 1994 onwards. Since in
July 2002, the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act restored food stamps to immigrants who have been in the
country for at least five years, the period of investigation is restricted to 1994-2002 that provides data on food
stamps participation during 1993-2001.


                                                                                                                     6
state characteristics such as state unemployment rate and per capita income are expected to control for

some of these effects.

          To control for unobserved time-varying factors contemporaneous with the variable Policy jt , I

adopt a difference-in-difference research design. This approach involves selecting a target group, i.e. a

group most affected by the policy change, and a comparison group, which is similar to the target group

but unaffected by the policy. An equation similar to equation (1) is estimated for the target and

comparison groups. Since FSP eligibility rules for the comparison group are unchanged, the estimated

coefficient for variable Policy      jt
                                          ( λC ) for this group captures the effect of omitted variables. To

eliminate the effect of these omitted variables, I subtract       λC   from the estimated value of the coefficient

for Policy    jt
                   ( λTR ) for the target group and arrive at the difference-in-difference estimate. The

identifying assumption of the research design is that in the post-PRWORA period, unobserved differences

between states that instituted substitute programs and states that did not, have the same effect on the target

and comparison groups, after controlling for state and time fixed effects. The difference-in-difference

estimate is given by:

(2) DD = λ mp = λTR − λC

The DD estimate in equation (2) can also be obtained in one step using the following regression:
               ~            ~
      FS ijt = β j + γ~t + λ Policy jt + λt Post t + λ p Post t * Tr + λ m Tr + λ mp ( Policy jt * Tr ) +
(3)
                  ~         ~
             Z jt Φ + X ijt Γ + u~ijt

There are two additional variables in equation (3) as compared to equation (1):          Tr is a dummy variable
indicating whether an individual belongs to the target group comprising of low-educated immigrants

and Postt , an indicator for whether an observation is taken from the post-PRWORA period.

          Equation (3) is relatively restrictive as compared to equation (2) in that it restricts the effect of

other explanatory variables to be the same for the target and comparison groups. In reality, in the

empirical analysis, I allow the effect of individual characteristics to be different for the two groups. The



                                                                                                                     7
effect of state unemployment rate, per capita income and state and year fixed effects are restricted to be

the same as statistical tests allow the restriction. Note that equation (3) allows the effect of PRWORA to

be different for the target and comparison groups (measured by variable Postt *Tr). This allows for

controlling unobserved factors contemporaneous with PRWORA that may have affected the two groups

differently.

          Since food stamps dependence varies by gender, all analysis is done separately for men and

women. I also repeat the analysis restricting the target and comparison groups to low-educated unmarried

mothers, as they are a highly vulnerable group, most likely to be in poverty and as shown later in this

analysis, foreign-born unmarried mothers were most affected by the special immigrant provisions in

PRWORA.

          In equation (3), the difference-in-difference coefficient is given by λmp and should be positive

and significant if immigrant food stamps participation increased in states that instituted substitute

programs as compared to those that implemented the federal ban. It is the estimate for              λmp   that

motivates the second part of the analysis, i.e. whether random changes in FSP participation affected

individual BMI. In the empirical analysis, an equation similar to (3) is used to estimate the effect of

changes in immigrant eligibility for food stamps on their BMI using the National Health Interview Survey

for 1993-2001 and is given by equation (4).

      Bm ijt = βˆ j + γˆt + λˆ Policy jt + λˆt Post t + λˆ p Post t * Tr + λˆm Tr + λˆmp ( Policy jt * Tr ) +
(4)
                  ˆ + X ijt Γˆ + uˆ ijt
             Z jt Φ

In equation (4) Bm ijt denotes the log BMI of individual i living in state j in year t, and symbol ^ is used

to distinguish coefficients in equation (3) from those in equation (4).8



Selection and validity of treatment and comparison group

8
  I also repeated the analysis with BMI as the outcome, and the estimated coefficients were similar. Since it is easier
to interpret the effect on log BMI, I have elected to present estimates for log BMI for most of the analysis.



                                                                                                                      8
         The soundness of the difference-in-difference research design depends on the validity of the

target and comparison groups. The target of the special provisions in PRWORA is low-income

immigrant families who are at high risk of being on food stamps. I use education as a proxy for income

and select low-educated (education≤12 years of schooling) foreign-born adults as the target group.

According to the March CPS, during 1993-1995, three years prior to PRWORA, 21 percent of the

foreign-born low-educated women, 49 percent of the foreign-born low-educated unmarried mothers and

16 percent of the low-educated foreign-born men received food stamps.9 During 1998-2000, after the

implementation of welfare reform, all the three groups registered a sharp decline in FSP participation with

the decline being greater among low-educated unmarried mothers (Table 1).

         Low-educated natives are similar to the target group in terms of their dependence on food stamps.

In the pre-PRWORA period, 18 percent of low-educated native women, 50 percent of the low-educated

native unmarried mothers and 10 percent of the low-educated native men received food stamps (Table 1).

More importantly, during the period of the study, their eligibility for the FSP was relatively unchanged.

         Figures 1 and 2 present BMI distribution for the target and comparison groups of women and men

in the pre-PRWORA period (1992-1995). BMI distribution of foreign-born low-educated women (men)

are quite similar to the BMI distribution of native low-educated women (men), providing some evidence

that the comparison group approach is appropriate to examine the effect of food stamps eligibility on

BMI.10

         To further test the validity of the research design, I use the March CPS for 1994-1997 (that

provides food stamps participation for 1993-1996) and National Health Interview Survey for 1993-1996

and conduct a placebo test with a pseudo policy intervention dated January 1995. Similar models as



9
  FSP participation is restricted to families with a total gross income no more than 130 percent of the federal poverty
line, with a net family income less than or equal to federal poverty line and household assets less than $2000.
10
   The seemingly small differences at the higher ends of the distributions for the target and comparison groups,
however, make the identifying assumptions in difference-in-difference analysis more restrictive for outcomes like
obesity. I did the analysis with two other outcomes: whether obese or overweight; and whether underweight. The
findings are similar to those obtained using log BMI as outcome. For space considerations, I do not present results
with these two outcomes.



                                                                                                                     9
outlined in equations (3) and (4) are computed with food stamps participation and log BMI as outcomes

using the above target and comparison group. Of interest is the coefficient on the interaction term

between three variables: a dummy variable indicating whether the observation is taken from the post-

intervention period, a dummy variable indicating a respondent’s membership to the target group and a

dummy variable indicating whether the respondent lives in a state that had a substitute food stamp

program for immigrants in the post-1996 period. Since there was no change in immigrant eligibility for

food stamps during this period, the coefficient for the triple interaction term should be zero. Appendix 1

has the result of this analysis and shows that the coefficient is indeed modest and statistically insignificant

for both outcomes for foreign-born low-educated unmarried mothers, women and men. This provides

some validity to the research design.

           As a second test, I use variation in the severity of PRWORA towards immigrants by duration of

their stay in the US to study if trends in BMI were different for recent immigrants than for those who have

been in the country for more than five years. As mentioned earlier, while federal policy denied food

stamps to all immigrants, a number of states restored benefits to immigrants who have been in the country

for at least five years. By the end of 1998, Federal government had also restored food stamps eligibility

to certain vulnerable populations of pre-1996 immigrants. Besides, PRWORA did not change eligibility

rules for foreign-born US citizens, who continued to be eligible for the FSP, just like the US born.11 By

law, legal permanent residents can apply for citizenship five years after receiving the permanent resident

status. Therefore, among the foreign-born who have been in the country for more than five years, a

substantial proportion were eligible for food stamps in the post-PRWORA period either on account of

their citizenship status or due to subsequent changes in federal and state policies. Thus, if FSP

participation increased obesity, denial of food stamps under PRWORA should have lowered BMI of

newly arrived immigrants by a larger proportion than the BMI of “older” immigrants.

           Another issue relates to the influence of country/region of origin on consumption patterns. NHIS,

the primary data used in this analysis, does not provide information on a respondent’s country/region of

11
     The NHIS data do not identify whether a respondent is citizen for most years covered by this study.


                                                                                                            10
birth. I use the ethnicity and race variables in the data to include controls for five ethnic groups:

Hispanics, non-Hispanic blacks, non-Hispanic whites, Asians and others. To minimize bias on account of

presence of individuals with different cultural and eating habits in the target and comparison groups, I

repeat the analysis by restricting the sample to persons with Hispanic ethnicity. In this analysis, the target

group is foreign-born Hispanics and the comparison group comprises of US-born Hispanics. Figures 3

and 4 present BMI distributions for US and foreign-born Hispanic women and men in the pre-PRWORA

period. The BMI distribution of foreign-born Hispanic women is quite similar to that of US-born

Hispanic women and the BMI distribution for foreign-born Hispanic men is quite similar to that of US-

born Hispanic men, providing some soundness to the comparison group research design.

        Finally, this analysis is based on cross-sectional data. To check whether there were changes in

immigrant population before and after welfare reform, which may affect the outcome of the analysis, I

looked at the composition of the immigrant population using the CPS during 1994-1996 and 1998-2001.

I found that there were few differences in immigrant characteristics between the two periods suggesting

that bias on this account is likely to be low.12



Food Stamps Participation and Obesity

        The primary objective of this analysis is to study the effect of food stamps on BMI. Equation (4)

provides an estimate of the effect of eligibility for FSP on BMI of foreign-born low-educated adults.

NHIS, the principal dataset used in this analysis, does not provide data on FSP participation for all years.

To overcome this data limitation, I apply a two-sample instrumental variables research design to first

estimate the effect of the policy on food stamps participation, and then the effect of predicted food stamps




12
  In the 1994-1996 sample, 19 percent of the foreign-born population were white, five percent black, 56 percent
Hispanic and 20 percent belonged to the other category. In the 1998-2001 sample, 18 percent were white, five
percent black, 56 percent Hispanic and 21 percent were in the other category. In both samples, 85 percent were
married and 73 percent had a child, and about 53 percent were living in the US for at least 20 years. In the 1994-
1996 sample, 37 percent had less than a high-school education, 24 percent were with a high-school degree and 39
percent had at least some college education; in the 1998-2001 sample, 35 percent were without a high-school degree,
25 percent had a high-school degree and 40 percent had at least some college.


                                                                                                                11
participation on BMI (Angrist and Krueger 1995, Borjas 2004). Mathematically, the association between

BMI and FSP participation is given by:

(5)    Bmijt = α fs FSijt + Z jt Φ + X ijt Γ + β j + δ t + uijt

 FS ijt is likely to be endogenous with BMI since unobserved factors that determine participation may

also affect body weight choices. I use heterogeneous responses by states to the federal ban to instrument

for FS ijt . The first stage regression estimated using the March CPS data is given by:

      FS ijt = α I I ijt + α p Policy jt + α mp * I ijt * Policy jt + γ p Post t * I ijt + γ t Post t
(6)
                  ˆ + X ijt Γˆ + α j + α t + uˆ ijt
             Z jt Φ

In equation (6), I ijt is an indicator for whether an individual is foreign-born. The first-stage parameters

from equation (6) are used to predict the probability that an individual in the NHIS data received food

stamps. The predicted probabilities are then used as the regressor that replaces FS ijt in the second stage

estimation of the effect of food stamps participation on BMI in equation (5). Note that the first stage

estimate includes all the covariates that are in the second stage, so the identification of the coefficient

 α fs in the second stage depends entirely on exclusion of interaction term (Iijt*Policyjt) from the second

stage regression. Standard errors are obtained using bootstrap to correct for errors in the first stage

prediction (Murphy and Topel 1985; Hardin 2002; Hardin et al. 2003).



Empirical Issues

          Participation in the FSP may affect food consumption in a number of ways. Firstly, by making it

mandatory that participants buy a minimum amount of food in order to use their stamps. Like any other

in-kind transfer program, the FSP will distort consumption decisions if participants spent a larger

proportion of their incomes on food than they would if they received cash.13 The distortion is an intended


13
  Since trading food stamps is illegal, benefits are typically sold for about 61 percent of their legal value (Whitmore
2002).


                                                                                                                    12
aspect of the policy through which the government aims to ensure that participants consume a minimum

amount of food. The FSP has also been found to distort the monthly nutrition cycle of participants who

tend to consume higher quantities of food immediately after receipt of food stamps (Wilde and Ranney

2000, Shapiro 2003). Finally, since the FSP raises incomes of participants, it may increase their

consumption expenditures including food expenditure depending on their marginal propensity to consume

food. Participants may decide to buy and consume more food or better quality food and in the latter case

FSP may lower obesity.

        Ideally, I would like to compute the effect of the extra amount participants would consume by

comparing immigrants who participated in the program with similarly placed immigrants who received

cash in place of food stamps. However, the policy change that I explore and the data I use do not allow

such an experiment. Like previous researchers, I study the combined (substitution and income) effect of

FSP participation on BMI (Townsend et al. 2001; Gibson 2002, 2003; Chen et al. 2005).

        Another empirical issue relates to the time (or amount of additional calorie in-take) it would need

for participants in the FSP to become obese. Roughly, 3500 calories is one pound. Based on

computations in Cutler et al. (2003), an extra 300 calories (a can of Pepsi plus three Oreo cookies) in-take

per day for a month will increase the weight of an average person by 2.6 pounds assuming no additional

physical activity accompanying additional food consumption. A change of this magnitude would increase

the BMI of a woman with a height of five feet and six inches by 1.2 units in three months and by 4.8 units

in a year, which is about 18 percent of the average BMI of a foreign-born adult. Thus, increased calorie

intake may have a perceptible effect on body weight within a year of high consumption of food rich in

calories.

        Would such an increase in BMI cause obesity? The average BMI (adjusted for age, gender, race,

number of years lived in the US) of a foreign-born adult was 26 units in the pre-PRWORA period. The

hypothesis that food stamps cause obesity therefore would involve the BMI of a foreign-born person with

average BMI to increase approximately 15 percent and of a foreign-born person with a normal BMI (say




                                                                                                          13
22 units) to rise by over 36 percent. However, for an overweight adult a much smaller increase in BMI

may cause obesity.



Data

        The primary dataset used in the analysis is the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) for the

years 1992-2001. NHIS is a continuing nationwide survey of the U.S. civilian non-institutionalized

population. During a year, the survey is conducted on a sample of 36,000 to 47,000 households,

including 92,000 to 125,000 persons. I restrict the analysis to men and women aged 21-54 years. Before

1997, from every household a respondent provided data on the height and weight of every adult person in

the household. Due to considerations about the accuracy of information on height and weight, the sample

of analysis for 1990-1996 is restricted to self-reports of the respondents, and respondents’ report on their

family members are excluded from the analysis. Since 1997, information on height, weight and BMI is

available for a randomly selected adult per household, who is told to complete the Sample Adult Module

of the survey. Self-reported measures of height and weight suffer from reporting bias. Following

previous research all regressions adjust for age and gender to minimize reporting bias (Kuczmarski 2001).

        One strength of the NHIS dataset is that it provides information on whether a respondent is

foreign-born and how long he/she has lived in the U.S. Unfortunately, NHIS do not provide data on

whether a foreign-born person is citizen for all the years used in this analysis. Therefore, it is not possible

to control for a respondent’s citizenship status. This limitation is partly overcome by controlling for the

number of years lived in the U.S. since citizenship is highly correlated with duration of residence in the

US. NHIS do not provide a foreign-born person’s country of birth, but it provides detailed information on

his/her ethnicity, which is used to define the following ethnic groups: non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic

white, Hispanic, Asian and others.

        NHIS provides a rich set of demographic variables that are used to define the target and

comparison groups and to construct control variables. Variables on family relationships are used to

identify women with children less than 18. Because of confidentiality and disclosure rules, the National


                                                                                                             14
Center for Health Statistics does not provide state identifiers in the public use NHIS data. State identifiers

were obtained from National Center for Health Statistics to complete the analysis.14

           One limitation of NHIS is that it does not provide information on respondents’ FSP participation

for all the years covered by this study. As mentioned, I use the March CPS data for 1994-2002 (that

provides information on food stamps participation for 1993-2001) to study the effect of immigrant

eligibility under state and federal programs on FSP participation.

           State of residence indicators are used to merge the following information with NHIS and March

CPS: state and federal FSP eligibility policy with regard to immigrants, state unemployment rate and real

per-capita income. The data on immigrant eligibility for food stamps are drawn from Zimmermann and

Tumlin (1999) and the State Documentation Project of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities

(www.cbpp.org).



Results

Descriptive analysis

           Table 2 provides descriptive statistics on BMI and related outcomes for various demographic

groups in the pre-PRWORA period. A number of points merit comment. One, among foreign-born

women those with a higher education are more likely to be underweight. Among men, foreign-born as

well as US-born, and native women, a tiny proportion is under-weight but there is no apparent correlation

between education and the propensity to be underweight. Two, for foreign-born and US born, men as

well as women, the other three BMI related outcomes, normal weight, overweight and obesity, are

correlated with education. For instance, for all the four groups, proportion with normal weight increased

with education, and prevalence of obesity and overweight decreased as education increased. And finally,

US born women (and men) are more likely to be obese as compared to foreign-born women (men) with

corresponding education levels.

     I thank the Research Data Center, NCHS for providing the state identifiers to complete the analysis.


                                                                                                            15
        In short, Table 2 suggests that obesity and overweight are more likely to exist in low-income

families, and that among foreign-born women, prevalence of being underweight is higher among the high-

educated than the low-educated. The need for FSP is, therefore, less pressing if the aim is simply to

eliminate prevalence of underweight in low-income families. But food stamps may enable poor families

to buy better quality food, which may lower obesity. At the same time it is likely that food stamps may

increase frequency and quantity of food consumed without affecting quality, which may increase

prevalence of obesity among the poor (Gibson 2002, Chen et al. 2005; Townsend et al. 2001).



Trends in FSP participation

        I begin by first examining the effect of PRWORA on FSP participation since it is the causal link

between PRWORA and declines in FSP participation among immigrants that has motivated this study.

Figure 5 presents trends in food stamps participation in households headed by low-educated (with a high-

school or lower education) foreign-born and US-born adults, based on the March series of the CPS, and

shows that PRWORA was associated with a decline in immigrant dependence on food stamps. In 1993,

FSP participation among the foreign-born was about four percentage points higher than FSP participation

among the US-born. Both groups experienced a decline after 1995, but the decline was steeper for

foreign-born adults. As a result, by 2000, low-educated US-born adults were two percentage points more

likely to use food stamps than low-educated foreign-born adults; and the gap between the two groups has

remained at this level during 2000-2003.

        Figure 6 presents the trend in FSP participation for unmarried low-educated mothers, a highly

vulnerable group, of whom about 50 percent received food stamps in the pre-PRWORA period.

Participation among the US-born group declined steadily during 1993-2000 and has been rising since

then. In comparison, FSP participation among foreign-born unmarried mothers increased during 1993-

1995, followed by a sharp decline during 1996-2001 and a modest rise since 2001. During 1993-1995,

before the enactment of PRWORA, foreign-born and US-born low-educated unmarried mothers had

roughly the same level of food stamps participation. During 2001-2003, five years after the


                                                                                                          16
implementation of PRWORA, US-born, low-educated unmarried mothers were nine percentage points

more likely to receive food stamps as compared to foreign-born low-educated unmarried mothers. Did

the decline in FSP participation resulting from changes in immigrant eligibility affect their BMI? Next, I

examine this issue using multivariate regression models.



Multivariate analysis

          I first examine the pre- versus post-PRWORA trend in average BMI of various demographic

groups defined by nativity and education, using the NHIS data. Columns labeled I to VI in Table 3

present average BMI (adjusted for age, education, ethnicity, marital status, and for the foreign-born, the

number of years lived in the US) of the target and comparison groups, averaged for four years before

PRWORA (1992-1995) and four years after the policy change (1998-2001) and the difference in these

rates between the two periods. Column labeled VII presents the difference-in-difference estimates based

on regressions that include controls for state unemployment rate, state per capita income, state and year

fixed effects, in addition to the demographic controls mentioned above. Difference-in-difference

estimates are based on separate regressions. In these regressions, the effects of unemployment rate, per

capita income, state and year effects are restricted to be the same for the target and comparison groups.

However, unrestricted DD estimates can be computed by simply subtracting the pre- to post PRWORA

change in BMI for the comparison groups from the pre- to post PRWORA change in BMI for the target

groups.

          Row 1 shows that in the post-PRWORA period, the average BMI of foreign-born low-educated

women increased by 2.7 percent (0.72 BMI units). During this period, the average BMI of low-educated

U.S. born women increased by 4 percent (1.11 BMI units). The resulting DD estimate is a statistically

significant 1.3 percent (-0.34 units) decline in BMI.

          Low-educated, foreign-born unmarried mothers are more likely to be poor and therefore more

likely to be dependent on food stamps. As noted in Table 1 and Figure 6, this group also experienced a

sharp decline in FSP participation in the post-PRWORA period. Row 2 in Table 3 suggests that like all


                                                                                                            17
women, low-educated unmarried mothers too experienced increase in BMI after PRWORA. Again, the

increase was relatively lower (2.4 percent or 0.63 BMI units) for the target group of foreign-born

unmarried mothers than for the comparison group of US born unmarried mothers (4.3 percent or 1.17

units). The difference-in-difference estimate indicates that PRWORA was associated a statistically

significant 1.8 percent decline in average BMI of foreign-born unmarried mothers with a high-school or

lower education with US-born unmarried mothers with similar education as comparison.

        Row 3 in Table 3 presents the analysis for foreign-born men. As in the case of women, BMI of

men too was rising during the nineties. Also, similar to the experience of women, the rise in BMI among

foreign-born men with a high school or lower education was slightly less than the increase experienced by

native men with similar education. The difference-in-difference estimates suggest that PRWORA was

associated with a statistically insignificant 0.5 percent decline in the average BMI of low-educated

foreign-born men.

        To sum up, analysis in Table 3 suggests that PRWORA was associated with a decline in BMI of

low-educated foreign-born women with low-educated native women as the comparison group, and the

decline was higher in absolute terms (point estimate) when the sample of analysis was restricted to

unmarried mothers. In the analysis on foreign-born men, PRWORA was associated with modest and

statistically insignificant effect on BMI.

        PRWORA changed immigrant eligibility for a number of means-tested programs, including cash

welfare, food stamps and Medicaid. Previous research shows that the decline in dependence on means-

tested programs was greater for immigrants than natives (Fix and Haskins 2002; Kaestner and Kaushal

2006). Estimates presented in Table 3 could be on account of these other changes. To isolate the effect

of FSP participation from the effect of these other factors, I now examine if trends in immigrant BMI

differed in states that created substitute FSP for immigrants as compared to states that observed the

federal ban, using models outlined in equations (3) and (4).



Food Stamps Eligibility, Participation and BMI


                                                                                                        18
        In this analysis, I compare the difference-in-difference estimate for the target group in states that

created substitute programs for foreign-born persons with the difference-in-difference estimate for the

target group that lived in states that banned food stamps to immigrants. Since the effect of eligibility on

BMI is expected to operate through changes in FSP participation, I first study the effect of state and

federal policies on food stamps participation, and then on BMI. The analysis is based on equations (3)

and (4). Columns 1 and 2 of Table 4 present the results for FSP participation and columns 3 and 4 have

the results for log BMI.

        Figures in each row of columns 1-2 and columns 3-4 are based on separate regressions that

control for age, race, education, whether foreign-born, years lived in the US (for foreign-born persons),

whether the observation is taken from the post-PRWORA period, state unemployment rate and per capita

income and state and year fixed effects. The effect of individual characteristics is allowed to differ for the

target and comparison groups. Regressions are computed on a pooled sample of the target and

comparison groups. Row 1 of the Table presents the results for women. In row 2, the sample of women

is restricted to unmarried mothers, and row 3 has the results for men. Low-educated native adults with

characteristics similar to the target groups are the groups of comparison.

        The coefficient for the double interaction term PRWORA (indicator for whether an observation is

taken from the post-PRWORA period) and Target (indicating whether a respondent belongs to the target

group) is negative for all groups, and suggests that in the post-PRWORA period, FSP participation of the

target group declined as compared to that of the comparison group. The double interaction term captures

the effect of PRWORA as well as other contemporaneous factors that affected the target and comparison

groups differently.

        Figures in column 2 suggest that with low-educated native women as comparison, in the post-

PRWORA period, FSP participation of low-educated foreign-born women is three percentage points

higher in states that started substitute FSPs for immigrants as compared to states that continued with the

federal ban. FSP participation of unmarried low-educated foreign-born mothers is 10 percentage points

higher in states with substitute FSPs as compared to states that denied immigrants food stamps, with


                                                                                                            19
unmarried low-educated native mothers as comparison. The corresponding number is a statistically

insignificant 0.6 percentage point when the sample of analysis comprises of men.

        Columns 3-4 present the analysis on BMI using the NHIS data. Column 3 provides estimates of

the effect of PRWORA (and other correlated factors) on the BMI of the target group, and these estimates

are modest and statistically insignificant for all the three target groups viz. low-educated, foreign-born

women, unmarried mothers and men. Figures in column 4 provide the estimated effect of substitute state

FSP on immigrant BMI and these estimates are also modest and statistically insignificant. The point

estimates suggest that among low-educated foreign-born women, a 2.9 percentage point increase in FSP

participation is associated with a 0.4 percent decline in BMI. In the analysis on unmarried mothers, a 10

percentage point increase in FSP participation is associated with a 0.03 percent increase in BMI. Among

low-educated foreign-born men a 0.6 percentage point increase in food stamps use is associated with a

0.01 percent increase in BMI.

        To sum up, the above analysis suggests that while eligibility for FSP is associated with

statistically significant rise in FSP participation of low-educated, foreign-born women, in particular

unmarried mothers, the estimated coefficients of the association between eligibility and BMI are

relatively small and statistically insignificant.

        One possible source of bias in the above analysis could arise from differences in country/region

of origin among the target and comparison groups and such differences may cause even similar time-

varying factors to exert a different effect on the BMI of groups with different cultural and ethnic

backgrounds. To overcome this bias, I repeat the analysis in Table 4 by restricting the target and

comparison groups to persons of Hispanic origin. Due to sample size considerations, the target groups in

this analysis are not restricted to the low-educated. Again, the analysis is done for three groups, women,

unmarried mothers and men. This analysis has all the controls of the analysis in Table 4, and is presented

in Appendix 2. These results suggest that in the post-PRWORA period, among foreign-born Hispanic

women FSP participation is a statistically significant 1.8 percentage point higher in states with a

substitute program than in states without such program; and among foreign-born unmarried Hispanic


                                                                                                             20
mothers, FSP participation is a statistically significant 5.9 percentage points higher in states with a

substitute program than others. The corresponding figure for foreign-born Hispanic men is a statistically

insignificant 0.2 percentage point increase. The estimated effect of food stamps eligibility on BMI is

negative for all the three target groups (foreign-born Hispanic women, unmarried mothers and men), but

statistically insignificant, with large standard errors. These findings reject the hypothesis that food stamps

increase BMI of foreign-born Hispanics.

        To gain further insight into the relationship between food stamps eligibility and BMI, I use

variation in the severity of PRWORA towards immigrants by duration of their stay in the US and examine

if trends in BMI were different among recent immigrants and earlier arrivals. The results of this analysis

are in Table 5, and show that the target groups of recent immigrants living in states with a substitute FSP

are no more likely to receive food stamps than the target group of recent immigrants living in states that

implemented the federal ban. However, among low-educated immigrant women who have been in the

country for at least five years, those living in states with substitute programs for immigrants are 3.6

percentage points more likely to receive food stamps than those living in states that banned food stamps

to immigrants. Among unmarried mothers who have been in the country for at least five years, those

living in states with a substitute program are 12 percentage points more likely to receive food stamps.

These differences in estimated increases in FSP participation between recent and earlier arrivals,

however, do not translate into significant differences in BMI. For instance, a 3.6 percentage point

increase in FSP participation among low-educated women who have been in the US for at least five years

is associated with a 0.7 percent decline in BMI, and a 12 percentage points increase in FSP participation

among low-educated, unmarried mothers who have been in the country for at least five years is associated

with a 0.03 percent decline in BMI. In men’s analysis, the estimated coefficients for FSP participation

and BMI are modest and statistically insignificant for both recent and older immigrants.

        In short, the analysis in Table 5 confirms the findings in Table 4 and Appendix 2 that FSP

participation has a modest and statistically insignificant effect on individual BMI.




                                                                                                           21
Food Stamps Participation and Obesity

        In the analysis so far I estimated the effect of food stamps eligibility on obesity. To examine the

effect of FSP participation on obesity, I now use a two sample instrumental variables model outlined in

equations (5) and (6). I restrict the sample in this analysis to unmarried mothers because the estimated

effects of PRWORA and substitute programs on food stamps utilization of the other groups comprising of

low-educated men and women are relatively small in size resulting in insufficient variations in FSP use

that are unlikely to yield meaningful results. As mentioned, the March CPS data is used to estimate the

first stage parameters using equation (6). These first stage parameters are then used to predict probability

of food stamps participation among the US-born and foreign-born populations in the National Health

Interview Survey data, which is then used as a regressor in the second stage estimation of the effect of

food stamps participation on log BMI.

        Table 6 has the results of this analysis. All variables included in the first stage regression, except

for the triple interaction term between PRWORA *whether a state has a FSP for immigrants* foreign-

born, are included in the second stage regressions. Control variables included in the regressions are:

whether foreign-born, age, education, race, marital status, years lived in the US (for foreign-born

persons), policy variable indicating whether a state has a substitute FSP for immigrants in year t; an

indicator for PRWORA, interaction of foreign-born with PRWORA; state unemployment rate, state per

capita income, and state and year fixed effects. Individual characteristics are allowed to differ by nativity.

Standard errors, given in parenthesis, are clustered at state-year for first stage estimates (column 2). In

the second stage, standard errors are obtained using bootstrap to correct for errors in the first stage

prediction (column 4).

        Due to sample size consideration, these estimates are first computed on all unmarried mothers

and followed by an analysis restricting samples to unmarried mothers with a high-school or lower

education. The first stage results suggest that in the post-PRWORA period foreign-born

unmarried mothers are 8.3 percentage points more likely to receive food stamps in states that




                                                                                                              22
instituted substitute FSP for immigrants than in states that implemented the federal ban; and

unmarried foreign-born mothers with a high-school or lower education are 10 percentage points

more likely to receive food stamps in states that instituted food stamps programs for immigrants

than in states with the federal ban.

        Estimates from the second stage regressions suggest that food stamps participation is associated

with a statistically insignificant 6.8 percent decline in average BMI of unmarried mothers. When the

sample is restricted to unmarried mothers with a high-school or lower education, the analysis suggests

that FSP participation is associated with a statistically insignificant 0.3 percent increase in BMI. This

estimate is the same as the reduced form estimate obtained in the difference-in-difference analysis in

Table 4 (coefficient on the effect on log BMI ÷ coefficient on the effect on FSP participation= 0.0003 ÷

0.099). Notice that restricting the sample to low-educated unmarried mothers changed the point estimate,

but the standard error remained relatively unchanged. These estimates reject the hypothesis that food

stamps participation causes a person with an average BMI to become obese. For instance, the adjusted

average BMI of low-educated foreign-born unmarried mothers was about 26.8 units in the pre-PRWORA

and it would need about 12 percent increase in BMI in the case of an unmarried mother with average BMI

to become obese. Estimated coefficients from this analysis are of smaller magnitude, and suggest that

food stamps have relatively modest effects on individual BMI.



Conclusion

        In this paper, I investigate whether participation in the FSP causes obesity. I use changes in

immigrant eligibility for food stamps under the 1996 welfare law and heterogeneous state responses to the

federal law to set up a natural experiment research design to study the effect of food stamps on Body

Mass Index (BMI) of adult immigrants. I find that while PRWORA was associated with a 1.3 percent

decline in the BMI of foreign-born low-educated women and a 1.8 percent decline in the BMI of foreign-

born low-educated unmarried mothers, these declines are unrelated to changes in FSP participation.



                                                                                                            23
        The analysis shows that in the post-PRWORA period food stamps use by foreign-born low-

educated women is three percentage points higher in states that created a substitute food stamps program

(FSP) for immigrants than in states that implemented the federal ban. The difference in FSP participation

among men living in states with substitute programs versus other states is negligible. Among low-

educated foreign-born unmarried mothers, FSP use is 10 percentage points higher in states with substitute

programs than in states with the federal ban. However, these increases in FSP participation are associated

with negligible and statistically insignificant changes in BMI. Among foreign-born Hispanics (with US

born Hispanics as the comparison group), the analysis suggests that food stamps eligibility is associated

with negative, but statistically insignificant effects on BMI.

        PRWORA and state responses were more severe on recently arrived immigrants (arrived ≤five

years ago). I use this variation in policy towards immigrants by duration of their stay in the US and

examine if trends in BMI were different among recent immigrants versus earlier arrivals. The analysis

shows that severity of policy did affect food stamps utilization. While low-educated recent arrivals living

in states with a substitute FSP were no more likely to receive food stamps than those living in states that

implemented the federal ban, eligibility increased participation for earlier arrivals. Among low-educated

immigrant women in the US for at least five years, those living in states with substitute programs were

four percentage points more likely to receive food stamps than those living in states with the federal ban.

Among unmarried mothers who have been in the country for at least five years, those living in states with

a substitute program were 12 percentage points more likely to receive food stamps than those living in

states with the federal ban. These differences in FSP participation, however, do not translate into

statistically significant differences in BMI.

        I also apply a two-sample instrumental variables research design to estimate the association

between food stamps participation and BMI. Federal and state level changes in immigrant food stamps

eligibility in 1996 are used to instrument for food stamps participation. I find that FSP participation is

associated with a statistically insignificant 6.8 percent decline in BMI of unmarried mothers and a

statistically insignificant 0.3 percent increase in BMI of low-educated unmarried mothers. These findings


                                                                                                             24
suggest that the FSP is not associated with any large sized effects on BMI to cause a person with normal

weight (18.5≤BMI<25) or with the average BMI (about 26 units) to become obese.

        Previous research (Townsend et al. 2001; Gibson 2003, 2004; Chen et al. 2005) that found

evidence in support of the hypothesis that food stamps cause obesity treated FSP participation as

exogenous which may have resulted in selection bias. The positive correlation between obesity and use

of food stamps may be because individuals who participate in the FSP are poor and more likely to face

food insecurity, consume poor quality food and therefore be obese. I study random changes in FSP

utilization caused by changes in federal and state eligibility criterion for immigrants, and therefore

arguably, I control for individual characteristics more effectively than previous research. The findings of

my research suggest that eligibility for the FSP can be decided without excessive concern about its

adverse effect on BMI. Further this research also suggests that the observed increase in prevalence of

obesity among immigrants with their duration of residence in the US is unrelated to FSP participation.

bootstrap (column 4). All variables included in first stage regression, except for the triple interaction term between PRWORA *whether a state has a FSP for
immigrants* whether foreign-born, are included in second stage regressions. Control variables included in the regressions are: whether foreign-born, age,
education, race, marital status, number of years lived in the US (for foreign-born persons), policy variable indicating whether a state has a substitute FSP for
immigrants in year t; a dummy variable for PRWORA, interaction between an indicator of whether foreign-born and PRWORA, state unemployment rate, state

Note: Robust standard errors clustered at state-year are reported in parenthesis. Dependent variables are listed in column heading. Figures in each cell are based
on a separate regression that control for age, race, education, marital status, whether foreign-born, years lived in the US (for foreign-born persons), state
unemployment rate, per capita income and state and year fixed effects. The effect of individual characteristics is allowed to differ for the target and comparison
groups. The target groups comprise of low-educated foreign-born adults listed as row headings; low-educated native adults with similar characteristics are the
comparison group. Regressions are computed on a pooled sample of the target and comparison groups.

Note: Robust standard errors clustered at state-year are in parenthesis. Dependent variables are listed in column heading. Figures in each row of columns 1-2 and
columns 3-4 are based on separate regressions that control for age, education, marital status, whether foreign-born, years lived in the US (for foreign-born
persons), state unemployment rate, per capita income and state and year fixed effects. The effect of individual characteristics and PRWORA are allowed to differ
for the target and comparison groups. The target groups comprise of foreign-born Hispanics listed as row headings; US born Hispanics with similar
characteristics are the comparison group. Regressions are computed on a pooled sample of the target and comparison groups. For the food stamps participation
analysis, there are 28638 observations of foreign-born Hispanic women and 24331 U.S.-born Hispanic women; 5449 observations of foreign-born Hispanic
unmarried mothers and 6716 US born Hispanic unmarried mothers and 24507 foreign-born Hispanic men and 16998 US born Hispanic men. For the BMI
analyses, there are 9185 observations of foreign-born Hispanic women and 7086 U.S.-born Hispanic women; 2789 observations of foreign-born Hispanic
unmarried mothers and 2351 US born Hispanic unmarried mothers and 10042 foreign-born Hispanic men and 7081 US born Hispanic men.
