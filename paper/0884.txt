       Consider a   firm that   has assets in place and also a valuable real

  investment opportunity.    However, it has to issue common shares to raise
  part or all of the cash required to
                                          undertake the investment project. If
  it does not launch the
                         project promptly the opportunity will evaporate.
  There are no taxes, transaction
                                  costs or other capital market imperfec-
  tions.

       Finance theory would advise this firm    to   evaluate this investment
 opportunity as if it already had plenty of
                                                cash on hand. In an efficient
 capital market, securities can always be sold at a fair price; the
                                                                    net
 present value of selling securities is
                                            always zero because the cash raised

 exactly balances the present value of the
                                               liability created. Thus, the
 decision rule is: take
                           every positiveNpV project, regardless of
 whether internal or external funds
                                        are used to pay for it.

                           managers know more about the value of its assets
and Opportunities than outside investors do? As we will

problem just posed and the steps required to solve it. In the first

example, the firm always issues stock and goes ahead .ith               a    positive

The firm has no cash or marketable securities
                                                                 (S =   0).   The investment

     We now examine a trial solution assuming the firm issues stock

     In state 1, the true value of the firm, including 100 raised from

 In state 2,

                   =            . 160    = 62.75



 Note that both old and new shares are correctly priced to investors,

 who regard the two         states      as equally probable.

   Because   the firm issues   stock in both states, the   decision    to issue
   tells investors nothing about the true state.

        This trial solution is the
                                      equilibrju solution, because issuing
  stock and going ahead with the project leaves the old stockholders

  better off regardless of the true state:

                                      Issue and                    Do nothing

       In this example the firm has no use for financial slack. If it
                                                                      had, say,
 100 in cash (S = 100) it would make exactly the
                                                 same investment decisions.
 The payoffs to old
                      Stockholders, after subtracting their extra 100 invest-
 ment in the firmts cash balance, would be:

The state payoffs differ, but
                                  expected payoff is identical: (250 + 60) = 155.


     Second example. Let the

     In state 1,

In state 2,


                               v = void +            = 160

 Note that P'      4(144.42 + 85.58) = 115       ,

      Now look at the payoffs to old stockholders:

                                              144.42                              150

                                            With these payoffs, the optimal

  strategy       is to issue and invest only in state 2, because in state 1, the

  market value of the old stockholders shares is lower when shares are issued.

  Butif the firm follows this strategy, issuing stock signals state 2 and P'
  drops to 60. The equilibrium payoffs are those circled below:


                                                 Issue and                    Do nothing
                                             invest (E 100)                       (E =   0)

         state 2


Thus the firm passes up a good investment project (NPV = +20)                          in
state 1.         Its   market values at t = 0      will be P' = 60 (state 2)
and P = 150            (state   1).   The        payoff to old stockholders is

(i50 + 60) = 105            .    There is a loss of 10 in firm value —-       i.e.,      at
t = —1, V = 105 vs. 115 in the first example.

        In this example, the firm is better off with cash in the bank.

If   S = 100 , the payoffs, net of the additional cash investment,
                                                                   are

        state    2



In this      case there appears to be an incentive            to   leave the cash in

the bank, and issue stock in state 2.             But   that action would immediately

reveal the true state, forcing P' down to

not have to issue stock to undertake the project, smart investors

will assume the worst if it does issue.


Discussion

      The conventional rationale for holding financial slack—— cash,

liquid assets, or unused borrowing power—— is that the firm doesn't

want to have to issue stock on short notice in order to pursue a

valuable investment opportunity. Managers point to the red tape,

delays and underwriting costs encountered in stock issues. They

also typically say,"We don't want to be forced to issue stock when

our firm is undervalued by the market."

      Afinancial economist would respond by asking, tManagers may
have superior information, but why should that be a disadvantage?
If we admit that the firm is sometimes undervalued, then sometimes
it must be overvalued. Why can't firms take advantage of the market
by   issuing securities only when the firm is overpriced?"
        Our examples suggest answers for these questions: slack
 has value in example 2, because without     it   the   firm is sometimes

 unwilling to issue stock and therefore passes up a good investment
                                                                       of
 opportunity. Slack does not allow the firm to take advantage
 investors by issuing only when stock is
                                         overvalud. Firms can get
                            they   do not have slack sufficient to cover their
 away with that only when

 investment requirements.

        The value of slack of
                                course disappears if the firm can costlessly
   Convey the true values a, b to the
                                         market. One way to justify our
   contrary assumption is to think of cases in which values depend
                                                                   on
   Proprietary information which, if released to the market, would

  be released to competitors
                                also, consequently reducing a and/or b.
        The firm cannot
                       convey that information by saying, "We have great
  prospects but we can't tell
                              you the details." In our model, the firm
  always has the incentive to do this, so such statements
                                                          carry no in—
  formation. The firm has to supply verifiable
                                                        detail   sufficient to
  indicate the true state of nature.     The    costs   of supplying, absorbing
  and verifying this detail may be significant.

       Slack   is clearly unnecessary if the firm has a "private
                                                                 line"
 to   existing stockholders.    However, private communication to all old
 Stockholders   would be difficult and also
                                               illegal for publicly held
 firms. Slack is also
                       unnecessary if the firm can compel its old
 stockholders to buy and hold any new issue; in this case the conflict

 between old and new stockholders does not exist.'

gives up one of them (the new project) if the partial-claim is

 therefore reduces the value of

       4.    Rendleman {13J also sets a   problem similar   to ours. His investors

 misassess   its risk. He focuses on the choice between debt and

nancing, but does not derive a full
                                          equilibrium model. For example, he shows
that undervalued firms will    typically   prefer debt, but does not model
the market's response to the firm's choice of debt
                                                   over equity.        In general
management's choice of financing
                                    must convey information about the firm's
intrinsic value and actual risk,
                                     Of course the sigilal would be more
complex than in our case, in which the
                                            firm has only two choices: issue
equity or nothing. A full equilibrium model with more than one

    The lower a is, the more attractive the issue price P'.

           Of course P itself depends on the probability densities of

 priced to investors if

 where A(M')          E(lE   =    I   — S)    and B(M') E(E =     I   — S).    These

 expectations reflect only the information available to investors:

 the distribution of              and         and the decision to issue, which

 tells investors that the true values               a and b satisfy Inequality (1).

Properties of Equilibrium

          These equilibrium conditions explain why the firm may pass up

good opportunities rather than selling stock to raise funds. This

occurs      with probability F(N). The ex ante loss in value is
L        F(N)(M). L 0 when S > I. Other things equal, L increases
if E, the required equity issue, increases. Since E = I — S,
the      loss also increases with the required          investment I and      decreases
with     slack available

issues stock or never issues stock, are rarely encountered in this

model given reasonable joint probability distributions for

     Having explained our model formally, we can now turn to possible extensions

and qualifications. We also discuss broader issues, for example, the impli-

cations of managers' superior information for capital structure and dividend

policy.


Easy Ways Out

     There is of course an easy way out-—an easy way tb avoid any loss of market

value: just issue stock at t = —1, when managers and the

market share the same information. That is one lesson of our model.

If managers know more than the market does, firms should avoid situations in

which valuable investment projects have to be financed by stock issues.

Having slack solves the problem, and one way to get slack is to issue stock

when there is no differential information.

      This is not an easy way out, however, if the information differential

is permanent. Suppose managers are always ore period ahead of the market.
                                                                    would not.
At t = — 1, for example, managers would know A and B, but investors

Investors would see A and B as random variables.

      Table 3 shows who knows what, when. Values of assets—in—place and

the investment opportunity are now subscripted for time.                Note that

                    =                                etc. The table assumes

that there is only one investment opportunity which must be taken at t =

or lost. Also, investors "catch up" to managers at t = +1.                   Thus A1 =
                                                                                         a1

and       =
              b1.
      Assume the firm has insufficient slack to undertake the project,

that the amount of slack is fixed unless equity is issued to increase

it, and that the investment required to undertake the project is known.

       Consider the decision to issue E =         I—     S   dollars of stock at

t = —1.       If the firm does not issue, its true market value, known to

                                             + b1 + S — L.       If it does issue, V1(issue) =
managers, is V1 (no issue) =            a1
a1    + b1 + S + E. A stock issue of E =             I   — S at t = —1 thus has a net value of L,


because it guarantees the firm will invest if b0 > 0.

      Now redefine the value of assets—in—place at t                 —l as

                         L.   Let b*1    L. b*1 is the NPV of investing
a*1 a1 + b1 —
E= I —    S   in cash or marketable securities——i.e., in slack. Managers

know the payoff of investing in slack but investors do not.                  L is a

 random variable from. their point of view, because its value depends on

                                                        retention rather than stock
 it. Moreover, it should build up slack through

 issues. This is consistent with actual retention policies of most public

 firms, which limit dividends so that they will rarely have to go to the

 market for fresh equity.

      Thus we add one item in favor of the list of possible arguments for

 low dividend payout. On the other hand, dividends would alleviate the
                                                                               thus
 problems posed in this paper if they help signal the true value of

 reducing GA. This is not necessarily an argument for high average payout.

   This could explain why dividend payments respond to changes in earnings,

   not market value. Earnings reflect the performance of assets in place.


       At this point we revcrt to our
                                        original three—date model, in which
differential information is important only at t = 0.



Debt Policy

       Another easy way out is to issue debt
                                                  rather than equity. If the
firm can issue default—risk free
                                   debt, our problem disappears: the
firm never passes up a positive—NPV investment.

       If it can only issue risky debt,
                                          our problem is only alleviated: the
firm   sometimes
               passes up positive—NPV investments, but the opportunity loss
is less with debt than with
                            equity financing. The general rule is: better
to issue safe securities than risky ones.

         If   debt is issued, we follow exactly the same argument, with D and D1 sub-

 stituted for E and E1, and reach the same conclusion:         the firm will issue

 and invest only if b exceeds AD        D1 —D.     Of course if the debt is default—

 risk free,        =   O,' and the firm always issues and invests when b > O.
 Thus the ability to issue risk—free debt is as good as financial slack.

 If the debt is not default—risk free, AD may be positive or negative.

 It will have the same sign as AE, but its absolute value will always be
    13/
less.—

        Now compare the issue—invest decisions for debt vs. equity financing.

Since b>O, the firm will always invest when AD and AE are negative.

Suppose AD and AE are positive (good news in store foiz investors at t =               +1).
If the firm is willing to issue equity and invest, it is also willing to issue

debt (AD        AE, so b > AE => A b > AD). But debt is issued in some states

where    equity is not (AD <   b < AE). Thus the ex ante    value   of the firm   is
higher   under the debt—financing policy, because      the loss in market value (L) due
to under—investment is less.

     This may explain why many firms seem to prefer internal financing to

financing by security issues and, when they do issue, why they seem to prefer bonds

to stock. This could be interpreted as
                                             managerial capitalism——an attempt by

managers to avoid the discipline of capital markets and to cut the ties

that bind managers' to stockholders' interests.         In our model, this
behavior is in the stockholders' interest.

          However, firms are rarely, if
                                                    ever, forced to use the proceeds of an
  asset sale to repurchase shares.
                                                   If the proceeds can be held as cash until
  t =   1, then the decision to
                                        repurchase signals investors that the firm's
  remaining asset is undervalued at
                                                    A2. If the firm insists on repurchasing,

                                                              no equilibrium.) In this
  case, where the only reason for
                                             repurchasing is to take advantage of
  investors who sell, repurchasing would be extremely rare.

         The difficulty here is that
                                              repurchase may reward faithful stock-
 holders at the expense of unfaithful
                                                     ones. A pro rata repurchase could
 avoid the problem, but in that
                                           case, the firm might just as well pay a
 cash dividend. A pro rata
                                      repurchase is taxed like a cash dividend.

      Now turn back to the case in which the firm has
                                                      one asset in place,
 and one investment

However, the asset—in—place can be sold.

        If it can be sold for
                             a, without affecting b, then the problems ad-
 dressed in this paper evaporate.i"

                                                             simply spin off
       This leads us to another "easy way out." The firm can
its asset—in—place as a separately—financed company.         In our model,

stockholders are better off exante holding holding two firms rather than one,

providing that the spinoff does not reduce the values of the distributions

A and/or B.




        Our model's main message is this: given differential information, a

firm with insufficient financial slack may not undertake all valuable in-

vestment opportunities. Thus a firm that has too little slack increases its

value by acquiring more.
                                                                 increases value when
        One way to do this is by merger. A merger always

one firm's surplus slack fully covers the other's deficiency.'

        But the same conditions that create this potential gain will complicate

the merger negotiations and in some cases rule out any possibility of

their successful completion. Consider a firm with an existing business,

a good investment opportunity, but
                                           insufficient slack to pay for it.          It
 seeks   a merger with a cash-rich firm. However, the would-be buyer only
knows the distributions             and     not the true values a and b.
        Let Q'     be   the proposed merger price. That is, if   the   merger offer

 is accepted, the shareholders of         the cash—poor firm receive Q' in         cash.

 If    theoffer is turned down, that firm's shareholders forego the investment
 and   are left with S + a. Thus, given a and b, the offer will
                                                                 be accepted

 if    Q' >   S   + a. But the cash—rich firm will only offer Q'

      because P' always exceeds Q'.1-"
          The decision to sell shares always carries
                                                           negative information, re-
     gardless of whether the shares are sold
                                                  to investors generally or to a
     specific acquiring firm. The buyer or buyers discount the shares so that

     cost equals expected payoff. If the firm issues E =        I   —S, old shareholders
     retain a stake, but if their firm is sold they are completely disengaged

     from it. The decision to sell all of the firm via merger, rather than

     issue the fraction E/(P' + E), drives down market price below P'
                                                                            ,   because the
     firm has chosen to sell more stock
                                            than absolutely necessary to cover the
  investment I.    (tie assume that (1) the acquiring firm's slack exceeds the

 selling firm's deficiency (I —       S),   (2) the acquiring firm has other assets,
 and (3) everyone knows what these assets are worth.)

         Negotiated mergers thus seem to be ruled out regardless of financing,

 because the cash—poor firm can always do better by issuing stock. How
                                                                       can
 mergers be explained under the premises of this paper?

         There are two possible explanations.
                                                     First, there may be partial or total
 disclosure of internal information
                                            during negotiation)2i Second, the merger
 may   go through if the buyer rather than the seller
                                                      takes the initiative. In
 our model, firms with plenty of slack should seek out acquisition targets

which have good investment
                           opportunities and limited slack, and about which
investors have limited information
                                     Such firms sell at a discount from their
average potential value A +       +            A tender offer made directly to the

  are better off ex ante——i.e., on
                                      average——when the firm carries sufficient

  financial slack to undertake good investment
                                                  opportunities as they arise.
             The ex ante loss in value increases with the size of the required

  equity issue. Thus, increasing the required investment or reducing slack

 available    for this investment also increases the ex ante loss. In      addition,
 numerical    simulations indicate the loss decreases when the market's
 uncertainty about the value of assets in place is reduced, or when the

 investment opportunity's expected NPV is increased.

      4. Firms can build up financial slack by restricting dividends when

 invesment requireraents are modest. The cash saved is held as marketable

 securities orreserve borrowing power.

          The other way to build slack is by issuing stock before cash is

 required for investment. Firms would try to make such precautionary

 issues in periods when managers' information
                                                 advantage is small; they would
definitely issue in periods where managers have no information
                                                                        advantage.
However, we   have   not derived a generally optimal dynamic issue strategy.

     5. When managers have superior information, and stock is issued to

finance investment, stock price will fall.

     6. A merger of a slack—rich and slack—poor firm      increases   the firms'

combined value. However, negotiating such mergers will be hopeless unless

the slack—poor firms' managers can convey their special information to the

prospective buyers. If this information cannot be
                                                      conveyed (and verified),
slack—poor firms will be bought out by tender offers made directly to their

shareholders.

    Of course the six items stated just above depend on the specific

assumptions of our model and may not follow in other contexts. We have

only explored one of many possible stories about corporate finance. A full

description of corporate financing and investment

require telling several stories at once.

     A more comprehensive theory of financing policy would be a good initial

target for further research. Our model supplies a rationale for debt

financing even in the absence of taxes. On the other hand, a policy that

relies too heavily on debt increases the likelihood of bankruptcy costs and

agency costs or problems of moral hazard.' Firms may arrive at their

optimal debt policies by balancing these consideratioflS.Z

  1. Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and

      National Bureau of Economic Research; Universidad Catolica de Chile. This

      paper draws on Majiuf [12] and an earlier (1978) joint working paper with

      the same title as this one. The delay in revision is the senior author's fault.

  2. We could interpret our time subscript not as calendar time, but just

     the state of information available to the firm and market.

  3. That is, managers may have inside information about the firm, but not

     about the market or the economy.

 4. An analogy may help make this clear. Think of a share of IBM stock on

     January 1 (t = —1).     could be the unknown distribution of the February

     1 price, a the actual price on February 1 (t =   0).   However a fur trap-

     per snowed in on the upper MacGregor River might not learn the February

     1 price until March 1 (t =   +1).
 5. Rights issues resolve the conflict of interest only if old stockholders can be

    compelled to exercise their riBhts and hold the newly—issued shares.

 6. However, Grossman's recent paper [8] on product warranties is worth not-

     ing because his underlying problem is like ours. There are also tempt-

     ing analogies between our paper and the literature on credit rationing.

    See, for example, Jaffee and Russell [10] and Stiglitz and Weiss [17, 18].

 7. Downs and Heinkel [5] contains empirical evidence supporting the Leland—

    Pyle analysis.

 8. A formal proof is given in Majluf[12], Appendix 2, pps. 286—290. See

    also pps. 142—143.

9. Majiuf [12] shows that at least one equilibrium P' exists if the firm

    issues stock. See his Appendix 1, pps. 279—285.

11. This problem is addressed in Rendleman'S paper 1113]. As noted above,

    he does not devise a full equilibrium solution for it.

12. That is, the change in the debt value at t
                                                   1 is independent of

     the firm—specific information revealed to investors at that time.

     Other things, such as a general shift in interest rates, may change

     debt value, but that is irrelevant here.

                                                See, for example, Galai and
13. We know this from option—pricing theory.

      sold at intrinsic value, the firm treats the proceeds as additional

      slack and looks again at its issue—invest decision.

 16. What if the asset in place can only be sold at a discount? What if

      the potential buyer does not know its true value? What if sale of

      the asset in place reduces b? These questions are worth exploring.

 17. If the merged firms' total slack does not fully cover their investment

      requirements, the merger may or may not increase value. See Majiuf

      [12], pps. 239—256.
                                               —38—


 18. A proof follows. Define a*(N')              as the breakeven value of a, the

      value at which the cash—poor firm is just indifferent to being

      acquired at the equilibrium price Q'. Note that Q'                  a*(N') + S.

      Refer again to (la), the requirement for the firm to issue stock:


                                 (S+a) <E+b

      If F' were equal to Q', the firm would issue and invest at a*(N')

      for any b > 0. That is, if

                        P' = Q' =   S       + a*(N')



                                E
                 (S + a) =                     (S + a*(N')) = E < E + b
                             S+a*(N)    ,




     Thus a(M'), the breakeven value of a at which the firm is just

     willing to issue stock, exceeds a*(N') for any b > 0.

     A(M') + B(M') > A(N') + B(N') and P' > Q'.

19. The cash—poor firm would prefer to negotiate with a firm that is not

     a competitor. A competitor might back out of the negotiations and take

     advantage of information acquired in them. This hazard is less in a

     "conglomerate" merger.

20. We assume the target firm has not yet declared its issue—invest

     decision.

21. However, there is no mechanism in our model to insure that such a

     policy would be followed at t             0 even if announced at -   t   =   1.
22. Agency costs and moral hazard problems exist only when
                                                                    managers
    have superior information.
