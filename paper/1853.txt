                    News from the U.S. and Japan:
              Which Moves the Yen/Dollar Exchange Rate?


                                ABSTRACT


     Intra—daily   movements in the yen/dollar exchange rate were examined

in four non—overlapping segments within each business day from January

1980 to September 1985. The empirical results yielded several conclu-

sions. First, most depreciation of the yen (appreciation of the dollar) from

late 1982 to early 1984 occurred in the New York market. The direction

of the yen was mostly neutral in the Tokyo market. Also, the volatility of

the exchange rate decreased considerably in the Tokyo market. The vola-

tility in the New York market, on the other hand, did not decrease until

very recently. Second, market efficiency was examined in terms of the

random—walk behavior of short—run movements in the yen/dollar rate.

Information on the preceding segments within a day was sometimes signi-

ficant in predicting the exchange rate movement in a market. Third, there

is evidence of the "profit—taking" behavior, or overshooting, in that a

large jump (more than 3 absolute yen) in any market tends to be reversed

by a fifth of the jump during the same day in the next market. Finally,

the relative effects of news from the U.S. and Japan were examined expli-

citly both with respect to possible major events behind large jumps and

the response of the yen/dollar rate to particular economic announcements

in both countries. Over the entire sample period, news concerning the U.S.

money stock had the only significant effects.

I.     INTRODUCTION

       The pre—eminence of the efficient markets hypothesis has led to

a number of studies on the effect of news on asset prices. Many of

these studies further employ finely observed data, usually a change in

an asset's price during a 24—hour period containing major "news." In

this context, "news" refers to an unexpected change in a fundamental

variable relevant to the asset's price determination. By examining the

response to news, different hypotheses about an asset's price behavior

can be evaluated. In contrast, the expected part of the announcement

or development should not influence the asset's price since it is already

taken into account before the announcement in an efficient market.

       Among the recent studies examining the effect of news, the

response of foreign exchange rates has received considerable attention.

The response to the Federal Reserve's weekly money announcements is

investigated by Cornell (1982, 1983), Frankel and Hardouvelis (1985),

Engel and Frankel (1984), Hardouvelis (1984), and Roley (1985b), among

others. Most of the evidence is consistent with the so—called policy—

anticipations (or Keynesian) hypothesis in that a positive money announce-

ment surprise causes dollar appreciation. Under this hypothesis, the

observed positive response of U.S. interest rates to positive money

announcement surprises represents a real interest—rate response, lead-

ing to an appreciation of the dollar in foreign exchange markets. The

real rate rises due to the expectation of future tightening by the Fed-

eral Reserve as a reaction to the unanticipated increase in money.-'

       The response of exchange rates to other economic announcements

also has been considered. Batten and Thornton (1984) examine the
                                    —2—

response to U.S. discount rate changes. They conclude that unexpected

discount rate changes implemented with international considerations,

most notably on November 1, 1978, are significant in explaining exchange

rate movements. Hakkio and Pearce (1986) consider the response of

exchange rates to U.S. announcements of inflation, industrial production,

and the unemployment rate, in addition to weekly money announcements.

Their results suggest that only money surprises affect exchange rates

significantly.

       While   not   focusing on economic announcements, Nussa (1979), Dorn—

busch (1980), and Frenkel (1981) also consider the effect of unantici-

pated changes in economic variables on exchange rates. Edwards (1982,

1983, 1984) and Longworth (1984) further attempt to formalize a method

to explain the deviations between the forward rate and the realized spot

rate using the unanticipated components of money, interest rates, and

output. Since their data consist of monthly changes, the immediate

responses of exchange rates to news announcements are not measured. A

novelty of their approach, however, is to take into account foreign (non—

U.S.) news as well as domestic (U.S.) news.

       As is recognized in the literature on the response of asset prices

to economic announcements, it is desirable to take the shortest interval

possible around potential news since other shocks may dilute the esti-

mated effect over one month. However, Edward's idea that exchange rates

should respond to not only U.S. news but foreign news, implying correl-

ated error terms in the various currency equations, is well taken. This

point leads to the question of how to measure exchange rate responses to

foreign (non—U.S.) news. Since an exchange rate is the relative price
                                   —3—

of two assets (i.e., currencies), it is important to recognize that the

rate could respond to domestic and/or foreign news. However, if exchange

rate responses to domestic and foreign news are to be separated, a 24—hour

segment, not to mention one month, as a data unit is not fine enough since

it involves reactions to both domestic and foreign news.

         Most studies investigating the effects of announcements measure

the change in exchange rates over 24 hours (e.g., a change from a close

to a close). In contrast, Hakkio and Pearce (1986) examine exchange rate

responses in the New York market over two sub—intervals, but they do not

consider exchange rate movements in the rest of the world. As noted above,

it is important to recognize that not only domestic but also foreign news

is very relevant in the determination of the exchange rate, and that the

foreign exchange market is open almost continually somewhere in the world.

Therefore, news analysis of the exchange rate needs to be carried out with

respect to the other countryts news as well as U.S. news.

         This paper distinguishes itself in several aspects from the other

studies mentioned above. Most advantages come from the data set, which

consists of the opening and closing quotes of the yen/dollar exchange

rate in the Tokyo market and the 9 A.M., noon, and 4:30 P.M. quotes in the

New York market for each business day from January 1980 through September

l98. In addition, announcements of the money supply, industrial produc-

tion, and wholesale (producers) prices are collected both for the U.S. and

Japan.

         The short time intervals between exchange rate observations along

with the use of both foreign and domestic economic data allow a better

understanding of the behavior of the yen/dollar rate for several reasons.
                                    —4—

First, the responses of the exchange rate to U.S. and Japanese economic

news can be differentiated. Because of the 14—hour (13—hour during day-

light saving time) time difference between Tokyo and New York, the busi-

ness hours of the two markets do not overlap. (See Appendix 1 for data

sources and timing.) Since currency, as opposed to the U.S. Treasury

bills or U.S. equities, is traded almost continuously around the clock

somewhere in the world, any development in world news will be immediately

reflected in the exchange rate.

         Second, it can be assumed as a first approximation that U.S.—ori—

ented news —— such as economic announcements, and political developments

——   mainly   hit the market during its business hours, and similarly for

Japanese news. Because of non—overlapping business hours, exchange rate

changes in the New York market (9 A.M. —     4:30 P.M.) can be regarded as
responses to U.S. news, and the changes in the Tokyo market (9 A.M. —

3:30 P.M.) as responses to Japanese news. Since the exchange rate should
reflect not only U.S. news but also Japanese news, it is very interest-

ing, for example, to consider how Japanese money announcements compare

with U.S. money announcements with respect to the exchange rate response.

         Third, economic news in addition to money announcements is consid-

ered; namely, industrial production and wholesale (producers, in the U.S.)

price index announcements every month. These announcements are decom-

posed into surprise and expected parts and tested against the efficient

markets hypothesis. Using these data, the relative efficiency of the New

York—Tokyo markets also can be compared.

         Finally, the features of this investigation outlined above are

extremely useful in addressing recent policy issues. By identifying
                                     —5—


whether Japanese news or U.S. news influences the exchange rate more,

and also by identifying what kind of news in each market moves the

exchange rate, this analysis sheds light from a new angle on the con-

troversy of the cause of the "overvalued dollar in the l980s." If the

"cause" of the strong dollar is tight monetary policy of the U.S., the

exchange rate should exhibit relatively large responses to U.S. money

announcement surprises. Alternatively, if the dollar's strength, par-

ticularly since 1982, is a reflection of the strength of the U.S. econ-

omy relative to that of Japan, then other kinds of news such as indus-

trial production announcements in both countries should have signif 1—

cant effects on the exchange rate.

       To analyze the effects of changes in policy and deregulation fur-

ther, several possible break points are considered within the 1980—1985

sample. First, December 1980 should be noted for the sweeping deregula-

tion that occurred with respect to Japanese capital controls both into

and Out of Japan.--" Second, in October 1982, the Federal Reserve

announced the abandonment of its previous monetary—control procedure and

also indicated that targets for the narrowly—defined money stock (Ml)

would be de—emphasized. Third, in February 1984, the Federal Reserve

adopted a different reserve requirement system, and as a consequence the

behavior of money and interest rates in the U.S. may have changed.'

       Following this introductory section, the second section examines

the relative volatility of the yen/dollar rate in the New York and

Tokyo markets. The relative contributions of these markets in determin-

ing longer—run movements also are considered. In the third section, the

random—walk behavior of the yen/dollar rate is tested both within and

across markets. The possibility of inertia over short intervals also
                                    —6—



is   tested. The role of news in explaining large exchange—rate movements

is considered in the fourth section, along with tests of profit—taking

behavior or "corrections" following large jumps. In the fifth section,

the response of the yen/dollar rate to economic news announcements in

both the U.S. and Japan is estimated. The main conclusions are summar-

ized in the final section.



II.      TREND AND VOLATILITY ANALYSIS

         To compare movements of the yen/dollar exchange rate in different

markets throughout the world, four major segments are considered within

each day. (The timing of different markets is explained further in

Appendix 1). First, exchange rate movements from the opening (9 A.M.),

TKO, to the close (3:30 P.M.), TKC, of the Tokyo market mainly reflect

traders' responses to news originating in Japan. Both the London and

New York markets are closed during business hours in Tokyo. This seg-

ment is denoted as the "Tokyo" segment of the day. Second, from the

close of Tokyo market to the opening of the New York market, news and

actions in the European markets are thought to be responsible for the

changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate through cross arbitrage with

European   currencies. This segment is referred to as "Europe." Third,
changes of the yen/dollar rate from 9     A.M.,   NYO, to 4:30   P.M., NYC, in

the New York market mainly reflect the effects of U.S. news, although

the London market is still open concurrently at the very beginning hours

of New York market trading. This segment is denoted as "New York." The

fourth segment of the day differs from the others. In particular, there

is no major market between New York and Tokyo. For 3½ hours (2½ during
                                   —7—


daylight saving time), most of the Japanese, American and European market

participants are not trading. For convenience, this period is referred

to as the "Pacific" market.

       A summary of yenldollar exchange rate movements for each market is

presented in Table 1. This table indicates which market was most influ-

ential in determining exchange rate changes and volatility. Several

stylized facts are apparent in this table. First, the exchange rate at

the end of the sample, September 20, 1985, happened to be about the same

as that of the start of the sample period, January 1, 1980. That is, total

net changes summed over all markets for the entire sample period are less

than one yen. However, when they are decomposed into separate markets,

differences are apparent. In particular, accumulated changes in the New

York market during the second subperiod reflect yen depreciation, and those

for Europe in the first, second, and third subperiods reflect yen apprecia-

tion. The drift of the exchange rate in the Tokyo market appears to be

"trendless" except for a mild depreciation in the second subperiod. The

data suggest that U.S. economic activity and policies led toward an "over-

valued" dollar, while the European markets recorded opposite effects. This

finding is consistent with the assertion that the U.S. fiscal and monetary

policy mix in 1981-1982 caused "surprisingly" high real interest rates,

considering the on—going recession, which in turn attracted foreign (Japan-

ese especially) capital into the U.S. In turn, the exchange rate responded

to the capital account movement rather than the current account. Moreover,

this effect was sufficiently strong such that counter measures (keeping the

interest rate higher than expected) by European countries could not over-

turn the tide.

         Since theory often predicts that asset prices exhibit a random walk

property, it is of interest to examine whether an expected daily change

was statistically different from zero in any market during any subperiod.

As indicated in Table 1, the daily exchange rate movement in the New York

market during the subperiod II (464 observations) was not a random walk in

the sense that the hypothesis that the expected change is equal to zero is

rejected at the 1 percent significance level. Similarly, in the European

market during the subperiods I and III, daily movements were predictable

at the 5 percent significance level. However, the mean change is slightly

more than 1/10 of one yen. Considering the bid—ask spread, which is about

1/20 to 1/10 of one yen, the statistical "predictability" does not mean

that there were unexploited profit opportunities in the market. The con-

ditional prediction depending on movements in the preceding markets are

examined in section III.

         The volatility of the exchange rate measured by variances and mean

absolute changes also is reported in Table 1. The Pacific market consist-

ently had low volatility, about a half to a third that of any other market

in terms of mean absolute changes. As is shown below, this result is

robust even when correcting for the different number of hours in the seg-

ments.

         The volatilities of the Tokyo and New York markets changed signif i—

cantly over the sample. In the first subperiod, the Tokyo market was

slightly more volatile than both the New York and European markets. How-

ever, the New York market was most volatile from the second to the fourth

subperiods. Since October 1982, the New York market has been about twice

as volatile as the Tokyo market in terms of the variances, due mainly to
                                    —9—


the major decline in the Tokyo market's volatility. In terms of variances,

the volatility of the third subperiod is a half of the first period in the

Tokyo market, and the fourth period's volatility is again half that of the

third period.

       The decline in the volatility in the Tokyo market can be explained

by two factors: news and institutions.-' First, the Japanese economy was

highly volatile after the second oil crisis in 1980. The Bank of Japan

was attempting to avoid both inflation and yen depreciation in the spring,

and then trying to stimulate the economy after the suniiner. For example,

the official discount rate was raised from 6.25 to 7.25 percent in Febru-

ary and again to 9 percent in March. The rate was decreased to 8.25 per-

cent in August and to 7.25 percent in November. Some of the actions taken

by the Bank most likely added to the uncertainty in the market.' Second,

most of the capital controls on flows into and out of Japan were elimin-

ated on December 1, 1980. In addition, the so—called "real demand princi-

ple" was eliminated on April 1, 1984. Prior to that date, positions in the

for-ward market without "real demands" were prohibited. Both measures con-

tributed to the broadening of the Tokyo market, which in turn may have

increased its stability.

       The above explanations are not entirely free from criticism. For

example, U.S. interest rates rose in the spring of 1980 and then declined

during the summer and fall, similar to Japan, but with a larger magnitude.

Despite the similar interest rate patterns, the volatility of the exchange

rate differed in the two markets.

       A. Volatility Per Hour

           In the preceding subsection, the difference in the number of

hours for different segments was ignored. If one segment is longer than
                                 —10—


another, its apparent volatility may   be artificially high. To correct
for the difference in segment hours, "per hour" variances are calculated

below.-' The market hours in Tokyo and New York are constant for all

observations. The hours between two markets, however, vary depending on

whether the U.S. is on the daylight saving time. In addition, the Pacific

segment, hours from New York closing to Tokyo opening, includes a weekend

(an extra 48 hours) once every five observations.

       Table 2 shows per hour variances calculated from the volatility

measures reported in Table 1. Even on a per hour basis, the volatility

ranking between Tokyo and New York does not change. The Tokyo market was

more volatile in 1980, while the New York market was more volatile than

Tokyo beginning in the second subperiod.

       Turning to the Pacific segment, volatility per hour is expected to

be very small since all major markets in the world are closed during

these hours. Moreover, if this segment contains a weekend, it extends more

than 50 hours without trading activities. As indicated in Table 2, the

per hour variance of the weekday Pacific segment is a third to a half

that of its New York counterpart as expected.—'

       The low per hour volatility of the Pacific market may be inter-

preted as evidence for the lack of news. To examine this hypothesis fur-

ther, the Pacific segment of the day can be compared to the most "active"

segment of the day, namely 9 A.M. — 12 Noon in the New York market. The

London market is still open during some part of the New York morning ses-

sion. The three hours which would reflect New York and European news are

obviously more volatile than the comparable hours in the Pacific segment

of the day."
                                     —11--



        An alternative explanation of the lower volatility during the

Pacific segment could be its lack of "self—generating" trading rather than

the lack of news. French and Roll (1984) propose that trades self—gener-

ate volatility based on evidence that when the stock market is closed dur-

ing regular business hours, the volatility between closing and opening

quotes is significantly less than during other times. Unfortunately,

because the foreign exchange market is almost always (except the Pacific

segment) open somewhere in the world and ready to process relevant news,

the maintained hypothesis that it is news which determines volatility can-

not be differentiated from an alternative hypothesis that the mere exist-

ence of trading generates the volatility.

III.    RANDOM WALK HYPOTHESIS

        In this section, the random walk hypothesis that changes in the

exchange rate are unpredictable is tested. Under this hypothesis, all

information concerning the exchange rate is processed instantly. The

New York closing rate, for example, should be the expected level of the

Tokyo opening. Similarly, the expected closing rate in the New York

market as of 9:01 A.M. should be the opening (9 A.M.) rate in the New

York market. The random walk hypothesis is tested by regressing a change

in a segment's rate on the aggregated change during the three preceding

segments:


(3.1)         TKO —    NYCi      a + bi(NYC   i   —
                                                      TKOt   i + e
(3.2)         TKCt — TKOt        a + bi(TKO — TKCt1)         +e
                   —          = a + bi(TKC —
(3.3)         NY
                       TKCt                       NY0_i) + e
(3.4)         NYCt —   NY0
                              = a + bi(NY0    —
                                                  NYCi)      +e
                                   —12—


where the random error term in each equation is represented by e for

simplicity. The random walk hypothesis is that b1 = 0 in each equation.-'

        The above equations can be generalized slightly to consider addi-

tional alternative hypotheses. The movement in European markets, for

example, captured by (NYO —            may have an "inertia" effect on the
                               TKC),
within—the-market change in New York. This hypothesis may not be refuted

by equation (3.4) if the movement in European markets is dominated by the

movement in the rest of the world. In general, the following equations

allow tests of whether any of the preceding three segments of the day has

a special effect on the change during the upcoming segment:

                      = a + bi(NYC                      —
(3.5)   TKO — NYCt                     i NY0i) + b2(NY0i TKCi)

        The estimation and test results of equations (3.1) —           (3.8)   are

summarized in Table 3. The equations are estimated over the entire sam-

ple and selected subsamples corresponding to possible policy regimes and

deregulation)' In two of the first four equations, (3.2) and (3.3), the

random—walk hypothesis can be rejected at the 5 percent level for the

entire sample period. The results indicate that the opening Tokyo quote
                                    —13—


is not an unbiased predictor of the closing Tokyo quote, and similarly

that the closing Tokyo quote is biased in forecasting the opening New

York yen/dollar rate. In contrast, the closing New York rate in the

previous day is an unbiased predictor of the opening rate in Tokyo, and

the opening and closing rates in New York do not exhibit any significant

bias. On the basis of these results, the rationality of the closing

quote in Tokyo may be questioned.

       For the entire sample period, the random walk hypothesis cannot

be rejected in equations (3.1) and (3.5), indicating that the exchange

rate movement in the Pacific market is indeed a random walk. The move-

ments in the preceding three segments of the day, whether aggregated or

separate, do not contribute in predicting the change in the Pacific mar-

ket. In contrast, equation (3.8) shows that the movement in the New York

market is predictable using changes in the three preceding segments, but

it is not predictable when these segments are aggregated.

       The rejection of the random walk hypothesis is most definite in

the second subperiod. The number of rejections decreases in the third

subperiod and again in the fourth subperiod)" One explanation is based

on the notion that "large jumps" and "small trembles" are caused by dif-

ferent factors and that a large jump in one period would predict move-

ments in the following segments. As large jumps become less frequent in

later periods (as will be evident in Table 4), it may become difficult to

reject the random walk hypothesis. Alternatively, the results may be

interpreted as support for the assertion that as the market becomes large

and more traders (speculators) participate in it, the price movement fol-

lows the theoretically—predicted random walk behavior.
                                 —14—


      The rejection of the random walk hypothesis does not necessarily

mean an unexploited profit opportunity. In fact, the typical size of

the predicted change in a segment is typically well under the bid—ask

spread.2i Nevertheless, important insights about the conditional pre-

dictability of intra—daily movements of the exchange rate are apparent
             13/
in the table.—



IV.    NEWS ANALYSIS AND PROFIT—TAKING BEHAVIOR

       In the previous section, the random walk hypothesis was analyzed

in the sense that information about yen/dollar rate movements during

the past 24 hours should not be helpful in predicting the current segment's

rate. The estimation procedure implicitly asstrned that each day in the

sample is qualitatively the same. However, newspaper headings are con-

 stantly encountered such as the price (exchange rate) declined because

of "profit—taking'1 after a sharp rise. There seems to be a view, at

least in the news media, that any large change in an asset's price is

followed by a movement in the opposite direction. There also is a view,

which is not mutually exclusive, that sharp changes in the price reflect

 the last stage of a bubble (or a bandwagon effect) in which the bubble

bursts. These views predict that days of large price changes should be

 treated separately from other days and be tested for predictability of

 subsequent price movements.

       A large change by itself is not evidence of a bubble. It may be

 reflecting some major news in the world, a sudden death of a political

 leader, or an initiation of war in the Middle East. If all large changes
                                  —15—


are attributable to major news, factors which traders think are most

important in the determination of the yen/dollar exchange rate can

potentially be ascertained. If many large changes occur without any

apparent major news items, the existence of a bubble or a bandwagon

effect in the market may be suspected.   To examine these hypotheses,

a set of selected days with large jumps is used.

       A. Is There Always Major News Behind a Large Jump in the Rate?

           Days in which a large change in the exchange rate occurred

are examined closely below. Table 4 lists the number of days in which

the yen jumped by more than 3 absolute yen. From Table 1, a change of

three yen is more than two standard deviations. This classification

scheme reconfirms the findings in Section II about which market was more

volatile. By selecting the infrequent days with jumps of more than 3

yen, special characteristics are examined.

       A jump in the exchange rate is supposedly triggered by some econo-

mic or political news. Newspapers relevant to the days of large changes

(more than 3 absolute yen per segment) were examined in an attempt to

identify major news items. This exercise is summarized in Appendix 2.

After possible causes for large jumps were reviewed, it appears that not

all jumps can be associated with major news.

       B. Tests of Bubbles and Profit—Taking

           Since news responsible for all large jumps could not be

identified, an alternative hypothesis is considered. In particular, sup-

pose that the exchange rate could deviate from an otherwise stationary

stochastic process for a short period of time. A "rational" bubble could
                                  —16—


then emerge and burst occasionally. That is, this bubble hypothesis for

a large change within a day is that the jump is caused by the final

stage of a bubble or a bandwagon effect. A large jump can then be inter-

preted as a sudden correction to the "natural" (equilibrium) level from

an exploding bubble process. This interpretation predicts that the large

jump is preceded by a significant change in the opposite direction.

Formally,

(4.1)          Jump = a + b(change in the previous segment) +   e,   b <   0.
        In addition, it can be loosely hypothesized that a large jump (3

yen or more) is followed by profit—taking behavior. Under this hypothe-

sis, the subsequent movement if not necessarily large, but it is in the

opposite direction regardless of the reason for the jump. This behavior

can be represented as

(4.2)          (Change in the subsequent segment) = a + b(Jump) + e, b < 0.

        The empirical results for days with large jumps are summarized in

the bottom part of Table 4. The results for equation (4.1) indicate that

there is no evidence that large jumps are preceded by changes in the oppo—
               14/
site direction Large jumps, therefore, cannot be identified as the pop-

ping of a bubble. In contrast, there is clear evidence that "profit—tak-

ing" occurred after a large jump'For a positive jump of 3 yen, for exam-

ple, the results indicate that during the next segment of the day the yen!

dollar rate falls by 0.5 yen. In an efficient market, it is difficult to

rationalize such behavior.

V.      RESPONSES TO ECONOMIC NS ANNOUNCEMENTS

        In   this section, the response of the yen/dollar exchange rate to

announcements of important economic news is examined. Announcements of

the money supply, industrial production, and producers (wholesale, in

Japan) prices are considered for both the U.S. and Japan. Previous

research in this area is extended in at least two ways. First, by con-

sidering foreign exchange trading each day in several segments through-

out the world, competing hypotheses about factors which determine the

exchange rate (critical fundamentals) can be better differentiated.

Second, Japanese announcements are analyzed in parallel with U.S. announce-

ments. Since the exchange rate could be influenced by either economy,

parallel effects from Japanese news announcements might be expected. How-

ever, due to the differences in monetary policy rules, regulations, insti-

tutions, and economic structures, announcement effects may not be symme-

tric between the two countries.

        The usual efficient markets model is used to estimate the response

of the yen/dollar exchange rate to economic news announcements. This

model may be represented as

(5.1)            X(k) =   a(k)   + b1(k) . SA +           .
                                                              EA   +e
                                                  b2(k)
                                                            th
where            X(k) = change in the yen/dollar rate in the k segment

                          after the announcement

                   SA =   surprise   part of the announcement

                   EA = expected part of the announcement.

Under the null hypothesis of market efficiency, both the coefficient on

the expected announced value, b2(k), and the constant should equal zero.

Moreover, if the market incorporates news rapidly, the coefficient on
                                  —18—


the surprise component of the announcement, b1(k), should equal zero in

segments following that of the announcement (k=l,2,...). Alternatively,

if one segment of the market either over—or—under—reacts to news, subse-

quent segments may exhibit significant responses.

       The announcement data are defined in Appendix 1. Expected values

of announcements differ depending on the country. For the U.S., expected

announced values are constructed using the survey compiled by Money Mar-

ket Services, Inc. In general, these survey data exhibit desirable proper-

ties in terms of their conformance with rational expectations (e.g., Pearce

and Roley, 1985). For Japan, a similar survey is not available. As an

alternative, a rolling vector autoregression is used, including money,

industrial production, wholesale prices, and the Gensaki interest rate.

The announcement surprises generated by this model are confirmed to have

means insignificantly different from zero and no significant serial cor-

relation

       A.   Money Announcements

            The estimated response of the yen/dollar exchange rate to

weekly U.S. money announcement surprises is reported in Table 5. The

response is estimated over the entire 1980—85 sample as well as several

subsamples corresponding to possible changes in policy regimes in both

the U.S. and Japan. In all cases, the response is estimated using equa-

tion (5.1) despite the absence of both estimated intercepts and the

effects of expected money in the table. While similar estimates of the

initial response in the New York market (k=0) are reported elsewhere,

the results in Table 5 are obtained both for a more recent sample and

for more highly disaggregated segments within a 24—hour period.
                                  —19—


       The initial response to U.S. money announcement surprises in the

New York market is positive and statistically significant at the 5 per-

cent level for the overall sample and in two of the four subsamples. In

these instances, the response is consistent with the expectation of

higher real interest rates in the U.S., f or example, as the Federal

Reserve attempts to offset a positive money surprise. The estimated

response is not significant at even the 10 percent level in the February

1984 — September 1985 period, corresponding to the adoption of contempor-

aneous reserve requirements by the Federal Reserve. Roley (1985a) finds

that the response of the 3—month Treasury bill yield also is insignifi-

cantly different from zero in the post—February 1984 period. As a con-

sequence, it is not surprising that the response of the yen/dollar exchange

rate is insignificant.

       Similar to the response in the New York market, the response in the

Pacific segment is statistically significant in two subsamples. These

results, which have not been reported previously, indicate that the yen!

dollar exchange rate does not adjust fully by 4:30 P.M. New York time to

the 4:10 P.M. announcement. Instead, a response of almost equal magnitude

is incorporated in the opening Tokyo quote as reflected by the response in

the Pacific segment. U.S. money announcement surprises have no further

effects in the subsequent Tokyo and Europe segments.

       As a whole, these results suggest that U.S. monetary information has

affected the yen/dollar exchange rate significantly. News from U.S. money

announcements also is incorporated within three to four hours following an

announcement. Moreover, constant terms are uniformly insignificant in the

estimated equations, and expected money is statistically significant at the

5 percent level in only one equation. Thus, the results are broadly consist-

ent with market efficiency.
                                   —20—


      If the Bank of Japan operates under the same policy rule as the

Federal Reserve, a symmetric effect to Japanese money announcements would

be expected. However, it is widely suspected that the Bank of Japan does

not emphasize the money supply as its policy target. Thus, Japanese

money announcements may influence the exchange rate differently.

       In contrast to the U.S., money announcements are made monthly in

Japan. In particular, the Bank of Japan announces every month the growth

rate of the money supply for 12 months ending in the month preceding the

announcement. The monthly average of M2 + CD is used for the definition

of money supply.

       The response of the yen/dollar exchange rate to Japanese money

announcement surprises is summarized in the right—hand side of Table 5.

Similar to the estimates for U.S. money announcements, intercepts and the

effects of expected money are insignificant in all but one instance, con-

sistent with efficient markets. A further question of interest is whether

the coefficient on the surprise part of announcement is significant as is

the case for the U.S. As is apparent in the table, a significant response

of the exchange rate after the money announcement is not detected. The

results therefore suggest that money announcements in Japan do not have

any information value for traders about the future course of the economy

or economic policies. Traders must believe that the Bank of Japan does not

respond to any surprise increase or decrease in the money supply (growth

rate). Thus, the money supply is apparently not a primary or intermedi-

ate target of the Bank of Japan.

       B. Industrial Production Announcements

           The unanticipated component of Industrial production announce-

ments could affect exchange rates through at least two channels. First,
                                   —21—


the announcement may embody information about the future course of the

economy. A surprise increase in industrial production, for example, may

indicate that the future growth of the economy will be stronger than pre-

viously expected. In turn, expectations about real interest rates and

capital inflows will be revised upward. As a consequence, the surprise

increase would induce an appreciation of this country's currency. More-

over, the monetary or fiscal authorities may react to the industrial pro-

duction surprise by implementing countercyclical policies. Under these

circumstances, the effect on the exchange rate would be reinforced.

         Second, a surprise increase in industrial production may imply

higher future inflation which should have a depreciating effect on a

country's currency. If traders think this scenario is possible, the

exchange rate should depreciate at the time of the announcement.

         The estimated response of the yen/dollar exchange rate to U.S.

industrial production announcement surprises is exhibited on the left—

hand side of Table        The response again is estimated using equation

(5.1). Because U.S. industrial production announcements were made at

either 8:30 or 9:00 A.M., the segments differ somewhat from those

reported for money announcements. In particular, the initial segment

in the New York market (k=0) is measured from the closing quote in the

Tokyo market to the 12:00 Noon quote in the New York market. The second

segment (k=l) allows for any further response in the New York market

from 12:00 Noon to 4:30 P.M. The other segments are as defined previ-

ously.

         During the segment in which the US, announcement is made, the

estimated response is insignificantly different from zero at the 5 per-

cent level. In the afternoon following the announcement, however, there
                                 —22—


is some evidence that the dollar depreciates in response to a positive

surprise, perhaps reflecting traders' assessments of increased infla-

tion. The estimated response since February 1984 contributes signif i—

cantly to this result. Nevertheless, combining the point estimates for

both segments in the New York market (k0,l), the overall response is

not statistically significant. It is somewhat disconcerting, however,

that the only significant response occurs at least three hours after

the announcement.

       Turning to industrial production announcements in Japan, the esti-

mated response of the yen/dollar exchange rate is reported on the right—

hand side of Table 6. The yen appreciates significantly in response to

positive industrial production surprises in one subsample. This esti-

mated response is consistent with traders' assessments of a stronger

economy and higher real interest rates, which leads to appreciation of

the yen. This behavior appears to be reasonable given the popular belief

in Japan that the economic growth rate is an important policy target. The

expected part of the announcement is uniformly insignificant.

       C. Inflation Announcements

           As was the case for money announcements, these are two main

competing hypotheses concerning the response of exchange rates to a sur-

prise in an inflation announcement.     Suppose that traders believe that

a surprise increase in prices is a signal of future inflation, then it

has a depreciating effect on the exchange rate through Purchasing Power

Parity. Alternatively, if traders think that the central bank will

tighten its policy in response to a surprise price increase, the exchange

rate could appreciate due to higher real interest rates and an increased

inflow of capital.
                                  —23—


       The response of the yen/dollar exchange rate to inflation surprises

is exhibited in Table 7.   Results using producer (wholesale) prices are

reported for both the U.S. and Japan in the table. Movements in producer

prices are generally considered to provide more relevant information

about future inflation than observed movements in consumer prices. The

estimation results as a whole are broadly consistent with the efficient

markets hypothesis, as the expected announced value of producer prices

is significant in only one regression.

       For surprises in U.S. producer prices, which again are announced

at either 8:30 or 9:00 A.M., the response of the yen/dollar rate is sig-

nificant at the 5 percent level in one case. In particular, the response

is significantly positive in the post—February 1984 sample. it is inter-

esting to note that this period is unique in that U.S. industrial pro-

duction surprises also have significant effects, while the response to

U.S. money announcement surprises is insignificant. The results suggest

that both the Federal Reserve and traders shifted their focus away from the

money supply and toward measures of inflation and economic activity.

       For surprises in Japanese producer prices, the response of the

yen/dollar rate is uniformly insignificant at the 5 percent level. This

non—reaction is possible if traders think that the Bank of Japan tries

to target real interest rates and/or the exchange rate. The Bank of

Japan in fact appears to be more sensitive to the level of the exchange

rate than the Federal Reserve. Japanese officials state quite frequ-

ently that they closely monitor the level of the yen in the foreign

exchange market. The lack of response of the yen/dollar rate to money

or inflation announcements therefore appears to be plausible.

VI.      SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

         This paper examined yen/dollar exchange rate movements from a new

perspective. In particular, movements in the yen/dollar rate were

examined in four disaggregated segments within each business day from

1980 through 1985. This disaggregation allowed within—day movements in

New York and Tokyo to be considered separately. In investigating the

behavior of the yen/dollar rate during these segments, several factors

were considered. First, both the volatility of the markets and the con-

tributions of the respective markets in determining longer—run exchange

rate movements were compared. Second, market efficiency was examined

in    terms of the random—walk behavior of very short—run movements in the
yen/dollar rate. The behavior of the exchange rate immediately before
and after large jumps also was investigated. Third, the relative effects
of news from the U.S. and Japan were examined explicitly both with

respect to possible major events behind large jumps and the response of

the yen/dollar rate to particular economic announcements in both coun-

tries.

          The empirical results yielded several conclusions. First, in

terms of the general characteristics of daily yen/dollar movements, the

data indicated that the New York market was typically more volatile,

perhaps reflecting a greater presence of relevant news. Moreover, the

volatility in the Tokyo market has been dramatically decreasing. Also,

in the first half of the 1980s, the dollar tended to appreciate in the

New York market and depreciate in the European market (Tokyo close to

New York opening). In three of the four subperiods considered, the Tokyo

market made   virtually   no contribution to annual yen/dollar rate movements.
                                  —25—


       Second, the random—walk hypothesis could be rejected in most cases.

Moreover, contrary to a related hypothesis also based on efficient markets,

large jumps of three yen or more were followed by significant movements in

the opposite direction, indicating the presence of so—called profit—taking

behavior or overshooting. Large jumps additionally could not be related to

major news items in many cases.

       Finally, among the economic announcements considered, U.S. money

announcement surprises had the most consistent effects, at least prior to

February 1984. Positive surprises were found to result in dollar apprecia-

tion. Other U.S. announcements had effects only in the post—February 1984

period, which could coincide with a change in emphasis by both traders and

policymakers from money to inflation and economic activity. For Japanese

economic announcements, only industrial production announcements in one

subperiod exhibited significant effects on the yen/dollar rate.

       As a whole, the results indicate that the source of the dollar's

strength relative to the yen during the 1980—1984 period eminated from the

New York market. In turn, information related to U.S. monetary policy

appears to be a significant factor. European markets, however, tended to

reverse the longer—run effects originating in New York. The evidence is

nevertheless suggestive that U.S. economic policies and the behavior of the

U.S. economy were largely responsible for the behavior of the yen/dollar

rate over this period.

                             second or third week. (Source: Bank of Japan,

        The base year for WPI and IP changed during the sample period. Announced

values during the old base year samples are deflated by the ratio of the new

series to the old series.

Expected Values

        A rolling vector autoregression model, including M2 + CD, I?, and WPI

and the end of month Gensaki interest rate (3—month repurchase agreement) is

used to create one—step (month) ahead predictions (expected values). The

information set contains a constant and three lagged endogenous values which

are available at the time of prediction. The deviations of expected values

from realized values are confirmed to have zero means and no serial correla-

tion.

1.   For discussions of both the policy anticipations and expected infla-
     tion hypotheses, see Urich and Wachtel (1981), Cornell (1983), and
     Roley and Walsh (1985).

2.   See Ito (1986) for the effect of the December 1980 changes on
     covered interest parity.

3.   The effects of these changes in Federal Reserve policy are considered
     in detail by Roley (l985a). The response of interest rates to money
     announcement surprises is found to change significantly over the dif-
     ferent regimes.

4.   Three more reasons for the volatility differences have been suggested
     to us by the Japanese traders. First, Japanese traders are on salar-
     ies, while U.S. traders are on commissions. This, however, does not
     explain why Japanese volatility has been decreasing. Second, the Tokyo
     market has a higher proportion of "real demands" than the New York mar-
     ket. The buy and sell orders based on real demands, that is leads and
     lags, may occur with the change in the level and be stabilizing, while
     speculative demands could be destabilizing. This explanation is at
     odds with the fact that the volatility has been decreasing since the
     abolition of the "real demand principle" in the forward market. Third,
     traders have self—fulfilling expectations that Tokyo is stable and New
     York is volatile. If the market is thought to be stable, profit—taking
     (and squaring the position) occurs with a small change, and loss—taking
     (and squaring the position) does not occur until the change becomes
     large. Both actions would stabilize the market. This explanation can-
     not, however, account for the changes which occurred over time in both
     of the markets.

5.   This was the first time that the Japanese official discount rate was
     changed in February. Changes in the rate in January or February had
     been avoided because the budget for the next fiscal year is being f or—
     mulated, and the change in the rate would jeopardize the government
     budget calculation.

6.   French and Roll (1984) discuss the use of "per hour" volatility in
     the context of stock prices.

7.   In fact, the variance before the per—hour correction is similar for
     the weekday and weekend segments. The per hour variance of the week-
     end segment is, therefore, about 15 to 20 times less than that of
     the weekday segment.

8.   Since both segments extend about three hours, the comparison is
     immune from a possible bias from per hour correction.
 9.   This test is actually somewhat weaker than that implied by the ran-
      dom walk hypothesis in that the test does not include a = 0.

10.   Observations involving national holidays in each country are deleted,
      but observations spanning weekends are included.

11.   It might be noted that the random walk hypothesis is rejected in the
      Pacific market in the third and fourth subperiods, when the other mar-
      kets become random walks. Combining this with the observation that
      the Pacific market is a random walk over the entire sample period, the
      result is somewhat puzzling. However, the rejection in the Pacific
      market in the fourth subperiod is a result of one particular outlier:
      March 19, 1985, when a large yen appreciation (4.55 yen) in the New
      York market was reversed in the Pacific market (a depreciation of 3.30
      yen). (See Appendix 2.) Without this outlier, the random walk hypo-
      thesis is not rejected in the Pacific market.

12.   The typical size of a predicted change can be calculated from Tables
      1 and 3. Substituting the sample mean or absolute mean (Table 1) for
      the right—hand side variables in each of the equations (3.5) to (3.8),
      and using the estimated b1, b2, and b3. (Table 3), the predicted
      changes can be calculated. The largest predicted change is —.143 for
      equation (3.6) in subperiod 1, using mean absolute changes.

13.   The interest rate differential could be an additional factor in pre-
      dicting exchange rate movements. Under the hypothesis of uncovered
      interest parity, the interest differential predicts the future spot
      rate. See Ito (1984) for the support of uncovered interest parity
      for the case of yen. The three—month dollar—denominated and yen—denomin-
      ated interest rates were most disparate in mid—1981, at 12 percent. At
      a level of 230 yen, which was the case then, the interest differential
      predicts 0.0756 yen appreciation each day, or 0.019 yen per one segment
      of the day. This does not appear to be a large factor in explaining
      the mean absolute change of 0.7 in the second subperiod.

14.   Additional segments also were included in the tests, and the same
      result emerged.

15.   This could also be viewed as evidence of "overshooting" or "overreaction"
      in the market within a day.

16.   Results reported in Tables 5 through 7 are robust with respect to
      several modifications in the data set: a change in lag length, the
      deletion of the Gensaki rate, or the addition of the exchange rate.

17.   For both the U.S. and Japan, surprises in industrial production and
      producer (wholesale) prices are calculated from announced percentage
      changes.

Notes:    Accumulated changes are sums of all observed daily changes in the respective mar-
          kets for the specified period. Because of occasional missing observations due to
          holidays in both countries, accumulated changes for the four markets do not neces-
          sarily add up to the total changes. If one market is closed because of a holiday,
          then not only that market but also the adjacent markets become missing observa-
          tions. For the same reason, the numbers of observations in each segment are dif-
          ferent even for the same subperiod. The number of observations can be calculated
          by dividing the accumulated change by the mean for a particular market for a par-
          ticular sub—period.

Notes:

         Variances divided by the number of hours of the respective market. The
         number of hours for both Europe and Pacific is different from the last
         Sunday in April to the last Sunday in October due to daylight savings
         time in the New York market. (See Appendix 1.) The reported numbers
         are adjusted for the difference due to daylight savings time by taking
         a weighted average, with the weights being the number of observations
         for the summer and winter, respectively.
