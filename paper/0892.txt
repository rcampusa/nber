                      Replacing the U.S. Income
               Tax with a Progressive Consumption Tax:
              A Sequenced General Equilibrium Approach



                              Abstract


     This paper examines the welfare consequences of changing the current
U.S. income tax system to a progressive consumption tax. We compute a
sequence of single period equilibria in which savings decisions depend on
the expected future return to capital. In the presence of existing income
taxes, the U.S. economy is assumed to lie on abalanced growth path. With the
change to a consumption tax, individuals save more and initially consume less.
As the capital stock grows, consumption eventually overtakes that of the
orginal path, and the economy approaches the new balanced growth path with
higher consumption and a greater capital stock. Both the transition and the
balanced growth paths enter our welfare evaluations. We find that the dis-
counted present value of the stream of net gains is approximately $650 billion
in 1973 dollars, just over one percent of the discounted present value of
national income. Larger gains occur if further reform of capital income
taxation accompanies the change. We examine the sensitivity of the results,
both to the design of the consumption tax and to the values of elasticity
and other parameters. The paper also contains estimates of the time required
to adjust from one growth path to the other.

 1. Introduction

      In this paper, a change from the current U.S. income tax to a pro-

 gressive consumption tax is evaluated using a dynamic general equilibrium

model of the U.S. economy and tax system. This model includes endogenous

household savings behavior, where savings in any period depend on the

expected future return to capital. The U.S. economy is assumed to be on

a balanced growth path in the presence of existing income taxes as repre-

sented by 1973 data. The behavior of the economy under a progressive con-

sumption tax is modelled in terms of a sequence of equilibria involving a

transition to a new balanced growth path.

     This sequenced general equilibrium model can be used to shed light on

recent debates in the tax incidence literature. In static equilibrium models

like that of Harberger (1962), plausible parameter values suggest that

capital bears the full burden of capital income taxation. In steady state

models, Feldstein (1974) and Grieson (1975) compare the growth path with a

profits tax to one with a wage tax. They find that labor can be better off

with the wage tax because the higher capital stock increases the gross wage

by more than the tax rate. These opposing results are reconciled by Boadway

(1979), who calculates that considerable time may be required to move from

one path to the other. The switch from a profits tax to a wage tax or consump-

tion tax can be expected to reduce net wages or consumption initially. Depend-

ing on the savings elasticity, the capital stock can eventually grow to the

point where all can be made better off. In at least one of Boadway's examples,

the net wage remained higher under the profits tax for 65 years. Depending

On the discount rate, labor/consumers may or may not prefer elimination of

capital taxation. Bernheim (1981) found considerable sensitivity to savings

parameters and the discount rate, as do we in results below.
                                 —2—

     Our model contains 12 income groups, each endowed with some labor

and capital. In order to measure the relative efficiency of different

tax policies, we compute a dynamic analogue of compensating variatipns

for each household group and sum these to give an aggregate measure.

Since the model incorporates several tax systems and a labor/leisure

choice, the move to a consumption tax is not equivalent to full restora-

tion of Pareto optimality. In spite of second—best considerations, our

results indicate significant gains from such a switch. On an annualized

equivalent basis, these gains are in the region of one percent of

national income. Larger potential annualized equivalent gains accrue

from removing further distortions.

     The next section reviews some of the arguments typically made for the

switch to consumption taxation. Section 3 summarizes our general equilibrium

model, while Section 4 gives special attention to our treatment of endogenous

factor supplies. Specific proposals are converted into model equivalent

form in Section 5, and simulation results are presented in Section 6. A

final section summarizes our conclusions.



2. The Progressive Consumption Tax

     The idea of taxing consumption rather than income has a long history.

it is frequently credited to Mill, but more recent advocates include Fisher

(1942), Kaldor (1957), Feldstein (1978), and Bradford (1980). The efficiency

argument in favor of such a change is that it would remove intertemporal

distortions associated with the income tax. Post—income—tax earnings can be

saved or consumed, but the return to savings is further taxed before consump-

tion can occur in future periods. This double taxation can be removed by

switching to a proportional or progressive tax on labor income only or on all

income with complete deductibility of savings.
                                 —3—

      This double taxation issue is usually explained in terms of a two—

period consumption diagram. The income tax changes the slope of the no-tax

budget constraint, favoring consumption today over consumption tomorrow.

With nonzero substitution, this price change results in a deadweight loss,

but because of offsetting price and income effects it may or may not result

in reduced savings. As recent literature has highlighted, however, the

main problem created by the income tax is not just the deviation from condi-

tions for exchange efficiency as suggested by this two period diagram. Inter—

temporal consumer prices for consumption today and tomorrow also do not equal

intertemporal producer prices. This deviation from conditions for general

efficiency typically causes the economy to be on a growth path where sub—

optimal savings occur.

     If we assume the economy is on a balanced growth path in the presence

of an existing income tax, the initial impact of a switch to a progressive

consumption tax would typically be to increase savings and reduce con-

sumption. When balanced growth is again achieved, the higher savings

result in a capital stock that is higher than under the income tax. The

consumption profile following a switch to a consumption tax would at first

be below that associated with the income tax, but would eventually exceed

it. Initially, instantaneous welfare is reduced, but it grows as the economy

approaches a new balanced growth path with higher consumption. In a model

with no other distortions and with a ccmplete set of contingent coimnodity

markets (or equivalently, perfect foresight), such a change must be welfare

improving since it involves a move to a Pareto optimal allocation. The

time profile for consumption is shown in Figure 1. Levhari and Sheshinski

(1972) discuss similar consumption profiles and provide analytical inter—

temporal welfare measures similar to the type we compute.

   Vertically hashed area represents instantaneous welfare loss.
   Horizontally hashed area represents instantaneous welfare gain.

     Our objective is to evaluate the net gain or loss to the U.S. economy

from making an income—consumption tax switch. The presumption for a net

gain mentioned above does not automatically follow in this model for a

number of reasons, although such a result remains likely. Our model incorpo-

rates other distortions from the tax systein,' the sequenced equilibrium

approach involves myopic expectations rather than perfect foresight,' and,

in the presence of a labor—leisure choice, both income and consumption taxes

are distorting.--" We also use a multi—consumer model which necessitates

aggregating over the separate consumer gains or losses, an important departure

from much of the theoretical work on this issue.

     In addition to interteniporal efficiency, the consumption tax has been

supported on ground of intersectoral efficiency. If all assets are given
                                     —5-.


 the same consumption tax treatment, welfare can be improved through the

 more efficient use of a given capital stock. This argument may favor the

 consumption tax over the current U.S. personal and corporate tax system, but

 not necessarily over a comprehensive income tax at a uniform rate. Thirdly,

 the consumption tax is often supported on the philosophical grounds that

 it is more equitable to taxwithdrawalsfrom the economy in the form of con-

 sumption than it is to tax contributions to the economy in the form of factor

 supplies.

      Finally, the consumption tax has been supported on administrative grounds.

 Because of the difficulty of taxing expenditures of individuals as they occur,

 most proposals have opted for a consumption tax operated as an income tax with

 a savings deduction. The U.S. Treasury's Blueprints for Basic Tax Reform (1977)

 introduces the concept of a "qualified account," with the requirement that

all financial savings which qualify for a tax deduction must feed through

such an account. With a redistributjve tax on all expenditures, the need

no longer arises for separate corporate, capital gains, and wealth transfer

taxes. Interest, dividends, and sales of corporate stock may remain in

the account, untaxed until withdrawn and spent. The tax base is easily

measured since it only includes labor and rental income and withdrawls from

the qualified account.±1 This device has a comparative advantage in an

inflationary economy since it completely avoids the need to define real

income or measure economic depreciation: whatever the income to an account,

the tax is based on nominal withdrawals in the same year. Similarly, the

need to tax inheritances under the Haig—Simons concept disappears,--"
                                                                         although

there remains the issue of whether transfers at death are to be taxed as

consumption.

     While   financial   assets receive a consumption tax treatment through the

"qualified account," other assets receive equivalent treatment through the
                               —6—


"prepayment" approach. Outlays for durables and housing would not qualify

for a tax deduction, but the imputed service stream from these assets

would not appear as taxable expenditure. If the durable's purchase price

equals the present value of imputed net rents, then a tax on the acquisition

price has the same present value as a tax on rents as they accrue. The

model incorporates both types of vehicles, for the existing tax system

as well as for the expanded savings deductions under a progressive con—
            6/
sumption tax.—



3. A General Equilibrium Model of the U.S. Economy: Structure and Data

     In order to investigate the possible impacts of the adoption of a

progressive consumptIon tax, we have used a dynamic numerical general

equilibrium model of the U.S. economy and tax system. In any period of

the equilibrium sequence, savings are endogenously dependent on the expected

future return to capital. Expectations are myopic in the sense that investors

expect current prices to prevail in future periods. Savings result in

increments to the economy—wide capital stock in the next period, and different

sequences of equilibrium prices and quantities are traced out for alternative

policy regimes. Policy appraisal proceeds by comparing the resulting con-

sumption profiles.

     The general equilibrium model stresses the interactive nature of the

price mechanism in jointly determining the behavior of all producers and

consumers in each market of the economy. Such a model is needed to appraise

tax policy changes which are of sufficient magnitude to cause interactive

effects throughout the economy. Since it is not based on differential

calculus, the model can handle a number of large distortions and measure

discrete changes in any number of them without linearity assumptions and

without ignoring income effects. There can be any number of sectors and
                                —7


 agents, and any specification of demand so long as it satisfies Wairas' Law.

     To keep the focus of the paper on results and policy implications,

only a brief overview of ixdel Structure is given hereP' In any single

period, there are 19 producer good industries that use capital and labor in

Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) value—added production functions.

They also use the outputs of other industries through an Input/Output matrix

with fixed coefficients. Tax rates on labor for each industry are derived

by taking payroll taxes as a proportion of labor income, while tax rates

on capital for each industry are derived by taking corporate income and

property taxes as a proportion of capital income. Each of these 19 producer

goods are used directly by government, for export, and for investment goods,

but indirectly for consumption through a fixed—coefficient "Z" matrix of

transition into 15 consumer goods with suitable definitions for consumer

demands. This transition is necessary because the goods classification

of consumer expenditure data is different from the output of the 19 pro-

duction sectors. There are 12 consumer groups, differentiated by income

class, each with an initial endowment of capital and labor. As discussed

below, consumers maximize utility defined over the 15 current consumer goods,

current leisure, and anticipated future consumption. The price of future

consumption depends inversely on the expected rate of return (which equals

the current rate of return). The resulting demand for future consumption is

translated into current desired savings. The latter is, in turn, translated

into a vector of investment demands for the 19 industry outputs.

     Government collects taxes from both the production and demand sides of

the economy and uses the revenue in a balanced budget to purchase producer

goods via Cobb—Douglas demand functions, to make direct transfer payments

to consumers, and to subsidize government enterprises. A simple trade

sector closes the model.
                                    - 8—


       The 1973 data for this model are derived from five major sources

including the July 1976 Survey of Current Business, the Bureau of Economic

Analysis Input—Output matrix, unpublished worksheets of the U.S. Conirnerce

Department's National Income Division, the U.S. Labor Department's 1973

Consumer Expenditure Survey, and the U.S. Treasury Department's Merged Tax

File. Because the data set for this model is so comprehensive, the sources

are necessarily divergent. In order to use all of these data together,

adjustments are made to ensure that each part is consistent with the rest.

All   data   on industry and government uses of factors are taken to be fixed,

while data on consumers' factor incomes and expenditures are correspondingly

adjusted. Tax receipts, transfers, and government endowments are fixed,

and government expenditures are scaled to balance their budget. Similar

adjustments ensure that supply equals demand for all goods and factors.

      The fully consistent data set defines a single period benchmark

equilibrium in transactions terms. Value observations are separated into

prices and quantities by assuming that a physical unit of a good or factor

is the amount that sells for one dollar. All benchmark equilibrium prices

are $1, and observed values are benchmark quantities.

      The equilibrium conditions of the model are then used to determine

behavioral equation parameters consistent with the benchmark data set. This

procedure calibrates the model to the benchmark data in the sense that bench-

mark data can be reproduced as an equilibrium solution to the model before

any policy changes are considered. In order to implement this we specify

exogenous elasticities of substitution between capital and labor in each

industry. We also specify labor supply and savings elasticities to which

substitution elasticities in preferences are calibrated. Factor employ-

ments by industry are used to derive production function weights, and

expenditure data are used to derive utility function weights. This calibra—
                                —9—


tion procedure allows for a test of the solution and ensures that the various

agents behaviors are mutually consistent in our benchmark data before

we evaluate policy changes.

     Through their interaction, utility—maximizing consumers and profit—

maximizing producers are assumed to reach a single period competitive

equilibrium where all profits are zero and supply equals demand for each

good and factor. Starting with data on endowments, tax rates, preferences,

and production parameters, we use Merrill's (1972) algorithm, a revised

version of Scarf's (1973) algorithm, to calculate prices that satisfy these

conditions at each point in time. Single period equilibria are sequenced

through endogenous savings decisions which augment the capital stock of the

economy. An exogenous labor force growth rate is assumed.

     For the benchmark sequence, we calculate a balanced growth path that

begins with our replicated data, has constant prices, and implies quantities

that all grow at the labor force growth rate. We then alter tax parameters

and calculate a revised sequence of equilibria. A higher net return to

capital implies more savings, capital growth, and a transition with an

asymptotic approach to a new balanced growth path. The model assumes no

involuntary unemployment of factors. Markets are perfectly competitive with

no externalities, quantity constraints, or barriers to factor mobility.

Since we compute a complete set of prices and quantities under alternative

tax policies, we can estimate the change in national income, utility or

income changes for each group, and all new factor allocations among industries.



4. The Treatment of Endogenous Factor Supplies

     An aspect of the model which is especially important for the analysis

of the consumption tax is the incorporation of endogenous factor supplies.
                                    — 10



 Consumer decisions regarding factor supplies are made jointly with their

 consumption decisions. Each household at any point in time has a nested

 CES utility function of the form:


                    1   15           1
           u   =             x. ,                                       (1)
                   U{H(.ni          Cj
where H is the instantaneous utility function defined over current consumption

 commodities X. and leisure £, the function U determines the allocation between

 consumption—cum—lejsure and expected future consumption, Cf. Current con-

sumption commodities X. are aggregated using a Cobb—Douglas function, whereas

both U and H are constant elasticity of substitution (CES) functions. Because

of our myopic expectations assumption, the current rate of return and other

current prices are all that are required to formulate a budget in terms of

prices for present and future consumption. Budget-constrained maximization

of U then results in a desired Cf which can be used to Imply current desired

savings.

     In calibrating the model, the parameters of the functions U and H are

determined so as to be consistent with the benchmark data set and to be

consistent with labor supply and savings elasticity estimates from the litera-

ture. Because observed 1973 expenditures and savings differ among the 12

income classes in the model, weighting parameters in the Cobb—Douglas and

CES functions will also differ.

     There is considerable controversy regarding the magnitude of the unconi—

pensated elasticity of saving with respect to the real after—tax rate of

return. For a long time the consensus appeared to favor a zero value for

this elasticity, a proposition that was termed Denison's Law due to Denison

(1958). In more recent work, Boskin (1978) has estimated this elasticity to

be approximately 0.4, although Howrey and Hynians (1980) have re—examined
                                    — 11 —



 Boskin's   estimates and suggest that a value closer to zero would be more

 realistic. On ther other hand, Summers (1981) derives savings elasticities

 between 1.5 and 3.0 by attaching plausible magnitudes to the parameters of

 a life cycle model. We use the 0.4 estimate in our central case, but we

 test the sensitivity of our results to a wide range of elasticity estimates.

      There also exists a number of different estimates for the uncompensated

 elasticity of labor supply with respect to the real net—of—tax wage. A

 consensus finding from Gregg Lewis (1975) is that the uncompensated elasticity

 for working age males lies in the range of —0.1 to —0.2, with a midpoint

 estimate of _0.15.!1 The estimates for labor supply elasticities of females

and older males constrast with these, are on average significantly positive,

and in some cases are larger than one. We assume an identical value for

all income groups in the model, and +0.15 is chosen as an appropriate weighted

average over the econometric estimates for males and females.2' We also

assume a labor endowment equal to 7/4 of the labor supply in the benchmark

equilibrium, reflecting an assumption that 40 hours are typically worked out

of a possible 70—hour week.

     To derive the steady state growth rate for the benchmark equilibrium

sequence, we compare the amount of observed 1973 savings to the capital

stock in the benchmark data set. We then assume that the effective units

of labor grow at the same rate. Though labor endowments grow at this fixed

2.89 percent annual rate in both the benchmark sequence and the simulated

sequence, endogenous demand for leisure implies that actual labor supply

will differ. Though the capital stock grows at the same 2.89 percent rate

in the benchmark sequence, endogenous saving implies that capital in the

simulation will grow at a different rate.

     The 2.89 percent labor growth rate is also assumed equally divided

between Harrod—neutral technical change and population growth. Our welfare
                                — 12 —



measures of tax changes are adjusted to account only for the initial popula-

tion. If total population were included in welfare calculations, the importance

of future periods would be sensitivie to population growth.

     A final important parameter is the real net—of—tax rate of return to

capital in the benchmark data. Since this value is used to calibrate prefer-

ence parameters under the assumption of intertemporal utility maximization,

it also determines the rate of time preference in the benchmark sequence of

equilibria. Following recent literature we use 4 percent for the average

value of this parameter, but each income class receives a net—of—tax return

that depends on its own marginal tax rate. We test other values for sensitivity.



5. Representing Consumption Tax Plans in Model Equivalent Form

    We consider a number of alternative plans for adopting a progressive

consumption tax as the major broadly based U.S. tax source. In order to

evaluate each plan in the model, it must first be represented in model

equivalent form. Each plan is treated as a variation on the existing income

tax, represented as a set of linear tax functions.

    For each of the 12 consumer classes, we have data on the taxes collected

in 1973, the income for that year, and the effective marginal tax rate. With

this information, the tax schedule for each group is modelled as a linear

income tax reflecting both the average and the marginal rate faced by the

group in 1973. This treatment captures the facts that average and marginal

tax rates differ by group, that both are increasing, and that it is the

marginal tax rate which causes the distortionary substitution effects of the

income tax system. One   shortcoming   of our treatment is that consumers do

not move into higher marginal tax brackets if they experience a large increase

in real income. For each consumer class the income tax function is
                                      — 13 —



             T. = B. +   tjTI.)   ,                                       (2)


where r is the marginal tax rate and TI. is the taxable income of the th

 group. The B. intercept is derived such that observed income and observed

marginal    tax rates yield   observed 1973 taxes paid for each group.

        Taxable income TI. in the benchmark is less than }iaig—Simons income

for two major reasons. First, a significant amount of savings flow through

private, state, local, or Federal government pension plans, through Keogh

and Individual Retirement (IRA) Accounts, or through cash value life insurance

policies. These are either taxed on a deferral basis (where both the initial

contribution and the return are sheltered but the payouts are fully taxed)

or on a prepayment basis (where the initial contribution is taxed but the

return and payout are tax—free). It is simple to show that the two methods

are identical except that the tax rate at the time of withdrawal may be

different from the rate at the time of contribution.

        Flow of Funds (1976) data indicate that in recent years approximately

30 percent of savings flow through these vehicles and are thus taxed on

a consumption basis. Our ndel captures the tax—sheltered nature of these

forms of saving by allowing households to deduct 30 percent of savings in

our calculations for the current tax policy.'

        Second, for the existing income tax, different fractions of different

types   of capital income are taxable. Due to    the $100 dividend exclusion,

for example, only 96 percent of dividends are taxed by the personal income

tax. The 50 percent exclusion of nominal realized capital gains in 1973 implied

that 73   percent of real accrued capital gains were effectively fully taxed.

For owner—occupied housing, none of the imputed net return is subject to

tax. These proportions are further explained in Fullerton, King, Shoven,

       According to the Flow of Funds accounts, roughly 20 percent of net
savings are made in the form of net accumulation of owner—occupied housing.

This form of saving receives a consumption tax treatment through the "pre-

payment" approach discussed above. With 20 percent of savings in owner—

occupied housing and an additional 30 percent in tax—deductible savings

vehicles, the current U.S. tax system is roughly halfway between an income

tax and a consumption tax already. Our model captures this complexity in

current U.S. tax law as well as the allocation effects of allowing con—

suniption tax treatments for only some investments.

       Because each industry has different proportions of capital income in

the form of dividends, interest, and capital gains, each has a different propor-

tion of capital income that is taxable by the personal income tax. For

this reason, the personal income tax on the taxable fraction of capital

income is collected at the industrial level at rate t,       the weighted average
household marginal income tax rate. The weights for I are proportional to

capital ownership. These taxes, which we term"perscnal factor taxes' act

as a withholding system and capture the industrial discrimination and

resulting reallocation of resources inherent in the present tax system. On

the consumer side of the model, a tax is paid at rate (r. —       r)   on that amount

of capital income which is fully taxable. That is, the consumer pays additional

taxes or gets a refund depending on whether his marginal tax       rate exceeds or
is   less than r. Thus, actual taxes paid on capital income vary according

to the marginal tax rates of the various groups.

       In   order to incorporate a consumption tax into the model, we begin with
existing values of B. and r. and allow an increased deduction for savings.
The maintenance of the existing B. and t,,     however,   would imply a reduction
in   tax revenues in 1973   under a cor.sumption tax.   Given that government
                                 — 15 —




 purchases and transfer payments play such a major role both in the actual

U.S. economy and in our model, tax effects can only be separated from the

expenditure impacts if real government revenues are maintained. The form

of yield equality we impose is that the time path of government receipts

must be the same for all tax alternatives. We examine three separate

approaches:   (1) imposing lump—sum taxes or transfers on consumers, pro-

portional to initial incomes and effected by changing the zero income

intercept in the linear income tax function for each consumer; (2) raising

all marginal tax rates by adding the same number of percentage points

to each; (3) multiplying all marginal tax rates by an endogenously deter-

mined constant. In eachcase, the scalar is determined so as to generate

sufficient funds for government expenditures.

     The lump—sum case abstracts from the efficiency effects of the replace-

ment tax, and it isolates the effects of the consumption tax change alone.

This may not be realistic, however, since potential replacement taxes are

generally distorting. Additive and multiplicative scaling are more realistic,

but have different effects on the income distribution. Since high income

individuals save more, the consumption tax may have regressive effects

unless the tax rates of high income groups are scaled more.

     In our evaluation of consumption tax alternatives, we have examined

eight different tax modification packages. The features of each of these

are shown in Table 1. Since we model the sheltering of imputed net returns

to housing at the industry level, and since saving in housing amounts to 20

percent of total net saving, a complete move to an expenditure tax would

mean that the remaining 80 percent of net saving should be deductible from

the personal income tax base. Plan 1, labeled consumption tax, raises

the fraction of sheltered savings in the federal personal tax from 30 percent

to   80 percent. This policy could be accomplished by greatly liberalizing

existing Keogh and IRA savings vehicles.

      The second plan involves the integration of corporate and personal

income taxes via the partnership method)' With this plan, the present

system of taxing a fraction of realized nominal capital gains is also

modified so that real gains are fully taxed as they accrue. The third

plan is the consumption tax (80 percent of savings deductible) combined

with corporate tax integration. The fourth plan corresponds most closely

to the theoretical consumption tax in that all income is taxed (including

the imputed income from housing), while all savings are deductible. The

separate corporate income tax is eliminated with this plan. Plan 5

represents a partial movement towards a consumption tax, where the 55

percent savings deduction represents a point halfway between the current

deduction of 30 percent and the Plan 1 deduction of 80 percent. In Plan

6, all savings are deductible, but the existing preference on income from

housing and the corporate income tax are retained. Plans 7 and 8 investi-

gate whether the present U.S. system, a hybrid of an income tax and a

consumption tax, is better or worse than a pure income tax. A pure

income tax would remove the special treatment of capital gains, tax the

imputed income to owner—occupants, and eliminate shelters offered by

pension funds and other retirement savings vehicles. While savings would

be taxed more heavily, much of the inter—industry distortion of the present

tax system would be eliminated. In Plan 7, a pure income tax replaces the

existing income tax. Plan 8 goes further and also removes the corporate

income tax.

6.   Results

      For each of the tax alternatives the new sequence of equilibria has

been computed. For each of the 12 consumer classes we have calculated the

present values of their compensating variations over time using individual

discount rates which are based on the model's 14 percent average after—tax

rate of return to capital in 1973. These welfare estimates are to be

interpreted as the income change in 1973 dollars which would permit that

group to obtain the same pattern of instantaneous utility over time under

the new tax regime as under the o1d)-" Strictly speaking, a welfare

improving change produces a negative compensating variation. However, we

adopt the sign convention that a positive entry indicates a welfare improv-

ing change and a negative entry a welfare reducing change. The instantaneous

utility derives from current consumption and leisure, excludes expected

future consumption from savings of that period, and corresponds to H of

equation (1). This procedure avoids double counting when the next periods

current consumption is added. The individual results are summed over the

12 groups and are presented in Table 2.

     The consumption tax (Plan 1) involves an efficiency gain of $686

billion if the revenue shortfall caused by the additional saving deductions

is made up using the lump—sum income tax intercepts. The gain is reduced

to $621 billion if marginal tax rates are increased in a multiplicative

manner and to $636 billion if an additive surtax is applied to the marginal

rates. Some of the potential efficiency gain is lost because of the distort-

ing effects of the higher marginal rates with multiplicative and additive

scaling." The figures in parentheses in Table 2 give the efficiency gain

of each of our plans as a fraction of the present value of future expanded

national income (estimated at 50 trillion). This includes current consump-

tion and leisure valued at the net of tax wage, and it corresponds to the

dollars   needed for instantaneous utility H. The gain under Plan 1 with

the lump—sum adjustments for revenue replacement is 1.4 percent of the

present discounted value of the future national income (including the value

of leisure). Since high income groups have the largest savings deductions,

multiplicative scaling might be preferred on equity grounds. However,

efficiency gains for multiplicative scaling are typically smaller than

those for additive scaling. The welfare costs of labor/leisure distortions

depend on the square of the marginal tax rate, and multiplicative scaling

adds more to the already high rates of high income consumers.

     Results regarding corporate income tax integration are presented for

Plan 2 in Table 2. With a lump—sum replacement the windfall gain for the

economy is larger than that of the move to a consumption tax, but with the

alternative replacements the gain is smaller. Our estimates indicate that

the present value of the gain is $732 billion with lump—sum replacement taxes

and $399 billion with multiplicative increases in marginal rates. The third

plan combines the features of 1 and 2, and our estimates suggest that the

efficiency improvement is approximately additive. The combined tax changes

were advocated in Blueprints and offer a present value efficiency gain of $1

trillion or more.

     Since 80 percent of total savings are deductible and 20 percent of total

savings flow into tax favored housing, these plans capture the intertemporal

effects of a full consumption tax. However, since any savings can be used

for housing, these plans leave an intersectoral distortion in favor of

owner —occupancy.   To capture the equivalence of the prepayment and post—

payment approaches, plan four allows full deductibility of savings and

eliminates the preference for housing. Gains are larger, as expected. The

efficiency gain of Plan 4 relative to the current tax system is roughly

$1.5 trillion with lump—sum revenue replacement, $1350 billion with multi—
                                      21 —




 plicative    marginal rate surcharges, and $1390 billion with additive marginal

 rate surcharges.

      Plan 5, a move halfway from the current deduction of 30 percent to the

 Plan 1 deduction of 80 percent, would result in efficiency gains roughly

 half those of Plan 1. Plan 6 exempts all saving from taxation, leaves the

 housing preference unchanged, and results in a personal income tax subsidy

 to saving. However, since this subsidy offsets the corporate income tax

which is left in place, total efficiency is enhanced relative to Plan 1.

     The results from Plans 7 and 8 indicate that the U.S. could move to a

pure income tax and integrate the corporate tax with no loss in efficiency,

but that a pure income tax alone would lose efficiency. For Plan 7, the

tax base is increased since imputed income from housing is included and

existing savings deductions are eliminated. Thus, the rate structure can

be lowered rather than raised in order to maintain government revenues.

Results for Plan 7 show that moving to a pure income tax alone involves an

efficiency loss of $579 billion if marginal tax rates are not lowered. This

is primarily because the intertemporal distortions of the current system

are made worse. However, if the marginal rates are reduced, the efficiency

loss to the economy is lowered to roughly $47T billion. The improvement in

the inter—industry allocation of capital (resulting primarily from the taxa-

tion of the return to owner—occupied housing) tends to offset the deterioration

in the interteinporal efficiency (now reduced by the marginal rate adjustments).

Plan 8 is a comprehensive single level income tax plan involving corporate tax

integration as well. Such a tax system lowers revenues and thus necessitates

a rate hike to maintain the yield. When the rates are adjusted either multi—

plicatively or additively, the net efficiency impact of the package is

negligible.

     Our model identifies 12 household groups and includes the capability

of analyzing welfare impacts by household. In Table 3 we present welfare

impacts by household for Plan 1 (80% savings deduction). These results

need careful interpretation since we do not explicitly model life cycle

behavior. One can think of each household as an income group which at

each point in time contains several individuals at differing stages of

their life cycle. Any one individual could move among income ranges over

his or her lifetime.-'

     Results by income range indicate that welfare impacts depend again on

the tax replacement. All estimates are expressed in terms of percentage

gains from the base sequence income of the group. The most regressive

pattern is given by the replacement with lump—sum taxes proportional to

base sequence incomes. Multiplicative and additive replacements yield larger

gains to low income groups since the replacement taxes impact more heavily

on those with high incomes. An interesting feature of these results is

that all three cases involve a Pareto improvement in the sense that all

household groups gain.

     To test the robustness of our results for Plan 1, we have performed

some sensitivity analysis with respect to two key parameters. These results

are reported in Table 4. The efficiency gain numbers for Plan 1 (consumption

tax) are shown for three different savings elasticity values and for three

different assumptions on the exogenous real return to capital in our bench—

mark data. The latter implies a different value for the rate of time pre-

ference of each group.

     In addition to the +0.4 savings elasticity used above, we have run

our simulations with savings elasticities of 0.0 and 2.0. The former is

consistent with 'tDenison's Law" (1958) and with the Howrey and Hytnans (1980)

 recalculation   of Boskin's estimate, while the latter is roughly comparable

 to numbers suggested by Summers (1981) as possible short—run impact savings

elasticities. The results of Table 4 indicate that the efficiency gain

increases with the savings elasticity. The results for the high elasticity

are consistent with the high range of Summers' results on welfare impacts of

intertemporal tax distortions. With an additive marginal tax surcharge, we

find that the welfare gain is $438 billion with a savings elasticity of

0.0, while it is $636 billion or $1279 billion if that parameter is 0.4 or

2.0 respectively. An interesting aspect of the results of Table 4 is that

the efficiency gain is not sensitive to the replacement tax for the case

with the saving elasticity set at 2.0. The reason is that while the move-

ment to a consumption tax initially necessitates rate increases, the high

saving elasticity implies that the economy grows sufficiently more rapidly

with a consumption tax to actually permit a lower rate structure in future

years.

     Table 4 indicates greater sensitivity of results with respect to varia-

tions in the exogenously specified real net of tax rate of return to capital

in the base sequence. As previously mentioned, we specify this value as 0.04.

In the calibration of utility function parameters to the benchmark data set,

this value becomes the rate of time preference in the base sequence. Since

initial consumption losses are followed by consumption gains, it should not

be surprising that the rate of time preference is a key parameter. The

same finding appears in Summers (1981), whose large welfare impacts are

in part due to his choice of a low discount rate. Varying the implicit

discount rate between 3 percent and 5 percent changes the size of the per-

centage welfare gain by a factor of approximately two. The size of base

sequence income also changes between these cases, complicating a comparison

of absolute magnitudes.

      Table 5 provides information on how long the economy takes to resettle

 into a steady state growth path after a tax change occurs. Once the economy

has completely adjusted to the new policy regime, all relative prices will

again remain constant. In the case of consumption tax proposals, the new

steady state is characterized by a higher capital intensity and a lower

relative return to capital. The results of Table 5 indicate that, for the

cases with a 0.4 savings elasticity, roughly 40 percent of the adjustment is

completed after 10 years, and 80 percent is completed after 30 years. The

economy then asymptotically approaches the new steady state growth path as

in Figure 1 above. The transition is accomplished much more rapidly with

a savings elasticity of 2.0, despite the fact that the total adjustment is

larger. Adjustments in capital/labor ratios proceed in patterns similar to

the adjustments in Table 5 price ratios.

     There is a high variance of previous literature estimates on the length

of the long run. Sato (1963) and Atkinson (1969) find the adjustment to

be extremely long (greater than 100 years), while Summers (1981) and Hall

(1968) find it to be surprisingly short (around 5 years). It is difficult to

completely reconcile these various findings, but it is clear that a prime deter—

xninant is the strength of substitution effects in the model used for the

analysis.



8. Conclusion

     In this paper we have reported results from an analysis of a possible

switch from the existing U.S. income tax to a progressive consumption tax.

We used a dynamic general equilibrium model of the U.S. economy and tax

system. Results indicate that sheltering more savings from the current U.S.

income tax could improve economic efficiency even if the necessary marginal

tax rate adjustments are made in order to maintain government revenue. Using

our   central specification, the present value of welfare gains for a complete

savings deduction from the personal income tax is around $650 billion in

1973 dollars. We find that a combined policy of tax integration and savings

deduction offers the largest welfare improvement with the present value

figure lying between $1 and $1.5 trillion, even when other tax rates are

adjusted to maintain government revenue. On an annualized equivalent basis,

the latter figures are in the region of 2—3 percent of national income.

      Results emphasize that while only half of net savings are currently

taxed in the U.S., this system leaves room for significant improvements. The

reason is that only certain savings vehicles are tax sheltered, particularly

owner—occupied housing. The intertemporal efficiency gain is offset by the

distortions created in the inter—industry allocation of capital.

      Additional analyses with the model indicate considerable sensitivity to

the elasticity of savings with respect to the real after—tax rate of return.

Further efforts to narrow the profession's consensus on the value of this

elasticity would clearly aid policy evaluation. We also find sensitivity with

respect to the implicit rate of time preference in the model.

 1.   In fact, several elements interlink in creating a number of sources of
      intertemporal inefficiency in the U.S. tax system. The income tax
      embodies the double taxation feature mentioned above, but it is both
      amplified in some directions and offset in others. Since nominal rather
      than real returns to capital are taxed, inflation raises the effective
      tax rate on the real return to capital under. the income tax. In
      addition, income from capital is subject to the corporate income tax
      and local property tax. On the other hand, a number of tax features
      reduce effective tax rates on capital income. Savings which are
      sheltered through pension funds yield tax—free capital income, as
      does owner occupied housing. Both of these cases imply single rather
      than double taxation of income to capital. All of these features
       appear in our general equilibrium model.

2.    Investors use current prices and returns as expected future prices and
      returns. These expectations turn out to be correct on a balanced growth
      path, but not in the transition between growth paths. An interesting
      result is that tax distortions may compensate for the myopia in
      expectations. If capital deepening occurs so that the future return to
      capital falls, a consumption tax can result in "too much" savings under
      myopic expectations. It is possible in this case that an income tax
      can partially or fully offset the myopia in expectations through double
      taxation of savings. In the results which follow, we do not believe
      this effect to be quantitatively significant.

3.    Due to the nontaxation of leisure, an income tax can be more efficient
      than a consumption tax if leisure and future consumption are complements.
      Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976) note that if preferences are separable
      into consumption and leisure, optimal taxation suggests a consumption
      tax rather than an income tax. A feature of the present model which
      complicates this result is the redistribution among households which
      accompanies the tax change. The presumption that a consumption tax
      will be prefereed to an income tax even in the presence of a labor—
      leisure distortion nonetheless carries over to the present model since
      the underlying structure is so similar to that used by Atkinson and
      Stiglitz.

4.    The qualified account is similar to a Keogh or Individual Retirement
      Account, but with no ceilings and no constraints other than the taxation
      of withdrawals. The Blueprints proposal would also eliminate medical,
      charitable, and state and local tax deductions. It would include social
      security benefits as income and it would eliminate the standard deduction.
      The rate structure would include only three brackets with a top marginal
      rate of 40 percent, designed to preserve revenue in 1976. It is esti-
      mated that the tax base would be 23 percent more than under the current
      income tax, but 7 percent less than under a comprehensive income tax
      (without the savings deduction). While we have not captured base—
      broadening features of the Blueprints proposal, we have used the con-
      cept of an income tax with deduction for savings.

5.   There is in fact some disagreement on this point. A strict Haig—
     Simons definition of income as consumption plus change in net worth
     would tax inheritances and gifts received while giving a deduction
     to the donor (or his estate in the settlement of final year taxes).
     The Carter Commission (1966), however, advocated taxing inheritances
     with no deduction.

6.   Though the consumption tax itself may be easy to administer, the
     transition to a consumption tax may be difficult. When first enacted,
     for example, the qualified account might be used not just for new
     savings but for the transfer of existing savings. In any case, our
     model does not include any of these administrative costs.

7.   A more detailed presentation of an earlier single period version of
     this model appears in Fullerton, Shoven, and Whally (1978), and
     further discussion of the dynamic version used in the present paper
     appears in Fullerton, King, Shoven, and Whalley (1981).

8.   A similar conclusion is also suggested by Stern (1976).

9.   We recognize the biases introducted by using a single aggregate
     elasticity, but the current model cannot accept parameter differences
     based on age or sex. It could accept different elasticity parameters
     for each of our income groups, but these are not readily available.

10. Because each vehicle has a different ceiling on the contributions which
     can be deducted each year, and because of nonconstant savings propensities,
     the proportion of marginal savings which are deductible may not be the
     same as the average proportion of savings deducted. Later simulations
     of tax plans with different deductible proportions provide results which
     are similar in nature to those that v.'ould be obtained with different
     porportions deductible in the benchmark.

11. See Fullerton, King, Shoven, and Whalley (1981) for detials of this plan.

12. If we had a complete life—cycle utility function of the form
     U = U(H ... 11T) with the possibility of substitution among H in
     different periods, then compensation sufficient to reach the old U
     could be less than compensation required to reach the old pattern of
     H.   Our equation (1) for U is not of this form, but allows simple
     calculation of savings and instantaneous utility H from current prices
     in each period of the sequence. Our welfare measure may be biased for
     this reason.

13. The distorting effect on intertemporal choices is affected to varying
     degrees by these tax replacements but is entirely eliminated in the
     pure consumption tax example. Distorting effects on labor/leisure
     choices remain and are further affected by raising marginal rates.

14. A further problem is that the highest income group saves a high
     proporation of income in the 1973 data, while the lowest income group
     actually dissaves. If we allowed each group to retain its own
     savings, then the rich would get richer and the poor would get poorer.
     In fact, of course, high income individuals often retire to a lower
     income bracket and take their wealth with them. To approximate this
                          - F3   -



movement of wealth and to insure balanced growth in the benchmark
sequence, the model takes total savings at the end of any period
and reallocates it in proportion to the capital holdings of each
group. This reallocation of wealth detracts from the confidence
we place in the model's distributional results.
