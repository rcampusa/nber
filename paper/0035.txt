                              I. Introduction

Inflation has been stronger in the United States since World War II

than in any other three consecutive decades of the nation's history.

Prices have declined less than they used to in periods of business

recession, and the declines have offset less of the increases dur-

ing business expansions even though the latter have also diminished.

This change in cyclical behavior lies at the heart of the 'inflation

problem" as it has been discussed in recent years. The present

study   examines   the recession behavior of wholesale prices since World

War II and compares it with the 1920s as the most recent period of

earlier recessions with     comparable severity. The focus is on changes
in   recession behavior, possible bias in the data, and differences

in behavior between various groups of wholesale prices. (Differences

between wholesale and consumer prices, though of importance,            are

not examined here.) The purpose is to extend the evidence on the

degree and uniformity of the chang in price behavior and to test

various interpretations of those changes.

The   eduction   of Cyclical Arnplitude in Agratc Frice Indexes

      Table    1 reports the cyclical behavior of the ureau of Labor

Statistics index of all wholesale prices and all items excluding

farm products and processed foods. In the four business recessions

following     1949 the aggregate index did not decline and in           the   last
three it     even rose. In previous recessions this index had failed

to decline only twice (in 1900 and the short after-war recession in
         1
1945).       In 1951 and 1970 it   even rose faster in the recessions
than in the preceding expansions, a perverse cyclical behavior which

it never exhibited before. Results            for   all items excluding foods

    The BI indexbegins in 1890.     The Warren-Pearson index of
  wholesale prices covering 185/t to 1890 (not shown) rose in the
  final two (1887 and 1890) of the seven recessions in that period.

show an even sharner break in the         1950s from the       past.   While this
index declined     in all recessions since          1891   except 1945 and 1970,
the declines were much less in the four following 1949. The decline

relative to the exransion rate has diminished steadily since l9'),

culminating in 1970 with the perverse cyclical behavior of the re-

cession rate exceeding the expansion rate. Such perversity occurred

only once before in 1894 for this index. The rate of change of the ag-
gregate index is graphed in Chart 1.
     Appendix Table A shows the cyclical behavior of three major
subgroups of wholesale prices available since 19l, basic materials,

intermediate     goods, and finished goods. A sharp decline in cyclical

amplitude occurs for all three subgroups in the recessions following

1919,    demonstrating   that it cannot be attributed to a reduced impor-

tance in the aggregate index       of   the more volatile prices of        basic ma-

terials.
     The exransion rates have also declined, thouqh not uniformly.
some C)aflS.iOflS in the 1920s and earlier had rates of price change
as low or below those of some postwar cycles. Although it was not
unusual in the 192-Os and earlier for the expansion rates to be low,
it was rare for the recession rate not to drop appreciably below
zero. It is true that the cycles in business activity have been
milder   on   the   average since World War II than formerly, but a

change in behavior of rices is strikingly apparent even after al-

lowing for differeres in the cyclical amplitude of business activ-

ity. A pairing of two        mild   recessions in the 1950s with two   in the
192-Os at the bottom      of Table 1 still shows that the ].ater price

swings   were considerably smaller, though       less so for expansion rates
alone. Although expansion rates have moved down at          the same time

that   recession rates have moved up toward and past zero,       recession

rates have moved farther.
     The present study is generally concerned with the response of
prices    to recessions, but the main emphasis is on recession rates

relative to the preceding expansion rates, which is equivalent to

an analysis of the overall cyclical amplitude         of rates of price
change.

Pc s s ib le Bias thAgeat e Indexes
       Although     the implications of the decline in measured pr cc

changes    have been widely discussed, its statistical basis deserves

re-examination. Because we want to distinguish broad changes in

market behavior from changes in statistical composition of the            data,
there    are several difficulties in relying exclusively on the aggre-

gate indexes. They are disproportionatel' influenced by certa in
                                              _/t_

                         product   groups, and the composition and weighting have

shifted over time toward the less volatile prices of manufactured goods.

Although      the index for finished goods in Table .A            shows   the same change
in cyclical behavior as that for basic materials and                    intermediate   goods,
the composition of each of these subindexes has                  also   shifted over time;
          the substitution of new           series     for old and   increases in the total

number   have given more weight to the highly fabricated products which
characteristically exhibit less price fluctuation. A 1952 revision of
the   index reduced the recession rate of decline for intermediate and
finished goods, though not for basic materials, as is shown by the over-
lap in Table A
        A study by McAllister2                     found that an increase in the index

from 550 to 784 items in 1931 produced an average reduction in amplitude

of 15 per cent for cyclical movements in the period of overlap, 1926-31.

For an increase from about 900 to 1900 items in 1952, the average reduc-

tion in amplitude was 21 per cent for the period of overlap, 1947—51.

These amplitudes are based on cyclical highs and lows in the index rather

                                            -
         McAllister's    tables indicate that nearly all the reduction after

   the first revision was due to the reduced amplitude of the finished goods

   index. For the later revision, the 1945-49 overlap in Table A shows that

   all the reduction occurred in the components for intermediate and finished

   goods; the amplitude of the materials component actually rose. These re-

   ductions likely reflect the addition of less volatile prices. Simply

   adding more items, once the number already exceeds a few hundred, would

   not reduce the amplitude much further.

               This can be shown as follows. Suppose an index Z is composed
      of n prices (xi), all with the same weight and variance2 and a correlation
coefficient  R with each other. (This example abstracts from changes in
      the weighting and variance of new items and concentrates on changes
      in number of items only.)

       For large n, this approaches i       from above. Hence the variance of the
       index will not under these assumptions decline much for increases in
      n beyond a moderate size.


          McAllister    also examined the number of reporters per individual
    price series, which has generally increased. The use of more reports
    for each series increases the probability of catching and recording small
    changes in market prices, but averaging tends to smooth the movements
     in individual price quotations. The effect on cyclical amplitude,
     however,     is probably. minor.
     To avoid the problem of changing   coverage   and   weighting,   the present

study analyzes frequency distributions of price changes for the same

products. Section II presents distributions of subindexes of wholesale

prices for which the converage of products has continued from the 1920s

to 1970 without major change. They make up most of the aggregate index

in the 1920s but only half by weight in the 1960s. These subindexes

allow us to compare the behavior of the same prices in the two mild re-

cessions of the 1920s with the five after World War II. (The dates are

those shown in Table 1.,) The 1930s and World War II are omitted as
not being comparable with the mild postwar cycles. Section III
analyzes frequency distributions of the prices of 1100                 individual

products which have no gaps or major changes in specification from

 1947 to 1970. Section IV utilizes the Stigler-Kindahl data on pri-

 ces collected from buyers in order to determine whether and to what

 extent BLS reports fTom sellers are biased. These sections are de-

 signed to identify and circumvent possible bias in the cyclical be-

 havior of the aggregate indexes.


 Possible Explanations of the Reduction in Cyclical Amrlitude

      As a first step toward explanation of the changes in price be-

 havior, Section V analyzes prices according to three characteris-

 tics of products and markets: the degree of processing and durabil-

 ity of products, the fraction of value added in production, and the

 market concentration of firms. These three were chosen because they

 are relevant to various theories of price behavior and also because

 the necessary data are available. Durable products are held in

 inventory, high value added reflects a preponderance of wage costs,

 and high market concentration can lead to tacit collusion on pricing.

 All of these are thought to make prices less subject to shifts in
                                        -7-


demand and less volatile. It is conceivable that the effects on

prices of high wage costs and concentration have intensified over

the postwar period to produce the observed attenuation in price

responses. A grouping of prices by the degree to which they are

subject to each of these characteristics helps to determine the

importance of these influences.

       Section VI summarizes and interprets the findings.

              Comparison of Post-World War II with the 1920s

Does the long-run decline in cyclical amplitude from the l920s to

post-World War II pertain to xmst of the individual price series

or is it largely a reflection of changes in the composition of the

aggregate indexes? It is desirable to examine indexes which have

had little change in coverage. Price series from the l920s to 1970

are available without breaks for only a small number of individual

products, but many continuous series exist for groups of essentially

the same closely related products. There are 48 major component

series of the wholesale price index which are available from 1926

to    1970, and 44    of   these can be extended back to 1923.         The 48
series make   up 93   per cent by weight of the 1926 aggregate index though

only 50 per cent of the 1970 index. (The 44 series make up 92 per cent

of the 1924 index.) These are mostly the second-level price indexes in

BLS   coding which are just below the first level of industry aggregates,
though some available third-level series were substituted where the cor-

responding second-level index began too late and         did   not cover the full

period. The 48 series are identified in Appendix Table B. The components

and   internal weighting of these series have changed over the years, of
course, but the products covered by          them have remained largely the same
except perhaps for a few         of   the more hiqhly fabricated manufactures.
These series necessarily exclude groups which have undergone major

1920s such as most       chemicals and electrical equipment. Manufactured

goods    are represented where the product group has     remained essentially
        in    functional purpose,
the saineAsuch as automobiles, household furniture,                and footwear,

though    the specifications of their individual components have changed

over time.      These   changes in specification do not greatly affect the

rates of price change within a single      business cycle, but over a longer
period   such changes may reflect developments in the product which alter

price behavior. So far as these series are concerned, such developments

cannot be distinguished from the changes in coverage which accompany

them. Nevertheless, these 48 series, though of restricted importance in

the later period, avoid much of the composition and weighting bias of the

aggregate index. (The coverage of Section III, which deals with individual

product prices, was feasible only for the post—World War II cycles.)

        To determine the range and pattern of price changes among these

series, we may plot frequency distributions rather than construct an

aggregate index. The average level of each series was calculated for the

three months surrounding the peaks and troughs of seven National Bureau

reference     cycles, the two mild ones in the   l920s and   the   five since

World   War II. The rate of change (compounded continuously) from peak to
trough of each cycle was calculated for every series. These series have

         This rate differs from the total percentage change , of course,

 not been seasonally adjusted, which produces distortion mainly for

 the highly seasonal farm prices in recessions of different length

 than 12 months (all but 1970). All the rates for each recession

      were classified as being   in    one of 14 intervals from .-20 to +10

      was made the beginning of the first positive interval in order to

      distinguish price declines from no change. (The plotted frequencies
      are the percentage of rates up to but not including the rates shown
                                                on the horizontal axis.
      Recession Rates

           Chart 2 presents cumulative frequency distributions of the

      percentage of rates in each interval for the seven recessions.

     The chart shows that the distributions shift in successive cycles

      toward smaller negative and larger positive rates of change, except

      the distribution for 1949 which lies to the left of most of the

      1927 distribution and of the upper half of the 1924 distribution.

      In the 1949 recession,prices declined from the inflated levels carried over

from wartime, so that this episode may not represent typical peacetime
     behavior.

           The distributions for 1927, 1949, and 1970 have similar shapes and

      differ mainly in horizontal position; the entire distributions shift

      fairly uniformly to the right for successive recessions. Compared with

      these three, the variability of price changes is much greater for 1924

      and much less for the three recessions from 1954 to 1961. The latter

      three are much steeper than the others in the middle range around a zero

      rate. Their steepness reflects not only a low variability but also a bunch-

      ing at low positive rates: Compared with the curve for 1927 and particu-

      larly 1924, these three are deficient in the number of price declines

      relative to increases, though declines are by means uncommon and represent

      for these three from 41 to 52 per cent of the total number.

           The successive rightward shifts of the distributions except for          S
      1949 are summarized by various measures of the average price change in

Table 2. The two constant-weight mean rates differ from the rate of change

of the aggregate index in the last column, reproduced here from Table 1,

not only in coverage but also in the method of calculation. Here the

rates of change of each component are averaged, whereas for the aggregate

index the rate of change is calculated after the levels of the component

series have been averaged.

     These measures of price response rank the recessions generally

in the same order, but the use of weights and changes in the weights

do lead to some sizable differences. For the last three recessions

in particular, the weighted indexes reduce the rightward shifts shown

by the unweighted mean and median. The weighted indexes            rank

the 1958 and 1961 recessions out of chronological order, while the

median and unweighted mean show progressive rightward shifts in

the postwar distributions..6 The weights place more importance on


     6The 192i distribution, which in Table 2 has the largest mean
  rate of decline except for 1949, appears to be representative of
  earlier recessions back to the early 1890s in both the mean and
  variability of the rates of change. This observation is based
  on the distributions of specific cycles in over 100 wholesale
  price series. See Frederick C. Mills, The Behavior of Prices,
  NBER, 1927, Table 139, p. 42l



prices which rose more in 1958. This is examined further in Section

V below. The weighted indexes are generally preferable as indica-

tors of aggregate behavior, but they canemphasize developments in

a relatively small number of markets in which the value of shipments

is very large.

 Recession minus Expansion Rates

         Insofar   as rates of   price change   respond   to business recessions grad-

ually rather than abruptly, the recession rates minus            the   preceding ex-

pansion   rates (both on an annual basis) will be more indicative of that
effect than the recession rates alone. Since rates of price change in
expansions   vary considerably, the shape as well as the mean of the dis-

tribution is affected. To determine how much, the expansion rates for

each series were calculated for the sevencycles and subtracted from the

corresponding      recession rates. The expansions        ran from   the trough to the
peak of the reference cycles, modified for four of           the cycles: Calendar-

year averages were used for       the beginning of the two expansions in 1921
and   1924 instead of the three months surrounding the troughs because not

all the needed monthly data have been published. (The use of annual aver-
                                        the
ages reduces the magnitude and probably/variability of the expansion rates.)

The first expansion after World War II was shortened to run from February

1947 to November 1948 to conform to the period used later in Section III

where data before 1947 are not available. And the last expansion was

started in December 1965 instead of the 1961 trough, because the inflationary

second half of this unusually long phase seemed more appropriate here than

the full period. Except for the two truncated phases, the difference

between recession and expansion rates is equivalent to a measure of

total cyclical amplitude.

        The cumulative frequencies of the change in rates of price

change from expansion to recession are presented in Chart 3 for the
seven   cycles. Four of the subindexes are not available before 1926,
so   the 1924 and 1927 distributions comprise only 4 series. All
seven distributions lie further to the left than their mates in
                             -12-

Chart   2 for recession rates alone, because expansion rates are

typically positive and the subtraction moves the recession rates

in a negative direction. The distributions in Chart 3 are also

generally flatter, indicating greater variability among the com-

ponents; as a result they are less steep around zero.

     The post-World War II distributions shift successively to the
                                          by
right, as can be seenparticularly/the medians and percentages of

declining series.                                                              -



              These shifts, which are more prominent here than in

Chart 2, are not a mechanical result of the method of computation.

There is no arithmetical reason for the change in rates of change

in successive recessions to be higher or lower than previously,

even if the rates had an upward trend, which was true only of the

1960s. These recession-minus-expansion rates are a way of allowing

for trends in prices and focusing on recession deviations from

trend. Thus recession responses have attenuated, even allowing for

rising price trends. The progressively higher level of the rates
                        later
of price change in the / recessions shown in Chart 2 reflects both

    ratecarried over from the preceding expansion and the pro-

gressively smaller decline in recession rates relative to, expansion

rates.


                                    III
                    Changes Since World War II

The subindexes used above are adequate to demonstrate a decline in

anplitude and variability of price responses since the 1920s. Those

data lack breadth of coverage and         precision,   however. Since   they
are subject as was noted to internal changes in weighting, which are

generally minor, but also to changes in components, which may often
                            —13-


 be important, composition bias was not absent. We may obtain a more

 precise picture of changes in cyclical behavior since World War II

 by confining the analysis to individual product prices (the fifth

 level of the BLS code). Although few of the individual price series

 comprising the wholesale price index span the period from the l920s

 to 1970, 1106 run from 1947 to 1970, and an additional 32 series

 ver all but the 1970 recession. These 1100-odd price series are

 all that the BLS publishes which have no break and pertain to the

 same product over the period, though even these undergo minor changes

 from time to time in the specification of products which cannot be

 avoided. The coverage by industry is shown in Appendix Table C.


 Magnitude of Price Responses

      The cumulative frequency distributions of the recession rates

 of these 1138 series ( 32 fewer series in the 1970 distribution1
k -
 inakelitt1e   difference) are presented in Chart 4. As before the

 series have not been seasonally adjusted. These distributions are

 broadly the same in shape and position as those in Chart 2, but al-

 so are smoother and provide a sharper picture of differences between

 the recessions. Chart 4 differs from Chart 2 mainly in the center

 segment of the distributions, which is steeper here -- showing less

 variability -- because of the inclusion of many more of the less vol-

 atile prices of manufactured goods. The middle three distributions

 for 1954, 1958, and 1961, which are very close together, are steeper

 around zero than the other two, suggesting a downward rigidity of

 prices in which the rates bunch at low positive rates (mainly zero).

 This bunching reduces the number of declining series in these three

 recessions to a1tst 30 percent; this is discussed further in Sec-

 tion IV.

     The bunching at zero partly obscures the relative position of

the distributions, though they clearly shift rightward from re-

cession to recessions As was done for Chart 3, we may eliminate

most of the zero bunching and obtain more distinctive distributions

by taking the differences between the recession and expansion rates.

This is presented in Chart 5 for the same 1100-odd series covered by

Chart 4. The expansions run from the trough to the peak with the

exceptions previously used for the first and last cycles: the first

runs from February 1947 to the 1948 peak because most of the series

are not available earlier, and the second runs from December 1965

to the 1969 peak in order to focus on the inflationary second half
                                      two
of that phase. The truncation of these/phases generally increases

the measured expansion rates of price change and so tends to increase

the size of measured declines in the rates from expanion to reces-

sion. Thus the 1949 distribution stands out even more here than

in Chart 4 because its short expansion period catches the bulge

in prices following the termination of World War II price controls

in mid-1946 and records high rates of change.

    Chart 5 can be viewed as measuring the recession rate of each,

price relative to its trend, where the trend is estimated by the

previous expansion rate. (A better estimate would be the average

rate of change for the three cyclical phases of previous expansion,

recession, and succeeding expansion. This more elaborate computation

was not done.) Recessions in this view work to reduce rates of

price change, but the level of prices can continue rising until --

if ever --   the rate gradually declines to zero. Consequently, re-
cession rates are correlated with the preceding expansion rates. The

postwar phenomenon of inflationary movements persisting in the face
                                     -15-


of   slack markets reflects the carry-over of expansion zates with
only small      reductions on the average, into recessions.

        The   significant   development in the postwar period is flOtthis

persistence of irlationary movements per         se   but the decline in

the response of prices to recessions As shown in Chart 5, the

responses measured as changes in the rates of change have pro-

gressively declined fairly uniformly along the entire range of price

changes except for the very large declines. By 1970 the median
response to recession as measured here was virtually           zero. The
magnitude of the dec1ir in responses is recorded by various mea-

sures of the distributions in Table 3. By either the mean, median,

 or percentage of declining series, the rates of change (top section)

in recessions became less negative or more positive, though not

entirely in sequence, and the changes in the rates (that is, re-

cession-minus-expansion rates) did so entirely in sequence for all
three   measures. The 1966-67 mini-recession has been        added to the

bottom group to provide a further test of the chronology of the shifts

in price behavior. It falls in its chronological order for the

median and percentage of declining series and is only slightly out

of order with 1961 for the mean.

      The severity of postwar business cycles haC generlly been

decreasing in real terms, which conceivably might account for ihe

declining response of prices. This cannot be said of the large de-

cline in response from the l920s to the later postwar recessions,

because the differences in severitythere are slight. But it is a

possible reason for the declines following l949 The evidence on

this point has been assembled in Chart 7. Various measures of the

distributions of recession_minus_expansion rates are plotted for the

five postwar recessions and the 1966-67 mini-recession. The chart

graphs the measures of Table 3 and Table 5 (presented later), the

change in rate of change of the weighted aggregate index, and the

change from peak to trough rates of corresponding cycles in the in-

dustrial component of the aggregate. A ranking of the severity of

the recessions in real terms is also presented. (This ranking omits

expansions. The severity of the total amplitude of business cycles
has            also been diminishing but by less.)

       All the measures of price response decline over the period as

a whole, and the ndian and percentage of rates below zero show sig-.

nificant declines from every recession to the next. Here the slight

overall response of prices to the 1970 recession does not appear as

a new phenomenon but as simply another step in the postwar progres-

sion. By contrast, the ranks of severity do not decrease in exact

sequence: 1949 and 1958 tied for st severe and 1961 and 1970 tied

r next to least severe. None of the price measures follow the time

pattern of the ranks. The price responses in the 1966-67 mini-rec-

ession are conspicuously out of order with its severity. Based on

this evidence, therefore, the declining response of prices appears

to have occurred sequentially, due presumably to a set of ins titu-

tional and expectational developments, and not due solely to the

overall reduction in severity of recessions,though it no doubt con-

tributed.

       It might also be concluded that the inflationary climate of

the expansion is apparently not crucial either, because the 1958

distribution followed upon a more inflationary expansion than did
the   1961 distribution which is farther to the right.
                                -17-


       Since the response of prices to recessions has progressively

diminished, it is natural to ask whether the time lag of the response

has lengthened. To provide an answer we may examine the distri-

bution of price changes for the eight nnths following each trough.

This span was selected because it terminates the first cycle in

June 1950 as prices erupted at the outbreak of the Korean War, arid

the last cycle in August 1971 as a price freeze was imposed. To
allow comparison between the cycles, eight nths was used for the
other recovery periods as well. To facilitate comparison with Chart
5,    the rate of change of each price in the preceding expansion phase

was subtracted from these rates for the eight-month period follOw-

ing the trough. The cumulative distributions of these rate differ-

ences are              in Chart 6, shown earlier.



        7The number of prices included here is 1104, 34 less than in
 Chart 5 (the 32 series not covering the 1970 recession were ex-
     cluded here from all the distributions, as well as two other ser-
     ies inadvertently). These minor differences in total number of
     series are of no consequence.



       While the distributions in Chart 6 are quite similar in shape

to those in Chart 5, they are closer together. Compared with the

recession distributions in Chart 5, there was a shift to the right

in the reco'treries following 1949 and 1954, almost no shift follow-

ing 1958 and 1961, and a slight shift to the left following 1970.

Thus, while the, recoveries from the 1949 and 1954 recessions brought

the usual strengthening of prices relative to the recession rates,

the recession pressures on the rates of price change continued un-
                             -18-

abated after 1958 and 1961, and to some degree intensified after
1970. Chart 6 hints at a delay in the response of prices in 1970
from the recession to the recovery period, but the shift in these
distributions relative to their positions in Chart 5 is too slight

to be of any significance. It is the magnitude of price responses

which has changed and apparently not the lag time.


Variability and Skewness of Price Responses

     Along with rjgJard shifts, the distributions display consid-

erably less variability in the post-1949 period compared with the

1920s. This was evident from the flatter distributions for the

1920s and 1949 in Charts 2 and 3. The 1924 and 1949 recessions may

be atypical, to be sure, in that they brought forth large declines

in some prices still inflated from wartime increases. Yet the mild

recession of 1928 also elicited much larger changes in a substantial

number of prices than has occurred in the postl949 recessions.

There is no doubt that large price swings have become less prevalent.

     Whi].e the reduction in response and variability of prices might

appear to be related phenomena, the response has continued to de-

cline and the variability has not. The shapes of the distributions

in Charts 4 and 5 exhibit little change in variability after 1949,

and the measure of variability in Table 4 confirms it. This measure

is the average (absolute) deviation from the mean.8 The variability


     8The means of Table 3 were computed from the individual rates
  of change, but the average deviations in Table 4 are based on
  midpoints    times frequencies of the   closed   intervals and,sums of
  the individual rates only in the open-end intervals Because of
  bunching    at zero, the midpoint of the 0 -2 1/2 class overstates
  the actual mean of this class and biases the average deviation
  upward except when the mean is above the midpoint of that class
  as in 1970. But this bias is bound to be small.

for    1949 is by far the largest, and the others differ very little

and show no tendency to decline further. (Standard deviations,

given in Appendix Table C, also show no trend.) Whatever the change

in    cyclical behavior which     reduced   the variability of pricessince
the 1920s, it appears so far tO have been a once-and-for-all change.
As a result, the continuing decline in the response of prices fol-
lowing 1949 has      occurred fairly uniformly in all segments of the

distributions.




        Table 4   also presents measures of skewness which give a similar

though more erratic picture of changes in the distributions. The
distributions are all skewed to the left as shown by the means being

less than the medians. This implies that the size of declines in
prices was larger on balance than the size of increases, which we

might expect to characterize recessions. (The measure of momental

skewness is positive for 1954 and 1970, however, indicating that

very large increases outweighed very large declines. The use of

the third power in this measure puts great weight on very large de-

viations from the mean.)

        By the    difference   bet*een the mean and   median,   the skewness

decreased after 1949 but has had little further change, particularly

for the recession-minus-expansion rates. (The larger leftward skew-

ness for the mini-recession is a surprising exception which, since

its variability was not out of line with the other recessions,

means that a relatively small number of prices had unusually large
                                       most of
declines.) The uniformity of skewness in/the recessions after

1919 is another indication, along with variability, that the right-

ward shifts in the distributions do not reflect major shifts in
                                 -20-


the pattern of price changes across the economy.

                 The Bunching of Price Changes At or Near Zero

Downward Rigidity

     Bunching at zero, which is often interpreted as downward rigid-

ity of prices, was noted in Charts 2    and 4. It is indicated there
by the jump in the cumulative frequency in the 0 - 2   1/2 interval)
plotted at 3 1/3.
Tabulations not shown indicate that most of the jump   represents
zero price changes. The phenomenon is portrayed in Figure 1 by the
solid curve   relative to a symmetrical distribution (dotted). Since

many prices change infrequently, a short recession would register

more zero changes than would a long recession. The recessions stud-

ied here vary from 9 to 14 months, however, not enough to rke a

great difference.

     A small percentage of declining series is sometimes taken to

indicate such bunching, but a rightward shift of the distribution

also reduces the percentage declining. Another possible indication

of bunching is leftward skewness -- as measured by the mean minus

the median --   but   this may    result from very large rates of

decline in a subgroup of volatile prices. To measure the effect

on the distributions due to bunching without imposing a specified

functional form on the distributions, we may rely on a simple me-

thod illustrated in Figure 1 and calculated for the postwar re-

cessions in Table 5. It is based on the assumption that a distri-

bution withOut bunching would be symmetrical around the mean.

The measure of bunching is the ratio of the actual

 percentage  declining to the hypothetical percentage for a symmetrical dis-
 tribution. A lower ratio indicates more bunching, and unity indicates no
 bunching. The hypothetical percentage is approximated by assuming that
 the frequency of price changes above 2 1/2 per cent per year is unaffected
 by the bunching at zero. Given a symmetrical distribution, the frequency
 above 2 1/2 per cent equals the frequency below a point equidistant to

 the left of the mean. The distribution between these two points is assumed

 to lie along a straight line (in that middle range the distributions with

  less bunching do appear to be linear), and the hypothetical percentage of

 declining prices is read off this line. This percentage is biased down-

 ward, thus overstating the bunching ratio, because bunching increases the

 mean. Recalculation of the ratio with an adjusted mean to correct for this

 bias indicates that this      overstatement      of the ratio is minor. (The cor-

 rected ratio z 1961 is reduced from .59 to .54.)
                                                       the
         By this measure of bunching, it was largest for/recession rates in 1961,
which had only
/ 59 percent of the hypothetical number of declining prices, and almost as

  large in 1954 and 1958. The bunching was somewhat less in 1948 because

 so many prices declined sharply in that recession) and it was considerably

  less   in 1970   because the hypothetical percentage declining was small.
         The distributiors for recession_minus_expansion rates are largely

 free of this bias when the trend of prices is significantly upward,

 because there is no comparable tendency for firms not to report smaller

 rates of price increase. There is little evidence of zero bunching

 for these distributions in Table 5.

         The phenomenon of price changes bunching at zero has received wide

 attention. It is attributed to downward rigidity of Iadministeredv

 prices, which has allegedly contributed to the persistence of

 inflation• Chart 4 demonstrated its prevalence in postwar recessions.
 Is it simply a statistical
                            artifact of the data? For prices fixed

by contract, for example, no change occurs until they are reset

(assuming no prearranged escalation). It is not clear how many

of the BLS series reflect contract prices. Even for noncontract

prices, the I3LS compiles reports from sellers who can be expected

to omit the unannounced discounting and shading of prices often

made in actual transactions.

     We may analyze this omission with the aid of the Stigler-

Kindahi collection of prices compiled from buyers, largely of

products for which "administered pricingt' was likely to be strong.9

Their data cover the 1958 and 1961 recessions only. Chart 8 pre-

sents three sets of cumulative frequency distributions of 62 National
                     compiled by Stigler and Kindahi
Bureau      price grouping(and the corresponding BLS indexes. Two

panels show the 1958 and 1961 recession rates, and the third panel

shows recession-minus-exnansion rates for 1961.

     It is apparent that the BLS series underreport price decreases,

mainly small ones. The paired distributions are fairly close ex-

cept between -5 to 2 1/2 or 5 percent per year. It is clear from

the underlying data not shown here that the main exception occurs

at zero. This result presumably reflects a tendency of the quoted

or list prices reported to the BLS to omit market shading when no

change in the list price has occurred, but to include them when the

list strays too far from the market price and is changed. Thus

the paired price series display the same cyclical behavior, as is

indicated by a correlation coefficient between the two sets of

price changes for 1958 of .81 and a regression coefficient of tht

31.5 on the       N3ER         series of .91. That is, the 3LS series         S
displayed     91 percent, on the average)of the          rates of change

in the        NBER         prices. (This regression was not computed for

1961, but it would give similar results.)

       The last panel of the chart also shows a difference in zero

bunching between the two sets of data. Although such chan9es in the

rates of price change generally do not bunch at zero, the expansion

rates for this cycle were fairly small, and the bottom panel par-

tially replicates the results for recession rates alone.

       There may be other reasons, to be sure, for part of the dif-

ference between these two sources of price data. The Stigler-

Kindahl data involve some interpolation of price observations,

which spreads a change occurring in one month over the intervening

months back to the previous observation. This makes less difference for the

9 to 12 month recession periods used here, however, than for in-

dividual months. Also, buyers who shift to lower-priced sellers

would report a price decline even though all sellers reported no

change. This causes the Stigler-Kindahi data based on buyers to

overstate price changes. On the other hand, the BLS apparently does

not list contract prices except in the month they are set, while

Stigler-Kindahl list them in all months of the contract period as

having no change. These differences in buyer and seller reports

are difficult to evaluate, but the tentative conclusion seems valid

that the greater zero bunching in the ELS series mainly reflects the

omission of market discounting from list prices.

       If we take the difference in bunching between the BLS and

NBER                 data in Chart 8 at face value, the percentage of
                              24_

declining series reported in Table 5 can be adjusted for rtificial

bunching. The adjustment10 raises the percentage of declining series


     10For price changes in the interval -2 1/2 to +2 1/2 percent
  per year, the percentage declining in 1958 is 45•45 percent by
  the Stigler-Kindahi data and 5.26 percent by the BLS data and in
  1961, 67.87 and 15.15 percent, respectively. This implies that
  40.19 and 52.71 percent of the BLS series in 1958 and 1961, re-
  spectively, should be shifted from the interval 0 - 2 1/2 to less
  than zero. These percentages were applied to manufactures with
  concentration ratios above 33 percent only and not to all series
  in that interval on the view that the nonmanufacturing and lowest
 concentration industries are less likely to display bunching at
  zero. This also reduces the size of the adjustment. (The elimin-
  ation of low concentration industries is consistent with the an-
  alysis of Section V below and with numerous studies in the litera-
  ture on pricing in concentrated industries.) For 1958, there are 2l
series shifted in this way and for 1961, 295 series, which results in
  the percentages reported in the text.



from 30.5 to 40.2 for 1958 and from 31.2 to 48.9 for 1961. The

 ratio of these adjusted figures to the hypothetical percentage de-

 clining in Table 5 is raised from .66 to .87 for 1958 and from .59

 to .92 for 1961. The adjustment therefore accounts for a substan-

 tial part of the bunching, though apparently not all. The downward

 rigidity of wholesale prices, though not entirely a statistical arti-

 fact of list instead of transaction prices, is certainly minor. The

 çersistence of inflation since World War II is not, therefore, char-

 acterized by downward rigidity so much as a general tendency of

 prices in the whole range of rates to respond less to recessions.


 High Kurtosis

     Although the bunching of price changes at zero is partly arti-

ficial   and hardly noticeable in the distributions of recession-.

minus-expansion rates, the latter distributions display the related

phenomenon of extremely high kurtosis --     that   is, compared with

the standard normal distribution, they are denser around the mean

and extended   in the tails. Table 6     gives the sample kurtosis and

standard    deviation   for these distributions in the postwar reces-

sions. The kurtosis (a pure number) is many times the size expec-

ted from a normal population, which is 3. A high kurtosis has been

noted elsewhere as characteristic of distributions of price changesj0

More than most other economic variables, changes in prices are

abnormally clustered at a modal value (usually zero) relative to

their total dispersion. What is the reason?

     One common example is the sequence of price changes over time

in commodity   markets,    in which daily price   changes are usually
small but   infrequently interspersed with very large changes. Such

 rate of price change among products depend upon a large number of

 influences, and we might at first expect their combined effect to

follow a normal frequency distribution. But the central limit

 theorem for a normal distribution requires that the probability dis-

tributions of the contributing influences not differ too greatly,

which is not likely here. Basic commodity prices are typically

more volatile than the prices of highly fabricated products, be-

cause of differences in the operation of their respective markets.

Even aside from such characteristic differezxes among prices, the

deflationary pressures of a recession can hit different sectors with

'erying severity and speed.

     Table 6 shows considerable variation in kurtosis over the

period. The kurtosis of the 1949 distribution is the lowest and

its standard deviation the highest, because the price changes are

widely dispersed. This is evident from examination of the histogram

of its price changes (not shown). The 1954 and 1970 distributions

have practically equal values in Table 6, indicating that the funda-

mental determinants of the distributions had no trend over this rer-

iod. Relative to these two, the 1958 distribution has a high kur-

tosis and standard deviation because of a greater number of very

large values out in the tails, and the 1961 kurtosis is low    because
the distribution is less peaked.

     As an analytical explanation of these high values of kurtosis,

we may describe price changes in a recession as   generated by a nor-
malvolatility
     distribution
               and
                  subordinate to   a process which directs the degree

of/deflationary   pressures among prices. Furthermore, we might view
this process as a distribution which determines the variance of the

normal distribution from which each price change is drawn. Then the

kurtosis of the subordinated distribution depends upon the
                                                              ratio

ordinated distribution has a kurtosis necessarily greaterthan the

3 of a normal distribution.

        In these terms a change in kurtosis reflects a change in the

generating process. A increase in the ratio of its variance to

its mean raises the kurtosis of the distribution of price changes.

On certain assumptions an increase in uniformity of price anticipa-

tions among firms        would decrease the mean but not the variance of
the generating process, and hence would *cre the ratio of variance

to    the mean and also icrease the    kurtosis. Since kurtosis has not

been  increasing over the inflationary postwar period, we might at
first conclude that the anticipated rate of inflation, even though
it    rose, did not become more uniform. As is shown in the Appendix,

however, the effect of a greater uniformity of price anticipations

on  the kurtosis is very slight, and an inference about their uniforra-
ity from the kurtosis of these distributions cannot be drawn.

          Prices    Grouped by Durability, Value Added, and Concentration


To what extent does the reduced response of prices in successive

business recessions following 1949 reflect the behavior of partic-

ular groups of prices? The answer will help identify which of var-

ious possible influeixes may underlie this development. Three class-
                                              -.2 8-.




ifications of       prices        were selected for examination. They

pertain     to the durability of the product, the ratio of
value   added in production to shipments, and the concentration of firms

in the industry. The classification by durability follows the fourfold

BLS grouping     of wholesale prices as of        1967 into durable and nondurable

manufactures,     and   durable   and   nondurable      raw or   slightly processed goods.
While the durable nonmanufactures comprise very few series in our sample

and have been omitted, the other three groups are large enough to allow

comparison of the frequency distributions of their prices. Value added

and concentration can      be derived from the BLS           assignment   of   each wholesale

product price to a five-digit SIC industry, for which the 1963 census of

manufactures     provides data on value added and shipments13              and   concentration. 14

          13
           These data cover total shipments of establishments in the indus-
   try and therefore cover all products, not just the main one on which
   classification of the establishment is based. This produces some error
   in our classification of prices.

          14
          The fraction of total industry shipments by the four largest
   firms was used. In afew cases where the four_firm ratio for 1963
   was not availabl, the concentration ratio for 1958 was used if the
   eight-firm ratio suggested that the concentration of the industry had
   not changed much since 1958.

These data are not published for every five-digit industry,                     so   that some
manufacturing prices had to be omitted from these distributions in addi-
tion to the exclusion of all nonmanufacturing prices (farming and mining).
However, to minimize exclusions, value added and                  shipments    for unavailable
five-digit     product codes were approximated by the corresponding four-digit

data where the five-digit product was the only one in the four-digit
                                             -29-


group, though this inadvertently incorporates other miscellaneous products

of the four-digit industry. Individual price series were classified ac-

cording to these ratios into low, middle, or high ratios of value added to

shipments and      similarly    for concentration. 15 Since these two classifications



          15
              The dividing lines were, for the value-added ratio, O-.400,
      .401-.600, and    .601-1.000   and, for concentration, 0-.33, .34-.67,
   and    .68-1.00.    These      boundaries were chosen to provide wide inter-
      vals each of which would contain a fairly large number of price series.


are   based   on   1963 data,   they are   less   appropriate for other years, but

these    characteristics of the products and the industries are not likely
to have changed greatly even over the two decades from 1948 to 1970; the
task of reclassifying the         prices using other survey years was    not deemed
worthwhile.
        Although these classifications are quite different in concept,
they    may in fact overlap for many prices. Such interdependence of

characteristics makes indentification of influences on price behav-

ior difficult. Still, with the large number of prices in our sample,

there is sufficient diversification to allow some indication of dif-

ferences in behavior.

        Charts 8-10 present cumulative frequency distributions for all

the previous 1100-odd product prices except those omitted from these

classifications for the reasons noted.


Prices Classified by Degree of Processing and Durability of Product (Chart 9)

which characteristically undergo large price fluctuations. The raw

postponed. Consequently, we expect that their                elasticity   of de-

mand with respect to short-run changes in price tends to be higher

This is not invariably/of course, since users of/nonessential non-

durables can also         do without for temporary periods.) This classi-

fication also corresponds to degree of perishability, which determines

the feasibility of sizable inventories. Inventories absorb short-run

changes in demand and also dampen price fluctuations. Unfortunately,

this correspondence is only a rough one. The durable manufactures

tain   production schedulesfor the products of which they are coinpon-
ents. Furthermore, apart from perishable basic foods, the nondur-
able group includes textiles, leather, paper, petroleum, chemicals,
and other such products classified as nondurable but regularly held
in   inventory. No attempt was made to alter the BLS classification

for present purposes. Nevertheless, BLS durability still corresponds

in part to the degree of importance of inventories in pricing. This

classification helps to show whether these characteristics of products

are related to   the   changes in   cyclical   behavior of   prices.
       Chart 9 reveals a sharp difference between the nondurable, largely

unprocessed goods and the    two manufacturing groups. As expected, the
distributioiof the former are much flatter, indicating considerable
variability of price response to the recessions. The smaller number of
series covered by this group (about one-fifth of the other two) makes

these distributions more jagged but would not ordinarily affect their

slope or median. The strong dependence of these prices on short-run

market conditions apparently is the reason why these distributions do

not shift successively rightward for each recession, as do those for the

two   manufacturing groups and for the combined distributions in Chart 5.
Indeed,   the distribution for 1970 in Chart 9A is further to the left

than   that for 1958. In the 1970          recession basic commodity prices de-

clined    as usual, while in the late 1950s they weakened during the final
stages of the business expansion and began to recover in the 1958 re-
cession   before it ended.
       The distributions for the two manufacturing           groups (Charts 9B and

9c)   are surprisingly similar, though as expected the durables exhibit

somewhat less variability. Both sets show successive rightward shifts

from one recession to the next, but less for the durables than the non-

durables except in 1970. Apart from the raw materials, therefore, the

rightward shifts in successive recessiOns do not differ by durability

and by    inference are not related to inventories.

gives less importance to volatile prices of raw materials, and this explains

why the variability declines as the ratio increases. The average ratios

in the three groups are 28, 50, and 66 percent. respectively, and

the variability roughly declines by that relative amount between

the first two   groups,   though by less between the second two (see

Table 7, below).

     For   each recession the medians of the distributions for each

higher group of ratios tend to move rightward, though much less so

for the later than the earlier recessions. Also, the distributions

for the higher ratios cluster more around zero and exhibit a re-

sponse to recession which is smaller over-all and changes less over

the postwar period.

     Taken all together, these results support the view that the

inflexibility of wage rates (due to custom as well as union baroziin-

ing) contributes to the lack of responsiveness of prices to re-

cessions, whereas a high dependence in production on basic materials

adds to price variability. Yet the tendency in successive recessions

for the rate of change of prices to decline less or rise more rel-

ative to expansion rates cannot be attributed directly to labor

Costs. These rightward shifts are largest for those prices having

the greatest variability and least dependence on wages. In the

l99 and 1954 recessions at the beginning of the postwar period,

the high value-added group displayed the least price response but

the subsequent rightward shifts in the distributions for this

group were also the smallest. Hence the rightwarcl shifts in the

total distributions of Chart 5 reflect a reduction in price re-

sponse to the later recessions more by the lower value-added

products. By implication wage costs have not contributed to the re-

duction in price responsiveness.

                 Prices   classified by concentration ratio (Chart           11).   Concentrated

         industrjes have long been linked to short-run price inflexibility, 16

         supposedly because they engage in oligopolistic price fixing or, even

        without overt collusion, administer prices independently of short-run

         market conditions. Quite apart from pricing by oligopolies, various
                                                  might
         arguments can be devised why firms /           prefer   to avoid frequent price

         changes, which concentration may facilitate. Marketoncentration ratios,

         however, may be a poor measure of the control exercised over market prices.

         degree of competition. Although profits are supposed to benefit from
         such control over prices, various studies have found concentration to be

atisfactory classification because it is not defined independently
of the price series.
     In Chart ii the distributions for the more concentrated indus-
tries    generally show less price response --         they have smaller vari-
ability and lie closer to zero, though this observation makes no

allowance for overlapping between concentration, durability, and

high value added, all of which work in the same direction. To

the extent that it is justified, this observation supports the con-

tention that in concentrated industries           price adjustments to a
change    in sales are delayed longer; this presumably reflects a

greater ability to set prices independently of market conditions.

is    no implication that prices of cicentrated industries do not

adjust in the long run to a change in market developments which is

not reversed over the business cycle.

        Among   the three groups,   the   distributions of the low   concentration

group   display   the smallest rightward shifts in successive recessions.

The   price   response of these industries, which tend to respond quickly
to market conditions, has not changed much over the postwar period. Yet
the rightward shifts are generally no smaller in the middle than in the

the    1970 recession. The tendency of prices to respond less in successive

recessions cannot, therefore, be attributed to the special behavior of

highly concentrated industries but is a more general phenomenon.

of low market concentration and high materials costs. Along with larger re-

         Apart   from basic commodity markets where prices closely follow

short-run demand and        supply   conditions, other wholesale prices exhibit a

pervasive tendency to respond to recessions less and less over the post-

war period. This tendency does not appear to be dominated by the behavior

of any particular group, though it is strongest for manufactures with low

value added and medium concentration.

at   the time as a new phenomenon. The change in behavior was attri-

buted to the emergence of dvmward rigidity in prices and a ten-

dency of producers to "administer't their prices with less regard

for short-run changes in market demand. Why did this phenomenon

emerge following the 1949 recession? One explanation given was

the growth of market power of firms to set prices and of labor

unions to dictate wages. Yet, while labor unions had become stronger

compared with the 1940s and earlier decades, firms as a whole did

not appear to have more market power. Another explanation was that

price setting is strongly influenced by anticipations of future

levels. The Employment Act of 1946, which had committed the govern-

ment to pursue full-employment policies, was followed in the post-

war years by an upward trend of prices, and the two together rein-

forced a belief that any deflationary pressures would be brief. Pre-

sumably that dissuaded firms from reducing prices in recessions.

Some theories of inflation see large firms as raising prices in

excess of increases in costs? even at a time of excess capacity, in

order to maintain profit margins as output contracts, but most of

the postwar inflationary movements could be attributed to excess

demand pressures if due allowance were made for lags in response.

Given sporadic bursts of demand-pull inflation, the failure of prices

to undergo offsetting declines during the ensuing recessions seemed

sufficient at that time to explain the upward trend of prices.19

       The emphasis on downward rigidity was not sufficient, however,

to explain the continuing rise of most prices in 1970 when the re-

to respond in 1970 even by rising less rapid'y. While laos in
the system could be invoked to argue that prices continued rising to

catch up with previous cost increases, such lags had not been equally

significant in previous recessions. The new behavior required a

revision of the theories.




       An important revision brought in the anticipated rate of in-

flation as a basic determinant of price changes to which the effects

of market demand and supply conditions were then added.'         The an-

ticipated rate supposedly depends upon anticipated trends in unit

costs at standard levels of capacity utilization. Declines in de-

mand reduce the rate of price change relative to the anticipated

rate.     A high   anticipated rate makes the actual rate high   and, if

demand subsequently declines, prices continue rising, albeit less

rapidly. Iising prices in 1970 could thus be explained by antici-

pated rates of inflation higher than those in earlier      recessions.
It   follows that the price response to recessions should be measured

by the rates of change relative to the anticipated rates. In the
                                    -38-


absence       of an acceptable measure of anticipated rates, the

preceding       expansion rates served here as     rough   proxies, thouoh
admittedly they are far from adequate. If the response tore-
cessions       were to remain unchanged, the distribution of recession

rates    of change    minus expansion      rates should be the same from one

recession to the next. A theoretical formulation of such price

behavior is presented in the first section of the Appendix.

        The    findings   of this study of individual prices partly support

and partly modify these views. Changes in            the composition of the
aggregate       indexes over time have affected their cyclical behavior.

Even so, there is no doubt that the average rate of decline in

prices in recessions has diminished sire the 1920s. It is true

that the distributions of recession price changes display a high

variability, less than in the 1920s but still considerable and

littlechanged in the past four recessions. The wide range of
changes has long been noted.21 It indicates the diversity of price

behavior,       reflecting both random variations and persistent differ-

ences between certain groups of prices. The variability of price

changes was less in the recessions following 1949 in part because

of greater bunching at zero, which was           widely    interpreted to imply
a downw rigidity of prices. But such bunching results largely from

a bias toward zero change in reported prices, which the Stigler-Kindahi

                                                                                  .

data for transaction prices in 1959 and 1961 show did in fact de-

cline moderately (Section IV). If we allow for this bias, however,

the data still indicate a general reduction in the size and number

of declines in prices since the 1920s.

     This reduction in response is clearer in the distributions of

recession-minus-expansion rates, which exhibit little bunching at

zeros These rates also crudely allow for differences in the trends

of prices and are equivalent to uasures of overall cyclical ampli-

tude. This amplitude has diminished since the l920s and has contin     -

ued to diminish in consecutive recessions Ixpansion and recession

rates have both helped to reduce the c1ica1 amplitude, but th

change for recession rates has been greater. A decrease in the

severity of business recessions in real terms undoubtedly has Con-

tributed,   but it does not provide a full explanation, because the

severity of the five postwar recessions has not decreased chrono-

logically. The l96-67 mini-recession was examined as an additional

test case, and the size of its response to prices fell between that

of 1961 and 1970 even though it was less severe than either of those

recessions.

     Furthermore, although the variability,of recession price changes

has contracted sharply since the 1920s, it has remained the same

following 1919. Deve1opnnts in market structure and mix which could
stabilize price fluctuations would show up in the variability of

price. Since variability has not decreased, we may conclude that
the continued decline in response to recessions has occurred aJonc

the entire distribution of price changes and does not reflect any

alteration in market structure ich also affects variability (or,

for that matter, skewness and kurtosis as well, which also show no

trends).

     Why have recession declines in the rate of price change pro-
gressively diminished? The answer cannot be that anticipated rates of
inflation rose While that was probably true, rising antici-tcd r k: vu1d
not account for diminishing dec1ii in the ra.tes of change. The answer
involves either or both a reduction in magnitude of price responses to
excess capacity or an increase in the speed of adjustment of anticipations
to actual price changes. The first would be influenced by the history of
restraints taken against inflation. If declines in demand growth have
been brief, the response to the next one will be less. It is hard to

believe that the postwar history of government failures to curb inflation

has not affected price responses significantly. Second, the speed of

adjustment of the anticipated rate to the actual rate of inflation can

be important, because it will affect the difference between the two at

during the business expansion./ price increases would presumably be re-

versed faster in a subsequent recession if they had recently accelerated

than if they had been rising at a fairly constant rate for some time,

though an offset to this faster reversal is the persistence of accelerated

inflation while its lagged effects on costs work through the economy.

The actual and anticipated rates will also be closer should anticipa-

tions be adjusted faster.

      These considerations suggest two reasons why the anticipated rate

of inflation at the beginning of the 1970 recession may have been closer

to the actual rate than had been trie at previous cyclical peaks and why,
therefore, the average price response was so slight. First,
the rate of inflation at the end of 1969 had been about the same for a

year or two. Second, the adjustment of anticipations may have become

faster as a result of the recurring postwar periods of inflation .   Of course,
                                    -      -

the   speed of adjustment is hard to judge because it is influenced by the
                                                   and because,
variability as well as the duration of inflation /unfortunately, there is

little direct evidence on the behavior of anticipations.

        Have   structural changes occurred in product markets to account for
the decline in price responsesr There has, for example, been a steady
growth in the relative importance       of highly specialized and fabricated

products,   which characteristically fluctuate less in price than do raw

materials. But this cannot account for the rightward shifts of the dis-

tributions, which are composed of the same set of prices. In a related

classification of the prices into durable and nondurable manufactures,

the latter exhibited somewhat larger rightward shifts than the former.

The exception to successive shifts is shown by prices of raw materials,

which continue to exhibit their characteristic sharp and variable responses

to    market developments. Other classifications of prices which might be
thought to reveal structural changes       are the concentration of markets

and the ratio of value added to shiments of producers. It is true that

variability of price changes is lower in more concentrated markets and

for firms with high value-added ratios. And the more concentrated markets

exhibit fewer price declines in the recessions. But these differences between

groups of prices have remained the same over the postwar period. The re-

sponse to recessions of the high valued-added and       concentration groups has
declined the same or perhaps less than the others. Therefore, even if
they increased in relative importance, which is not generally true, they
cannot    account for the general decline in response.

      The decisive influence on price response appears to have been
a   general adaptation of economic units to inflationary   prospects and

government  policy rather than structural developments. Thus the
change in price behavior appears to be long range and therefore not
likely to change much either way within a few years. The attenua-
tion of price responses appears to have moderated cyclical accel-

rate,    prices would be rising in part to reflect current, as well

as to catch up to past, excess demand, the first term of equation
1.    It is certainly conceivable for lagged excess demand to raise

prices even though p were above e and there was a deficient current

demand, that is, a negative D-S. Such a rise in prices greater

than e could be described as due to the push of past cost in-

creases not previously adjusted to.


                The Distribution of p Across Products

        The distribution of p depends upon the distribution of ex-
cess demand and of            S   plausible   that deviations of indi-

vidual price changes from the economy-wide mean rate of change

reflect myriad small influences and therefore are normally distri-
hited. The variance of the probability distributions which gen-
erate individial price changes differs among products, however,
because of characteristic differences in the volatility of prices.

For a given point in time we have, for each product i,

(2)                     p = cL.L[D.(p.)   -   S.(p.)1       +

        By the previous assumptions the first term follows a normal
                                                 2
distribution    with some mean and a variance cy     which are dif-

ferent for each product, and the second term is normally distri-
                                          2
buted with some mean and a variance 2 which are the same for

all products. The assumption that the variance of e is the same

across products is crucial to the following argument, but it seems

reasonable as a first approximation: The anticipated rate of

price change for a product will depend mainly upon prospects for

inflation in the economy at large and ordinarily much less upon

developments in the individual sectors. Individual firms will

assess these prospects differently, of course, but nyst of the
                        Appendix -- 46


relevant inf1uerxes are the same                   and therefore the distribution of
perceived possibilities would generally be the same.

      Then p. has a distribution subordinate to a normal probability

function in which the variance of the normal function is directed

by a process with mean

  the following proof and interpretation of the kurtosis.



      If now   the   uniformity across products of the anticipated rate

of inflation changes, this is reflected in a smaller                                                   which   re-

duces the variability of p by the same amount. What happens to

its kurtosis? We have àm/O                          1   and s/m =                      O.           Therefore,

from (5), the change in kurtosis with respect to a change in 0

(in percentage terms in order to abstract from the arbitrary time

unit of measurennt of p), is

Since these parameters are all necessarily positive, the effect on

k is negative. In words,            the

of the directing process as a percentage of its mean/as in (5).

The variance may be high absolutely, but, if the mean is also

very high, the percentage variation in the directing process is

                   Anticipations and the
               Distribution of T)rice Changes

      This appendix develops a theoretical relationship between the

kurtosis of the distribution of price changes and the uniformity of

rrice anticipations. A smaller variability of anticipated rates of

inflation will reduce the variability of the actual rates and will

also, in combination with demand influences on prices, increase the

kurtosis of the distribution, though by very little. We begin by

formulating   the effect of excess demand and anticipations on price

changes.


                       A Model of Price Changes

      For each product we may postulate demand and supply schedules

which are continually shifting upward because of inflation (and

rightward because of grcwth in real terms). The anticipated rate

of increase in their intersection point is pe, which represents

the anticipated rate of equilibrium price increase. The antici-

pated level of the demand and supply schedules is not at any time

necessarily equal to the actual levels D and S. The excess quan-

tity demanded implied by these actual schedules at the market price

p is, for some point in time, D - S, and we may suppose that thi.s

helps determine     given   an adjustment fraction x and distributed

lag function L as follows:

(1)                         p   czLID(p) -   S(p)1   +   e
      The lag function L reflects delays in adjusting to past cost

increases, which accounts for the time it takes for increases in

the prices of factors of production to work through the price system.

      Actual prices rise along the anticipated path e with devia-

tions which depend with a lag upon D-S. The anticipated path changes
                         Appendix _44_


slowly over time, so that D-S does not remain always positive or

negative but moves cyclically above and below the anticipated path.

      A change in aggregate demand is reflected in the rate of change

of demand    and affects excess demand D-S.      depends upon past
rates of price change as well as information about future develop-

ments. It is unrelated to current excess demand D-S. A special

case is for pe to equal the anticipated rise in unit costs at a

'standard" level of capacity utilization. It is possible for p

to be rising even though          D-S is negative. Thus a slowing

of aggregate demand makes D-S negative, so that f   is less than ,
and D equals S at a price lower than the current p.

      Equation 1 implies corresponding adjustments in quantities to

the discrepancy between D and S. Assuming there are inventories,

one possibility is that dollar sales are D(p) and the value of

production is S(p), so that the bracketed expression is the un-

planned change in the value of inventories (ignoring planned changes

and revaluations of inventory stocks due to price changes). But

the actual amoun sold and produced might not be on either schedule,

though sales would be less than D. Thus D(p) is the maximum demand

and S(p) the desired production, hypothetical amounts which the

firm estimates through its experience n the market.

       It is difficult to imagine equation 1 without the price anti-

cipations terms, for that would imply that price changes always

moved according to (a lagged function of) excess demand. A moving

equilibrium of rising prices would then not be possible. Yet ii:

seems plausible that a fully anticipated inflation could occur in

which excess demand at each moment was zero. In general, however,

j   could be above or below e•
