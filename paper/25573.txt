We propose a new measure of financial intermediary constraints based on how the intermediaries
manage their tail risk exposures. Using data for the trading activities in the market of deep out-of-
the-money S&P 500 put options, we identify periods when the variations in the net amount of
trading between financial intermediaries and public investors are likely to be mainly driven by
shocks to intermediary constraints. We then infer tightness of intermediary constraints from the
quantities of option trading during such periods. A tightening of intermediary constraint
according to our measure is associated with increasing option expensiveness, higher risk premia
for a wide range of financial assets, deterioration in funding liquidity, and broker-dealer
deleveraging.

1     Introduction

In this paper, we present new evidence connecting financial intermediary constraints to
asset prices. We propose to measure the tightness of intermediary constraints based on
how the intermediaries manage their aggregate tail risk exposures. Using data on the
trading activities between public investors and financial intermediaries in the market
of deep out-of-the-money put options on the S&P 500 index (abbreviated as DOTM
SPX puts), we exploit the price-quantity relations to identify periods when shocks to
intermediary constraints are likely to be the main driver of the variations in the net amount
of trading between public investors and financial intermediaries. This then enables us to
infer tightness of intermediary constraints from the option trading quantities. We show
that a tightening of intermediary constraint according to our measure is associated with
increasing option expensiveness, rising risk premia for a wide range of financial assets,
deterioration in funding liquidity, as well as deleveraging by broker-dealers.

    To construct the constraint measure, we start by computing the net amount of DOTM
SPX puts that public investors in aggregate purchase each month (henceforth referred to
as P N BO), which also reflects the net amount of the same options that broker-dealers
and market-makers sell in that month. While it is well known that financial intermediaries
are net sellers of these types of options during normal times, we find that P N BO varies
significantly over time and tends to fall/turn negative during times of market distress.

    Periods when P N BO is low could be periods of weak supply by intermediaries (due
to tight constraints) or weak demand by public investors. One needs to separate these
two effects in order to link P N BO to intermediary constraints. We propose to exploit the
relation between the quantities of trading, as measured by P N BO, and prices (expensive-
ness of SPX options), as measured by the variance premium. Positive comovements in
prices and quantities are consistent with the presence of demand shocks, while negative
comovements are consistent with the presence of supply shocks.1 We summarize the daily
   1
     We assume public investors’ demand curve is downward sloping, and financial intermediaries’ supply
curve is upward sloping. These assumptions apply when both groups are (effectively) risk averse and
cannot fully unload the inventory risks through hedging. Notice that the presence of one type of shocks
does not rule out the presence of the other.



                                                  1
price-quantity relations each month. Those months with negative price-quantity relations
on average are likely to be the periods when supply shocks are the main driver of the
quantity of trading. Then, we take low P N BO in a month with negative price-quantity
relation as indicative of tight intermediary constraints.

   In monthly data from January 1991 to December 2012, P N BO is significantly negatively
related to option expensiveness, and this negative relation becomes stronger when jump
risk in the market is higher. In daily data, the correlation between P N BO and our measure
of option expensiveness is negative in 159 out of 264 months. These results highlight the
significant role that supply shocks play in the market of DOTM SPX puts.

   In those periods with a negative price-quantity relation, P N BO significantly predicts
future market excess returns. A one-standard deviation decrease in P N BO (normalized
P N BO) in a month with negative price-quantity relation is on average associated with
a 4.3% (3%) increase in the subsequent 3-month log market excess return. The R2 of
the regression is 24.7% (12.3%). The predictive power of P N BO is even stronger in the
months when market jump risk is above the median level (in addition to the negative
price-quantity relation), but becomes much weaker in the months when the price-quantity
relations are positive. Besides equity, a lower P N BO also predicts higher future excess
returns for high-yield corporate bonds, an aggregate hedge fund portfolio, a carry trade
portfolio, and a commodity index, and it predicts lower future excess returns on long-term
Treasuries and (pay-fix) SPX variance swaps.

   The predictability results survive an extensive list of robustness checks. They include
different statistical methods for determining the significance of the predictive power,
exclusion of the 2008-09 financial crisis and extreme observations of P N BO, different ways
to define option moneyness, and an alternative quantity measure based on end-of-period
open interest instead of trading volume, among others. In addition, we consider an
alternative method for identifying periods of weak supply based on Rigobon (2003) (see
also Sentana and Fiorentini (2001)). Using the reduced-form econometric assumptions of
this method, we extract supply shocks to intermediaries and confirm the ability of the
inferred supply shocks to predict future stock returns.



                                             2
   The return predictability results are consistent with the intermediary asset pricing
theories, where a reduction in the risk-sharing capacity of the financial intermediaries
causes the aggregate risk premium in the economy to rise. An alternative explanation of
the predictability results is that P N BO is merely a proxy for standard macro/financial
factors that simultaneously drive the aggregate risk premium and intermediary constraints.
If this alternative explanation is true, then the inclusion of proper risk factors into the
predictability regression should drive away the predictive power of our constraint measure.
We find that the predictive power of our measure is unaffected by the inclusion of a long list
of return predictors in the literature, including various price ratios, consumption-wealth
ratio, variance risk premium, default spread, term spread, and several tail risk measures.
While these results do not lead to the rejection of the alternative explanation (there can
always be omitted risk factors), they are at least consistent with intermediary constraints
having a unique effect on the aggregate risk premium.

   Our intermediary constraint measure is significantly related to the funding condition
measures of Fontaine and Garcia (2012) (extracted from the Treasury market) and Adrian,
Etula, and Muir (2014) (based on the growth rate of broker-dealer leverage). At the same
time, we also find that our constraint measure provides unique information about the
aggregate risk premium not contained in the other funding liquidity measures.

   Our results suggest that when financial intermediaries switch from sellers of DOTM SPX
puts to buyers (e.g., in the months following the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in 2008), it
is likely that the tightening of constraints are forcing the intermediaries to aggressively
hedge their tail risk exposures, rather than the intermediaries accommodating an increase
in public investors’ demand to sell crash insurance. Examples of shocks to intermediary
constraints include stricter regulatory requirements on banks’ tail risk exposures (e.g.,
due to the Dodd-Frank Act or Basel III), or losses incurred by the intermediaries. To
further examine the risk sharing mechanism, we try to identify who among the public
investors (retail or institutional) are the “liquidity providers” during times of distress:
reducing the net amount of crash insurance acquired from financial intermediaries or even
providing insurance to the latter group. We answer this question by comparing public
investors’ demand in the markets of SPX vs. SPY options. SPY options are options on the

                                              3
SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, which has a significantly higher percentage of retail customers
than SPX options. Our results suggest that institutional public investors are the liquidity
providers during periods of distress.

      Our paper builds on and extends the work of Garleanu, Pedersen, and Poteshman
(2009) (henceforth GPP) to incorporate the impact of supply shocks into the options
market. In a partial equilibrium setting, GPP demonstrate how exogenous public demand
shocks affect option prices when risk-averse dealers have to bear the inventory risks. In
their model, the dealers’ intermediation capacity is fixed, and the model implies a positive
relation between the public demand for options and the option premium. Unlike GPP, we
consider shocks to the intermediary constraint and the endogenous relations among public
demand for options, option pricing, and aggregate market risk premium.2 In the empirical
analysis, we try to separate the effects of public demand shocks and shocks to intermediary
constraints, and show that the latter is linked to the time-varying risk premia for a wide
range of financial assets. Our empirical strategy based on the price-quantity dynamics is
motivated by Cohen, Diether, and Malloy (2007), who use a similar strategy to identify
demand and supply shocks in the equity shorting market.

      The recent financial crisis has highlighted the importance of understanding the potential
impact of intermediary constraints on the financial markets and the real economy. Following
the seminal contributions by Bernanke and Gertler (1989), Kiyotaki and Moore (1997),
and Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (1999), recent theoretical developments include
Gromb and Vayanos (2002), Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009), Geanakoplos (2009), He
and Krishnamurthy (2013), Adrian and Boyarchenko (2012), Brunnermeier and Sannikov
(2014), among others.

      In contrast to the fast growing body of theoretical work, there is relatively little
empirical work on measuring intermediary constraints and studying their aggregate effects
on asset prices. The notable exceptions include Adrian, Moench, and Shin (2010) and
Adrian, Etula, and Muir (2014), who show that changes in aggregate broker-dealer leverage
is linked to the time series and cross section of asset returns. Our paper demonstrates a
  2
    We present a general equilibrium model in the Online Appendix, which captures time-varying
intermediary constraints in reduced form and is quite tractable.

new venue (the crash insurance market) to capture intermediary constraint variations and
study their effects on asset prices. Moreover, compared to intermediary leverage changes,
our measure has the advantage of being forward-looking and available at higher (daily and
monthly instead of quarterly) frequency.

        The ability of option volume to predict returns has been examined in other contexts.
Pan and Poteshman (2006) show that option volume predicts near future individual stock
returns (up to 2 weeks). They find the source of this predictability to be the nonpublic
information possessed by option traders. Our evidence of return predictability applies to
the market index and to longer horizons (up to 4 months), and we argue that the source
of this predictability is time-varying intermediary constraints.

        Finally, several studies have examined the role that derivatives markets play in the
aggregate economy. Buraschi and Jiltsov (2006) study option pricing and trading volume
when investors have incomplete and heterogeneous information. Bates (2008) shows how
options can be used to complete the markets in the presence of crash risk. Longstaff and
Wang (2012) show that the credit market plays an important role in facilitating risk sharing
among heterogeneous investors. Chen, Joslin, and Tran (2012) show that the market risk
premium is highly sensitive to the amount of sharing of tail risks in equilibrium.



2         Research Design

Our goal is to measure how constrained financial intermediaries are through the ways
they manage their exposures to aggregate tail risks. The market of DOTM SPX put
options are well-suited for this purpose. First, this market is large in terms of the economic
exposures it provides for aggregate tail risks.3 Second, compared to other over-the-counter
derivatives that also provide exposures to aggregate tail risks, the exchange-traded SPX
options have the advantages of better liquidity and almost no counterparty risk (other than
exchange failure). Third, the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) classifies exchange
    3
    For example, based on the data in December 2012, Johnson, Liang, and Liu (2016) estimate that
the change in value of index options outstanding is on the order of trillions of dollars following a severe
market crash, the majority of which contributed by out-of-money SPX puts.



                                                    5
option transactions by investor types, which allows us to determine the net exposures of
the financial intermediaries and is essential for constructing our measure.

   Specifically, the OCC classifies each option transaction into one of three categories
based on who initiates the trade. They include public investors, firm investors, and
market-makers. Transactions initiated by public investors include those initiated by retail
investors and those by institutional investors such as hedge funds. Trades initiated by firm
investors are those that securities broker-dealers (who are not designated market-makers)
make for their own accounts or for another broker-dealer. Since we focus on financial
intermediaries as a whole, it is natural to merge firm investors and market-makers as one
group and observe how they trade against public investors.

   We classify DOTM puts as those with strike-to-price ratio K/S ≤ 0.85. For robustness,
we also consider different strike-to-price cutoffs, as well as cutoffs that adjust for option
maturity and the volatility of the S&P 500 index (which is similar to cutoffs based on
option delta). Another feature of option transaction is that an order can either be an
open order (to open new positions) or a close order (to close existing positions). We will
focus on open orders, because they are less likely to be mechanically influenced by existing
positions (see Pan and Poteshman, 2006).

   We construct a measure of the public net buying-to-open volume for DOTM SPX puts
(abbreviated as P N BO). In period t (e.g., a day or a month), P N BOt is defined as


       P BN Ot ≡ public total open-buy volumet − public total open-sell volumet .        (1)


P N BO represents the amount of new DOTM SPX puts bought (sold if negative) by public
investors in a period. Due to the growth in size of the options market, there could be a
time trend in the level or volatility of P N BO. Thus, we also consider normalizing P N BO
by the average monthly volume of all SPX options traded by public investors over the past

                         Average monthly public SPX volume over past 3 months

While P N BON helps address the potential issue with growth in the size of market,
P N BO has the advantage in that it better captures the actual magnitude of the tail risk
exposures being transferred between public investors and intermediaries, which matters for
measuring the degree of intermediary constraints. Considering this tradeoff, we conduct
all of our main analyses using both P N BO and P N BON .

      It is well documented (see e.g., Bollen and Whaley, 2004) that, during normal times,
public investors are net buyers of index puts while financial intermediaries are net sellers.
All else equal, when financial intermediaries become more constrained, their willingness
to supply crash insurance to the market will be reduced. It is thus tempting to infer
how constrained financial intermediaries are based on the net amount of crash insurance
they sell to public investors each period, as captured by P N BO. However, besides weak
supply from constrained intermediaries, weak public demand can also cause the equilibrium
amount of crash insurance traded between public investors and intermediaries to be low.
The challenge is to separate the effects of supply from demand.

      We address this problem in two ways, (1) by exploiting the price-quantity relation
to identify periods of “supply environments,” when variations in P N BO are likely to be
mainly driven by shocks to intermediary constraints, and (2) by the method of Rigobon
(2003), which achieves identification by exploiting the heteroskedasticity of demand and
supply shocks.

      Before presenting the identification methodology, we briefly explain our “price” measure,
i.e., the expensiveness of SPX options. One would ideally like to calculate the difference
between the market price of an option and its hypothetical price without any market
frictions. The latter is not observable and can only be approximated by adopting a specific
pricing model. For simplicity and robustness, we use the variance premium (V P ) in
  4
    For robustness check, we also define P N BON using past 12-month average public trading volume in
the denominator, which generates similar results.

Bekaert and Hoerova (2014) as a proxy for overall expensiveness of SPX options, which is
the difference between VIX2 and the expected physical variance of the return of the S&P
500 index.5


2.1       Identification through the price-quantity relation

Our first empirical strategy is motivated by Cohen, Diether, and Malloy (2007) (CDM),
who identify shifts in demand vs. supply in the securities shorting market by examining the
relation between the changes in the loan fee (price) and the changes in the percentage of
outstanding shares on loan (quantity). In their setting, a simultaneous increase (decrease)
in the price and quantity indicates at least an increase (decrease) in shorting demand,
whereas an increase (decrease) in price coupled with a decrease (increase) in quantity
indicates at least a decrease (increase) in shorting supply.

       The same logic applies to the options market. The demand pressure theory of GPP
predicts that a positive exogenous shock to the public demand for DOTM SPX puts forces
risk-averse dealers to bear more inventory risks. As a result, the dealers will raise the
price of the option (a move along the upward-sloping supply curve). Thus, demand shocks
generate a positive relation between changes in prices and quantities. Alternatively, if
there are intermediation shocks that tighten the constraints facing financial intermediaries
(e.g., due to loss of capital or higher capital requirements), they will become less willing
to provide crash insurance to public investors. Then, the premium for the DOTM SPX
puts rises while the equilibrium quantity of such options traded falls (a move along the
downward-sloping demand curve).

       Different from CDM, we would like to identify periods of weak and strong supply
(level), instead of negative or positive supply shocks (changes). For this reason, we cannot
directly apply their identification strategy. However, the ability to identify supply and
demand shocks is still useful for our setting. Consider a month with low P N BO. If the

price-quantity relations on a daily basis suggest mainly supply shocks in that month, then
the low P N BO is more likely to be driven by weak supply instead of weak demand.

   Based on this idea, we run the following regression using daily data in each month t:


                   V Pi(t) = aV P,t + bV P,t P N BOi(t) + dV P,t Ji(t) + vi(t) ,       (3)


where i(t) denotes day i in month t. The presence of jumps in the underlying stock index
can affect V P even when markets are frictionless. Thus, when examining the relation
between V P and P BN O, we control for the level of jump risk J in the S&P 500 index
based on the measure of Andersen, Bollerslev, and Diebold (2007).

   A negative coefficient bV P,t < 0 in month t suggests that supply shocks are the dominant
driver of price-quantity relations in that month, and we expect P N BO to be informative
about the variation in intermediary constraints during such times. The fact that bV P,t < 0
does not identify any particular supply shock, nor does it rule out the presence of demand
shocks in the same month. It does indicate that supply shocks are likely to be more
significant relative to demand shocks. Similarly, bV P,t > 0 does not rule out the presence
of supply shocks in a month, but demand shocks are likely to be more significant. During
such periods, we do not expect P N BO to be informative about supply conditions.

   Furthermore, we expect high jump risk to amplify the effect of shocks to intermediary
constraints on the equilibrium quantity of options traded. This is because a main reason
that intermediary constraint matters for their supply of DOTM index puts is the difficulty
to hedge the market jump risk embedded in their inventory positions. If public demand
does not become more volatile during such times, variations in P N BO will be more
informative about shocks to intermediary constraints when jump risk is high. Whether
this assumption is valid or not is an empirical question.

   In summary, in a month when the price-quantity relation is on average negative
(bV P,t < 0), we expect small (or negative) value for P N BOt (cumulative net-buying by
public investors for the month) to indicate tight intermediary constraints.

2.2       Identification through heteroskedasticity

Besides the identification of “supply environments” based on the price-quantity relation,
an alternative method to identify supply shocks is through econometric identification.
One method suited for our study is identification through heteroskedasticity of Rigobon
(2003).6 Rigobon (2003) considers a standard linear supply-demand relationship between
prices (pt ) and quantities (qt ):


                              pt = b + βqt + t ,    (demand equation)                  (4a)

                              qt = a + αpt + ηt ,    (supply equation)                  (4b)


where the volatilities of the supply and demand shocks are σ and ση , respectively. In
general, the residuals will be correlated with the independent variables in each equation
and the parameters will not be identified. Rigobon (2003) solves this identification problem
by considering regime-dependent heteroscedasticity of (, η). Supposing that there are
two regimes and the relative volatilities of the supply and demand shocks vary across the
regimes, the supply and demand equations can be identified.

      In parallel to our empirical strategy motivated by CDM, we also identify demand and
supply shocks following the method of Rigobon (2003). There is suggestive evidence that
in the market for DOTM SPX puts supply shocks are more volatile relative to demand
shocks during the period of the U.S. financial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis.
We thus date the low and high-supply volatility regimes accordingly, and use the price
and quantity measures discussed above to estimate the supply-demand system in (4a–4b).

      The two identification methods presented in Section 2.1 and 2.2 have their respective
advantages. On the one hand, the Rigobon method has the advantage of being based
on a clean set of parametric assumptions, which helps with precise identification of the
supply equation and supply shocks. However, these assumptions might be restrictive and
potentially inconsistent with the data (e.g., the assumption about the linear relations
between prices and quantities, the number of volatility regimes, and whether other
  6

                                                    10
parameters might change across these regimes, etc). On the other hand, the method based
on price-quantity relation does not identify the supply environment or supply shocks as
cleanly, but it imposes weaker assumptions on the demand and supply curve that likely
makes the results more robust.

   After constructing our measures of intermediary constraints, we investigate how these
measures are linked to asset prices. According to the theory of financial intermediary
constraints (see e.g., Gromb and Vayanos (2002) and He and Krishnamurthy (2013)),
variations in the aggregate intermediary constraints not only affect option prices, but also
drive the risk premia of other financial assets. This theory implies that low P N BOt , when
occurring in a period dominated by supply shocks, should imply high future expected
excess returns on the market portfolio. That is, we expect b−
                                                            r < 0 in the following predictive

regression:


 rt+j→t+k = ar + b−                         +
                  r I{bV P,t <0} P N BOt + br I{bV P,t ≥0} P N BOt + cr I{bV P,t <0} + t+j→t+k (5)



where r denotes log market excess return, and the notation t + j → t + k indicates the
leading period from t + j to t + k (k > j ≥ 0). Similarly, we expect η̂t extracted from the
supply-demand system in (4a–4b) to predict future market excess returns as well,


                               rt+j→t+k = as + bs η̂t + t+j→t+k                               (6)


where we expect bs ≤ 0. Besides the market portfolio, the predictability should apply to
other risky assets as well.

   Finally, the empirical strategy and testable hypotheses above are mainly based on
economic intuition. In the Online Appendix, we present a dynamic general equilibrium
model featuring time-varying intermediary constraints. The model not only helps formalize
the main intuition, but generates more rigorous predictions about how intermediary
constraints affect the equilibrium price-quantity dynamics in the crash insurance market,
the aggregate risk premium, and intermediary leverage. Moreover, we can use the calibrated
model to examine the quantitative effects of intermediary constraints on asset prices.

3         Empirical Results

We now present the empirical evidence connecting the option trading activities to the
constraints of the financial intermediaries and the risk premia in financial markets.


3.1        Data

Figure 1 plots the monthly time series of P N BO and its normalized version P N BON .
Consistent with the finding of Pan and Poteshman (2006) and GPP, the net public purchase
of DOTM SPX puts was positive for the majority of the months prior to the financial
crisis in 2008, suggesting that broker-dealers and market-makers were mainly supplying
crash insurance to public investors. A few notable exceptions include the period around
the Asian financial crisis (December 1997), Russian default and the financial crisis in Latin
America (November 1998 to January 1999), the Iraq War (April 2003), and two months in
2005 (March and November 2005).7

        However, starting in 2007, P N BO became significantly more volatile.8 It turned
negative during the quant crisis in August 2007, when a host of quant-driven hedge
funds experienced significant losses. It then rose significantly and peaked in October
2008, following the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. As market conditions continued to
deteriorate, P N BO plunged rapidly and turned significantly negative in the following
months. Following a series of government interventions, P N BO bottomed in April 2009,
rebounded briefly, and then dropped again in December 2009 when the Greek debt crisis
escalated. During the period from November 2008 to December 2012, public investors on
average sold 44,000 DOTM SPX puts to open new positions each month. In contrast, they
bought on average 17,000 DOTM SPX puts each month in the period from 1991 to 2007.

        One reason that the P N BO series appears more volatile in the latter part of the sample
is that the options market (e.g., in terms of total trading volume) has grown significantly
    7
    The GM and Ford downgrades in May 2005 might be related to the negative P N BO in 2005.
    8
    One potential concern is that the volatility of P N BO may be non-stationary. If we apply the structural
break test of Andrews (1993) to the monthly realized volatility (computed from daily P N BO), we find
evidence for a break in the time trend in volatility at τ = March 2007 (Fmax = 50.4 > Fcrit,1% = 15.56).
Subsequent to this break, the point estimate of the time trend is negative, indicating that volatilities
declined (or at least didn’t continue to increase) from this point.

over time. As the bottom panel of Figure 1 shows, after normalizing P N BO with the
total SPX volume (see the definition in (2)), the P N BON series no longer demonstrates
visible trend in volatility.

       Table 1 reports the summary statistics of the option volume and pricing variables
and their correlation coefficients. From January 1991 to December 2012, the public net
buying-to-open volume of DOTM SPX puts (P N BO) is close to 10,000 contracts per
month on average (each contract has a notional size of 100 times the index). In comparison,
the average total open interest for all DOTM SPX puts is around 0.9 million contracts
during the period from January 1996 to December 2012, which highlights the significant
difference between P N BO and open interest. The option volume measures have relatively
modest autocorrelations at monthly frequency (0.61 for P N BO and 0.48 for P N BON )
compared to standard return predictors such as dividend yield and term spread. The
correlation matrix in Panel B shows that the various quantity measures are negatively
related to variance premium (V P ). In addition, both P N BO and P N BON are negatively
correlated with the unemployment rate (see Table IA1 in the Internet Appendix).

       Figure 2 provides information about the trading volume of SPX options at different
moneyness. Over our entire sample, put options account for 63% of the total trading
volume of SPX options. Among put options, out-of-the-money puts account for over 75%
of the total trading volume; in particular, DOTM puts (with K/S < 0.85) account for
23% of the total volume. These statistics demonstrate the importance of the market for
DOTM SPX puts.

       While financial intermediaries can partially hedge the risks of their option inventories
through dynamic hedging, the hedge is imperfect and costly. This is especially true for
DOTM SPX puts, because they are highly sensitive to jump risk that are difficult to
hedge. To demonstrate this point, we regress put option returns on the returns of the
corresponding hedging portfolios at both weekly and daily horizons. We consider both
delta hedging (using the S&P 500 index) and delta-gamma hedging.9 The R2 of these
regressions demonstrate how effective the hedging methods are.
   9
   We restrict the options to be between 15 and 90 days to maturity to ensure liquidity. For delta-gamma
hedging, we use at-the-money puts expiring in the following month in addition to the S&P500 index.

Figure 2: Percentage of total put and call volumes at different moneyness. This
figure plots the total fraction of volume for calls and puts at different levels of moneyness
(measure by strike price, K, divided by spot price S). The height of each bar indicates
the fraction of the total market volume at that moneyness level, while the colors indicate
the breakdown within the strike between public (blue) and private (red) orders.

   As Table 2 shows, with daily (weekly) rebalancing, delta hedging can capture around
72% (76%) of the return variation of ATM SPX puts, but only 41% (34%) of the return
variation of DOTM puts. With delta-gamma hedging, the R2 for ATM puts can exceed
90%, but it is still below 60% for DOTM puts. These results imply that when holding
non-zero inventories of DOTM SPX puts, financial intermediaries will be exposed to
significant inventory risks even after dynamically hedging these positions. It is because of
such inventory risks that financial intermediaries become more reluctant to supply crash
insurance to the public investors when they are more constrained.

3.2    Option volume and the expensiveness of SPX options

We start by investigating the link between P N BO and the expensiveness of SPX options as
proxied by the variance premium (V P ) in Bekaert and Hoerova (2014). Before constructing
the measure bV P,t in Equation (3) for the price-quantity relation based on daily data, we
first examine the relation between P N BO and V P at monthly frequency.

   Table 3 reports the results. In both the cases of P N BO and P N BON , the coefficient
bV P is negative and statistically significant, consistent with the hypothesis that shocks to
intermediary constraints generate a negative relation between the equilibrium quantities
of DOTM SPX puts that public investors purchase and the expensiveness of SPX options.
The coefficient (-94.60) in the univariate regression suggests that a one standard deviation
decrease in P N BO is associated with an increase in V P of 4.82, a 25% increase relative to
the average variance premium. Similarly, a one standard deviation decrease in P N BON
is associated with a 3.15 unit increase in V P .

   After adding the interaction between P N BO and the jump risk measure J into the
regression, the coefficient cV P of the interaction term is significantly negative, which
implies that P N BO and V P are more likely to be negatively related during times of
high jump risk, and that their relation can turn positive when jump risk is sufficiently
low. To understand the economic magnitude of the coefficient cV P , we can compare how
the marginal effect of P N BO on V P , bV P + cV P J, changes for different levels of jump
risk. Our estimates imply that a one standard deviation decrease in P N BO is associated

with an increase in V P of 1.41 when J is one standard deviation below its mean, while
the increase in V P is 5.71 when J is one standard deviation above its mean. Similar
calculations show that the marginal effect of P N BON on V P is even more sensitive to
J. The result is again consistent with the intermediary constraint theory, as the effects
of shocks to intermediary constraints on the supply of DOTM SPX puts by financial
intermediaries tend to strengthen when the aggregate tail risk is high.

   In contrast, when we replace P N BO with the public net buying volume for all other
SPX options excluding DOTM puts (P N BON D ), not only are the R2 of the regressions
smaller, but the regression coefficients bV P and cV P are no longer significantly different
from zero. As we have demonstrated in Table 2, DOTM SPX puts are more difficult
to hedge and hence expose intermediaries to higher inventory risks. Thus, the trading
activities of DOTM SPX puts are likely to be more informative about the fluctuations in
intermediary constraints compared to those for other options.

   Garleanu, Pedersen, and Poteshman (2009) shows that exogenous public demand
shocks can generate a positive relation between net public demand for index options and


                                                        18
measures of option expensiveness. They find support for this prediction using data from
October 1997 to December 2001. Bollen and Whaley (2004) also find evidence of the
effects of public demand pressure on option pricing in daily data.

   Our results above are not a rejection of the effect of demand shocks on option prices.
In Section 4.5, we replicate the results of Table 2 in GPP and show that the different time
periods is the main reason for the opposite signs of the price-quantity relation in the two
papers. Conceptually, the demand pressure theory and the intermediary constraint theory
share the common assumption of constrained intermediaries, and both can be at work in
the data. For instance, our results in Table 3 show that the price-quantity relation is more
likely to be negative (positive) when the jump risk in the market is high (low), indicating
that the supply (demand) effects tend to become dominant under such conditions.

   Next, we estimate the monthly price-quantity relation measure bV P,t from regression (3)
using daily data. The fact that demand effects and supply effects are both present in
the data is again evident. Out of 264 months, the coefficient bV P,t is negative in 159
(significant at 5% level in 44 of them), and positive in 105 (significant at 5% level in 24
of them). These statistics suggest that, according to the price-quantity relation, shocks
to intermediary constraints are present in a significant part of our sample period. The
months that have significantly negative price-quantity relations include periods in the
Asian financial crisis, Russian default, the 2008 financial crisis, and several episodes during
the European debt crisis.10


3.3     Option volume and risk premia

We now examine the predictions from Section 2 linking P N BO and risk premia in the
financial markets.

   For initial exploration, we run the basic univariate return-forecasting regression using
P N BO and P N BON . Table 4 shows that P N BO has strong predictive power for future
market excess returns up to 4 months ahead. The coefficient estimate br for predicting

direct application of the CDM method to identify supply environments.

one-month ahead market excess returns is −24.26 (t-stat of -3.45),11 with R2 of 7.7%.
For 4-month ahead returns (rt+3→t+4 ), the coefficient estimate is −18.05 and statistically
significant (t-stat of -2.36), and R2 drops to 4.3%. From 5 months out, the predictive
coefficient is no longer statistically significant. When we aggregate the effect for the
cumulative market excess returns in the next 3 months, the coefficient br is −67.16 (t-
stat of -3.54) and R2 is 18.0%. The economic significance that this coefficient estimate
implies is striking. A one-standard deviation decrease in P N BO is associated with a 3.4%
(non-annualized) increase in the future 3-month market excess return.

       Figure 1 indicates that non-stationarity might be a potential concern for P N BO. The
autocorrelation of P N BO is only 0.61 and a Phillips-Perron test strongly rejects the
null of a unit root (see Table 1). However, non-stationarity may arise elsewhere, e.g.,
through the 2nd moment. For this reason, we also use the normalized P N BO to predict
market excess returns. Table 4 shows that, like P N BO, P N BON also predicts future
market returns negatively. The coefficient estimate br remains statistically significant
  11
    All the standard errors for the return-forecasting regressions are based on Hodrick (1992). We provide
additional results on statistical inference in Table IA2 in the Internet Appendix, including Newey and
West (1987) standard errors with long lags, bootstrapped confidence intervals, and the test statistic of
Muller (2014). See Ang and Bekaert (2007) for further discussion on long-horizon statistical inference.

up to 4 months ahead, but with lower R2 than P N BO at all horizons. The difference
in R2 between P N BON and P N BO shows that we should interpret the high R2 for
P N BO with caution, which could partially be due to its volatility trend. As for economic
significance, a one-standard deviation decrease in P N BON is associated with a 2.5%
increase in the future 3-month market excess return.

       While P N BO shows predictive power for market risk premia in the full sample, theories
of intermediary constraints imply that the predictive power should be concentrated in
periods when variations in P N BO are mainly driven by changes in supply conditions.
In Section 2, we have proposed to identify supply environments based on the negative
price-quantity relation (bV P,t < 0), and we expect high level of jump risks (Jt ) to also help
with identifying such environments under certain assumptions. Next, we examine how the
predictive power of P N BO changes in the sub-samples identified by bV P,t and Jt .

       Table 5 shows that the predictive power of both P N BO and P N BON are indeed
stronger (in terms of both economic and statistical significance) during the periods of
negative price-quantity relation and during periods of high jump risks.12 For example,
when bV P,t < 0, a one-standard deviation decrease in P N BO (P N BON ) is associated
with a 4.1% (3.0%) increase in the future 3-month market excess return. The coefficient
for P N BO becomes considerably smaller in the sub-sample when bV P,t is positive, and it
becomes insignificant for P N BON .

       We then further split the full sample into 4 sub-sample periods based on the two
                                 ¯ 13 Table 5 shows that for both P N BO and P N BON ,
criteria (bV P,t < (≥)0, Jt < (≥)J).
the predictive power is the strongest when bV P,t < 0 and the level of jump risk is high. If
bV P ≥ 0 and jump risk is low, then the coefficient br becomes positive and insignificant for
both measures, and the R2 drops to near zero.

       In summary, the sub-sample results suggest that our strategy based on the price-
quantity relation does a good job identifying those periods when P N BO are connected to
  12
     We set J¯ to the median for Jt in the full sample. This potentially introduces future information into
the return-forecasting regression. Our results are robust to changing J¯ to only using past information.
  13
     While using the level of jump risk to split the sample is motivated by the difficulty to hedge tail risk,
the correlation between the two dummy variables of whether Jt and V Pt are above their respective sample
medians is 0.97 (the correlation between Jt and V Pt is 0.54), meaning we will obtain essentially the same
results if we split the samples based on V Pt .

variations in intermediary constraints and in turn the conditional market risk premia. For
the remainder of the paper, we use the regression specification (5), which summarizes the
sub-sample results succinctly.

    To investigate whether the predictability results above are useful in forming real-
time forecasts, we follow Welch and Goyal (2008) and compute the out-of-sample R2
for P N BO and P N BON based on various sample-split dates, starting in January 1996
(implying a minimum estimation period of 5 years) and ending in December 2007 (with
a minimum evaluation period of 5 years). We consider the wide range of sample-split
dates because recent studies suggest that sample splits themselves can be data-mined
(Hansen and Timmermann (2012)). In forming the return forecasts, we first estimate the
predictability regression (5) during the estimation period (from date 1 to t), and then use
the estimated coefficients to forecast the 3-month future market excess return for t + 1.
After obtaining all the return forecasts, we then compute the mean squared forecast errors
for the predictability model (M SEA ) and the historical mean model (M SEN ) in various

an an out-of-sample R2 above 5% for all the sample splits and remains above 10% in the
later period. All of the out-of-sample R2 are significant at the 5% level (1% level since
2000) based on the MSE-F statistic by McCracken (2007).

   Panel B of Figure 3 plots the in-sample R2 from the predictive regressions of P N BO
and P N BON using 5-year moving windows. The two R2 s vary significantly over time.
They are low at the beginning of the sample. Both R2 rise to near 18% in the period around
the Asian financial crisis and Russian default in 1997-98. During the 2008-9 financial crisis
period, the R2 rise above 40%. These high R2 for the return-forecasting regressions would
translate into striking Sharpe ratios for investment strategies that try to exploit such

                                                 23
predictability. For example, Cochrane (1999) shows that the best unconditional Sharpe
ratio s∗ for a market timing strategy is related to the predictability regression R2 by
                                              p
                                              s2 + R 2
                                        s∗ = √ 0       ,
                                              1 − R2

where s0 is the unconditional Sharpe ratio of a buy-and-hold strategy. Assuming the
Sharpe ratio of the market portfolio is 0.5, then an R2 of 40% implies a Sharpe ratio for
the market timing strategy that exceeds 1. Such high Sharpe ratios could persist during
the financial crisis because of the presence of severe financial constraints that prevent
arbitrageurs from taking advantage of the investment opportunities.

       Theories of intermediary constraints argue that variations in the constraints not only
will affect the risk premium of the market portfolio, but also the risk premia on any
financial assets for which the financial intermediaries are the marginal investor. Having
examined the ability of P N BO to predict future market excess returns, we now apply the
predictability regressions to other asset classes.

       Among the assets we consider are (1) high-yield corporate bonds (based on the Barclays
U.S. Corporate High Yield total return index), (2) hedge funds (based on the HFRI fund-
weighted average return index), (3) carry trade (constructed by Lustig, Roussanov, and
Verdelhan, 2011, using the exchange rates of 15 developed countries), (4) commodity
(based on the Goldman Sachs commodity index excess return series), (5) the 10-year US
Treasury, and (6) variance swap for the S&P 500 index returns (with the excess return
defined as the log ratio of the realized annualized return variance over the swap rate; see
e.g., Carr and Wu, 2009).14

       As benchmark, the first row of Table 6 restates the predictability results for equity
(market excess returns). It then shows that, our constraint measures predict the future
excess returns for a variety of assets besides equity. In periods with bV P,t < 0, P N BO
predicts negatively and statistically significantly (at least at the 10% level) the future
3-month returns of high yield bonds, hedge funds, carry trade, and commodity (for

P N BON , the coefficient b−
                           r for carry trade and commodity returns are still negative but

insignificant). Thus, like the market portfolio, the risk premia on these assets tend to
rise when the intermediary constraints tighten. The predictive power of P N BO on these
asset returns is also economically significant. For example, in a supply environment, a one
standard deviation decrease of P N BO is associated with a 2.8% and 1.6% increase in the
subsequent 3-month expected excess returns of the high-yield bond index and the hedge
fund index, respectively.

   Next, both for P N BO and P N BON , the predictive coefficient b−
                                                                   r is positive and

significant for the 3-month excess returns of the 10-year Treasury and the S&P 500
variance swap. Here, a one standard deviation decrease of P N BO in a supply environment
is associated with a 1% and 68% decrease in the subsequent 3-month expected excess

                                                  25
returns of 10-year Treasuries and variance swaps, respectively. The result on Treasuries is
consistent with Fontaine and Garcia (2012), who find the deterioration in funding liquidity
predicts lower risk premia for Treasuries. Intuitively, when financial intermediaries become
constrained, Treasury values tend to rise (“flight to quality”) as does the volatility in the
market. Thus, Treasuries and (pay-fix) variance swaps provide a hedge against negative
shocks to intermediary constraints.


3.4    An alternative hypothesis

The above return predictability results have two alternative interpretations. It is possible
that financial intermediaries become more constrained when the market risk premium
rises (e.g., due to higher aggregate uncertainty in the real economy), which in turn reduces
their capacity to provide market crash insurance to public investors. As a result, a low
P N BO today would be associated with high future market returns, even though a tighter
intermediary constraint does not cause the market risk premium to rise in this case.
Alternatively, it is possible that intermediary constraints directly affect the aggregate
market risk premium, which is a central prediction in intermediary asset pricing theories.

   To distinguish between these two interpretations, we compare P N BO against a number
of financial and macro variables that have been shown to predict market returns. If P N BO
is merely correlated with the standard risk factors and does not directly affect the risk
premium, then the inclusion of the proper risk factors into the predictability regression
should drive away the predictive power of P N BO. The variables we consider include the
difference between implied and historical volatility used in Bollerslev, Tauchen, and Zhou
(2009) (IV RV ), the log dividend yield (d − p) of the market portfolio, the log net payout
yield (lcrspnpy) by Boudoukh, Michaely, Richardson, and Roberts (2007), the Baa-Aaa
credit spread (DEF), the 10-year minus 3-month Treasury term spread (TERM), the tail
risk measure (Tail) by Kelly and Jiang (2014), the slope of the implied volatility curve
(IVSlope), and the consumption-wealth ratio measure (d
                                                     cay) by Lettau and Ludvigson
(2001). All the variables are available monthly except for cd
                                                            ay, which is at quarterly
frequency.


                                             26
       Table 7 shows that, with the inclusion of the various competing variables, the predictive
coefficient b−
             r remains significantly negative and remarkably stable in magnitude for both

P N BO and P N BON . Comparing the R2 from the regressions in Table 7 and the
regression with only P N BO (or P N BON ) (first row, Table 6), we see that the incremental
explanatory power for future market excess returns mostly comes from P N BO (P N BON )
interacted with the price-quantity relation indicator.15

       In summary, the results from Table 7 show that the option trading activities of public
investors and financial intermediaries contain unique information about the market risk
premium that is not captured by the standard macro and financial factors. This result is
consistent with the theories of intermediary constraints driving asset prices. Of course,
the evidence above does not prove that intermediary constraints actually drive aggregate
risk premia. It is possible that P N BO is correlated with other risk factors not considered
in our specifications.


3.5       Option volume and measures of funding constraints

We have presented evidence linking P N BO negatively with option expensiveness and
market risk premium when IbV P,t <0 , which is consistent with the interpretation that low
P N BO is a sign of tight intermediary constraints. Thus, IbV P,t <0 × P N BONt can be
viewed as a measure of intermediary constraint. We now compare this measure to several
measures of financial intermediary funding constraints proposed in the literature.

       These measures include the year-over-year change in broker-dealer leverage advocated
by Adrian, Moench, and Shin (2010) (∆lev), the fixed-income market based funding
liquidity measure by Fontaine and Garcia (2012) (FG), the TED spread (TED, the
difference between 3-month LIBOR and 3-month T-bill rate), and the LIBOR-OIS spread
(LIBOR-OIS, the difference between 3-month LIBOR and 3-month overnight indexed swap
  15
    In theory, variation in risk premium due to intermediary constraints should affect variables such as
the dividend-price ratio. The reason that d − p does not show significant predictive power in Table 7
in the presence of P N BO could be that d − p is affected by both the variations in discount rates and
expected dividend growth, and that transitory fluctuations in the discount rate caused by fluctuations in
intermediary constraints have limited effects on prices.

rate).16 TED spread and LIBOR-OIS spread measure the credit risk of banks.

       We first run OLS regressions of our constraint measure on the funding constraint
measures in the literature. As Panel A of Table 8 shows, TED spread is significantly
positively related to IbV P,t <0 × P N BOt , but insignificantly related to IbV P,t <0 × P N BONt .
The positive relation between TED spread and IbV P,t <0 × P N BOt is mainly due to the
fact that P N BO rose significantly along with the TED spread during the early part of
the financial crisis. Subsequently, while P N BO becomes lower (and turned significantly
negative), the TED spread also fell and then remained at low levels. This result points
out a potential weakness of TED spread (and LIBOR-OIS) as a measure of funding
constraint. TED spread could become lower due to banks reducing their own credit risk
through deleveraging, reducing risk taking, and buying crash insurance, but that does not
necessarily imply banks are less constrained (could be the opposite).

       Next, our constraint measure is significantly negatively related to the measure FG. This
is consistent with FG’s interpretation that financial intermediaries are more constrained
(low P N BO) in periods when the value of funding liquidity is high (high FG). In the
quarterly regression, our constraint measure is significantly positively related to the growth
rate in broker-dealer leverage ∆lev. That is, intermediary constraint tends to be tight
(low P N BO) when broker-dealers are de-leveraging (low ∆lev).17

       In Panel B of Table 8, we further examine the ability of the various funding constraint
measures to predict aggregate market returns. Adrian, Moench, and Shin (2010) show
that ∆lev has strong predictive power for excess returns on stocks, corporate bonds, and
treasuries. In a univariate regression (unreported) with ∆lev, we find similar results in our
sample period. When joint with our constraint measure, the coefficient on ∆lev becomes
insignificant in the case of P N BO and marginally significant in the case of P N BON ,
while b−
       r remains significant. Similarly, when the other funding constraint measures are

used in place of ∆lev, the coefficient b−
                                        r is always highly significant. These results suggest

that relative to other funding constraint measures, our intermediary constraint measure
  16
      We also examine the funding constraint measure by Hu, Pan, and Wang (2013) and the CBOE VIX
index (VIX). Neither of them is statistically significantly related to PNBO.
   17
      He, Kelly, and Manela (2017) show that the leverage of commercial banks became higher during the
financial crisis while that of broker-dealers fell.

3.6     Econometric identification of supply shocks

Since equilibrium prices and quantities are jointly determined by supply and demand, a key
element in establishing a causal link between supply and risk premia would be a method of
identifying exogenous shocks to supply. Rigobon (2003) solves the identification problem
in the supply and demand equations (4a–4b) through heteroscedasticity. We implement
this method using V P as the price variable and P N BO (or P N BON ) as the quantity
variable. Following Rigobon (2003) (who uses crisis periods in debt markets to identify
movement in bond markets in Latin America), we consider the high supply volatility
(relative to demand volatility) regime for our identification as the period from September
2008 (the Lehman default) to November 2011 (cancellation of Greek referendum). The
second regime is the remainder of our sample.

    The results of the estimation are shown in Table 9. We see when using either P N BO
or P N BON as the quantity measure, there is a statistically significant positive (negative)
slope for the supply (demand) curve. The point estimates indicate that a one-standard
deviation increase in the variance premium (an increase of 21.7) is associated with an
increased quantity of 103,000 deep out-of-the-money put contracts, which represents an
increase of 2.02 standard deviations to the equilibrium quantity. In terms of the normalized
measure P N BON , a one-standard deviation increase in the variance premium results in
an increased quantity of 5.8% times the trailing 3-month volume of SPX options.

    Table 10 reproduces the predictability results of Table 4 replacing P N BO and P N BON
with the extracted supply shocks and normalized supply shocks.18 The extracted supply
shock is strongly related to P N BO with a correlation of 0.71. Overall, the predictability
with the extracted shocks is very similar to what we found with P N BO and P N BON ,
which reinforces our interpretation of the results.

    However, we temper this evidence with a caveat based on the assumptions of the
  18
     In the regression, we use the Hodrick (1992) standard errors to be consistent with the remainder of
the paper, which do not correct for the error in variables associated with uncertainty in the parameters
used to extract the supply shocks.

shocks assumes linear and stationary supply/demand relationships, and zero correlation

4      Robustness Checks

In this section, we report the results of several robustness checks for our main results.


4.1     Financial crisis

One potential concern regarding the predictive power of P N BO is that it might be driven
by a small number of outliers, in particular the 2008-09 financial crisis. To address this
concern, Table 11 reports the results of the return-forecasting regressions in two sub-
samples: pre-crisis (1991/01-2007/11) and post-crisis (2009/06-2012/12). The predictive
powers of P N BO and P N BON remain statistically significant in both sub-samples. The
  19
    One could easily imagine non-linear relationships (such as a dependency on the level of jump risk) or
slope coefficients that vary with the volatility regime, as well as non-zero correlation between supply and
demand shocks due to exogenous factors simultaneously driving supply and demand.

economic significance of the predictive power is weaker in the pre-crisis period than in the
full sample (in terms of smaller magnitude of b−            2
                                               r and lower R ), but it is quite strong in the

post-crisis period. Thus, the predictive power of our measure of intermediary constraint
is not just a crisis phenomenon. The weaker predictive power for P N BO in the earlier
sample period could be due to the fact that intermediary constraints are not as significant
and volatile in the first half of the sample. Another reason might be that the SPX options
market was less developed in the early periods and did not play as important a role in
facilitating risk sharing as it does today.


4.2     Moneyness

Next, we examine how the predictive power of P N BO changes based on option moneyness.
Our baseline definition of DOTM puts uses a simple cutoff rule K/S ≤ 0.85. Panel A
of Figure 4 plots the coefficient b−
                                   r and the confidence intervals as we change this cutoff

value for SPX puts. The coefficient b−
                                     r in the return forecast regression is significantly

negative for a wide range of moneyness cutoffs. The point estimate of b−
                                                                       r does become

more negative as the cutoff becomes smaller. Because DOTM puts are more difficult to

hedge than ATM puts, they expose financial intermediaries to more inventory risks. Hence,
P N BO measure based on DOTM puts should be more informative about intermediary
constraints and in turn the aggregate risk premium than P N BO based on ATM puts. At
the same time, because far out-of-money options are less liquid, the P N BO series becomes
more noisy when we further reduce the cutoff, which widens the confidence interval on b−
                                                                                       r .

In contrast, Panel B shows that for essentially all moneyness cutoffs, P N BO based on
SPX call options does not predict market returns.

    A feature of our definition of DOTM puts above is that a constant strike-to-price cutoff
implies different actual moneyness (e.g., as measured by option delta) for options with
different maturities. A 15% drop in price over one month might seem very extreme in
calm periods, but it is more likely when market volatility is high. For this reason, we
also examine a maturity-adjusted moneyness definition. Specifically, we classify a put
                                    √
option as DOTM when K/S ≤ 1 + kσt T , where k is a constant, σt is the daily S&P
return volatility in the previous 30 trading days, and T is the days to maturity for the
option. This is similar to using option delta to define moneyness, but does not require
a particular pricing model to compute the delta. Panel C of Figure 4 shows that this
alternative classification of DOTM puts produces qualitatively similar results as our simple
cutoff rule. Panel D shows again that P N BO based on SPX calls and this alternative

S&P returns scaled by the square root of days to maturity (see Section 4.2).


moneyness cutoff does not predict returns.


4.3     Volume vs. open interest

In our construction of P N BO, we focus on the net amount of new DOTM index puts
that public investors buy in a period. An alternative way to gauge the economic exposure
for public investors and financial intermediaries is to examine the net open interest for
the two groups. Between new volume and open interest, which one better represents the
degree of intermediary constraints?

   We use the volume-based measure in our main analysis for a few reasons. The first
reason is data limitation, as CBOE does not provide daily long and short open interest

                                                                      35
data after 2001. Second, when financial intermediaries become constrained, it is likely
easier (e.g., due to transaction costs) to adjust the quantity of new DOTM puts traded
than to change their established positions. That would make the volume-based measure
more sensitive to changes in intermediary constraints than open interest-based measure.
Third, taking on an option position that is originally near the money but later becomes
DOTM due to market movements is different from taking on a new DOTM option. In the
former case, the intermediaries can put on hedges against tail risk over time, which again
means these positions are less sensitive to changes in intermediary constraints.

   Nonetheless, we provide two robustness checks. First, we examine an alternative
measure based on the end-of-month public net open interest for DOTM SPX puts (P N OI).
The results are discussed below. Second, we construct a P N BO measure using only one-
month options, for which the monthly measures of net volume and open interest are
equivalent. We find that the main results hold for the measure based on short-dated
options (see Table IA4 in the Internet Appendix).

   For the period of 1991 to 2001, we use daily long and short open interest provided by
CBOE to compute P N OI. From 2001 onward, we compute daily net open interest from
the volume information as follows:


    N OIdK,T = N OId−1
                   K,T
                       + openBuydK,T − openSelldK,T + closeBuydK,T − closeSellK,T
                                                                              d ,         (7)


where N OIdK,T is the public investor net open interest of options with strike price K and
maturity T on day d, openBuy is the public investor buying volume from initiating long
positions, openSell is the selling volume from initiating short, closeBuy is the buying
volume from closing existing short positions, and closeSell is the selling volume from closing
existing long positions. We then aggregate N OIdK,T to compute daily net open interest of
DOTM puts (P N OI). We also consider a normalized version of P N OI (P N OIN ), which
is P N OI divided by the sum of public long and short open interest for all SPX options.

   Table 1 shows that the end-of-month P N OI is around 29,000 contracts on average,
and P N OI has higher autocorrelation than P N BO. Table 12 shows that, like P N BO,
P N OI predicts future market excess returns negatively in the periods with bV P,t < 0, with

4.4      Public investors: retail vs. institutional

As Figure 1 shows, while financial intermediaries typically sell DOTM SPX puts to public
investors during normal times, the roles are often reversed during crisis times, most notably
during the 2008-09 financial crisis. To understand the risk sharing mechanism between
financial intermediaries and public investors, it is informative to find out who among the
public investors are the “liquidity providers,” reducing the demand for crash insurance
or even providing insurance to the intermediaries when the latter become constrained.
The SPX volume data from CBOE do not provide further information about the types of
public investors behind a given transaction (e.g., retail vs. institutional investors). We
tackle this question by comparing the trading activities of the public investors in SPX



                                                 37
options with those in SPY options.

       While SPX and SPY options have essentially identical underlying asset, it is well
known among practitioners that institutional investors account for a significantly higher
percentage of the trading volume of SPX options than do SPY options. Compared to
retail investors, institutional investors prefer SPX options due to a larger contract size (10
times as large as SPY), cash settlement, more favorable tax treatment, as well as being
more capable of trading in between the relatively wide bid-ask spreads of SPX options
due to stronger bargaining power. We construct P N BOSP Y for SPY options using the
same procedure as P N BO, which covers the period from 2005/05 to 2012/12. While SPX
options trade exclusively on the CBOE, SPY options are cross-listed at several option
exchanges. P N BOSP Y aggregates the volume from the CBOE and International Securities
Exchange (ISE), which account for about half of the total trading volume for SPY options.

       Figure 5 compares the P N BOSP Y and P N BOSP X (equivalent to P N BO) series.
During the period of 2005/05 to 2012/01, P N BOSP Y is positive in the majority of the
months. From 2008/09 to 2010/12, P N BOSP X is negative in 22 out of 28 months, whereas
P N BOSP Y is negative in just 7 of the 28 months.

       A systematic way to examine the difference in how the equilibrium quantities of
trading in the two markets are connected to the intermediary constraints and market
risk premium is through the regressions of (3) and (5). These results are reported in the
Online Appendix, and we summarize the main findings here. Unlike SPX, the P N BO
measure based on SPY is insignificantly (positively) related to the variance premium
on average, and does not predict future market excess returns. The contrast between
SPX and SPY suggests that institutional investors and retail investors respond differently
to the changes in intermediary constraints. In particular, when constrained financial
intermediaries start buying crash insurance, they appear to be buying the insurance from
the public (institutional) investors in the SPX market and not from the public (retail)
investors in the SPY market.20

    Notice that this difference in public investor trading behaviors between the two markets does not
necessarily imply arbitrage.

4.5     Comparison with GPP

Our results on the price-quantity relation in the DOTM SPX puts market is related to
Garleanu, Pedersen, and Poteshman (2009). However, our results differ from GPP in
several aspects. First, we have a longer sample period, from 1991 to 2012, while theirs is
from 1996 to 2001. Second, our P N BO measure uses contemporaneous public net-buying
volume, while GPP use public net open interest,21 which is the accumulation of past
net-buying volumes. Third, our P N BO measure focuses on DOTM SPX puts, whereas
GPP use options of all moneyness (which is similar to the sum of P N BO and P N BON D
in this regard). In this section, we first replicate the main results of GPP (in Table 2,
p4287), and then examine the differences between the two studies.

   The dependent variable in Table 13, option expensiveness, is the same as the one used
in GPP Table 2, i.e., the average implied volatility of ATM options minus a reference
model-implied volatility used in Bates (2006).22 GPP regress the option expensiveness
  21
     GPP aggregate the net demand of both public investors and firm investors, and refer to it as the
non-market-maker demand.

The table reports the results from regressing option expensiveness, measured by the average
implied volatility of ATM options minus a reference model-implied volatility used in Bates (2006),
on measures of option demand. NetDemand and JumpRisk are the equal- and vega-weighted
public net open interest (or net volume) for all SPX options. t-stats are computed based on
Newey and West (1987) standard errors with 10 lags. (∗∗∗ ,∗∗ ,∗ ) denote significance at 1%, 5%,
and 10%, respectively.

on several measures of SPX non-market-maker demand pressure, including the equal-
weighted public open interest (NetDemand), and public open interest weighted by jump
risk (JumpRisk). They find the regression coefficients to be positive in the period from
1997/10 to 2001/12.

   In Table 13, we obtain very similar results to GPP for the two sub-samples 1996/01-
1996/10 and 1997/10-2001/12 for the open interest-based measures. We also construct
two net volume-based measures and again find that they are positively related to option
expensiveness in the period from 1997/10 to 2001/12.

   Next, for the period 2002-2012, we use daily volume data to extend the net open
interest measures (constructed using the procedure described in Section 4.3). In this
subsample, We find that the coefficients on both the open interest and volume-based
measures become negative and statistically significant. This finding is consistent with our
finding of a negative price-quantity relation in the full sample (see Table 3). The changing
signs of the price-quantity relation in different sub-samples suggest that the effects of
demand shocks and supply shocks are both present in the SPX option market.



                                                  40
5    Conclusion

We provide evidence that the trading activities of financial intermediaries in the market
of DOTM SPX put options are informative about the degree of intermediary constraints.
In periods when supply shocks are likely to be the main force behind the variations in
the price-quantity relation in the DOTM SPX put market, our public investor net-buying
volume measure, P N BO, has strong predictive power for future market excess returns
and the returns for a range of other financial assets. The predictive power of P N BO is
stronger during periods when the market jump risk is high, and it is stronger for DOTM
puts. P N BO is also associated with several funding liquidity measures in the literature.
Moreover, the information that P N BO contains about the market risk premium is not
captured by the standard financial and macro variables. These results suggest that time-
varying intermediary constraints are driving the supply of crash insurance by financial
intermediaries and the risk premia in financial markets.

A      Physical Jump Risk
The construction of the jump risk measure J follows Bekaert and Hoerova (2014) and
Corsi, Pirino, and Reno (2010), which we briefly outline here. The monthly jump J is the
average of daily jump J d , which is defined as

                                   Jtd = max[RVtd − T BP Vtd , 0],                           (A1)

where RVtd is the S&P500 daily realized variance (based on 5-minute returns), and T BP Vtd
stands for threshold bipower variation, which is defined as follows (see Corsi, Pirino, and
Reno, 2010, equation (2.14)):
                                            N
                                      1    X
                      T BP Vtd   =             |rj−1 · rj | · Irj−1
                                                                2   ≤ϑj−1 · Irj2 ≤ϑj .       (A2)
                                   0.79792 j=2

Here, rj is the jth 5-minute return on day t; ϑj is a stochastic threshold,

                                                ϑj = c2ϑ · Vˆj ,                             (A3)

where cϑ is a scale-free constant (set to 3), and Vˆj is an auxiliary estimator of variance,
which is estimated through the following iteration,
                          PL                    i
                                                2
                                                    
                           i=−L,i6=−1,0,1   K  rj+i
                                                L
                                                    I{r2 ≤c2 ·V̂ Z−1 }
               V̂jZ
                                                       j+i    ϑ j+i
                      =    PL                i
                                                                      ,     Z = 1, 2, ...   (A4)
                            i=−L,i6=−1,0,1 K L
                                                 I{rj+i ≤cϑ ·V̂j+i }
                                                     2     2    Z−1




The starting value is V̂j0 = +∞. In each iteration step, large returns are eliminated based
on the condition rj2 > c2ϑ · V̂jZ−1 , and the iteration stops when there are no more large
returns to remove. The bandwidth parameter L determines the number of adjacent returns
included in the estimation of the local variance around point j (with the observation
at j and the two adjacent ones excluded). We set L = 25 and use a Gaussian kernel
            √
K(y) = (1/ 2π) exp(−y 2 /2).


B     Additional Empirical Results
To check whether our supply-environment indicator IbV P,t <0 does a good job identifying
important events of supply shocks, Table A1 shows the value of our indicator during a set
of months in which significant events have occurred in the financial markets, and which are
likely associated with either positive or negative supply shocks for financial intermediaries.

                                                        42
In addition, Table A1 also reports the value of the indicators based on sign of bV P,t and
the CDM method from November 2007 to June 2009, the period of the 2008 financial
crisis. Outside the 2008 crisis, the strategy based on the sign of bV P,t identifies the major
events seven times out of ten, whereas the CDM strategy identifies two events. Inside the
2008 crisis, the two indicators both pick up 12 out of 20 months.
    Additional empirical results and robustness checks are provided in the Internet Ap-
pendix. They include (1) a table of correlations between P N BO and various macroe-
conomic and financial variables (Table IA2); (2) systematic analysis of the statistical
significance for the return-forecasting regressions using P BN O and P N BON (Table
IA3); (3) return-forecasting regression with P N BO1month (and P N BON1month ), which is
P N BO constructed using only options with one month or less to maturity (Table IA4); (4)
sub-sample return-forecasting regressions with P N OI (Table IA5); (5) return-forecasting
regression with P N B (and P N BN ), which is the public net buy volume for DOTM
SPX puts including both open and close transactions (Table IA6); (6) return-forecasting
regression using a modified CDM method (Table IA7); (7) return-forecasting regression
using bV P + cV P Jt as indicator (Table IA8); (8) sub-sample return-forecasting regressions
with the log dividend-price ratio (Table IA9).
