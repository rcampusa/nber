                                              ABSTRACT

In this paper, we highlight the potential for linked employer-employee data to be used in entrepreneurship
research, describing new data on business start-ups, their founders and early employees, and providing
examples of how they can be used in entrepreneurship research. Linked employer-employee data provides
a unique perspective on new business creation by combining information on the business, workforce,
and individual. By combining data on both workers and firms, linked data can investigate many questions
that owner-level or firm-level data cannot easily answer alone - such as composition of the workforce
at start-ups and their role in explaining business dynamics, the flow of workers across new and established
firms, and the employment paths of the business owners themselves.

1 Introduction

       Linked employer-employee data fill an important gap in the set of data to study
entrepreneurship, shedding light on questions that cannot be addressed using firm or individual-
level data alone. For researchers interested in start-up firms and their founders, data identifying
the transition of the entrepreneur from the workforce to founder of a new firm is of inherent
interest. How workers move from being employees to entrepreneurs, who they recruit for start-
up teams, and what predicts starts, successes, and failures is key to understanding the dynamics
of entrepreneurial activity in the United States. Policymakers are interested in entrepreneurship
in part because they are interested in job growth. Linked employer-employee data show who
works for new firms and whether these firms are creating “good” jobs. Labor market
agglomeration effects are widely acknowledged to be important in the spatial clustering of
technological or innovative industries. Yet labor market flows across firms are difficult to
understand with business or household-level data alone.

       In this paper, we discuss the potential of linked employer-employee data to study
entrepreneurship, and provide a road map for researchers interested in using these data. We will
discuss both the confidential microdata and public use data derived from linked employer-
employee data. Linked employer-employee microdata for the U.S. are currently available to
approved researchers working in restricted data centers. However, the Census Bureau has
recently stepped up efforts to create new public use data about young firms using linked
employer-employee data as part of the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD)
program. The result is new public use data on workforce composition, hiring, turnover, and
earnings paid to workers at young firms. Because these new statistics are sourced from
administrative data, they are available at much finer geographic and industry detail than is
usually available in public use statistics. While lacking the flexibility of the confidential
microdata, these new statistics bring many of the benefits of the linked employer-employee data
into the public domain for easier research access.

       Specifically, our goals in this paper are threefold:

       (1)        To familiarize researchers with the U.S. linked employer-employee data and
                  how it can be used in entrepreneurship research;


                                                 2
       (2)        To describe newly available public use statistics derived from linked
                  employer-employee data and provide examples of how it can be used to study
                  entrepreneurship; and
       (3)        To outline future plans to expand the set of available data to study
                  entrepreneurship by linking in new administrative data sources on self-
                  employment and partnerships, as well as identifying the employment history
                  and human capital formation of entrepreneurs themselves.

       This chapter begins with a brief overview of the current landscape of data available for
empirical research on entrepreneurship. We then describe the linked employer-employee
microdata in more detail, and provide information on how to access the data. Subsequent
sections describe new public use data tabulated from the linked employer-employee data, and
provide specific examples of how it can be used to study workforce and earnings dynamics in
new firms. The last section of the paper outlines a vision for future work to build new statistical
infrastructure to support entrepreneurship research from linked worker-firm administrative data.

2 An Overview of Available Data for Entrepreneurship Research

       Entrepreneurship has long been acknowledged to play an important role in modern
economies by spurring innovation, creating jobs, and enhancing productivity. However, only in
the last few decades has entrepreneurship flourished as a research area within economics. Data
on entrepreneurial activity are necessary for any empirical research on determinats of
entrepreneurship and the impact of entrepreneurship on the economy. Yet the existing statistical
infrastructure is in many ways inadequate to investigate questions around business formation and
innovative activity. Despite several new data sources made available in the last decade, many
important data gaps remain.

       Currently available data to study entrepreneurship include firm-level or owner-level
microdata, as well as published aggregate statistics. Table 1 details the most commonly used
publically available data in entrepreneurship research. Information on entrepreneurs typically
comes from household- or business-level surveys, mostly as cross-sectional snapshots, although
a few smaller panel datasets are available. The Current Population Survey (CPS), the Survey of
Consumer Finance (SCF), the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), and the National


                                                3
Longitudinal Surveys (NLS), and the other household surveys listed here ask a similar small set
of questions concerning self-employment and business ownership. 1 Data on both founders and
their businesses are available in the Census Bureau’s Survey of Business Owners (SBO), and the
Kauffman Firm Survey (KFS). With regard to business-level data on new firms, statistics on
start-ups and established firms are available in the Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS) and the
Business Employment Dynamics (BED). The creation of the BDS and BED has led to a growth
of research documenting the importance of new businesses for job creation and economic
growth. The Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI), derived from LEHD microdata, are a
relatively recent addition to this list which we will describe in greater detail later in this paper.

        Most existing data sources are limited in their ability to depict the interaction between
start-ups and their human assets, including owner, founding team members and early employees.
The omission of human capital, which can strongly influence both the nature and the success of a
new business, increasingly leaves researchers of entrepreneurship at a disadvantage as the U.S.
economy becomes more service-oriented and knowledge-based. Data that contain information on
owners or workers are typically unable to follow the business over time, or else only provide
dynamic information on a limited sample of business entrants. These shortcomings make it
difficult to study the impact of factors such as owner characteristics and experience on the
outcomes of start-ups, and measure the potentially changing effects over time.

        The scope of entrepreneurship research is fairly broad, but there are many research
questions for which longitudinally linked employer-employee data is especially useful. Table 2
lists some of the broad questions in the field of entrepreneurship research (along with a selection
of representative studies), and with some specific examples of how linked employer-employee
data can be employed in the study of these topics. For instance, several researchers have noted
that young firms typically hire younger workers (e.g., Ouimet and Zarutski, (2014)) spawning
wider interest in exploring how labor-related factors can influence the success of new ventures.
Detailed data on labor market flows across firms are well suited for investigating subjects like
agglomeration economies, labor market spillovers, and spinoff firms (e.g., Agarwal et al. (2013),
using LEHD microdata). Highly spatial public use data on young firms by detailed industry can

entrepreneurship, see Fairlie (2005).


                                                   4
help explain why regional growth appears to be correlated with the presence of many
small/young firms (e.g., Glaeser, Kerr, and Ponzetto (2010)). Data linking business owners and
their employment histories can help identify the determinants of entrepreneurship and new
business success, a large literature that includes the work of Evans and Leighton (1989), Hurst
and Lusardi (2004), and Hamilton (2000). Planned integration of self-employment data with
linked employer-employee data would enable further investigation into the distinction between
types of entrepreneurship. As only a small subset of entrepreneurs begin their businesses with an
intent to grow, identifying potential high-growth entrepreneurs is of great economic and policy
interest (e.g., Hurst and Pugsley (2011) and Chaterjee and Rossi-Hansberg (2012)).

3 The Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) Data

        The Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program at the U.S. Census
Bureau has built over the last decade a comprehensive linked employer-employee dataset for the
United States. The result of this effort is a comprehensive longitudinal database covering over
95% of U.S. private sector jobs and most public sector employment.

        The LEHD data system is extraordinarily complex, linking data across multiple agencies,
blending administrative and survey data, and filling data gaps with additional source data
whenever possible. The LEHD job-level data comes primarily from quarterly worker-level
earnings submitted by employers for the administration of state unemployment insurance (UI)
benefit programs. Information on federal jobs (not covered by state UI programs) is provided to
Census by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). 2 These job-level records are linked to
establishment-level data collected for the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Quarterly Census of
Employment and Wages (QCEW) and Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Business Database (LBD)
data to obtain further information about the employer. Demographic information about
individual workers is obtained via links to Census surveys and Social Security administrative
data. Residential information on workers comes primarily from Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
address data. Ongoing work to integrate administrative data on self-employed workers is
described later in this paper.


2
  State UI covers most private employment, as well as state and local government employment. There are notable
exceptions to coverage, namely most small agricultural employers, religious institutions, and much of the non-profit
sector. OPM federal employment data includes the civilian workforce, but not the armed forces or the postal service.

                                                         5
       As is evident from the description above, the LEHD data relies on data sharing
agreements with multiple state and federal agencies to provide critical inputs to the linked
employer-employee data. Key among these are data sharing agreements between state
governments and Census through the Local Employment Dynamics (LED) partnership. State
agencies provide the principal job-level data (state UI records of employee-specific total
quarterly wage and salary payments) as well as QCEW data. As of this writing, all 50 states, DC,
Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have provided data to the LEHD program through this
partnership. Because states joined the partnership at different times with different amounts of
data archived, the set of available states in the LEHD data varies by year; states with the longest
panels have data that begin in the early 1990s, and the last state, Massachusetts, enters in 2010.

       The voluntary nature of the data sharing agreements makes LEHD unique among
statistical programs. While the LEHD program has been enormously successful in bringing
together multiple agencies to share data to create universe-level data on jobs in the U.S., the
voluntary nature of these agreements (state and federal partners receive no compensation for
participation in the program) is a great risk to the long-term viability of the data program.
Withdrawal of data-sharing partners from the program risks the integrity of many of the products
provided from the LEHD data and the usability of the data for research. These data sharing
agreements also have implications for researcher access to the confidential microdata, outlined in
the next section.

       The ability to identify firm age is a recent enhancement to the LEHD data, a highly
valuable additional characteristic for researchers interested in entrepreneurship. Firm age is
obtained via links to the microdata that underlies the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD),
which also serves as the source data for the Census Bureau’s Business Dynamics Statistics
(BDS). As in the BDS, firm age is defined as the age of the oldest establishment in the national
firm. An establishment is age zero in the first year that it reports any positive payroll, and ages
chronologically thereafter. Firm age is robust to ownership changes such as mergers, spinoffs,
and ownership changes. For example, a new legal entity spun off as a result of merger or
acquisition activity will not be considered a new firm; instead, it is assigned the age of its oldest
establishment at the time of its formation.



                                                 6
        A comprehensive description of the LEHD data is available in Abowd et al. (2009). A
detailed discussion of the methodology used to add firm age to the LEHD data is provided in
Haltiwanger et al. (2014).

3.1 Researcher Access to LEHD Microdata

        Researchers can apply for access to LEHD microdata by submitting a research proposal
through the Federal Research Data Center (FRDC) network. Applications for microdata access
for research undergo a formal approval process that includes review of the proposal by the
Census Bureau as well as by state and federal agencies that have supplied worker and firm data
to the LEHD program. Projects approved to use the confidential microdata are conducted in a
secure research data center with all output undergoing a formal disclosure review process before
being permitted for dissemination outside the secure facilities. 3

        The proposal review process for LEHD confidential data access is complicated by the
many data sharing agreements between data partners and the U.S. Census Bureau. Any FRDC
proposal requesting access to IRS data must be approved by IRS (whether a proposal using
LEHD data needs IRS approval depends on the data requested, but firm age, likely of critical
interest to entrepreneurship researchers, is sourced from IRS data). State agreements vary, with
some states choosing to allow their state data in pooled multi-state research samples for research
projects approved by Census. Other state partners choose to review proposals and approve or
deny data access on a project-by-project basis. 4

        In short, acquiring confidential LEHD microdata access for entrepreneurship research can
be classified as a “high-cost/high-reward” activity. The scope of research projects that benefit
from such rich microdata is vast. This is particularly true in the interdisciplinary field of
entrepreneurship research, where many issues are fundamentally interactions between workers
and firms. For instance, LEHD data allow identification of spin-off firms and the employment
history of their start-up teams. Employment with start-up firms is considered a high-risk/high-
reward career strategy – linked employer-employee data can measure both the earnings benefits

  More information on how to apply for confidential microdata research access through the FRDC network is
available on the Center for Economic Studies website: https://www.census.gov/ces/.
4
  Under all LED data use agreements, any state or sub-state tabulation or estimate released from LEHD data must be
approved by the state partner. Tables and estimates in research papers must have a minimum of three states
contributing to the estimate or cell to avoid this requirement.

                                                        7
and risks of joining a start-up team. Acquiring talented employees is critical for start-up success
– better understanding of how labor market agglomeration effects spur industry growth would
help policy makers interested in spurring local entrepreneurship efforts. These examples
obviously represent only a handful of possible topics for research using linked employer-
employee data. Additionally, the LEHD microdata can be linked to other person and firm-level
data, expanding the set of possible research questions even further.

        Although LEHD microdata access offers the broadest possibilities for projects in
entrepreneurship research, the relatively high cost of obtaining access to the data (writing a
successful proposal, obtaining necessary approvals, possible travel to a research data center) is
prohibitive for many researchers. This is especially true for younger researchers (e.g., graduate
students, junior faculty). Policy makers and journalists interested in entrepreneurship often need
quick answers to immediate questions. Thus, in the next few sections of this chapter we focus on
new public use statistics on young firms created from the LEHD data, which can be accessed by
the broader research and policy community.

3.2 LEHD Public Use Data for Entrepreneurship Research

        In this section, we briefly describe three public use data products derived from LEHD
microdata, with a focus on new data on firm age. In the following section, we illustrate the value
of these statistics for entrepreneurship research by means of examples. Table 3 provides an
overall summary of this new data, including variables, frequency, and stratification levels, also
highlighting the relative strengths of these statistics relative to other available data.

3.2.1 The Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI)

        The Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) are a set of thirty-two economic indicators
providing employment, hires and separations, business expansion and contraction, as well as
earnings for the universe of UI-covered employment in the U.S. Data are available by worker
demographics (sex, age, education, as well as race and ethnicity) and firm characteristics (firm
age, size) as well as at fine levels of detail by workplace geography (county and Workforce
Investment Board area) and industry (highly detailed 4-digit NAICS codes).




                                                   8
           QWI statistics by firm age are quite new (the first release was in 2013), made possible by
the recent enhancements to the LEHD microdata discussed earlier in this chapter. The QWI
provide data for five firm age tabulation levels, with the youngest firm category being firms less
than two years old. While the ability to examine employment growth at young firms is not a
unique feature of the QWI, several indicators are uniquely available in the QWI: earnings at
start-ups, earnings of new hires at start-ups, hires, separations, and turnover. 5 Moreover, as we
show in a later example, the QWI are unique in allowing the composition of the start-up
workforce to be examined: for example, the share of young workers, of women, of racial
minorities, or highly educated workers employed at start-ups.

3.2.2 LEHD Origin Destination Employment Statistics (LODES)

           LEHD Origin Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) provide employment data by
both place of work and place of residence at block-level geography. The ability to analyze
employment by both place of residence as well as place of work is critical for identifying
regional labor markets and understanding the interconnectedness of geographic areas that lie
across state and metro area boundaries. A combination of noise infusion (similar to QWI) and
synthetic data methods are used to protect worker and firm characteristics, including residential
location. A web-based mapping application, OnTheMap, provides an easy-to-use interface for
mapping small-area workforce characteristics. The application also provides tabulations to
accompany the workforce maps on employer and worker characteristics, and allows users to
create analysis of custom geographies. For researchers interested in entrepreneurship, a key
feature of interest is highly detailed block-level data of employment in new firms. For example,
Figure 1 uses LODES data in OnTheMap to show the spatial concentration of new firms near
the Stanford University campus in Palo Alto City, California.

3.2.3. Job-to-Job Flows (J2J)

           Job-to-Job Flows (J2J) is a brand new data product from the Census Bureau on the flows
of workers between employers, with data first released in December of 2014. Job-to-Job Flows is
the first public use data product that exploits the ability of the linked employer-employee data to
follow workers across firms, across industries, and across labor markets.

5
    Job creation and destruction for young firms and establishments can also be analyzed with the BDS and the BED.

                                                          9
         The J2J data should prove particularly valuable to researchers of entrepreneurship. First,
the potential to study start-up teams as groups of workers moving from their previous employers
to the newly established firm is unique to linked employer-employee data. While there is no
information about each individual’s role or title in the company, strategies have been employed
to identify founders, see Agarwal et al. (2013) using LEHD microdata. A second unique feature
of the data is its ability to provide a dynamic view of the workforce in the early years of a
business, permitting examination of the role that gender, age, industry experience, and
experience working at other new businesses plays in the success or failure of new firms. Finally,
the ability to identify co-workers and network effects from working in new technologies may
also be interesting to researchers studying agglomeration economies and their role in forming
industrial clusters.

         As of this writing, the J2J data is beta, with more detailed tabulations planned for later
releases. A full description of the methodology used for deriving the worker flow estimates from
the LEHD data is available in Hyatt et al. (2014).

4. Some Examples of Analysis Using the Quarterly Workforce Indicators and Job-to-Job
Flows

         In this section, we provide some specific examples of how the public use QWI and J2J
data can be used to answer questions of interest to researchers studying entrepreneurship.

4.1 Who Works at Start-ups?

         We begin by presenting simple descriptive statistics from the QWI on the population of
workers employed at start-ups. Table 4 compares the workforce composition of start-ups to that
of more established businesses, where start-ups are defined as businesses of age 0-1 years, and
established businesses are grouped into two age categories, 2-10 years old and older than 10
years.

         Comparing the percentages across the columns in Table 4, we see that start-ups
disproportionately employ more young workers, with workers aged 14-24 representing 20.2% of
the workforce at start-ups (versus 14.5% overall). Employment at younger firms also skews
female (51.0%) and less educated. Young firms are also more likely to employ Asian and


                                                 10
Hispanic workers. Obviously, some of the differences in demographics across young and old
firms are driven by industry composition (e.g., in leisure and hospitality firms, are
overrepresented among young firms). These same statistics are available within detailed
industries, so users can measure how the demographics of new firms in an industry compare to
more established firms.

4.2 Did Changing Demographics Contribute to the Decline in Start-ups?

         Next, we use the QWI to explore whether the composition of firms or the workforce can
account for changes in certain economic indicators that we care about. Specifically, we turn to
the important question of what has caused the documented decline in the employment at start-
ups. 6 We begin the analysis in the year 2000, after which the employment share of start-ups
began to decline and the earnings paid by new firms eroded. 7 We consider the share of
employment at start-ups, the trend in the earnings differential between start-ups and established
firms, as well as measures of employment reallocation: job creation, job destruction, hires, and
separations.

         We begin by describing the trends over time, although the decompositions that follow
will only pertain to the endpoints of the trends plotted in these figures, which span from 2000Q2
to 2012Q2. Figure 2 presents the trends in employment and earnings for two age categories:
“start-up” firms, those aged 0-1, and all other firms, i.e., those aged 2 or older. Figure 2a shows
that the employment share at young firms has declined throughout the 2000s, consistent with the
evidence in the literature referenced above. The earnings series in Figure 2b shows divergent
trends for young and old firms. Consistent with the evidence first documented by Brown and
Medoff (2003), earnings at young firms are lower than earnings at older firms. The average

6
  This topic is discussed in a number of recent papers including Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda (2012), Hyatt and
Spletzer (2013), Decker (2014), Decker et al. (2014a,b), Davis and Haltiwanger (2014), Pugsley and Sahin (2014),
and Dinlersoz et al. (2015).
7
  Another reason for starting in 2000 is that most of the states in the statistics above had entered the program as of
that time, thus the analysis can be conducted on a balanced panel. Different states enter the LEHD data at different
times. The year 2000 was chosen as a starting point because most of the country is in the scope of the dataset by that
year. The states included are AK, CA, CO, CT, DE, FL, GA, HI, ID, IL, IN, IL, IN, IA, KS, LA, ME, MD, MN,
MO, MT, NE, NV, NJ, NM, NY, NC, ND, OH, OK, OR, PA, RI, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VT, VA, WA, WY, and WI.
Comparisons are between 2000:Q2 and 2012:Q2. The year 2000 corresponds to the start of the job-to-job flows data,
as described below. Furthermore, the year 2000 is a good starting point to consider the decline in entrepreneurial
employment, see Dinlersoz et al. (2015).



                                                         11
earnings of workers at the youngest firms have declined in real terms throughout the 2000s, but
the earnings at older businesses have shown a modest increase, consistent with what is shown by
Haltiwanger et al. (2012) and Dinlersoz et al. (2015).

           Information on the composition of the workforce by firm age can be used to answer
questions related to the decline of start-ups and of business and employment dynamics more
generally, a much discussed topic. Following Hyatt and Spletzer (2013), we can measure the
effect of compositional changes using a standard decomposition technique to separate between-
group differences from trends within groups for shares and earnings of start-ups (age 0-1) and all
other businesses (age 2+), as follows. Any aggregate Y t can be written as Σ i Y it S it , where i
indexes groups of the workforce or businesses (such as worker age or industry sector), and S i is
the share of the group. We decompose the difference ∆Y t = Y t − Y t-1 according to:

(4.2.1) ∆Y t = Σ i ∆Y it S i• + Σ i Y i• ∆S it ,

where Yi· denotes the mean such that Y i• = (Y it +Y it-1 )/2, and likewise S i• . In other words, the
decline in employment dynamics is equal to the change in the dynamics of each group weighted
by the group’s average employment share (the within effect), plus the change in each group’s
employment share weighted by the group’s average measure of dynamics (the composition
effect).

           The first column of Table 5 contains the results of this shift-share analysis for the change
in the employment at young vs. old firms. The intuition for this analysis is that different types of
workers may be different inputs to the production process, or that the demands for the output of
different industries may lead to the shifts in business entry/exit rates for those industries. For
example, younger workers may be more productive at start-ups, as in Ouimet and Zarutskie
(2014) and Acemoglu, Akcigit, and Celik (2014), or have fewer resources to wait until a higher
wage offer from an older firm as in Dinlersoz et al. (2015). However, as shown in Table 5, most
of the changes in composition should have increased the share of start-ups, not decreased it,
although the effects of changes in industry composition and worker demographics are fairly
small. The main exception to this is the aging of the U.S. workforce, a demographic trend that
does appear tied to the decline in employment share at start-ups. The increase in the share of



                                                   12
older workers, and their tendency to work at established businesses, explains 9.4% of the
decrease in the share of employment at start-ups.

          Figure 2b shows the average real earnings for workers who worked the entire quarter at
start-ups and established firms, between 2000 and 2012. As can be seen in the graph, earnings at
established firms are rising over this period while earnings at start-ups are falling. In the second
column of Table 5, we decompose the rising earnings premium at established firms by
observable characteristics of firms and workers in the QWI. The formula for this composition
change is slightly different, as it compares changes in two groups with each other. We plot the
percentage that the changes in the shares in each of the two categories explain, given the average
earnings for the categories, as follows:

                                                      �������𝑥𝑥 − ∑ Δ𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌,,𝑥𝑥 ∗ 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸
                              ∑ Δ𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂,𝑥𝑥 ∗ 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸                                 �������𝑥𝑥
(4.2.2)                                                                                                  .
                                                    �������𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 − Δ𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸
                                                 Δ𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸           �������𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌

This provides a measure of how the change in a share for a subset of the population defined by a
characteristic (x), as well as in the average earnings for that particular characteristic, is related to
the change in earnings for young vs. old firms. Unlike our results for employment shares at start-
ups, changes in industry composition and worker demographics explain a considerable part of
the apparent increased earnings premium for working at an established firm. For example,
changes in the industry composition across young and older firms explains about one third of the
decline in relative earnings at start-ups. Workers at established firms are also trending older and
more educated, relative to younger firms, although as these effects are measured ignoring the
change in the industry distribution, they may be related and thus their effects are not necessarily
additive.

          In turn, Table 6 shows how the change in the composition of employment by firm age
explains the decline in four employment dynamics measures: hires, separations, job creation, and
destruction. These measures exploit the dynamic aspect of the LEHD data: workers and business
size are linked longitudinally to create these measures. This decomposition is again computed
according to equation 4.2.2 above. Results show that the shift away from entrepreneurship
explains a substantial portion in the decline of such dynamics, due to the fact that start-ups are
more volatile in terms of employment dynamics. The table shows that the decline in start-ups


                                                        13
explains 9.3% of the decline in hires and 6.8% of the decline in separations. 8 These results are
similar to what Hyatt and Spletzer (2013) found using the LEHD microdata.

         The above examples show how the demographic and industrial detail of the QWI can be
used to study the composition of start-up employment, and its effects on economic dynamics.
However, note that these exercises only scratch the surface of what can be learned from these
statistics. All of the measures used here can be cross-tabulated on multiple levels, and are also
available at narrow geographic detail, allowing for much more complex analyses.

4.3 Where do Early Employees Come From?

         The new Job-to-Job Flows (J2J) data allow us to identify movements of workers into
start-up firms from other employers. Figure 3 shows a comparison of worker flows across three
classes of employers: young firms (less than two years), established firms (more than 11 years),
and small firms of all ages (less than 20 employees). Employment growth in each employer class
is the sum of net employment flows (i.e. hires of nonemployed workers minus separations to
nonemployment) and new worker reallocation (i.e. hires of workers away from other firms minus
separations employees to other firms). This decomposition allows us see how firms grow, by
poaching workers away from other firms or through employment flows.

         Figure 3a depicts the hire and separation rates at start-up firms from 2000-2013. As can
be seen in the figure, new firms obtain a significant share of their early employment growth by
poaching workers away from more established firms. Flows into new firms from established
firms are much higher than separations from new firms to more established employers. Poaching
hires were highest during the 2000-2002 period, when half of new firm hires were of workers
moving from other jobs. Overall, this decomposition shows the importance of worker moves
from more established firms as a critical input to early firm growth.

         As a comparison, Figure 3b shows this decomposition for established firms. In contrast
to start-ups, net employment growth at established firms is much smaller, and occurs exclusively
via employment flows. We find in other analysis (not shown) that the high contribution of job-to-


8
  Additionally, the decline in startups explains 25.8% of the decline in job creation, but only 9.5% of the decline in
job destruction. These results are similar to what Decker et al. (2014b) found using the BDS.


                                                          14
job flows to employment growth at young firms disappears by the time firms are 2-3 years old. It
may be that the high growth rate of the youngest firms from worker reallocation is driven by
start-up teams transitioning from their previous jobs at older firms to the new firm.

        As an additional comparison, we show the flows at businesses (of all ages) with fewer
than 20 employees in Figure 3c. This decomposition for small businesses looks more like that
for older established firms than for younger firms. Net worker reallocation to small firms from
larger firms is low, although very slightly positive. 9 Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda (2013)
finds that controlling for age, it is young firms rather than small firms that disproportionately
drive job creation. Here we find that a pattern of employment growth through worker relocation
(workers voting with their feet) characterizes new firms but not small firms generally. That
workers are willing to move from established (and presumably more stable and higher-paying)
employers to start-ups suggests that for early employees, working at a new firm offers
opportunities for advancement and career growth not available to them at more established firms.

        At press time, the J2J data are quite new, and do not yet provide as many tabulation
levels as the QWI. The possibilities for analysis will only expand as the J2J statistics release
more detailed tabulations.

5 Looking Forward: The Potential for New Data on Entrepreneurship

        While substantial progress has been made in the last few years making linked employer-
employee data more useful and accessible for entrepreneurship research, the work we have
described so far represents only a fraction of possible ways to expand the frontier of data
available for research. In particular, linking in additional data on business owners and creating
new data on the dynamics of entrepreneurship would be an important advance in the statistical
infrastructure to study new business formation. In this section, we discuss the potential for more
information on entrepreneurs and their firms from linked employer-employee data and discuss
some results from work to date on integrating new sources of data.

5.1 Linking Data on Business Owners


9
  Haltiwanger, Hyatt, and McEntarfer (2015) point out that the fact that worker relocation does not in fact
redistribute workers away from small firms to large firms is inconsistent with a number of important labor market
models, particularly Burdett and Mortensen (1998).

                                                       15
           Efforts are currently underway to enhance the set of available data on business owners
and the self-employed by integrating data on sole-proprietors and partnerships into the LEHD
data infrastructure. A prototype microdata file is being created which covers the universe of
active U.S. sole-proprietorships and partnerships, both with and without employees, from 2002
through 2012. The Census Bureau is undertaking research into using these data for new public
use statistics on the dynamics of business ownership. 10

           The universe of this dataset encompasses all unincorporated businesses owned and run by
one or more individuals. The data that we integrate originate primarily from individual federal
income tax returns, such as income filings from Schedules C and K1, payroll tax records for
employers (form 941), and applications for an Employer Identification Number (EIN) for
employers (form SS-4). The scope of our data includes owners of sole proprietorships,
partnerships, and Subchapter S corporations. Owners of Limited Liability Companies (LLCs)
and the like are included as long as they do not elect to be taxed by the IRS as a corporation. The
individual business owners can then by linked via a personal identifier to the LEHD job-level
database, thus providing an employment history for each owner. More details on how the data
are constructed are provided in Garcia-Perez et al. (2013).

           This linking of information on business ownership and employment status joins
information in a way that is not available in other data sources, permitting a unique view of the
path to entrepreneurship. Individuals starting businesses bring with them a pre-existing stock of
human capital, through their past experience both in the labor market and also as prior business
owners. The potential statistics derived from this unique data source will allow researchers to
study the intersection of these two employment spheres, which has been little explored up to this
point.

           One challenge in the study of entrepreneurship is the lack of a cleanly defined measure of
entrepreneurial activity. Measurement aside, there is in fact no consistent definition in the
literature of what entrepreneurship is. At its narrowest, entrepreneurs have been identified as the
founders of innovative new businesses that grow rapidly in both employment and output and thus




10
     This builds on previous work integrating the employer and nonemployer business data, see Davis et al. (2009).

                                                          16
drive national measures of economic growth. More broadly, the word entrepreneur has at its root
“one who starts” and thus can refer to the founder of any business regardless of size or outcome.

       More broadly still, entrepreneurial activity is associated with business ownership of any
kind (with or without employees) and with self-employment, which is in turn equally hard to
define. In fact, for tax purposes in the U.S., independent contractors are defined as self-employed
and their earnings treated as self-employment earnings.

       Taken independently, each of these varied concepts of entrepreneurial activity has value
and each measure reveals a different facet of the economy. Rises and falls among innovative,
high growth businesses have obvious implications for national employment and output. The set
of all business starts with or without employees tells us, at a minimum, about the economy’s
capacity to support such efforts. The set of small self-owned businesses without employees
combined with the pool of contract or contingent workers serves as an alternative measure of
employment in a changing economy. This count may also measure what the development
literature calls the informal labor market.

       To better understand the implications of a rise or fall these varied measures of
entrepreneurial activity, we must recognize that each of these events, the start of a new business
(with or without employees) or the transition to contingent work, reflects a choice made by the
owner. These choices are in turn influenced by the owner’s personal pre-entry economic
environment. In addition, trends in the varying concepts of entrepreneurship likely are inter-
related. For example, ownership of a business without employees in many cases precedes the
“birth” of an employer business. Thus, our ability to extract information from these trends is
greatly enhanced by placing them in a broader context.

       The linked employer-employee data constructed by the LEHD program have the potential
to provide this context.    Specifically, statistics released from these data may improve our
understanding of entrepreneurial dynamics in three ways. First, as noted, it is the use of federal
tax filings by sole proprietorships, partnerships and sub-chapter S corporations that gives the
LEHD program its ability to identify business owners. Knowledge of the type of originating tax
form combined with the presence or absence of employees allows us to disentangle these varied
types of entrepreneurship and to separately examine trends in each. Second, by combining


                                                17
administrative data on the universe of individual business owners with the universe of covered
wage and salary work, the resulting dataset permits us to observe an owner’s pre-ownership
wage and salary work history, and thus to potentially generate statistics based on prior
employment, earnings, and industry experience. Third, we can follow individuals as they
transition between ownership of businesses without employees, employer businesses, and
traditional work, and explore the interconnection between these spheres. In short, by identifying
differing types of business ownership and by integrating each with employment and earning
history and prior ownership experience for the owner, the program has the potential to release a
set of statistics that gives insight into what each of these measures may be telling us about the
vitality of the economy.

        We will first describe the type of statistics the program has the ability to create to
measure and explore conventional self-employment as well as self-employment as an alternate
form of employment (what the literature has termed the “gig economy”). We follow with a more
developed discussion of how linked employer-employee-owner data may further our knowledge
of entrepreneurship by tracking the events that precede and follow the birth of a business.

5.2 Self-employment and the “Gig Economy”

        The vast majority of businesses that report earnings have no employees. While self-
employment counts have stagnated in survey reports in recent years, the count of these
nonemployer sole proprietor businesses have continued to rise. 11 This count includes any person
who receives income as a statutory employee or contingent worker or who operates a business or
practice for profit with regularity and continuity. 12 Internet businesses, freelancers, contract
workers, consultants, etc, all are included in this measure.



11
   In a recent interview, Laurence Katz described preliminary work with Alan Krueger to investigate the discrepancy
between steady trends in self-employment in survey data and increases in self-employment suggested by tax data.
Rob Wile, “There are probably way more people in the ‘gig economy’ than we realize.” July 27, 2015, Fusion.net.
12
    Data on non-employer sole proprietors originate from filings of IRS 1949 Schedule C. The Schedule C
instructions state “use Schedule C (Form 1040) to report income or loss from a business you operated or a
profession you practiced as a sole proprietor. An activity qualifies as a business if your primary purpose for
engaging in the activity is for income or profit and you are involved in the activity with continuity and regularity.
For example, a sporadic activity or a hobby does not qualify as a business. Also use Schedule C to report (a) wages
and expenses you had as a statutory employee, (b) income and deductions of certain qualified joint ventures, and (c)
certain income shown on Form 1099-MISC, Miscellaneous Income.”


                                                        18
       The rise in employment arrangements of this type is linked in part to technology which
has significantly lowered the entry cost for these businesses. The U.S. economy has become
much more service oriented and thus the capital requirements associated with business entry are
low. The pros and cons of this trend have been widely discussed and can be viewed from the
perspective of the employer, the worker, or the economy as a whole. From an employer’s
perspective, the availability of an on-demand workforce lowers labor costs and provides
flexibility. From the worker’s perspective, a less formal work arrangement often precludes other
benefits of employment such as stability and health insurance coverage yet does provide an
alternative to conventional work when faced with unemployment or under-employment. For the
economy as a whole, a rise in unemployment is one of the mechanisms through which the
economy is theorized to self-correct during recessions. Thus, unlike a rise in conventional
entrepreneurship which is viewed as a driving force of economic growth, it is not clear whether
we should regard the rise in the numbers of nonemployer sole proprietors as a sign of economic
strength.

       Linked employer-employee-owner data have the potential to create statistics that provide
more insight into these trends. For each new nonemployer, we observe their employment and
earnings status in time periods preceding self-employment entry. The data thus give us some
ability to separately identify those new nonemployers pushed into self-employment by lack of
economic opportunity from those lured into self-employment by higher anticipated returns. We
can identify those entrants with no wage and salary earnings, those with broken spells of
employment, those previously working at a downsizing employer or those employed but earning
significantly less than comparable workers. Similarly, we can identify those entrants with high,
above average or rising wage and salary earnings. An understanding of the forces that may
influence self-employment entry may help economists understand the nature of a rise of business
ownership of this type.

5.3 Measuring Business Ownership Dynamics

       The determinants of entrepreneurial success are a much studied topic, but many of these
factors are determined prior to the beginning of a business. The human capital and prior
experience that an entrepreneur brings to their new venture are clearly important, and may not be
possible to fully encapsulate in measures such as education level. Moreover, many business

                                               19
starts and business failures occur before the firm hires its first employees. Such small owner-
operated businesses are not included in statistics such as the BDS and QWI, where business birth
is defined as the moment the firm hires its first worker. In order to identify the characteristics of
successful entrepreneurs, and to answer questions like why the rate of entrepreneurship is
declining, it may be important to observe these potential job creators at their earliest stages.

       Such a link should prove enlightening in the context of the well-documented decline in
U.S. start-ups, which has sparked much interest in the underlying causes and implications of this
slowdown. Although the overall trend in start-ups may be downward, in reality the composition
of new business owners is constantly in flux, with certain types of individuals exhibiting
differing and perhaps offsetting trends. To understand the decrease in start-ups requires
knowledge of the factors that precede a business and an understanding of how these factors
influence the odds of a successful start-up. For example, the self-employment literature
recognizes that some are pushed into self-employment by lack of economic opportunity while
others are pulled into entrepreneurship by means of comparative advantage or innovative idea.
Statistics derived from linked sole-proprietor and LEHD data will offer a way to help parse such
differences in the paths of potential entrepreneurs.

5.4 Don’t Quit Your Day Job: A Look at Self-Employment Dynamics

       Researchers are interested in identifying successful transitions to entrepreneurship. One
measure of success is the owner’s ability to create a primary source of earnings for themselves
from the business. The combined owner-work history data are well suited to explore the
following question: what share of self-employed businesses grow enough to allow the owner to
leave wage and salary employment?

       The left-hand panel of Table 7 shows the percentage of sole-proprietors in 2009 who are
engaged in wage and salary work in the same year, as well as in the surrounding years of 2008
and 2010. One of the first facts to stand out is that the majority of self-employed businesses
without employees do not in fact grow large enough to supplant the owner’s reliance on some
form of wage and salary work. Over 50% of nonemployer business owners in 2009 have wage
and salary income in that year, a share that is higher for new nonemployer business owners
(those in the first year of their business), at around 65%. For new employers in 2009, defined as


                                                 20
businesses with employees who were not employers in 2008, about 40% had wage and salary
jobs in 2008, 35% have such employment in the 2009 year (the birth year of their employer
business), and 30% retain it in the following year 2010. For more established business owners
with employees, the wage and salary work rate stabilizes at just above 20%.

       For employer business owners, we can also capture their experience as operators of
businesses without paid employees. In the right-hand panel of Table 7, we see that amongst new
employer business owners in 2009, around 36% operated a nonemployer business in the previous
year. This rate falls by over half to 17% during their first year of employer business activity in
2009, suggesting that it may represent the same businesses that are transitioning as they acquire
employees. Note that the percentage of new 2009 employers with nonemployer income rises
again in 2010 to 24%, perhaps indicating that some new employer businesses have shed their
employee within one year, but nonetheless maintained the business. Note again that the rate of
nonemployer business holding amongst all employers remains in the 15- 20% range, meaning
that a substantial fraction of owners maintain other sources of business income simultaneous to
running an employer business.

       This example clearly shows that there is no single path to entrepreneurship, as the
relationship between wage and salary work, self-employment, and running an employer business
is quite complicated. These data are uniquely suited to studying the interplay between these types
of employment, and the future business owner statistics should enable new exploration into the
origins of entrepreneurship.

6 Conclusion

       Linked employer-employee data has enormous potential for empirical research in
entrepreneurship. These data allow an ever-growing community of researchers to develop a
clearer picture of how new firms come into being, obtain workers, grow, shrink, and exit, and
how this dynamic process is related to employment and economic growth. In this chapter, we
described the LEHD linked employer-employee microdata, public use data on start-ups tabulated
from LEHD data, and highlight how they fill gaps in the set of available data for the study of
entrepreneurship. We provided examples that illustrate the power of the new public data to
address questions that previously required access to restricted microdata.    Work to expand the


                                               21
utility of this data for entrepreneurship research is still ongoing; we also outlined future plans for
development of new data products for empirical research on entrepreneurship.
