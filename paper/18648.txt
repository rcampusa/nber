                                             ABSTRACT

Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this study examines the impact
of high school cohort composition on the educational and labor market outcomes of individuals during
their early 20s and again during their late 20s and early 30s. We find that the positive effects of having
more high school classmates with a college educated mother on college attendance in the years immediately
following high school fade out as students reach their later 20s and early 30s, and are not followed
by comparable effects on college completion and labor market outcomes.

I. Introduction

       Existing research indicates the college enrollment decisions can be influenced by policy

relevant factors. For instance, researchers have consistently found that programs that reduce the

cost of college increase college enrollments (Abraham and Clark 2006; Cornwell, Mustard and

Sridhar 2006; Dynarski 2000; 2003; 2004; Kane 2003; 2007). Recent evidence suggests that the

composition of one’s high school classmates can also influence college enrollment. Bifulco,

Fletcher, and Ross (2011) find that students whose school cohorts have higher percentages of

students with college educated parents are more likely to attend college, and using data from

Norway, Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2010) presents evidence that the gender composition of

a school cohort can influence years of schooling.

       Over the last several decades, as college going rates have increased significantly,

completion rates among those who enter college have fallen (Belley and Lochner 2007). Thus, it

is not clear that increasing college enrollment is sufficient for increasing degree attainment.

Descriptive evidence suggests that returns to completing college are substantially higher than the

return to merely attending college (Baum, Ma, & Payea 2010), and thus, effects on college

completion may be more policy relevant than effects on college enrollment.

       Research on whether policy relevant factors can have the same impact on college

completion and degree attainment as they have on college enrollment is relatively scarce. Recent

studies have examined the effect of scholarship and grant programs on college completion with

somewhat mixed results. Dynarski (2008) and Scott-Clayton (2011) find that merit-based

scholarship programs increase the likelihood of earning a bachelor’s degree, and Castleman and

Long (2012) find that a need-based grant program in Florida has increased the likelihood of

earning a bachelor’s degree. Sjoquist and Winters (2012), however, raise some questions about



                                                  1
the robustness of the findings reported in Dynaraki (2008), and in a separate study, Bruce and

Carruthers (2011) find little evidence that a merit based aid program in Tennessee has had

positive impacts on degree attainment. Similar studies of the impact of high school cohort

composition on degree completion have not been conducted.

       The lack of research examining the impact of high school composition on college

completion might be explained by the difficulty of isolating causal impacts with existing data.

Students are not typically assigned to schools randomly, which makes it difficult to isolate the

causal effect of high school composition. Following Hoxby (2000), several recent studies have

addressed this challenge by using arguably idiosyncratic variation in student composition across

cohorts within the same schools to identify the effects of classmate characteristics. These studies

have found that variation in the race, gender, ability, exposure to family violence, and home

language of classmates can have short term effects on individual test scores (Angist and Lang

2004; Carell and Hoekstra 2010; Friesen and Krauth 2008; Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin 2002;

Hoxby 2000; Lavy, Paserman, and Schlosser 2008; Lavy and Schlosser 2007). This approach,

however, requires data on multiple cohorts of students from the same schools, and data sources

that have sufficient information on school context for multiple cohorts of students do not

typically track students longitudinally to observe college completion outcomes.

       In this study, we turn to a particular sample that is well suited to provide evidence on the

effects of high school composition on college completion and other long term outcomes. The

National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) is a longitudinal survey that

follows multiple cohorts of students from the same schools. A previous analysis using the Add

Health has demonstrated that among a representative sample of 20 to 25 year olds, having had a

higher percentage of classmates with a college educated mother in high school decreases the



                                                 2
likelihood of being a high school dropout and increases the likelihood of having attending

college (Bifulco, Fletcher, and Ross 2011). The present study uses the recently released Wave 4

of the Add Health, which measures the outcomes of respondents between the ages of 27 and 32,

to examine the effect of cohort composition on college completion and other long-run outcomes.

       First we examine whether the impacts of high school cohort composition on college

attendance are sustained, or whether estimated effects fade as individuals make decisions to

return to school during their 20s. Next, we examine whether or not the composition of one’s

high school cohort has any longer term effects on college completion and labor market

outcomes. In addition, we extend the analysis in Bifulco, Fletcher, and Ross (2011) by

estimating the effects of cohort composition separately for males and females. It is useful to

examine the effect of cohort composition separately for males and females for two reasons.

First, as individuals begin to form families, labor supply decisions of males and females begin to

diverge (Killingworth and Heckman 1986). Second, recent studies suggest that males and

females respond differently to similar peer environments (Black, Devereux, and Salvanes 2010;

Kling, Liebman, and Katz 2007).

       We find that the effect of the percent of classmates with a college educated mother on

college attendance does fade. The estimated effect on college attendance by Wave 4 is

substantially smaller than the effect on college attendance by Wave 3, and is not statistically

distinguishable from zero. The separate analyses for males and females lend additional support

for the fade-out hypothesis. The estimated effects of percent of classmates with a college

educated mother on educational attainment during Wave 3 are driven entirely by effects on

males. By Wave 4, the estimated effect on college attendance for males, while still substantively

large, is one third the size of the estimated effect on college attendance in Wave 3, and is not



                                                 3
statistically distinguishable from zero. In addition, while the percent of black or Hispanic

students in a cohort is associated with higher rates of idleness among males in Wave 3, this

aspect of cohort composition shows no effect on idleness among males in Wave 4. The effects

on Wave 3 and Wave 4 outcomes are estimated using the same sample and so the apparent

fading of effects cannot be attributed to differential attrition between waves.

        On the question of whether the effects of cohort composition on college attendance in the

years immediately after high school have any lasting effects on degree attainment or labor

market outcomes, the results are somewhat ambiguous. Among males, the effects of classmates

with a college educated mother on degree attainment and employment are similar in magnitude

to the fading college attendance results, which might be viewed as substantively large. However,

the effects are imprecisely estimated and not statistically distinguishable from zero. Also, the

estimates are sensitive to choice of sample. While we cannot rule out an impact of the

proportion of classmates who have college educated mothers on educational attainment and

employment, the estimated effects are not as large as the initial effects on college attendance.

Effects of cohort composition on income and earnings are generally small and statistically

insignificant.

        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II provides a brief discussion of

why we might expect short-run effects of cohort composition on college enrollment to fade-out.

Section III describes the data and sample used in the analyses. Section IV explains the within-

school, across cohort identification strategy that we use and how we implemented it. It also

presents the results of balancing tests that provide empirical support for this identification

strategy. Section V presents evidence that the effects of cohort composition on Wave 3

outcomes fade by Wave 4. Section VI presents results on the impact of cohort composition on



                                                  4
degree attainment and labor market outcomes in Wave 4. Section VII discusses a potentially

anomalous result from our analysis and a concluding section summarizes and discusses the

implications of our findings.


II. Why Might Short-Run Effects Fade-Out

       There are several reasons that we might expect the composition of one’s high school

cohort to influence post-secondary educational outcomes. First, attending school and classes

with more educationally advantaged students, e.g. more students with college educated parents,

might influence the development of academic skills, attitudes towards school, and college

aspirations. Changes in skills, attitudes, and aspirations are likely to change the perceived and

real benefits of a college education to an individual. Following Becker (1964), if we view the

decision to attend college as an investment choice in which students choose to enroll if the

perceived discounted value of the benefits exceeds the costs, increasing the real or perceived

benefits of college will increase enrollments. Of course, improved skills and attitudes toward

education can also be expected to increase the likelihood of persisting and succeeding in college.

Increases in skills and attitudes would also be expected to translate in to improved labor market

outcomes. Thus, if cohort composition influences college enrollment choices through

intermediate impacts on skills and attitudes, we would expect that cohort composition will also

influence college completion and other longer term outcomes.

       However, there are reasons that cohort composition might influence college enrollment

decisions even if it does not influence skills and attitudes. An important strand in the literature

on post-secondary attainment has emphasized the importance of the information provided

through social networks (Granovetter 1995). Information about opportunities can influence

decisions to attend college even if we hold expectations, grades, and cognitive achievement


                                                  5
constant. If improved information about post-secondary options both makes an individual more

likely to choose to attend college and also improves a student’s match with the college he or she

chooses, then we might also expect effects on college completion.

       Alternatively, if a student has incomplete information about the returns to attending

college, one might use the decisions of one’s peers as a guide (Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, and

Welch 1992; Manski 1993). As students on the margin of enrolling or not enrolling in college

see other students applying for and preparing to attend college, they might be tipped toward

enrolling themselves (Fletcher 2012). Thus, peers can influence behavioral choices without

influencing attitudes or skills. If cohort composition influences the college enrollment decision

in this way, without substantially changing skills, attitudes, or information, then we might expect

to see the effect of cohort composition on college enrollment fade as individuals age. As

individuals enter their mid-twenties and make decisions about whether or not to return to school,

the influence of high school peers is likely to wane, and underlying skills and attitudes are likely

to be more telling. Also, if those on the margin of enrolling, whose decisions are influenced by

what their peers are doing, are among those least likely to succeed in college, then effects on the

enrollment decisions will often not translate into effects on degree attainment. Unlike in the case

of policies to reduce the cost of attending college, which might have continuing effects on

persistence in college by either reducing students’ need to work while they are in enrolled or

limiting students accumulation of debt, there is little reason to expect cohort composition to

increase persistence in the absence of changes in individual skills and attitudes, or improved

matches with the college they choose.

       Bifulco, Fletcher, and Ross (2011) present evidence that the percent of classmates with

college educated parents, although it increases the likelihood of having attending college by



                                                 6
one’s early 20s, does not have any effect on individual skills and attitudes during school. That

study also documents that children of college educated parents are substantially more likely to

attend college themselves, even when compared to other students who have selected into the

same high school. This evidence suggests that the effects of the percent of classmates with

college educated parents on college attendance is due largely to imitative behavior during or

shortly after high school, rather than any change in underlying skills or attitudes. Thus, we

might expect that any short-term effects on college attendance will fade as individuals make

decisions about returning to school during their 20s, and also that any positive effects on degree

attainment will be substantially smaller than the short-term effects on college attendance. In the

remainder of this article we refer to these expectations as the fade-out hypothesis.

III. Data and Samples

       The Add Health is a school-based, longitudinal study of the health-related behaviors of

adolescents and their outcomes in young adulthood. The study used a clustered sampling design

in which first a nationally representative set of high schools, and then a random sample of

students from each grade in each school were selected. The survey consists of four waves.

Wave 1 was conducted between April 1995 and December 1995. In addition to an extensive in-

home survey for the students selected for the longitudinal study, an in-school survey was

administered to all of the students attending each sampled school. Wave 2, 3, and 4 consist of

follow-up in-home surveys of individuals in the longitudinal sample conducted 1, 7, and 13 years

after the Wave 1 survey.

       Approximately 20,000 individuals completed the full Wave 1 survey and of these

approximately 12,300 responded to the Wave 3 and Wave 4 surveys. Following Bifulco,

Fletcher, and Ross (2011), the analyses presented here are conducted using subsamples of these



                                                 7
students who, during Wave 1, were: in grades 9-12; attended a school serving each of grades 10,

11, and 12; reported themselves as either white, black, Hispanic, or Asian; and had 10 or more

students in their school cohort. We focus primarily on those who responded to Waves 1, 3 and 4

so that we can test for the fade-out of educational attainment effects.

       The independent variables of interest in the analyses are the percent of students in an

individual’s school cohort who have a college educated mother and the percentage who are either

black or Hispanic. These variables are computed using information from the in-school survey

administered to students in the sample schools, and thus are based on a census of students in each

cohort. The Wave 3 outcomes examined include whether or not the individual is a high school

dropout, whether or not the student has attended college, and whether or not the individual was

idle. High school dropouts are defined as individuals who had not completed 12th grade and

were not in high school at the time of Wave 3 survey, and include students who had GEDs.

Being idle is defined as neither working nor attending school at the time of the survey.

       Wave 4 outcomes examined include each of the outcomes measured in Wave 3, plus

indicators of whether or not the individual has received an associate degree or higher, has

received a bachelor degree, and is currently employed at the time of Wave 4. In addition, we

examine the log of household income and the log of earnings reported at the time of Wave 4.

Respondents were asked to report total household income before taxes in $5,000 to $50,000

increments up to $150,000 or more. Values were coded at the midpoint of the reported range




                                                 8
and at $150,000 for those in the top category. 2 Respondents also reported the dollar amount of

income from personal earnings during the most recent year. 3

       Table 1 provides the descriptive statistics for each of the cohort composition variables,

each of the outcome variables just described, and an additional set of variables that are used in

either the regression models that we estimated or the balancing tests conducted (both of which

are described below). Means and standard deviations are provided for individuals who meet the

primary sampling criteria described above.

       If we compare Wave 3 and Wave 4 outcome measures we see that the number of

dropouts changes little from Wave 3 to Wave 4. Because we count GED recipients as dropouts

in the analysis, there is very little opportunity for students to change their dropout status after

Wave 3. 4 The percent of individuals who have ever attended college, however, increases from

58.5 percent in Wave 3 to 70.7 percent in Wave 4, which suggests that a substantial number of

people first attended college sometime after Wave 3. Our first question is whether these delayed

choices to attend college lead to a fade out of the effect of high school cohort composition. Note

also that many who have attended college had not earned a degree—41.8 percent earned an

associate degree or higher and 33.3 percent earned a bachelor degree by Wave 4. Part of our

second question is whether the effect of cohort composition on the decision to delay college has

any lasting impact on degree attainment.

  We also estimated interval regression models coding each interval as its own category and
assuming that conditional log income has a normal distribution. The results of these regressions
were substantially similar.

IV. Method of Estimating Cohort Composition Effects

        The primary challenge in estimating cohort composition effects is the potential

correlation between unobserved student characteristics and cohort attributes created by self-

selection of individuals into schools (Moffitt 2001). Under the assumption that families do not

select schools based on the differences between their child’s cohort and the average school

composition, a cross-cohort, within-school design breaks the correlation between unobserved

student characteristics and cohort attributes.

        To implement this strategy, we estimate the following regression equation:

             β 0 + β1 %CollEd cs + β 2 % Minoritycs + β3 MomEdics + β 4 Ethnicityics
        Yics =
                                       +δ c + φs + γ s C + ε ics

Here, Yics is an outcome for student i, who was a member of cohort c in school s; %CollEd cs is

the proportion of students in the individual’s school-specific cohort who have a college educated

mother; % Minoritycs is the proportion of students in the individual’s school cohort who are either

black or Hispanic; β1 and β 2 are the parameters of interest and represent the effect of cohort

composition on individual student outcomes; MomEdics is a set of dummy variables indicating

the education level of the student’s own mother; Ethnicityics is an indicator of the student’s own

race/ethnicity; δ c is a non-school specific, cohort fixed-effect; φs is a school fixed effect; C is the

cohort variable indicating the student’s grade during Wave 1, the effect of which is allowed to

vary by school; and ε ics is a random error term.

        The inclusion of school fixed effects ensures that the estimation of cohort composition

effects is based on comparisons across cohorts within a school. Inclusion of γ s C controls for

school specific trends as well. In models that only include school fixed effects, schools that


                                                    10
show a systematic trend in cohort attributes are a concern. For instance, parents might observe

when the share minority in a school is increasing over time. If the preferences for racial

composition differ across families, students from older cohorts who select into a school might

differ in systematic, unobserved ways from students in younger cohorts. Also, minorities and

students whose parents have less education are more likely to drop out between grades 9 and 12,

and also tend to be less motivated to continue their schooling. Thus, compared to younger

cohorts the older cohorts in the Add Health will have higher percentages of classmates with a

college educated mother and lower percentages of minorities and also students who are generally

more motivated, creating a potential correlation between cohort composition and unobserved

student characteristics. If we assume, however, that families do not choose schools based on

unanticipated changes in cohort composition, and that the effects of dropouts on cohort

composition and student unobservables are approximately linear in grades within schools, then

controlling for school trends will eliminate any correlation between cohort composition and

unobserved student characteristics.

       The results that we report here are from models that include controls for the individual

student characteristics related to our cohort variables. Race and parents’ education are correlated

with several factors that influence outcomes. Thus, even if deviations from school trends in the

cohort composition measures are randomly distributed, students in cohorts with higher than

predicted percentages of minority students or college educated parents will systematically differ

from students in other cohorts. Including individual controls for race and parent education is

necessary to prevent these systematic differences from biasing the estimates of cohort

composition effects. We also estimated models that include a more extensive set of individual

level controls including those listed in Table 1. In principle, if the identification strategy



                                                  11
employed here successfully isolates idiosyncratic variation in cohort composition, additional

individual level controls are not necessary. And in fact, models with additional controls provide

results substantively similar to those reported below. 5

          Because of clustering of students within schools, we compute Huber/White standard

errors that are robust to clustering within schools for all our regressions. The sampling weights

used in computing our estimates depend on the sample used. Our primary analysis uses a sample

of individuals who responded to the Wave 1, 3 and 4 surveys, and so the Wave 1, 3, and 4

longitudinal sampling weights are used. In estimates that make use of the Wave 1 and 3

respondents and the Wave 1 and 4 respondents, the corresponding longitudinal weights provided

by the Add Health are used.

          If the identifying assumptions of the model specified above are met, deviations from

school specific trends in the cohort composition variables should be uncorrelated with deviations

from school specific trends in student background characteristics. To test that this condition is

met, we regressed a series of student background characteristics on the cohort composition

variables controlling for cohort fixed effects, school fixed effects and trends, the student’s

race/ethnicity, and the education level of the student’s mother. The results of these “balancing

tests” are provided in Table 2, which includes the results of 10 separate regressions and a total of

20 separate coefficient estimates. Only one, marginally significant t-statistic is obtained—the

estimated relationship between percent black or Hispanic and whether or not the student’s parent

was born in the U.S is significant at the 0.10 level. One significant t-statistic among 20

coefficient estimates is less than we would expect to emerge by chance. Also, none of the

regressions have statistically significant F-statistics. These results provide support for the

                                                 12
assumption that the variation in cohort composition used to identify effect estimates is not

systematically related to student characteristics.

V. The Fade-Out of Cohort Composition Effects

       Table 3 presents our evidence on the fadeout of the cohort composition effects observed

in Wave 3. The estimates presented in the first three columns of the top panel are from Bifulco,

Fletcher and Ross (2011). A one point higher percentage of college educated mothers in one’s

high school cohort is associated with 0.34 percentage point lower high school dropout rate and a

0.55 percentage point higher rate of college attendance.

       The first three columns of the middle and bottom panels of Table 3 indicate that these

effects of cohort composition on Wave 3 outcomes are driven almost entirely by effects on

males. Among males, a one percentage point increase in the percent of students whose parents

are college educated is associated with a 0.53 percentage point decrease in the likelihood of

dropping out and a 0.96 percentage point increase in the likelihood of attending college. These

effects on males are significant considering the growing gap between males and females in

educational attainment, particularly among less advantage groups (Buchman and Diprete 2006;

Goldin, Katz and Kuziemko 2006; Heckman and La Fontaine 2007). We also see that a higher

percentage of black and Hispanic students in one’s high school cohort is associated with

substantially lower rates of college attendance and higher rates of idleness among males, and the

estimate on idleness is statistically significant. These effects of percent black and Hispanic,

however, are offset by effects in the opposite direction for females.

       The next three columns of Table 3 present estimated effects on the same Wave 3

outcomes computed using the sample of students who responded to the Wave 1, 3, and 4

surveys. These results indicate that the findings on Wave 3 outcomes are robust to this sample


                                                 13
change. Both for the entire sample and among males, the estimated effect of percent college

educated mothers on the dropout variable is virtually unchanged, and the estimated effect on

college attendance, although somewhat smaller, remains positive and statistically significant.

These results suggest that attrition from Wave 4 of the survey does not fundamentally change the

key findings of Bifulco, Fletcher, and Ross (2011). Also, a higher share of black and Hispanic

students in the high school cohort continues to be significantly associated with higher rates of

idleness among males.

          Counter to expectations, but consistent with the results from the previous sample, the

percent of high school classmates with a college educated mother is associated with higher rates

of idleness and the percent black or Hispanic is associated with higher rates of college attendance

among females. The counter intuitive result on idleness might be explained by childrearing.

Because of household responsibilities, women with young children are especially likely to be

neither attending school nor employed outside the home. When we recode the idleness variable

such that women with children under the age of 5 are not counted as idle, the effect of the

percent of college educated mothers in the high school cohort becomes smaller and statistically

insignificant. 6 The positive effect of the share of minority students on college attendance among

females is perhaps more puzzling, and is a result we discuss further below.

          The last three columns of Table 3 present the estimated effects of cohort composition on

the same three outcomes, only now measured at the time of Wave 4. The sample used to

compute the estimated effects on outcomes measured in Wave 4 is exactly the same as that used

to compute the estimated effect on outcomes measured in Wave 3. Thus, any difference between

the results in the last three columns of Table 3 and the corresponding results in the previous three

columns cannot be attributed to sample changes, but rather provide an indication of how much

the effects of cohort composition on Wave 3 outcomes fade by Wave 4 within the same sample.

       The estimated effect of the percent college educated mothers on the dropout for Wave 4

is very close to that obtained from Wave 3, which is not surprising, given that there is very little

opportunity for individuals to change dropout status between Waves 3 and 4. Thus, as expected,

we see little fade out of the effect of percent with a college educated mother on the dropout

variable. For the college attendance variable, however, there is strong evidence that the effects of

the percent of classmates with a college educated mother fades. The estimated effect of percent

with a college educated mother on college attendance by Wave 4 not only is statistically

insignificant, but the point estimate is about one-third the size of the estimated effect on college

attendance by Wave 3. We see a similar difference between the estimated effect on college

attendance measured in Wave 3 and Wave 4 among males. Similarly, the effect of the percent

black or Hispanic in the high school cohort on idleness among males fades--a statistically

significant effect estimate of 0.446 in Wave 3 is very close to zero in Wave 4. Among females

the statistically significant effect of percent of classmates with a college educated mother on

idleness during Wave 3 also becomes much smaller and statistically insignificant in Wave 4.

       The one result that persists from Wave 3 to Wave 4 is the positive association between

the share of students in the high school cohort who are black or Hispanic and college attendance

among females. We discuss this result in Section VI below.

VI. Long-Term Impacts on Attainment and Employment

       Even though the effect of classmates with a college educated mother on college

attendance fades out, particularly among males, differences in cohort composition might have

longer lasting effects on college attainment and labor market outcomes. Delaying college, for


                                                 15
instance, might make it less likely that one will obtain a degree (Bozick and DeLuca 2005; Niu

and Tienda 2011; Rowan-Kenyon 2007), and might also influence income and earnings by an

individual in his or her late 20s and early 30s. Table 4 presents results that address this issue.

        Considering the results for the sample as a whole, males and females together, we do not

find significant relationships between the high school cohort composition variables and either

degree attainment or labor market outcomes. Nor do we find any statistically significant

relationships when we focus solely on males. In the sample of males, several of the point

estimates suggest substantial effects of cohort composition, but the estimates have large standard

errors. For instance, the estimated effect of the percent of classmates with a college educated

mother on attaining a bachelor’s degree is 0.355. An effect of this size implies that a one half

standard deviation (7.1 percentage point) increase in the percent of classmates with college

educated parents increases the likelihood of attaining an associate’s degree by 2.5 percentage

points, which is an 8 percent increase at the mean. A one half standard deviation increase in the

percent of classmates with college educated parents decreases the likelihood of being

unemployed by 2.2 percentage points, which represents a decrease of 18 percent at the mean.

Although arguably important substantively, these effects are substantially smaller than the

estimated effects on college attendance in Wave 3, and similar to the estimated effects on college

attendance in Wave 4. Like the estimated effect on college attendance in Wave 4, these results

are all statistically insignificant. The percent of classmates who are black or Hispanic shows a

positive effect on obtaining a bachelor’s degree among males, which is the sole effect that

reaches statistical significance at the 0.10 level.

        The estimated effects on income and earnings are generally small and statistically

insignificant. For instance the point estimate of the effect of percent of mothers with a college



                                                      16
education on the log of family income is 0.463, one of the larger coefficients in the last two

columns of Table 4. This effect implies that a one half standard deviation in the percent of

college educated mothers is associated with a 3.3 percent increase in income, an effect which is

not nearly statistically significant.

        In an attempt to increase precision, we reestimated the regression presented in Table 4

using the sample of individuals who responded to Waves 1 and 4 of the survey regardless of

whether or not they responded to Wave 3. This addition increased the sample size by more than

20 percent. The results are reported in Table 5. The effects of expanding the sample on standard

error sizes are modest. The point estimates computed using this expanded sample are generally

smaller, particularly among males. Among other results, the marginally significant effect of the

percent black or Hispanic on the likelihood of earning a bachelor’s degree among males is

substantially smaller than the corresponding estimate in Table 4, and not nearly statistically

significant. Given the imprecision of the effect estimates by gender and the sensitivity of the

point estimates to choice of sample, it is difficult to draw strong conclusions about the impacts of

cohort composition on degree attainment and employment outcomes, but the evidence of any

lasting impacts is weak.

VII. An Anomalous Result?

        The one result that is not completely consistent with the fade-out hypothesis is the finding

that the positive effect of percent black or Hispanic in the cohort on attending college among

females is at least as large in Wave 4 as in Wave 3 (see bottom panel of Table 3). Several points

are worth making about this finding.

        First, although a positive effect of the percent minority on college attendance might seem

counterintuitive to some, it is not inconsistent with the notion that cohort composition influences



                                                17
college attendance choice through imitation of peers. We suspect that the students whose

decisions to enter college are most likely to be influenced by the composition of their school

cohort are those choosing between going to community college and not going at all. To test this

suspicion we conducted the following analysis. First, using the sample of college graduates, we

estimated a logit model to determine the likelihood of receiving an associate’s degree,

conditional on receiving any degree, as a function of individual characteristics. The individual

characteristics used were those listed in Table 2 plus ethnicity and parent education level. The

estimate of this model allows us to compute for each student the probability that if they went to

college they would go to a two year school. 7 Next, we estimated our model of college

attendance adding to the model this predicted probability, plus an interaction between the cohort

composition variables and this probability. A positive coefficient on this interaction term

suggests that the cohort composition measure has a larger effect on the college enrollment

choices of those on the margin of attending a two-year college or no college than on those who

are on the margin of attending a four-year college.

         The results of this analysis are presented in Table 6. In both the male and female

samples, the estimated coefficient on the interaction between percent black or Hispanic and the

probability of attending a two-year college, conditional on graduating, is statistically significant

and indicates that those likely to be on the margin of deciding whether or not to go to a two-year

college are substantially more likely to be influenced by the percent minority in the cohort than

those on the margin of deciding whether or not to attend a four-year college. For instance,

among females, the effect of percent black or Hispanic in the cohort on college attendance for

7
  Preferably we would use the sample of all students who attended college to estimate the likelihood that an
individual with specified characteristics would attend a community college rather than a four year institution.
Unfortunately, the Add Health allows us to determine the type of college attended only if the individual has earned a
degree or is currently enrolled. Thus, for many of the college attendees in the sample we cannot determine what
type of college they attended.

                                                         18
those with a 90 percent probability of attending a two-year school if they decide to attend college

is three times as large as the effect on those with a 10 percent probability of attending a two-year

school if they decide to attend college.

       Black and Hispanic students in our sample are, in fact, more likely to attend a two-year

college than non-minorities. Although we cannot identify for each student who reports having

attended college in Wave 3 what type of college they attended, we do know that among black

and Hispanic students 32.9 percent report either that they are currently attending a 2-year

college, obtained an associate degree, or attended college but did not receive a degree and are not

currently enrolled. The corresponding number among non-minorities is 31.1 percent.

Conversely, only 28.6 percent of minorities compared to 37.3 percent of non-minorities either

were currently attending a four year college or had obtained a bachelor’s degree by Wave 4.

Thus, it is possible that students in cohorts with a high percentage of black and Hispanic students

will see more of their classmates applying to and choosing to attend a two-year college, and as a

result some of those on the margin of enrolling in a two-year college are persuaded to do so.

       In contrast to the effect of minority classmates among females, the effect of classmates

with a college educated mother among males is substantial among those on the margin of

attending a four-year institution and is not significantly larger for those on the margin of

attending a two-year institution than those on the margin of attending a four-year college.

Although not definitive, this result suggests a reason why the effect of classmates with a college

educated mother on college attendance among males fades as individuals age, but the effect of

percent minority in the cohort among females does not fade. Classmates with a college educated

mother influence the decision to attend college in the years immediately following high school

made by those who are relatively advantaged and who may be relatively likely to attend college



                                                 19
at some point in their lives regardless of whether they attend immediately after high school.

Thus, the effect of classmates with a college educated mother on college attendance fades as

those who are not influenced by cohort composition to attend college in the years immediately

following high school begin to return to school later in life. The percent minority in the cohort,

in contrast, primarily influences the college going decisions of less advantaged students who are

relatively unlikely to return to college in their mid and later 20s. Because those influenced by

the percent minority in the cohort are not likely to return to school later in life, the effect of

percent minority on college attendance persists through the mid and later 20s.

        Finally, it is worth noting that the positive effect of black and Hispanic classmates on

college attendance among females does not translate into significantly higher rates of college

completion (see first two columns, bottom panel of Table 4). Thus, even in this case, the effect

of cohort composition on encouraging college attendance is, for many students, insufficient to

move them to college completion.

VIII. Conclusion

        The purpose of this analysis has been to determine whether the effects of high school

cohort composition on college attendance and idleness documented by Bifulco, Fletcher and

Ross (2011) fade out as individuals age from their early twenties into their later twenties and

early thirties. We also examine if cohort composition variables have any longer lasting effects

on degree attainment and labor market outcomes. We find that the cohort composition effects on

college attendance and idleness do in fact fade. The evidence on degree attainment and

employment is less conclusive. Point estimates for the effect of classmates with a college

educated mother on degree attainment and employment among males are similar in magnitude to

the insignificant long run impacts on college attendance, and arguably large, but the estimates are


                                                   20
statistically insignificant and become smaller when the sample is expanded. Thus, there is not

strong evidence of lasting impacts.

       The fade-out of initial effects on post-secondary outcomes is consistent with the evidence

Bifulco, Fletcher and Ross (2011) present that the percent of classmates with college educated

parents has no effect on individual skills and attitudes during school. Combined with this earlier

evidence, the fade-out of cohort composition effects suggests that the initial effect on college

attendance is due largely to imitative behavior during or shortly after high school. As contact

with the school cohort becomes less frequent, and individual attitudes and skills become more

telling, the effect on educational enrollment fades. Also absent changes in underlying skills and

attitudes, or improved college-student matches, short-run impacts of cohort composition on

college enrollment do not translate into discernible effects on college completion or labor market

outcomes.

       It is important to note that the estimates based on within-school variation might

underestimate the effect of school composition on student outcomes. Some of the mechanisms

through which the composition of a school might influence outcomes are constant across cohorts.

For instance, a school’s ability to garner resources or teacher expectations for students might be

influenced as much by other cohorts in the school as a student’s own cohort. Also, the effect of

school composition on skill and attitude development might depend on the amount of integration

of students from different backgrounds that occurs within schools. Finally, it is worth noting that

the fact that the effects of having more classmates with college educated parents fade out does

not imply that the effects of other aspects of cohort composition fade. For instance, using data

from Norway, Black, Devereaux, and Salvannes (2010) find that the percent female in the cohort

influences educational attainment, and those effects might in fact be longer lasting. Nonetheless,



                                                 21
the evidence presented here suggests that the initial influence of having more educationally

advantaged high school classmates on post-secondary outcomes are short-lived.

The figures in each row are coefficients from regressions that include, in addition to the
cohort composition measures, controls for cohort fixed effects, school fixed effects,
school trends, the student's race, and the student's mother’s level of education. All
variables are measured using Wave 1 of the Add Health. Figures in parentheses are
standard errors robust to clustering at school level. The F-statistics is for the joint effect
of percent black or Hispanic and percent with college educated mother. All models
estimated using Wave 1, 3 & 4 longitudinal weights. * designates significantly different
