The Effect of Education Policy on Crime: An Intergenerational Perspective

                                              ABSTRACT

The intergenerational transmission of human capital and the extent to which policy interventions can
affect it is an issue of importance. Policies are often evaluated on either short term outcomes or just
in terms of their effect on individuals directly targeted. If such policies shift outcomes across generations
their benefits may be much larger than originally thought. We provide evidence on the intergenerational
impact of policy by showing that educational reform in Sweden reduced crime rates of the targeted
generation and their children by comparable amounts. We attribute these outcomes to improved family
resources and to better parenting.

1    Introduction
Crime imposes huge costs on society and has an exceptionally strong in-
tergenerational link. Earlier papers have demonstrated that crime and
education are related and that policies that increase education can reduce
crime (see Lochner and Moretti (2004)). This is important because it shows
the broader impact of educational reform and a way of improving outcomes
for adults, beyond deterrence and punishment. There are strong theoret-
ical reasons why this should be the case (Becker (1981), Lochner (2004),
Freeman (1999)). An outstanding question, however, is to what extent edu-
cation policies have long term effects on criminal behavior in the sense that
they also affect criminal behavior of the children of those directly affected
by educational reforms. There are good reasons to expect so, considering
the strong intergenerational correlations in criminality and the fact that
education policies can affect parental resources as well as skills important
for parenting. This is associated with the more general question of whether
policy can change the intergenerational transmission of human capital and
offer a way of breaking the cycle of poverty.
    In this paper we show that the Swedish comprehensive school reform,
(originally studied by Meghir and Palme (2005) for its effects on education
and earnings) substantially decreased crime rates of the target generation
and that of their children.
    The effect is only present if the father was affected by the reform -
not the mother. However, this is not surprising because for the cohorts
under consideration here the reform did not affect female outcomes, either
in terms of education, earnings or fertility. On the other hand men affected
by the reform (and in particular those from lower SES) attain higher edu-
cation levels, engage less in criminal activity, earn substantially more, and
marry higher earning wives. Their children however do not attain a higher


                                     2
education level relative to the children of the comparison group, who were
not directly affected by the reform; nor do they earn more. But their crime
rate is substantially reduced. Our interpretation is that the improved re-
sources and lower crime rates of the father, improve their children’s social
skills and make them more averse to criminal behavior, without necessarily
improving their labor market outcomes (see Cunha, Heckman, and Schen-
nach (2010)).
   The two earlier papers by Lochner and Moretti (2004) and Machin,
Marie, and Vujić (2011) respectively study the relation between compul-
sory schooling laws and criminal behavior. Lochner and Moretti (2004)
use changes in compulsory schooling laws across time between US states
to identify the effect of increasing education on crime. Machin, Marie, and
Vujić (2011) compare criminal behavior of the cohorts just before and just
after the implementation of the comprehensive school system in Britain.
We use data containing individual information on all convictions and prison
sentences, along with detailed background characteristics covering the en-
tire population. The dataset also links information on three generations.
In addition to that, our paper extends two important aspects of the pre-
vious literature. First, we compare the criminal behavior of two groups,
distinguished by the school system they were exposed to, but active in the
same labor markets at the same point in time, and who belong to the same
cohort. This means that we are able to identify the effect of the education
reform net of general equilibrium effects; separately from possible cohort
effects, effects originating from regional or local labor market shocks; or
any secular trends in criminal behavior on the national level. Second, by
linking the individuals affected by the reform to data on their children we
are then able to estimate the effect of the reform on the next generation.
Our results point out the importance that educational reform can have on
improving intergenerational outcomes in ways not documented before.

        The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses previous the-
oretical and empirical work on the relation between both own education
and criminal behavior as well as parental education and criminal behav-
ior; Section 3 provides an overview of the comprehensive school reform in
Sweden; Section 4 describes the data; Section 5 presents empirical results
on the association between educational attainments and criminal behav-
ior as well as intergenerational associations of crime; Section 6 discusses
our identification strategy; Section 7 presents the effects of the education
reform on educational attainment of both generations before showing our
main empirical results on the effect of the comprehensive school reform on
various crime outcomes of both generations followed by empirical results
on possible mechanisms; Section 8 concludes.



2        The Impact of Education on Crime

2.1        The Impact of Education on Crime within a Gen-
           eration

The links between economic incentives and crime have been established
both theoretically and empirically in earlier studies. A prominent example
is Freeman (1999) who outlines an economic model of crime where the
choice between criminal and legal activity is determined by comparing the
expected utility of each. Grogger (1998), Gould, Weinberg, and Mustard
(2002) Machin and Meghir (2004) and Edmark (2006)1 demonstrate the
importance of wages and labor market opportunities in driving crime. One
implication of this is that improved education may reduce crime.
        A number of papers have looked at the link between education and crime
directly. These include Lochner and Moretti (2004) and Machin, Marie, and
    1
    For Sweden Edmark (2006) shows the relationship between unemployment rates and
property crimes on county level.


                                        4
Vujić (2011), cited above. A more theoretically based approach was offered
by Lochner (2004) who develops a life cycle model of education and crime
and estimates a negative education-crime relationship. A study, based on
this human capital approach by Williams and Sickles (2002) finds that
years of schooling has a significant negative effect on crime in adulthood,
and that there is a relationship between crime and other measures of human
capital. Earlier studies support this empirical evidence on the education-
crime relationship. For example Freeman (1996) states for the 1991 US
Census that two thirds of US prison inmates are high-school drop-outs
and 12 percent of 24-35 year old high school drop outs were incarcerated
in 1993. This negative correlation between crime and education has also
been documented in the criminology and sociology literature, for example
Sabates and Feinstein (2008a).2
       In the Appendix to this paper we develop a simple theoretical model
in order to better understand the mechanisms through which an education
reform may affect criminal behavior of both the cohort directly affected
by the reform and their children. The model shows that an increase in
compulsory schooling reduces the available time for crime early on;3 it in-
creases human capital and thus reduces the incentive to commit crimes and
may increase the chance of remaining in school beyond the new compul-
sory level. It may also draw increased investments from parents, further
increasing human capital. This reduces crime in the young (school period)
ages. As an adult, the result is increased human capital, which will reduce
adult crime. If there is a habit formation aspect of crime, the early decline
will be reinforced. Thus crime will decline relative to the group that was
not affected by the reform.
       As shown in Meghir and Palme (2005) the Swedish school reform signif-
   2
    See also Sabates and Feinstein (2008b).
   3
    Jacob and Lefgren (2003) give some evidence on this effect and refer to it as the
incapacitation effect.


                                         5
icantly increased the number of years of schooling as well as labor earnings
of those individuals who went through the new school system, in particu-
lar for individuals originating from homes with low educated fathers, i.e.
not more than statutory level of schooling. For those individuals we would
expect a decrease in criminal behavior due to the reform. For individuals
affected by the reform but having parents with more than statutory ed-
ucation the impact is less clear cut. For this group there is no effect on
educational attainment. However, it changed the way they were educated
because it abolished early selection and tracking, which affected primarily
this group.4 This may explain the smaller effects we obtain for those from
a higher SES background.
       A reform increasing educational attainment can however generate gen-
eral equilibrium effects that have the capacity to partially or fully offset the
effects of the policy (see Gallipoli and Fella (2006)). This makes the design
of our empirical analysis particularly useful: by comparing individuals who
went through the reform to those that did not (based on their municipal-
ity at birth), but who work in the same local labor market we control for
general equilibrium effects.


2.2       Parental Education and Children’s Crime

Intergenerational associations of criminal behavior have been documented
in the criminology literature. From the economics point of view this ques-
tion relates to the investments that parents make in their children and
the way that parental education may affect such investments, see Becker
(1981).5 In the Swedish context Hjalmarsson and Lindquist (forthcom-
   4
     A previous study by Deming (forthcoming) highlights the importance of school
quality and it’s potential impact on crime.
   5
     For some empirical work see for example Carneiro, Meghir, and Parey (forthcom-
ing). Moreover, there is direct evidence that better childhood environments and early
education can reduce crime rates, see for example the results form the Perry pre-school
experiment presented in Schweinhart, Montie, Xiang, Barnett, Belfield, and Nores (2005)


                                          6
ing) document a strong correlation between crime of fathers and children
of both genders using the Stockholm Birth Cohort Study. In a second
Swedish study the same authors Hjalmarsson and Lindquist (2010) focus
on parent-child correlations in crime using adoption data, to determine
the factors through which mothers and fathers influence child criminality,
which follows the approach of Björklund, Lindahl, and Plug (2006).
   The theoretical model presented in the Appendix also helps us bet-
ter understand the possible effects on the criminal behavior of children of
the cohort primarily affected by the reform. The children of the affected
generation all experience the same education system because the reform
was rolled out nationally in 1962. They only differ by the fact that some
have parents who faced the new education system and as a result have
more parental education and more resources. These differences will lead
to higher parental investments in their children and possibly higher educa-
tional attainment relative to the children in the comparison group, whose
parents did not go through the reform, see for example Holmlund, Lindhal,
and Plug (forthcoming). Educational attainment may increase because,
according to mounting evidence, an increase in early parental investments
in children improves cognition and social skills and hence reduces the costs
of education. In addition, the increased parental resources allow more
transfers to children alleviating financial constraints for education. These
channels imply an increase in human capital reducing crimes at all life
stages, as described above.
   In addition to the mechanisms brought forward by our theoretical model,
one can think of at least four indirect effects of parental reform assignment
on child criminal behavior. These effects are addressed empirically in Sec-
tion 7.5 on mechanisms. (1) Assortative mating. In the context of an
educational reform, this may imply that those assigned to the reform tend
and Cunha and Heckman (2007).


                                     7
to get married with people with higher educational attainments and/or
earnings, which may have an augmenting effect on parental resources; (2)
Fertility. There may be a causal effect of the attained educational level
on fertility behavior, see e.g. Hotz, Klerman, and Willis (1997) which may
affect the criminal behavior of the children, since the parents are able to
devote more resources to fewer children; (3) Parental criminal behavior.
Previous empirical research has shown a very strong link in criminal be-
havior across generations. Although it is not likely to be an entirely causal
effect it is conceivable that parts of it come from parental role model ef-
fects. Since there may be a direct effect of the reform on parental criminal
behavior, there may also be a secondary effect on the children’s risk of
being convicted for a crime; (4) Mobility. We know from previous studies
that there is a strong element of peer group effects in criminal behavior,
see e.g. Glaeser, Sacerdote, and Scheinkman (1996). The education reform
may have induced those assigned to the reform in the parental generation
to move out from criminal areas, which, in turn, may have affected the
criminal behavior in the child generation. In our empirical analysis we are
able to provide evidence on whether these mechanisms are in place.



3     The 1950 Swedish Education Reform

3.1    The Reform

Prior to the implementation of the comprehensive school reform, pupils
attended a common basic compulsory school (folkskolan) until grade six.
After the sixth grade pupils were selected to continue one or (mainly in ur-
ban areas) two years in the basic compulsory school, or to attend the three
year junior secondary school (realskolan). The selection of pupils into the
two different school tracks was based on their past grades. The pre-reform



                                     8
compulsory school was in most cases administered at the municipality level.
The junior secondary school was a prerequisite for the subsequent upper
secondary school, which, in turn, was required for higher education.
       By 1940 there was increasing pressure to reform the educational system
so as to respond to the increasing amounts of education in countries such as
the US (see Goldin (1999)) and to offer a unified path to higher education.6
       In 1948 a parliamentary school committee proposed a school reform that
implemented a new nine-year compulsory comprehensive school, abolished
early tracking and introduced a national curriculum. The extension to nine
years of compulsory schooling meant that in many parts of the country the
compulsory increase was two years, while in others it was one.7


3.2       The Social Experiment

The proposed new school system, as described above, was introduced grad-
ually from 1949 to 1962 in municipalities or parts of city communities,
which in 1952 numbered 1,055 (including 18 city communities).8 The se-
lection of municipalities was not random. However, the decision to select
the areas was based on an attempt to choose areas that were representative
for the entire country, both in terms of demographics as well as geograph-
ically.
       When a municipality introduced the new school system it implemented
it either for the cohort of pupils who where in fifth grade at the time of
the decision or for those who were currently in the first grade, effectively
delaying the start of the programme. Table 13 in the Appendix shows the
   6
      See Erikson and Jonsson (1993) for an analysis of the educational trends at the time.
   7
      The school reform and its development are described in Meghir and Palme (2003),
Meghir and Palme (2005), and Holmlund (2007). For more detailed reference on the
reform, see Marklund (1980) and Marklund (1981).
    8
      This was done for evaluation purposes as well as a way of resolving the political
differences relating to the refomrs. The official evaluation National School Board (1959)
was mainly of administrative nature. Details on this evaluation are also described in
Marklund (1981).

consider cohorts born between 1945 and 1955. Figure 1 shows the number
of observations in each one-year birth cohort and the proportion assigned
to the reform.



4       Data Sources and Descriptive Statistics
We use a sample originally obtained from Sweden’s population census. To
link individuals across generations we used the multi-generation register,
provided by Statistics Sweden.9 We are able to link and use three gen-
erations in our analysis: the parent generation which is the generation
directly affected by the reform and it consists of all individuals born in
Sweden between 1945 and 1955, their parents and their children labeled
as the grandparent generation and the children generation, accordingly.10
This corresponds to 1,340,857 persons, 658,056 males and 655,801 females
in the parent generation. From the birth certificates we know date of birth,

     Even though we have information on biological and adoptive parents and children,
we exclude all individuals who have been adopted, or who have adopted children them-
selves.


                                         10
parish of birth and gender. We restrict our sample of the children genera-
tion to those who have reached the age of criminal responsibility (age 15)
in 2008, the last year for which we have crime records. This corresponds
to 1,621,758 children, 833,564 sons and 788,194 daughters in the children
generation that were born between 1959 and 1991.
       The reform assignment variable is obtained by relating the parish of
birth to the municipality and then linking that to the historical record for
reform implementation.11
       Information on the education level for the parent generation and child
generation was obtained and matched onto our sample from the Swedish
National Education Register. For the grandparent generation we obtain
information from the 1970 census. This provides information on individ-
uals younger than age 60 in the year of the census, allowing us to obtain
education information for 78.4 percent of the mothers and for 65.8 percent
of the fathers of the parent generation. When we condition on education
of the grandparent generation we thus restrict the sample to those where
the information is available.12
       Information on all convictions in Sweden covering the time period be-
tween 1981 and 2008 is provided by the Swedish National Council for Crime
Prevention (Brå) and has been linked to individuals in our data set using
the unique personal identifying number. This means we are able to link
individuals to actual convictions, which is an advantage of our study com-
pared to previous studies on education reform effects on criminal behavior
(Lochner and Moretti (2004) and Machin, Marie, and Vujić (2011)). We
have detailed information on the number of crimes the person has been
convicted for in each trial, the date of conviction, as well as the penalty for
each crime. One conviction/court trial often covers several crimes.

    Table 14 in the Appendix summarizes the number of available observations in each
generation and subgroup.

   Table 1 shows the number of convicted persons for the two genera-
tions, the 1945-1955 cohorts and their children, covered by our data on
convictions. Over this time window, 25 percent of all males in the parent
generation have been convicted at least once, and over 5 percent have been
to prison. Only 7 percent of women have been convicted, and 0.5 percent
have received a prison sentence. Importantly, the data on criminal convic-
tions only cover the time range between 1981 to 2008, which means that
the generations born between 1945 and 1955 will be between the ages of
26 to 63, whereas their children’s convictions cover the ages of 15 to 49.
The crime rate for the children generation looks very similar but this hides
the fact that on the one hand the aggregate crime rate has declined but we
observe a younger age window (see Figures 2 and 3 in the Appendix).
   Table 15 in the Appendix shows the crime-age distribution for the entire
data set not only covering the cohorts of interest. The largest amount of
convictions are for people between 15 and 24, followed by the age range 25
to 34, and further decreasing with age. This pattern of convictions by age
is also shown in figures 1 and 2 in the Appendix that show the average rate
of convictions by age and by cohorts for the cohorts 1970-1989 using men
in our children sample.



                                       12
       The stated conviction rates for men of roughly 25 percent is a surpris-
ingly high proportion of the population, which prompted us to look into
this in greater detail. First, note that the type of crimes included in our
data have to be severe enough to involve a trial and a conviction in court.
This includes the more serious traffic violations such as driving without a
licence, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and causing bod-
ily harm, but does not include speeding or parking tickets. As such they
do represent serious anti-social behavior. Unfortunately, we were not yet
given the specific type of crime for which an individual in our data has
been convicted.13 However, a good idea of the composition of crime can be
obtained in Table 17 in the Appendix where we show a breakdown of type
of crime convictions in 2009.
       In addition to the data on convictions we have data on all suspected
crimes between 1991 and 2009. It includes a variable that gives a detailed
code on the type of suspected crime.14 Although this data overstates actual
charges and crimes we use it to provide an idea of the distribution of traffic
crimes. Table 18 presents all categories that are related to traffic violations
and the number of offenses between January 1991 and June 2009. The
total number of suspected crimes during this time were 4,073,985 of which
16.9 percent were traffic crimes. Again, all of these traffic crime categories
are severe violations. Additional support of such high conviction rates in
Sweden is provided by other Swedish studies that have shown similar con-
viction rates, see Hjalmarsson and Lindquist (forthcoming), Hjalmarsson
and Lindquist (2010), and Grönqvist (2011).
  13
     We are waiting to obtain a variable that indicates the type of crime from the Brå
crime registry.

       Panel B also shows a very strong association between both mother’s
and father’s education and son’s criminal behavior, even controlling for the
child’s own education.16
  15
   When computing the standard errors we cluster by birth municipality.
  16
   We present the relationship between crime and the levels of education in the Ap-
pendix (see Tables 19 and 20), revealing a steep decline in crime participation associated



                                                  15
    Finally Table 3 illustrates the intergenerational links of crime. The
probability of ever being convicted increases by over 15 percentage points
if a son has a convicted father. This corresponds to a 61 percent increase
of the total share of convicted sons. Children whose father have ever been
convicted to a prison sentence are 8.5 percentage points more likely to end
up in prison, which translates to a 292 percent increase in the share of sons
convicted to prison.



5     Empirical Strategy
The main outcome variables we use are whether an individual was ever
convicted during the observation window 1981-2008 and whether someone
has ever received a prison sentence. Finally, we also consider whether
someone has been convicted more than once as opposed to once or not at
all (recidivism) and the number of convictions (including zero).
    All the analysis is done for males only and we distinguish them by the
education of the grandparent generation.17 We present two sets of estimates.
The first relate to the impact of the reform on the parent generation, i.e.
the generation affected by the educational reform directly. The second
relate to the impact of the reform on the children of the parent generation.
    The youngest person in the parent generation sample is 26 when the
crime records made available to us start. Hence, the effect we estimate is
not attributable to simply keeping the kids off the streets by getting them
to attend school. On the other hand we are missing part of the crime career
of individuals, because a lot of the crime happens at a younger age; this
is not a cause for bias since we observe the same data for the comparison
groups as well. For the child generation we observe the criminal history
with higher levels of own and parental education. A similar decline is also recorded for
incarceration rates.
  17
     The female crime rate is very small and has not been affected by the reform.


                                          16
from the start. Any impacts we we estimate for the child generation are not
due to different schooling systems since they all attend the same reformed
system.
   Since the reform was not randomized we control for potential differences
across treatment and control municipalities using a difference in differences
approach. This compares the change in the crime across cohorts in mu-
nicipalities that implemented the reform for the younger cohort but not
the older one to the change in crime rate across the same cohorts living in
municipalities where there was no change in policy for these same cohorts.
In practice we do this for all cohorts in our window and all municipalities.
Thus our approach is best described by the regression


                  ∗
                 yi,m,t = α + β1 Ri,m,t + γ10 ti + γ20 Mi + i,m,t ,

       ∗
where yi,m,t is the latent crime "intensity" outcome observed for person i
born in municipality m and in birth cohort t. A conviction corresponds
    ∗
to yi,m,t > 0. Ri,m,t is the reform indicator, which equals one if individ-
ual i belongs to a municipality and cohort that has been assigned to the
new school system; ti is a vector of indicator variables indicating to which
cohort individual i belongs to and Mi is a vector of indicator variables in-
dicating in which municipality individual i was born. i,m,t is conditionally
independent of Ri,m,t .
   Based on the latent equation above we first use the linear probability
model, which we estimate by GLS. The main reason for this specification
is computational convenience: there are about 1,000 municipality and 11
cohort fixed effects.
   As an alternative, we also estimate a Logit model and we solve the
computational problem by using minimum distance: first we group the
data by municipality and cohort and estimate the within-cell conviction



                                         17
probability (Pmt ). We then use minimum distance to impose the restriction
that this probability is generated from a logistic distribution with a linear
index as in the latent equation above by fitting the log-odds ratio as follows

                                Pmt
                       log(           ) = δ0 + δ1 Rm,t + δ20 ti + δ40 Mi .
                              1 − Pmt


         In practice we need to drop all cells where the log odds ratio is not
defined.18 Implicitly the Logit and the LP models deal with such cells and
the nonlinear form of the probabilities in a different way and hence we
needed to check if the results differ: they do not.
         The key identifying assumption that delivers the difference in differ-
ences approach is that in the absence of the reform, crime propensity can
be written as yit∗ = F (t, εi ) where the distribution of the unobservable εi
is independent of cohort t but can vary across municipalities and where
F (., .) is strictly monotonic in this unobservable. In terms of an economic
model, If we think of this as human capital then this means that individuals
with higher human capital always commit less crime. The linear specifica-
tion above imposes the monotonicity assumption. The discrete nature of
the dependent variable also requires a distributional assumption on εi for
identification.19

   The reform significantly increased years of schooling for men of the
affected generation. The overall effect is larger for those individuals with
low educated fathers, as reported in Meghir and Palme (2005). However, in
this broader and larger sample we find a significant effect (at the 10% level)
on those with higher educated fathers. The effect for women is similar and
shows a strong and significant increase in schooling for those with a low
educated father, though smaller in magnitude than for males. We find no
effect on those women with a father who has higher than statutory level of
education.

6.2       The Reform and Crime in the Parent Generation

Table 5 and 6 show the estimates of the effect of being assigned to the
reform on three different outcomes: the probability of ever being convicted,
recidivism20 and total number of convictions. Table 5 shows the results for
the entire sample, while Table 6 shows the corresponding results separately
for the sub-sample of those with a low educated grandparent generation:
for this group the impact of the reform on the educational attainment of
the parent generation is strongest.
      In addition, we split up the results on the basis of different cohort groups
because the overall results may be diluted by the fact that the oldest birth
cohorts are observed from an age where crime rates are relatively low. For
example, the oldest cohort included, those born in 1945, are aged 36 when
we start to record their criminal behavior.
      We use a linear probability model for the outcomes of ever being con-
victed as well as recidivism and a negative binomial model for the number
of convictions. All specifications include fixed effects for birth municipality
as well as birth cohorts and the standard errors are corrected for clustering
within municipality of birth, allowing for both spatial and serial correlation.


Column 1 in Table 5 shows the results for the entire sample. The point
estimate is significant but not very precise. However, if we restrict the
sample to cohorts where data allow us to observe most of the criminal
careers, we obtain significant and large effects on all outcomes. On the
probability of being convicted, the estimate for the youngest cohort, born
in 1954 or 1955, is highly significant suggesting a 1.3 percentage points
decrease in crime; this corresponds to a 5 percent decrease in the probability
of ever being convicted as a result of being assigned to the post reform
school system. Comparing the results in Tables 5 and 6 suggests that the
 20
      being convicted at least twice versus once or not at all

effect is somewhat stronger in the group originating from homes with low
educated fathers whose educational outcomes were more strongly affected
by the reform.

To put these effects into perspective to years of schooling we compute an
indirect least squares estimate, reported in Tables 5 and 6. This instru-
mental variable approach relies on the assumption that the reform only
affected our outcomes through its impact on parental education. The ILS
estimate21 suggests that one year of schooling decreases the probability of

      This is computed as the ratio of the reduced form estimate of the reform effects

by 3.5 percentage points for those with low educated fathers.
    Hjalmarsson, Holmlund, and Lindquist (2011) confirm our estimates
on an extended data-set including convictions going back to 1973. They
confirm our general finding that the reform has an impact on own criminal
on the probability of a conviction (Tables 5 and 6) over the first stage estimate of the
reform effects on years of schooling (Panel A in Table 4). The first stage results show
an 0.216 and 0.324 increase in years of schooling for men and men with low educated
fathers, respectively.

behavior and that the results get stronger when the period in the life cycle
with the highest rate of criminality are included in the sample. All our
results are consistent with findings by Lochner and Moretti (2004) and
Machin, Marie, and Vujić (2011) for the US and the UK respectively.
      The reform also had an impact on other crime outcome variables, re-
cidivism and number of convicted crimes, and the probability of having
ever been convicted to a prison sentence. The latter results are only pre-
sented in the Appendix in Table 22. The results indicate that the reform
decreased the probability of recidivism and prison sentence for some of the
cohorts and more strongly so for those originating from a low education
background. We also find an effect on the number of convicted crimes on
a 10 percent significance level for some cohorts and again stronger effects
for the low SES group.
      As a robustness check for our estimates we reestimate the model using
the Logit specification. The results from this exercise, reported in the
Appendix, show results very similar to those displayed in Tables 5 and 6,
although the precision is somewhat inferior.


6.3       The Reform and Crime in the Child Generation

Table 7 reports the results of the difference-in-differences estimation of the
effects of the school reform on the three outcomes - probability of being
convicted, recidivism and number of convictions - for the child genera-
tion.22 For the first two outcomes we estimate linear probability models
and for the third negative binomial models. Again, for the probability of
being convicted, we additionally estimate a Logit model based on cohort-
municipality cells reported in the Appendix as a sensitivity analysis. We
estimate two specifications. In the first one, we estimate the effects of a
father who attended the new school system on son’s criminal behavior and

reform school system. In addition, we present separate results for those
with low educated grandfathers.

      The reform significantly reduces the probability of having ever been
convicted for the sons of those (fathers) who were assigned to the reform
by 0.6 percentage points. Since the average share of convicted individuals
in this cohort was about 26.5 percent the reduction in criminality was
approximately 2.5 percent.23 The effect is stronger in the group with a
low educated paternal grandfather: the reduction in the probability of a

      The marginal effects of the Logit Model estimates are very similar, see Appendix.

conviction is 1.02 percentage points, which translates to a 4.13 percent
decrease in the share of convicted sons of low educated grandfathers. The
results for the additional outcome variable that measures recidivism, the
probability of having been convicted at least twice are presented in column
(3) for all sons, and for those with low educated grandparents in column
(4). In the group with low educated grandfathers, having a father who
was assigned to the new school system significantly reduces the probability
of becoming a repeat offender. We find a strong effect of father’s reform
assignment on the total number of crimes for the overall sample of sons,
shown in column (5).24
       There are no significant effects of reform assignment of mothers on the
probability of a conviction of their sons either for the entire sample of all
sons, or for those with a low educated maternal grandfather. This also
holds for the recidivism outcome variable presented in columns (3) and (4)
and the number of convictions shown in columns (5) and (6).25


6.4       The Common Trends Assumption

An identifying assumption underlying the differences-in-differences estima-
tor is that any trend in the outcome variable is common in the treatment
and comparison groups over the period of comparison. This assumption is
untestable because it relates to the counterfactual change in the treatment
group. However, an indication can be obtained by testing whether the
trends are common in the two sets of groups before the reform and indeed
  24
     We gain more precision of the results presented Table 7 when we exclude those
sons who only appear one, two or three years in the crime records, see Table 25 in
the Appendix. More specifically, we repeated the linear probability estimation for sons
excluding those who are 15 years, 15 or 16 years, and 15-17 years in the last year for
which we have crime records.
  25
     We repeated the analysis for the children generation using the suspected crime data
and find a negative but not significant relationship between father’s reform assignment
and sons probability of having ever been suspected for a crime. Results are provided by
the authors upon request. Descriptive tables on suspected crime rates are provided in
the Appendix in Table 16.


                                          25
after the reform as well.
   In our sample we have 12 groups of municipalities indexed by which
cohort was first assigned to the reform. We used only the municipalities
that first implemented the reform for the 1947 cohort onwards (i.e. 10 of
the 12 set of municipalities) and compared the trend of criminal behavior of
individuals across these municipalities for all cohorts that were not affected
by the reform. The pooled regression of these groups is y = α + βt + γ 0 m +
δ 0 t ∗ m + ν, where m is a set of dummies indicating the group to which the
municipality belongs based on the cohort for which it first implemented
the reform; t is a linear trend that represents the cohorts 1945-1955. A
joint test of δ1 = δ2 = ... = δ10 = 0 gives a F statistic of F (9;7,090)=1.15
with P =0.323, with 7,090 cohort-municipality cells before treatment. This
implies the hypothesis of common trends in crime for the pre-treatment
cohorts for all groups of municipalities cannot be rejected.
   For post-treatment trends in crime we only compare crime between the
municipalities that implemented the reform for cohorts born before 1954.
We compare the criminal behavior of individuals across these municipalities
for the cohorts affected by the reform. A joint test of equality of the
coefficients on the interaction term of the above pooled model yields F(9,
4,808) with P=0.1303, where 4,808 is the number of cohort-municipality
cells that are treated. This means that the hypothesis of a common trend
in criminal behavior for the treated cohorts is the same across the groups of
municipalities that implemented the reform for different cohorts cannot be
rejected. Both these tests are strong evidence in favor of the key identifying
assumption for our difference-in-differences approach to the problem.


6.5    Mechanisms

The key result of our paper is that the reform reduced the criminal behavior
of fathers and sons by large and comparable amounts. The persistence of

                                     26
the effects of this policy puts a different perspective on the value of such
reforms because the benefits are multiplied by improving intergenerational
outcomes. We now make an attempt to provide evidence on the mechanisms
behind this outcome.
   We address four different channels through which the education reform
may affect the probability of the next generation to be involved in criminal
activities. First, transmission of general human capital between genera-
tions. Second, changes in fertility patterns that may affect resources allo-
cated to children. Third, effects through peer group behavior from possible
parental movements from high to low crime areas. Fourth, effects caused by
intergenerational state dependence in criminal behavior, through parental
role models or stigmatizing effects of being convicted for a crime.


6.5.1   Intergenerational transmission of human capital

Consider the following simple model of intergenerational transmission of
human capital. Human capital is produced by investments in various stages
of the child’s life as well as by overall educational attainment Ec . Suppose
there are two stages, early investments I0 and investments during schooling
I1 . The efficiency of investments depends on the educational level of the
parent, Ep . Fixed endowments are left implicit. Denote the human capital
production function by


                             H = H(I0 , I1 , Ec |Ep )


where HI0 0 > 0, HI0 1 > 0, HE0 c > 0 and HI000 < 0, HI001 < 0, HE00 c < 0. Parents
are assumed to care about child quality, which here is just their human




                                        27
capital. Ignoring dynamics for simplicity, they solve the problem26


          max {u(C, H) st C + I0 + I1 = Y p and H = H(I0 , I1 , Ec |Ep )}
         C,I0 ,I1



where C is parental consumption. In this simple context investments in
children will increase as parental resources Y P increase, so long as H is a
normal good. The first order conditions for investments are


                                   u0H ∂I
                                       ∂H
                                          0
                                            = u0C
                                        and
                                   u0H ∂I
                                       ∂H
                                          1
                                            = u0C .

To the extent that liquidity constraints are absent the timing of the in-
creased resources over the life-cycle are unimportant and they will be al-
located to equalize the marginal returns to investment as far as child de-
velopment is concerned (see Cunha, Heckman, and Schennach (2010)). An
increase in the marginal productivity of such investments (say due to an
increase in parental education Ep ) will lead to more investments in the
children at both stages. This will happen both because the productivity of
investments may increase and because parental resources Y P go up.
       Resources can thus be a central mechanism; in Table 8 we report the
causal effect of the reform on earnings for males and females, respectively.
Males on average gained 6.4 percent on the reform; this effect can be at-
tributed to men born in low SES homes (column 2 in the table). For
women, the reform did not have any significant effect on earnings in any
group at all.27
  26
     The problem is dynamic sequential, but nothing would be gained in introducing this
notation here.
  27
     This is somewhat different compared to the result on earnings reported in Meghir
and Palme, 2005. However, it is important to note that the estimates are obtained using
a number of later cohorts; women were increasing their educational attainment overall
quite fast, so for later cohorts the reform did not constrain their behavior.

      Moreover, as shown in Table 9 the reform caused men to marry women
with higher earnings by about US $800 a year.28 The wife is also less likely
to be unemployed.
      These results point to a very strong increase in resources for males from
low SES homes assigned to the reform, both directly through increasing
earnings as well as through marriage with higher earning women. The
fact that the larger part of the intergenerational effect of crime can be at-
tributed to these households further reinforces the notion that the increase
in resources was a key factor in reducing criminality.
      For females who went through the reform there was no significant effect
on resources, through labor earnings, or through assortative mating. This
is also consistent with the lack of any effect of the mother having been
assigned to the reform on the child’s criminal activity.
      There are two channels through which an increase in parental resources

can affect child criminal activity. First, investments in children can increase
their human capital. This will improve labor market opportunities relative
to the returns from crime and will also increase the opportunity costs of
being incarcerated or stigmatized with a criminal record. This has been
argued by Becker and others.29 First, as long as the improvement in labor
market skills is not counteracted by improved effectiveness in crime the
increase in human capital will reduce crime. Second, a related channel,
which can be viewed as increasing human capital, is an improvement of
social skills through a better upbringing and reduced paternal crime. It
can also be viewed as increasing the costs of crime.
      To pursue these issues we first see if the reform increased children’s
generation educational attainments and labor earnings. Table 10 shows
the effects of father’s reform assignment on years of schooling of their sons
(Panel A) and log annual earnings (Panel B), separated by education levels

   born 1945-1955. The sons have to be born before 1982. In Panel A the
   dependent variable is years of schooling measured in 2006, such that indi-
   viduals born before 1982 should have finished their education. Panel B uses
   a panel of log annual earnings covering the years 1991-2006, but excluding
   2003. All regressions include a full set of birth municipality and birth cohort
   dummies of father, as well as year fixed effects, this set of variables is de-
   noted as Xi , m. The specification in Panel B, column 1 equals: log(earn)i =

       To sum up, we did not obtain evidence that educational attainments
and labor earnings increased for sons in the child generation, which are
  30
     We restricted the sample of sons in those estimations to be born before 1982. Al-
tering this age threshold by excluding successively younger cohorts lead to the same
results, both for the education estimations as well as for the earnings estimations. In
addition, we used specifications including trends of sons’ birth cohorts interacted with
fathers’ birth cohorts, trends of fathers’ birth cohorts interacted with municipality dum-
mies for years of implementation of the reform, neither showed a different result from
the ones presented in Table 10. Furthermore, instead of using years of schooling we
estimated whether father’s reform assignment had an impact on whether sons reached
at least vocational education, secondary schooling/ secondary schooling plus one year
or a university/college degree. We found no impact.

mechanisms for reduced criminality in this generation. However, increased
parental resources can very well improve parental quality increasing the
psychic costs of participation in crime, without necessarily changing labor
market returns. In this case we can expect a reduction in crime without
necessarily observing other improvements, such as earnings.


6.5.2    Fertility

The reform could affect fertility behavior by reducing the total number of
children, increasing the age of first birth or changing the spacing of births,
all of which could affect the time and monetary resources invested in kids.
It could also decrease unwanted pregnancies and births.31 In Table 11
we consider some of these possibilities. We estimate the impact on ever
having a child, on the number of children and on the age for the first child.
From a point estimate perspective all coefficients imply an improvement
in the quality of children, with the strongest effect being the age at first
birth. However, the effects are not significant at conventional levels. The
only highly significant result is the number of children associated with
teenage fathers.32 However, since only 1.7 percent of men father children as
teenagers and, more importantly, the reform only decreased this probability
by between 0.2 and 0.3 percent, this is not enough to explain a large part
of our results, although it does go in the right direction.


6.5.3    Mobility

A further potential channel for the improvement of child outcomes may
come from improved neighbourhoods and peers. Indeed such a possibil-
ity was an important motivation for "Move to Opportunity" (see Kling,
  31
      Previous studies provide evidence that unwanted or unplanned children might be
more likely to become offenders, see Donohue and Levitt (2001) and Hunt (2006).
   32
      The results for women are qualitatively the same, the only difference is that women
who were assigned to the reform are less likely to ever have a child on a 10 percent
significance level.

Liebman, and Katz (2007)). To investigate whether the parent generation
moved to better neighbourhoods following the reform we classify all mu-
nicipalities according to their average income in 1960, i.e. before anyone
affected by the reform entered the labor market.33
      Table 12 shows results for: indicator variable if individual lives in a
different municipality in 1991 compared to their birth municipality in col-
umn (1); indicator variable if individuals moved from a lower than median
income birth municipality at 1960 levels to a higher than median income
municipality at 1960 levels in 1991 in column (2); the reversed direction
from high to low income municipalities in columns (3); and if individu-
als moved from or remained in a municipality with the same 1960 income
classification in columns (4) and (5).

   The results of these estimations show no significant impact of the reform
on moves from or to low income municipalities and no significant impact of
moves at all. Although the peer group may have improved through better
education this was not further reinforced by moving to different/better
neighborhoods.

   transformed into those that they correspond to from 1976 onwards. Low to low/high to high include both cases where
   individuals move to another municipality by 1991 that also was of lower/higher than median income in 1960, and those

6.5.4     Father as a role model

Section 5 showed a very strong association between father’s criminal behav-
ior and that of the son. As shown in Table 3, among convicted fathers the
probability of the child being convicted is higher by 15 percentage points, or
more than 60 percent. For prison sentences the association is even stronger:
if the father has been convicted to a prison sentence, the probability that
the son is also convicted to prison is higher by more than 290 percent. We


                                                 34
cannot establish the extent to which this relationship is causal. However,
we note that the reform did decrease fathers’ crime and improved their ed-
ucational outcomes. So a possible channel is that fathers who went through
the reform are better role models with improved education and lower crime
rates.


6.5.5    Women and the effect of the reform

When we look at whether there is an effect of women going through the
reform on their child’s criminal activity we find no effect; yet the reform
did not increase their earnings or their educational attainment, since in the
later cohorts of women included here educational attainment had increased
beyond the compulsory level anyway. Moreover women commit only a
fraction of the crimes that men commit (1/5th) so there is much less scope
for improving them as role models.



7       Conclusions
Educational reforms have been studied extensively for their impact on ed-
ucational attainment and labor market outcomes. However, they can also
have other important effects such as improvements in health and reduction
in crime, which have been documented in the literature. Here we inves-
tigate the intergenerational effects that education can have on crime, by
exploiting an important reform and the rich administrative data available in
Sweden, linking three generations of individuals. Establishing these longer
term persistent effects is crucial for our understanding of the real benefits
of such interventions. In an earlier paper Meghir and Palme (2005) demon-
strated that the reform we use here, had substantial effects on educational
attainment and earnings, particularly for those with low educated parents.
    Using administrative data that compares individuals of the same co-


                                     35
horts, but educated under different systems, we find strong negative and
significant effects of the reform on crime. Thus, for the youngest cohorts,
born between 1954 and 1955, the point estimate suggests a 1.3 percentage
points, corresponding to 5 percent decrease in the probability of being con-
victed from being assigned to the post reform school system. In the group
from homes with low educated fathers the effect seems to be somewhat
larger, which is consistent with a larger effect on educational attainment.
   The striking result of this paper, however, is the effect of the reform on
the sons of those originally affected: there is a significant effect of paternal
assignment to the reform on the probability of being convicted correspond-
ing to an average reduction in crime of about 2.5 percent.
   We investigate the role for five different channels through which the
intergenerational effect of education on can operate. We find empirical
support for two of these: increased parental resources and improved pa-
ternal role models. The supporting evidence for the former is that men’s
earnings increased due to the reform; moreover these men also married
higher earning women. The support from the second is necessarily more
circumstantial: first we note a very large correlation between father and
son criminal activity, part of which we expect to be a causal link; second
father’s criminal activity declined. We interpret this as implying that the
improved behavior of the father affects child behavior. The persistent inter-
generational impact of the reform shows the potential of education policy
to induce broader social change.

  Notes: We only present the number of observations that are available on father’s and grandfa-
  ther’s education level, because we will condition on father’s or grandfather’s education level in
  the analysis. We only have information on the highest level of education for those individuals
  that are not older than 60 years in the year of the 1970 census. We report the number of indi-
  viduals in each sample, the number of individuals for which we have information on the highest
  level of education on their fathers or grandfathers and the share of those for which we have
  this information with the lowest education level. For the children generation with low educated
  grandfathers on their father’s side of the family, we consider those children whose father was
  born between 1945 and 1955. For the children generation with low educated grandfathers on
  the mother’s side of the family we consider those whose mother was born between 1945 and
  1955.

8.3.1    Additional Results - First Generation

To avoid the computational difficulties involved in estimating a logit model
with 1,000 municipality fixed effects and 11 cohorts we use a minimum dis-
tance procedure. We collapse the sample to 10,744 municipality-cohort cells
by computing the log-odds ratio within each cell. For 691 municipality-
cohort cells the proportion of observed crime was zero and hence the
log-odds ratio is not defined. For 108 cells we cannot assign the reform
status, which leaves us with 9,949 municipality-cohort observations. We
then regress the log-odds ratio on the municipality and cohort dummies
as well as on the reform indicator using GLS. Each cell was weighted by
p
  pc (1 − pc )Nc , where Nc is the cell size and pc is the within cell probability
of a conviction. The corresponding marginal effects for different cohorts of

When we collapse the data set by cohort-municipality level as a first step
to estimating the logit model, we do it by father’s cohort-municipality
level which gives us 10,607 cells for the father’s sample, and 10,247 for
the sample with low educated paternal grandfathers. For the specification

with mother’s reform assignment we collapse the data by mother’s cohort-
municipality level which leads to 10,647 for the entire sample and 10,324
for the low educated maternal grandfathers sample.
   The log-odds-ratio estimates from the logit model translate into a marginal
effect of a 0.646 percentage points decrease in the probability of a convic-
tion, which is very similar to the marginal effect obtained from the linear
probability model (LP column). Hence, the logit model suggests similar to
the linear probability model, that father’s reform assignment significantly
reduces the total share of convicted men by about 2.5 percent.

for the effects of the reform status of father and mother on the probability
of a prison sentence of sons show no significant effects.

8.3.3      Classifying Municipalities

Individuals who were assigned to the reform might be more likely to move
to higher income/lower crime areas later in life. Our strategy to study
this is to use pre-reform municipality income levels from the year 1960
to classify municipalities into lower than median income and higher than
median income municipalities before the reform, since the reform itself may
have affected post reform municipality characteristics.34 Our main focus is
to see whether individuals assigned to the reform are more likely to move
from low to high income municipalities. For this mobility analysis across
municipalities we will use individual information on birth municipalities,
the municipality of residence in 1991 and municipality income levels in
1960. For each individual we will assign the income level of their birth
municipality and whether it was below or above median income in 1960.
Furthermore, we determine where each individual lived in 1991 and assign
the income level of that municipality but at the pre-reform income level in
1960, as well as the according income classification.
This analysis is complicated by the fact that Sweden’s municipalities went
through several reforms between 1953 and 1986 that changed the local
government district division and the numerical codes used in administrative
data. In our data we have 1046 different municipality codes in 1952. By
1986 Sweden’s amount of municipalities was reduced to 286.35 .
       The reduction of municipalities was mainly done through merges of
several municipalities. More specifically, 965 municipalities were merged
with neighboring municipalities to build municipalities with one code or
in some cases remained the same. In these cases we are able to assign
  34
     Unfortunately, we do not have crime records on municipality level before 1981.
  35
     All municipality code changes are taken from the report of Statistics Sweden that
lists all municipality code and administrative division changes between 1952-1986:
Sveriges kommuner åren 1952-1986 Förändringar i kommunindelning och kommunkoder,
SCB Meddelanden i samordningsfrågor, Sverige (1986): 5; most changes were finalized
already before 1976


                                         55
unique new post-municipality reform codes that correspond to the previous
municipality codes.
       However, in a few cases municipalities were split up into several other
communities: 76 of the original 1046 municipalities were split up into 2
different municipalities, and 8 original ones were split up into 3 different
municipalities. For those 84 cases of split ups we cannot determine new
post-municipality reform codes that uniquely correspond to the before 1952
municipality codes. Due to this ambiguity we decided to assign the munic-
ipality code of the municipality with the highest population among those
municipalities into which the municipality was divided.36 All together this
process led to the mentioned 298 municipalities by 1986.


       For our mobility analysis we use the population weighted average of mu-
nicipality income levels of 1960 for the new 298 municipalities and whether
it is below or above median income. More specifically, the income levels
of the new municipality codes are computed using the 1960 income lev-
els and population sizes of the municipalities that will later build the new
municipalities. We match this information to each individual to assign a
municipality income level according their birth municipality and a munic-
ipality income level according to their municipality of residence in 1991
both as of 1960 levels and according to the new municipality codes. All
birth municipality codes are thus brought in accordance with the new codes
after the municipality reform and those are used for the analysis because
one would obtain a mechanical move of individuals by the changes of mu-
nicipality codes even though individuals did not move.



  36
    When matching the data some municipalities where individuals lived in 1991 did
not appear in our municipality coding because they were split up municipality cases and
the higher population destination was chosen. In these five cases we assign the income
level of the municipality that was not chosen by our rule.
