                                           ABSTRACT

For over a quarter century anthropometric historians have struggled to identify and measure the
numerous factors that affect adult stature, which depends upon diet, disease and physical activity
from conception to maturity. I simplify this complex problem by assessing nutritional status in a
particular year using synthetic longitudinal data created from measurements of children born in the
same year but measured at adjacent ages, which are abundantly available from 28,000 slave
manifests housed at the National Archives. I link this evidence with annual measures of economic
conditions and new measures of the disease environment to test hypotheses of slave owner behavior.
Height-by-age profiles furnish clear evidence that owners substantially managed slave health. The
short-term evidence shows that weather affected growth via exposure to pathogens and that owners
modified net nutrition in response to sustained price signals.

       For over a quarter century economic historians have examined the profusion of

data on stature for insights into the quality of life since the eighteenth century. Their

study of muster rolls, slave manifests, convict records and other sources provides

valuable knowledge of biological inequality, slavery, health aspects of living standards

during industrialization, the relative health of men and women, the mortality transition,

and many other subjects.1

       Much research has gone forward using average adult stature, which summarizes

the nutritional status of a population from conception to maturity. This summary aspect

of adult height creates a double-edged sword: it broadly encompasses and distills

numerous forces such as diet, disease and work effort, which significantly affect the

quality of life. On the other hand, analysis of such evidence is complicated by the many

factors that can influence a person’s adult height over a time span of nearly two decades,

from conception to maturity. Thus it is often difficult if not impossible to identify the

specific causes that distinguish the average height of one birth cohort from another.

Indeed, different cohorts may have identical average heights but for somewhat different

reasons, such as relatively small size at birth in one group that is offset by good

adolescent net nutrition in the other. Therefore any researcher of average adult height

potentially faces a host of identification issues not unlike those involved in the study of

national income, a summary measure of social performance that has inspired countless

economic models specifying the pathways or mechanisms underlying outcomes.

       This paper formulates a new technique for tackling the identification problem:

synthetic longitudinal data. The method relies on the heights of growing children, which

were abundantly recorded for antebellum American slaves, but the method can be applied




                                              1
to any population having height-by age data for individuals who had not reached

maturity. By shrinking the time span of the health measure from nearly two decades to

one year, it becomes feasible to link outcomes with forces that operated in that year.

       The next section briefly describes an enlarged sample of over 28,000 slave

manifests and compares height-by-age results with earlier research on slave stature. The

main contribution of substance on the topic of slavery, pursued in the remainder of the

paper, involves short versus long-term strategies of plantation management. At one end

of the continuum of opinion, represented by Eugene Genovese’s The Political Economy

of Slavery, plantation owners were pre-capitalist, quasi-aristocratic landowners imbued

with an antibourgeois spirit who most probably relied on tradition and rules of thumb to

guide their farms.2 Obtuse to profits but sensitive to norms of southern society, these

planters avidly organized social events, were attentive to fashion, contributed to political

discourse and orchestrated the marriages of their offspring but responded little to

changing economic conditions in organizing production. A contrary hypothesis, put

forward in Time on the Cross, envisions slave owners quickly adapting to prices of inputs

and outputs in choosing to purchase or clear land, to hire or sell slaves, to change the crop

mix.3 Although not discussed in the book, presumably this alacrity also applied to

components of net nutrition under planter control, including diet and work effort. I link

the synthetic longitudinal height data with prices of inputs and outputs, controlling for

weather and for epidemics, to assess the extent to which plantation owners responded to

short run economic conditions in deliberately managing the health of their chattel.



Evidence




                                              2
       The Bill for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, passed by Congress in 1807,

outlawed imports from Africa but permitted the coastwise trade to continue as a

monitored activity.4 Ship captains at the port of origin prepared duplicate manifests that

described each slave by name, age, sex, height and color. One copy remained at the port

of origin and the captain delivered the other to the port of destination, where the collector

prevented smuggling by checking the cargo against the manifest.

       Previous articles on slave heights used samples that were small or modest in size,

which limited the options for chronological analysis within regions. Steckel’s 1979 sample

had 1,442 manifests involving 16,099 slaves, an effort subsequently enlarged to 10,562

manifests and 50,606 individuals.5 This paper nearly triples the sample size, collecting all

the manifests available at the National Archives in Record Group 36, which after eliminating

a small number of duplicates, includes 27,580 manifests and 146,168 slaves.

       Table 1 shows that slave origins were widely distributed around the Atlantic and Gulf

coasts. Virginia provided nearly one-quarter of all slaves in the collection, followed by

Louisiana (17.0%), South Carolina (15.6%), and Alabama (12.6%). The major ports within

these states were Charleston, Norfolk, New Orleans, and Mobile. The geographic pattern of

shipments tended to flow from east to west. Virginia, for example, provided 24.5 percent of

slaves but received only 0.6 percent of the exports in the sample. At 14.0 percent, Georgia

was the largest recipient of slaves on the Atlantic Coast but Louisiana was by far the most

important destination (57.5%). New Orleans alone received 57 percent of all slaves.

       Although the law became effective in 1808, only 8 manifests appear for the years

1808 to 1814. The War of 1812 no doubt interrupted shipments and many slaves in the early

part of the westward migration probably traveled short distances overland, but the virtual




                                              3
nonexistence of records before 1815, the modest numbers before 1820, and the small number

of exports from North Carolina over the entire period (a total of 558 slaves) suggest that

some manifests did not survive to be lodged in the National Archives (see Table 2).6

Shipments occurred in substantial numbers every year from 1818 to 1860 but the period of

most intense activity took place from the mid 1840s through the mid 1850s. Nearly one third

of all slaves were shipped between 1845 and 1854.

          Even though the collection of manifests housed by the National Archives may be

incomplete, there is no doubt that coastal shipments comprised an important share of

westward migration. Comparing the manifests with estimates of the interregional movement

of slaves prepared by Fogel and Engerman shows that nearly one slave in five who moved

was listed on a manifest, and the ratio exceeded 25 percent during the decades of the 1820s

and the 1840s.7 Because most slaves who traveled from the interior states probably went

over land, the coastal trade likely comprised a large share of all exports from the coastal

states.

          Growth depression of children and their remarkable recovery as teenagers have been

at the center of height research on slave health. Comparisons with historical and

contemporary populations show that American slave children were small in relation to

children living in the poorest areas of least developed countries; such poorly nourished

children would have elicited shock and alarm in a modern pediatrician’s office.8 On the

other hand, the catch-up growth that American slaves witnessed as teenagers was remarkable

if not unprecedented.9 Overwhelmingly past and present populations that had very small

children also had very small adults.10 The slave pattern has numerous implications, not only

for economic history and the understanding of the slave regime, but for biological processes




                                             4
of growth that interest anthropologists, human biologists, and nutritionists. The unusual

pattern of physical growth strongly suggests that planters deliberately managed the health of

slave children. The question addressed here is whether this management was fine tuned and

extended to short-term control of net nutrition. The analysis below indicates that the answer

is “yes.”

       The data in Table 3 make clear that the unusual pattern of physical growth was

not an artifact of sample composition, whereby the slave trade mixed very short children

from one region with tall adults from another. Growth depression and recovery prevailed

within all regions, although its extent was somewhat less in the Chesapeake compared

with lower states in the South. Several features of life are potential explanations for

health that deteriorated with more southerly location, including a decline in dietary

diversity, a harsher disease environment, and greater work effort on larger plantations

organized by gang labor. The power of these explanations is under investigation.

       The unusual age profile of slave growth is unlikely to have been caused by a

disease environment that improved around age 10, approximately the age when children

began working.11 Indeed, the physical effort of work would have drained net nutrition,

other things being equal. Thus it is very probable that the diet improved by more than

enough to offset the drain of work. It is relevant to ponder whether this pattern was

profitable. Through trial and error, or possibly more sophisticated calculations, did slave

owners conclude they should starve children but feed working children enough for catch

up growth? The answer is yes, based on the costs of pork and therefore protein, the most

deficient item in the child diet, and the value of on inch of height. Even if mortality rates

fell by 50 per cent and children were able to work beginning at age 8 with an improved




                                              5
diet, the rate of return on this investment was only 1.2 per cent,12 which is far below the

10 per cent estimated by Fogel and Engerman for the rate of return on a slave purchase.13

This result highlights the importance of the family in protecting the interests of children

in free society.



Synthetic Longitudinal Data

        Figure 1 depicts the growth velocity of American boys, tabulated from modern

American growth standards, which illustrates the average pattern of growth under good

conditions in the United States. Several studies confirm the similarity of this pattern

across a wide range of well-nourished ethnic groups; children who grow up under good

conditions are approximately the same height regardless of genetic heritage. Growth is

clearly most rapid in early childhood and after several years of irregular decline children

experience an adolescent growth spurt, which adds considerably to their eventual height

as adults. The adolescent spurt and other aspects of physical maturation begins about 2

years earlier among girls than boys and primarily for this reason females end up about 4.5

inches shorter as adults, i.e. girls have about 2 years less growth at preadolescent rates.

The general pattern of growth is not automatic, however, and is very sensitive to the

environment. If poor conditions suddenly appear, children will cease to grow almost

immediately. Nutritional stress during wartime demonstrates the vulnerability of children

to adverse net nutrition.14 In a phenomena know as “catch-up growth” children can

rapidly recover some or possibly all lost ground if good times return. This feature of

growth leads researchers to monitor the consequences of health or nutritional

interventions by repeated (longitudinal) measurements.




                                              6
       Military organizations systematically recorded heights since the mid-eighteenth

century and their archives provide an enormous reservoir of information for study of

nutritional status from the eve of the industrial revolution onwards. Such data are

enormously valuable because the measurements summarize net nutritional conditions

from conception to maturity. Because all we have is the end result (adult height),

however, we do not know when (at which age) various forces of diet, disease or work

may have affected growth. This identification problem confounds the interpretation of

adult height, but a solution can be extracted from the heights of those who were still

growing.

       Consider individual 1 in Figure 2, a slave child born in 1830 who was measured at

age 5 and again at age 6. The growth of the child reflects net nutritional conditions

during the year 1835, and with numerous measurements of this type for a variety of

years, one could connect child growth in those years with changing environmental

conditions. In this way one could assess the extent and rapidity with which slave owners

modified diet and/or work effort in light of changing prices of food inputs and of product

outputs.

       Unfortunately the manifests do not record genuine longitudinal data. But they do

report heights of children born in the same year and measured once at different ages, as

demonstrated by individuals 2 and 3 in Figure 2. One can estimate net nutritional

conditions in 1835 by subtracting the height of individual 2, measured at age 5 in 1835,

from that of individual 3, measured at age 6 in 1836. Because they were both born in the

same year, presumably they had similar nutritional experiences as a birth cohort (up to

age 5), at least as affected by exogenous phenomena of prices, weather and epidemics.




                                             7
       Of course, individuals 2 and 3 may differ in their genetic potential for growth;

conceivably the 3rd individual could have smaller in 1836 than the 2nd individual was in

1835, implying the impossible situation of negative growth. With large samples,

however, these genetic features tend to cancel such that the difference in the mean

heights accurately depicts average net nutritional conditions during the year.

       Two adjustments or modifications of the procedure are needed to address limits of

the manifest data. Despite the huge sample size overall, Table 3 shows that the number

of children measured was rather small, especially below age 10. Therefore the number of

measurements of children at adjacent ages in successive years is insufficient to obtain

even remotely precise estimates of growth velocities for a particular age, sex and year.

Aggregation by age and by sex overcomes this limitation, but to do this the results must

be made comparable by standardizing for average growth velocity at a particular age and

sex. Second, because the sample sizes vary considerably across ages (see Table 3), I then

weight the standardized velocities by the relative sample sizes used to calculate the

means. Equation (1) below defines the procedure:




                      I j , j +1 =
                                     k =2   i =16
                                                    (x   i +1, j +1, k   − x i , j ,k   ) (w ) (100)   (1)
                                                                                           i , j ,k
                                     k =1   i =3          x i +1,k       − x i ,k



where I j , j +1 is an index of growth velocity between years j and j+1, expressed as percent

of average (across all years) for the entire collection of manifests. The indexes j and k

are counters for age and sex, respectively, whereby velocities in a particular year are

estimated as the differences between mean heights from ages 3-4 to ages 16-17. The




                                                                     8
term wi , j ,k indicates the relative weight applied to the velocity at a particular age based

on the sample sizes used in the calculations.15 Thus, the weights for a particular year sum

to 1.0.

          Figure 3 shows the sample sizes used to calculate the index of growth velocity for

a particular year, i.e. nj + j+1, where nj refers to number of children of all ages and both

sexes measured in year j. The numbers are modest in the 1820s and in some years

thereafter, which raises a question for econometric methods. I deal with the varying

sample sizes by using weighted least squares.

          Two additional issues arise in the empirical work, one of which is chronological

imprecision. Owners shipped slaves throughout the year but they concentrated departures

in the 4 months from November to February. In principle one could utilize this

chronological information in calculating velocities, by tabulating differences in mean

heights by month of shipment, e.g. comparing average heights of slaves shipped in

February of one year with those shipped 12 months later. The sample sizes are so small

in a particular month, however, that this attempt at refinement is hardly worthwhile.

Moreover captains reported the ages only as of last birthday as opposed to year and

month, which would remain a factor limiting the accuracy of growth velocities in any

case. In sum, the chronological synchronization problem creates so much noise in the

yearly data that it is difficult to discern adjustments in plantation management within a

single year. Providing there is enough variation over a somewhat longer time interval, it

is still possible to examine sort-term modifications of decision-making. Therefore I

smooth the dependent variable by using a 3-year moving average of the index of growth

velocity, I j , j +1 .



                                               9
       Cropping patterns varied considerably between the upper and lower portions of

the South. Tobacco, cotton, rice and sugar were the major field crops linked to various

regions and across these areas slave owners responded to different price signals for

outputs. This suggests the analysis should be organized by region of origin. Table 3

shows that by far the largest portion of the sample originated with the cotton producing

areas, which stretched from North Carolina to Texas, with geographic interruptions for

rice and sugar cultivation in coastal areas of South Carolina and Georgia and in southern

Louisiana. Unfortunately little can be done to distinguish slave exports from rice versus

cotton plantations in South Carolina and Georgia, and therefore I use all such manifests

originating from these states. Rice was a small minority crop compared with cotton in

the southern states and as a practical matter the inclusion in the database of slaves

departing from rice plantations adds slightly to the noise in assessing the relationship

between cotton prices and planter behavior.16 Sugar was a growing industry throughout

the period, largely absorbing rather than exporting slaves and for this reason the

contamination from including Louisiana is probably small.17

       Figure 4 displays a 3 year moving average of the velocity index for slaves

exported from the cotton producing states along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Although

the index fluctuates a great deal, two larger cycles are apparent: decline during the 1820s

followed by recovery until the early-mid 1840s and then another decline followed by a

recovery that began in the mid 1850s. Any simple but powerful explanation of short-

term slave nutritional status would have to account for these two cycles. The data points

in the figure form the dependent variable for the empirical model discussed below.




                                             10
An Empirical Model

       Rees, Komlos, Long and Woitek formulate a dynamic optimization model of food

allocation over the slave life-cycle, in which owners maximize wealth in ways that

explain two observed features of slave heights.18 These features are the unusual age

profile of physical growth and an increase in male slave heights during the late

antebellum period.19 The central variable explained in their model is field productivity

(measured by stature), which they link to the prices of output (cotton), food, and slaves.

Owners select optimal diets in light of these prices and the contribution food makes to

human physical growth. Higher prices of cotton relative to food have an efficiency wage

effect, encouraging owners to improve diets and therefore net nutrition and physical

growth: slaves are better fed so they can work harder. Higher prices of slaves relative to

food creates an investment incentive, whereby owners improve diets in the short run in

anticipation of the greater value of future physical work capacity.

       Rees et al. report that both male slave prices and cotton prices rose relative to

food prices during the late antebellum period, which their mechanism translates into a

prediction of increasing food allotments and physical growth. If the process they

envision operated rapidly, then food allocations and therefore child growth would have

responded quickly to increases in the ratio of slave prices to food prices, and with

increases in the ratio of cotton prices to food prices. The authors do not model the speed

of this mechanism, but with the data at hand it is possible to test whether it was rapid. A

negative finding does not mean that the modeled mechanism did not exist, but only that it

may have been slow or small in the short term.




                                             11
       Figure 5 displays the price ratio of cotton (New York) to pork (Cincinnati, mess)

and the ratio of the price of prime age male slaves (New Orleans) to the price of pork.20

Rees et al use prices of a more general market basket of food products to calibrate their

model, but I feel that pork is the food item most relevant for an empirical test because it

was the most expensive item in the slave diet, providing protein essential for human

growth. Moreover, pork had high value in relation to weight and was therefore widely

traded, making its market price a good proxy of opportunity cost on the farm.

       Before considering empirical tests of the price-physical growth mechanism, it is

useful to consider two additional factors that may have affected health and physical

growth in the short term: weather and epidemics. In the past couple of decades climate

historians have made considerable progress measuring annual aspects of weather using

tree rings, which are sensitive to fluctuations in moisture. Climate historians have

assembled long, overlapping series of tree rings for roughly 150 localities of the United

States and they have distilled this information into something called the Palmer Drought

Severity Index (PDSI).21 They scale this index from -6 (very dry) to +6 (very wet)

relative to normal for a particular locality. Figure 6 shows results in a 3 year moving

average for 9 localities in the cotton states that exported most of the slaves used to

calculate the velocity index. While moisture fluctuated considerably, there was a clear

trend toward dryer conditions late in the antebellum period.

       Moisture might have been relevant for health and physical growth in two ways,

food production and exposure to disease. If it operated mainly through the former, one

would expect to find a substantial connection with food prices. The correlations in Table

4 show this is not the case. Scatter diagrams and regressions also establish there is no




                                             12
statistically significant connection between the Palmer Index and the prices of pork or

corn, at least within the range of weather conditions found across a swath of the South in

the antebellum period.

       Within the range of rainfall typically found in the cotton regions of the Southeast,

roughly 45 to 50 inches per year from modern data, relatively wet conditions would have

promoted the growth of parasites and insect vectors such as mosquitoes. In contrast,

somewhat dry (but not drought) conditions would have reduced parasites and insect

vectors but still provided adequate moisture for food production. If the antebellum record

included extremes of the index, one might expect a nonlinear relationship, with bad

health following from very wet conditions and also very dry conditions. Very wet

weather would have been particularly bad because it created parasites and insects while

reducing food production. Therefore it is important to consider the range of the index

and to explore possible nonlinearities in the relationship between the Palmer Index and

physical growth.

       Cholera and yellow fever caused well-known epidemics in the antebellum era.

According to Wilson Smille, cholera ravaged New Orleans in the early 1830s, was bad in

the mid 1850s, and also appeared in the mid 1830s and the early 1840s.22 Yellow fever

was epidemic in the early 1820s, the late 1840s and the mid 1850s. The extent to which

these epidemics penetrated into the rural interior of the South is unknown. One could

argue that slaves in the sample could have been vulnerable because they were shipped

from coastal ports and therefore may have been exposed, via regular trade contacts, to

diseases that were notorious in the coastal cities.




                                              13
       Figure 7 shows a 3 year moving average of the average of the crude death rates in

Baltimore and New Orleans, the high points of which indicate epidemic conditions in the

South.23 If conditions were bad it both cities, one might expect they were also bad along

the coast in between, and possibly in the rural areas from which slaves were shipped

Admittedly, these data are imperfect for study of the issues at hand, but it is clear the

death rates fluctuated enormously. The cholera epidemic of 1832 is particularly

pronounced. If under the worst conditions these diseases found their way into rural

interiors along the coasts, then child growth would also have been affected.



Results

       As indicated earlier, Rees et al. do not explain the speed of adjustment to

changing economic conditions, which is a question to be examined empirically. Keep in

mind that the dependent variable measures the standardized change in height from year y

to year y+1, and the three year moving average centered on year y to y+1 incorporates

change from year y-1 to year y+2.

       One could argue that the time frame of the epidemiological variables should

coincide with the dependent variable. An epidemic, for example, might register

immediately in slower growth. On the other hand it may have taken time for an

epidemic, observed in port cities, to penetrate the interior where most slaves lived.

Similarly, a change in weather might precede changes in physical growth if insect and

parasite vectors took time to accumulate (or disappear). Similar weather in successive

years could have compounded the relationship, whereby the population of insect and

parasite vectors and their infected (or uninfected) hosts was disproportionately magnified




                                             14
(or shrunk) by a sequence of wet (or dry) years. In the same vein, if there was inertia in

plantation management, physical growth would have lagged behind relative price

changes. It seems plausible that changes in food rations or work patterns, which were

guided by price signals but appeared capricious to slaves, imposed psychological costs

(i.e. labor unrest), and therefore owners would have changed routines only after a clear,

persistent signal that it was profitable to do so. Thus, it may have been unprofitable to

precisely synchronize the chronological relationship between relative prices and net

nutrition.

        Table 5 shows results from an exploration of the lag structure with all of the

explanatory variables, ranging from coincident to a 3 year lag. Equations 1 – 4 indicate

the best fit of simple regressions. Two results are anticipated: the large, systematic

effects of the slave/pork price and the Palmer Index. The corresponding beta

coefficients, which indicate the number of standard deviations of change in the dependent

variable for a one standard deviation change in the independent variable are 0.48 and

0.72. With a lag that is one year shorter, the coefficients are still statistically significant

but the t-values shrink to 2.37 and -3.05, respectively.

        Most surprising is the large, but unexpectedly negative and statistically significant

coefficient of the cotton/pork price. The coefficient is negative and statistically

significant even without a lag. The theory predicts a positive coefficient. What might

have happened? Conceivably planters adjusted in ways unanticipated by the theory,

perhaps planting more cotton at higher relative prices (imposing more work or a different

kind of work that required additional energy), without changing rations (because it was




                                               15
costly in terms of labor unrest). Thus slaves could have been less sensitive to changes in

work routines than to changes in diet.

       Equation 5 suggests a more plausible interpretation, which hinges on

multicollinearity. The coefficient on cotton/pork is no longer significant in the presence

of slave/pork and the Palmer Index variables. Although Table 4 shows that the

correlation between the Palmer Index and the prices of cotton and pork was very low, by

chance the correlation was much higher with cotton/pork price ratio, amounting to 0.72.

I cannot think of a plausible mechanism by which the Palmer Index should have been

highly correlated with the price ratio, and indeed by adding a few more years of evidence

at the beginning of the period, the correlation drops dramatically to 0.06. Thus, the high

correlation and consequent multicollinearity for the sample period is just bad luck. The

cotton/pork coefficient has the wrong sign and by accident the variable represents or

mimics the Palmer Index.

       Multicollinearity may explain the statistical phenomena but the theoretical

question remains: why didn’t the cotton/pork price translate into net nutritional action by

planters? Perhaps the effect existed but was simply small or swamped by other factors,

and thus is not readily visible with the measures at hand. Notably the real price of slaves

rose while the real price of cotton fell during the antebellum period. The real price of

pork also rose, but the real price of slaves rose faster. Quite possibly the slave/pork price

was a better indicator of profitability of net nutritional action than the cotton/pork price

because the numerator of the latter was affected by technological change, westward

movement to better land and the growth of large, more efficient plantations. In addition,

the time horizon of the two variables is quite different, with the cotton price reflecting




                                              16
very short-term conditions whereas the slave price captured long run expectations of

profitability. Thus, slave owners reacted to price information in deciding net nutrition

but they focused through long-run lenses.

        The average of the crude death rates in New Orleans and Baltimore had no

systematic effect on the velocity index, regardless of the lag structure. This does not

imply that epidemics were irrelevant for physical growth. Instead rural slaves were likely

insulated from disease currents that dramatically appeared in the cities and along major

travel routes. The health benefits of isolation are well documented for the era prior to the

public health revolution of the late nineteenth century. In particular, average heights in

different countries and across regions within countries are typically higher for remote,

agricultural areas.24

        In sum, equation 6 of Table 5 provides the most parsimonious model for

explaining the short-term health of American slaves. The cotton/pork price and the crude

death rate in cities were irrelevant for short-term health on southern farms, but in acting

to manage the short-term health of their chattel, owners were subject to changes in the

disease environment created by the weather. The latter was slightly more important in

explaining variation in the antebellum period, based on relative sizes of the beta

coefficients.

        Is it possible to determine the amounts of diet and work that planters manipulated

in modifying net nutrition? Were work routines relatively fixed and diets adjusted? Or

were diets reasonably static but work routines varied? We lack detailed annual measures

of diet and of work effort, and indeed the nature of these has been one of the ongoing

controversies in the study of slavery. Thus, brute force methods are unavailable. But it is




                                             17
possible to divide the sample into two parts: younger (non-working) children and older

children who worked. Presumably if control was achieved through diet alone, then the

growth of young children would have responded to price signals. If through work alone,

then the growth of older but not younger children would have responded to price signals.

Of course, this is a weak test and it may well have been the case that owners manipulated

both to their advantage. In any event and unfortunately, the annual samples of young

children (ages 3 – 9 years) are too small for effective study given the noisy nature of the

velocity index.25 With the sample weights ( wi , j ,k ) of equation (1), the results in Table 5

are therefore by dominated by the experiences of working children (ages 10 and above),

and with the data at hand it does not appear possible to form an empirically-based

opinion on this issue.26



Conclusions

        Since the mid 1970s economic historians have built upon the strengths and

struggled with the weaknesses of adult heights. Powerful in summarizing many

important factors relevant for the quality of life, these numerous variables unfold over

many years, making it difficult to investigate short-term influences on the final result.

Thus, adult heights are quite valuable as a measure of human welfare but it has been

challenging to identify and measure the causes of changes or differences. Synthetic

longitudinal data are a substantial step forward but remain an incomplete remedy.

Researchers would still like to assess influences on the components of net nutrition

within a year, or other short span of time.

       Exposure to disease is one of the components of net nutrition typically found hard

to measure, even in modern studies. This paper proposes the weather, as measured by the

Palmer Drought Index, and the crude death rate, which reflects epidemics. Uncorrelated

with agricultural prices, the Palmer Index most likely captures the density of insects and

parasites that spread diseases. Researchers should be cautious in expecting the empirical

success of this variable, and the failure of the crude death rate, to automatically translate

into studies involving other regions or time periods. Effects of moisture on health may

well depend on other features of climate. Of course, epidemics are relevant for health

and human growth, but results of this paper suggest it may be difficult to interpret their

geographic reach across rural societies.

       All historians recognize the hard edges of slavery: the denial of freedom and

genuine social mobility, the considerable possibilities for violence and brutality, and the

psychological costs of the slave trade. Some influential historians, such as U.B. Phillips,

have softened these edges with paternalism, or the notion that while life was generally

hard in the early nineteenth century, owners had genuine feelings and emotional bonds

with their chattel, and by implication planters were willing to sacrifice some profits for

their happiness.27 The height data tell a different story. Not only was the slave

population deliberately made “peculiar” in its pattern of physical growth, owners were

reasonably quick to manipulate net nutrition in light of changing economic

circumstances. While there were traditional elements in diets and work, at the margins

planters abandoned custom, and if physical growth and child health improved in the late

antebellum period, it was because dryer weather reduced exposure to disease and owners

expected a future economic pay back.

small number of North Carolina exports might not indicate a deficiency in the records.

     Arguably the weights should be inversely proportional to the standard errors of the estimated velocities,
which depend on the variances of the heights at adjacent ages and the sample sizes used to estimate the
means. Because the variances of the heights are roughly equal, by far the largest variation in the standard
errors arises from the varying sample sizes across ages. On this basis I calculated the weights as follows:
                                                                   ( n i +1, j +1,k + n i , j ,k )        1             1
                                              1 .0   sqrt                                          (               +            )
                                                                ( n i +1, j +1,k + n i , j ,k − 2 ) n i +1, j +1,k   n i , j ,k
                          w i , j ,k =
                                         i = 16                        ( n i +1, j +1,k + n i , j ,k )        1              1
                                                  1 .0   sqrt                                          (                +            )
                                         i=3                        ( n i +1, j +1,k + n i , j ,k − 2 ) n i +1, j + 1,k   n i , j ,k

where n refers to sample size and the index counters i, j, and k refer to age, year and sex, respectively. The
first term within the square root increases the penalty (decreases the weight) for very small samples.

     The slow growth of both rice exports and the black population suggest that region may have shed some
slaves in the late antebellum period. See Peter A. Coclanis, The Shadow of a Dream: Economic Life and
Death in the South Carolina Low Country, 1670-1920 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991).

     Other approaches may be fruitful, such as models that explain heights of children as a function of the
annual values of the independent variables from birth to the age of measurement.
