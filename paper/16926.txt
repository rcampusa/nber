                                             ABSTRACT

Roughly one half of hospitals in the U.S. are in rural areas, yet researchers have largely studied the
effects of hospital ownership in the urban context. We examine differences in the provision of profitable
and unprofitable medical services in rural areas across nonprofit, for-profit, and government hospitals.
We also consider the effect of hospital ownership mix within rural hospital markets. We find that
rural nonprofit hospitals are more likely than for-profit hospitals to offer unprofitable services, many
of which are underprovided services. Nonprofits respond less than for-profits to changes in service
profitability. Nonprofits with more for-profit competitors offer more profitable services and fewer
unprofitable services than those with fewer for-profit competitors.

       The mix of ownership types among hospitals in the United States is shifting as hospital

conversions from nonprofit to for-profit ownership are on the rise again (Gold 2010). Since the

last spate of conversions in the early 1990s, we have learned a great deal about the effects of

hospital ownership in urban settings. However, despite claims that hospitals are the heart of rural

health systems (Holmes et al. 2006) and for-profit ownership may harm rural health services

(Moscovice and Stensland 2002), researchers have largely studied ownership in the urban

context.

       The marked divergence between rural and urban health care makes it inappropriate to

apply findings from one context to the other, and highlights the need for research into the

particular effects of ownership on rural hospitals. Differences in urban and rural health care can

be seen in insurance status (Lenardson 2009), provider demographics (Reschovsky and Staiti

2005), case mix and government payment structures (Moscovice and Stensland 2002), and the

relatively high government hospital market penetration in rural markets (Exhibit 1). For these

reasons, as well as the fact that roughly half of all U.S. hospitals are located outside of

metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), we examine the direct and spillover effects of hospital

ownership on the availability of medical services in rural areas.

       First, we provide new descriptive information on for-profit and nonprofit market share in

rural markets. We also identify systematic differences in the characteristics of geographic areas

in which for-profits and nonprofits locate, patterns that are particularly important to consider

when analyzing the effects of rural hospital ownership on hospital behavior. Previous studies

concluding that rural for-profit hospitals have better controlled labor and other operating costs

(McCue 2007) or are otherwise more efficient (Ferrier and Valdmanis 1996) than either

nonprofit or government hospitals acknowledge the importance of location. But these studies



                                                  2
address neither the variation in population density within non-urban areas nor related selection

effects. Second, using regression analysis, we identify two distinct types of ownership effects: 1)

the direct effects of a rural hospital’s own ownership on medical service offerings, and 2) the

spillover effects of the market mix of hospital types on a hospital’s service offering.

         Our strongest findings suggest that nonprofit hospitals are more likely than rural for-

profit hospitals to offer unprofitable services, many of which are in short supply in rural areas.

Nonprofits are also less responsive than for-profits to changes in medical service profitability.

Moreover, nonprofit hospitals located in areas with more for-profit competitors act more like for-

profit hospitals in terms of service offerings than do nonprofits located in areas with fewer for-

profit competitors. It is unclear, however, whether these similarities are because nonprofits must

make up for lost revenue due to cream-skimming by for-profit hospitals or because the

characteristics of those markets favor that type of behavior. Given both the recent increase in

hospital conversions and debate at all levels of government regarding whether nonprofit hospitals

merit their tax-exemptions, these results are both timely and important for understanding the

potential effects of nonprofit and tax policy for health policy.



DATA

Hospital data are from the American Hospital Association’s (AHA) Annual Surveys of

Hospitals.1 We construct control variables for market demographics using tract-level data from


1
  The AHA data have several limitations. First, they are self-reported and the survey format changed slightly over
the years. From 1988-1993, it asked hospitals whether each service was offered at the hospital, another hospital, or
not at all. Later surveys asked hospitals to answer four separate questions regarding whether the service was
available at the hospital or at various affiliated entities. For all years, we converted the answers into a dichotomous
variable representing whether the hospital itself offered the service. To ensure consistent coding, we compared the
responses in 1993, when the surveys included both question types. Second, the data have missing values,
particularly in the later years, with no obvious difference between nonprofit and for-profit respondents. We imputed
about one percent of the observations for each service using data from the surrounding years. Third, in
approximately 83 hospitals, the self-reported variable for whether a hospital is a general or specialty hospital was


                                                           3
the U.S. Census (1990 & 2000). Hospital reimbursement status variables are from the CMS

Healthcare Cost Report Information System (HCRIS) and the Prospective Payment System

Minimum Data File. HMO data (1990- 2001) are from the National Directory of HMOs and

Interstudy (see Baker 1997 for details). We construct the hospital system membership variable

from 1) the AHA, and 2) databases by Madison (2004) and Dafny and Dranove (2006). Finally,

we rely on a hospital address and coordinate database we constructed from the AHA, geocoding

software, and extensive primary research.

Hospital Population, Key Study Variables, and Market Definitions. We include all non-federal,

general medical and surgical hospitals in the continental U.S. in the study. We define rural

hospitals as all those that fall outside of MSAs, a characterization typical of rural hospital

research. As discussed below, we also include a control variable to account for varying degrees

of rural status based on population density.

        Our dependent variable is an indicator variable for whether a hospital offers a medical

service. We examine all acute and post-acute medical service reported in the AHA, which

includes approximately 80 service questions; we exclude questions about facilities, non-medical

services, and duplicate questions (see Appendix 1 for a full list of services). We also exclude

services that fewer than 3 percent of rural hospitals offer over the whole study period (including

profitable services, e.g., open heart surgery, and unprofitable services, e.g., burn units) as well as

services for which a majority of years are missing. This leaves 37 medical services.

        Drawing on extensive prior research, we categorize the medical services as relatively

high, relatively low, or variably profitable over the study period (Horwitz 2005a; Horwitz

2005b). We do not know the accuracy of these designations for each individual hospital or

inconsistent across years. We recoded 183 cases (about 0.5 percent of our estimation sample) using the modal
response during all sample years.



                                                        4
market, however they are consistent with expert views, scholarship, and federal and state policy.

Two advantages of the approach are 1) the designations rely in part on market perceptions rather

than whether the services proved to be profitable ex post, thereby reflecting decisions to invest in

service lines and, 2) our results do not rely on the designation of any single service but on

comparisons among all major medical services.

         The key explanatory variable for estimating the effects of hospital ownership on a

hospital’s own output is a dummy variable for nonprofit, for-profit, or government ownership.

The key explanatory variable in estimating spillover effects is the interaction between ownership

and for-profit market share. Using each hospital’s longitude and latitude, we define a hospital’s

market based on the distance to each potential competitor. We report results using a “distance-

weighted” market measure, one that identifies the percent of all other potentially competing

hospitals (i.e., all hospitals in the nation weighted by their distance, more or less as “the crow

flies,” from the observation hospital) that are for-profit.2 Elsewhere we have shown this

procedure produces results equivalent to less precise approaches to defining markets such as

radii around a hospital’s zip code or MSA (Horwitz and Nichols 2007).

         Because a large proportion of hospitals are not located near a for-profit, we define “for-

profit markets” as those where at least 5 percent of hospitals face for-profit competition.3 Thirty-




2
  For each hospital in our sample in each year, we assign a weight to each other hospital in the nation (including both
urban and rural hospitals), weighting by its admissions divided by the square of one plus a constant * the distance
squared. This method places more reasonable relative weights on points of different distances from the hospital than
does the reciprocal of squared distance, and does not create a discontinuous drop in weight on neighbors from one to
zero that using geopolitical or other boundaries would. We fix the constant used in the weighting such that the
method yields similar results to those of actual patient markets. In addition, we used a geodesic distance
calculated using an accurate ellipsoidal model of the earth's surface. For more detail, see Horwitz and Nichols 2009,
Horwitz and Nichols 2007.
3
  In sensitivity testing, we confirmed that the results are not sensitive to the precise definition of a for-profit market.
For example, the results do not change appreciably if we define a for-profit market as one in which 10 percent of a
hospital’s competitors (weighted by distance and admissions) are for-profit.

percent of government and 26 percent of nonprofits are located in a for-profit market.



STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

The Direct Effects of Ownership on Rural Hospitals

Service Level Specification. In our main specification, we include all medical services provided

at all hospitals in the sample in a single regression where each observation is a medical service-

hospital-year combination. For reasons discussed in detail below, all of our main specifications

are cross-sectional; in sensitivity testing, also described below, we use fixed-effects models. We

regress service provision on hospital, market and service characteristics as follows:

(1)    E(ServiceProvided)ijt = βo + β1Fit + β2Yt + β3Hit + β4Djt + β5Rjt + β6Pjt + β7Fit*Pjt

where j indexes medical services, i indexes hospitals, and t indexes year. The matrix F contains a

set of indicator variables for nonprofit, for-profit, or government ownership. The matrix Y

contains a set of dummy variables for years. Control variables in Hit include hospital

characteristics and other variables described below. D includes demographic characteristics of

the hospital’s potential patient population, as described below.

       Pjt is an indicator of service profitability (0 for unprofitable, 1 for profitable each year).

The key variable is Fit*Pjt (coefficient β7), the interaction between ownership and service

profitability, which suggests the probability of a hospital of a given type to offer relatively

profitable and unprofitable services. In this model, we include all 31 services classified as either

profitable or unprofitable, excluding the six services of indeterminate profitability. We code

services with variable profitability as either profitable or unprofitable depending on the year.




                                                  6
       To control for potential confounding factors, we include a set of hospital, market, and

payment characteristics. Hospital characteristics, H, include: 1) hospital size (measured by

quintiles of hospital admissions, which is a better measure of size than the number of beds in a

hospital because beds may or may not be filled and may or may not be licensed), 2) teaching

status (measured by membership in residency training organizations), and 3) hospital system

membership.

       We also include the market penetration of HMOs, as a proxy for competitive pressure.

We include two variables to control for market concentration, Herfindahl-Hirschman Index

(HHI) (sum of squares of each hospital’s annual share of total admissions within each state

among rural hospitals only), and whether the state has 2, 3, 4, or 5 or more rural hospitals.

       We include D, a vector of demographic variables, measuring the characteristics of a

hospital’s potential patients, including population measures of size, age, education, race, sex,

marital status by sex, employed persons by industry (as a proxy for insurance status), household

income, income per capita, and travel time to work (as a proxy for willingness to drive to the

hospital). Because these data were from the decennial censuses, we linearly interpolate and

extrapolate the natural log of each control variable. We compile these data from the 1990 and

2000 Censuses by averaging across all tracts in the states and DC, using weights that vary

inversely with the distance squared from hospital i to the centroid of each census tract.

       R includes two sets of variables that address the unique nature of rural hospital markets

and payments. First, we include a dummy variable for each quartile of 1989 population density

in the vicinity of a hospital, weighted as with other Census-based controls so a nearer tract’s

population density contributes more than more distant tracts. These variables proxy for the




                                                 7
degree of ruralness in the market and reflect the fact that there is a spectrum of market types

between rural and urban designations.

         Second, R includes dummy variables for federal designation as a Critical Access Hospital

(CAH), a CMS program that reimburses hospitals through a cost-based rather than prospective-

payment system.4 Including the CAH variable is important because participating hospitals tend

to have considerably higher revenues, expenses, and profit margins, particularly associated with

outpatient care, than non-participating hospitals.5 Moreover, although some CAHs are for-profit -

- none in early years, 41 for-profit hospitals in 2005, and 2% of our sample overall -- CAHs are

typically nonprofit (Pink et al. 2006) or government hospitals. Eight percent of the nonprofit and

9 percent of the government hospitals in our sample were CAHs.

         To further account for potential differences in reimbursement status, we include indicator

variables to sole community hospitals (SCH) or Medicare dependent hospitals (MDH)

designation.6 Since PPACA extends some of these rural payment programs, they will likely

continue to affect rural medical service provision. (PPACA Part II 2010)

         Because the probability of a hospital offering a service is not independent from one year

to the next, we correct standard errors by clustering at the hospital level, a conservative choice,

so they are robust to arbitrary serial correlation (Arellano 1987; Kézdi 2004; Stock and Watson

2006). These cluster-robust standard errors are also robust to heteroskedasticity in errors.




4
  To participate, hospitals must meet several criteria such as location in a rural location at a specified distance from
the nearest hospital, operating no more than 25 beds, maintaining a low average length of stay (no more than 96
hours), or designation as a “necessary provider” under a state waiver administered by the CMS program (CMS
2009). As of June 2010, there were 1,315 critical access hospitals (Flex Monitoring Team).
5
  However, participation does not seem to change either the mix of inpatient and outpatient services or the balance
between medical and surgical services within hospitals (Li et al. 2009; Schoenman and Sutton 2008).
6
  We determined whether a hospital had CAH, SCH, or MDH status from the Medicare cost reports, which indicates
the beginning and end dates of payment status. When a hospital had a CAH, SCH, or MDH payment status for more
than half the year, we coded the dummy variable as a one for that hospital-year observation.


                                                           8
Individual Service, Hospital Level Specification. We also estimated a separate probit for each of

the medical services in our study. We estimated a hospital-level specification to ask whether

hospital types (nonprofit, for-profit, government) offer different types of medical services as

follows:

(2)    E(ServiceProvided)it = F(βo + β1Fit + β2Yt + β3Yt*Fit + β4Hit + β5Dit + β6Rit)

where i indexes hospitals and t indexes year and F() is the probit function. All other variables are

as described above.

       After estimating the effect of ownership using equation 2, we predict the probabilities

reported in the Appendix by varying only the corporate form and market type of each hospital

observed in the middle year of 1996 while holding the independent variables constant (at 1996

levels). We then average the individual predicted probabilities to obtain the probability that a

hospital type offers a service each year. Conducting the empirical tests in this manner allows us

to hold constant non-ownership hospital characteristics, thus yielding more accurate predictions

of how hospitals would behave if they changed form and no other attributes.



The Spillover Effects of Ownership on Rural Hospitals

Service Level Specification. We then estimate a spillover-based specification in which we

whether hospital types offer different types of services in different market types measured by for-

profit penetration, modeling the effect of ownership mix on service provision by hospital type as

follows:

(3)    E(ServiceProvided)ijt = βo + β1Fit + β2Yt + β3Hit + β4Djt + β5Rjt +β7 Fit*FPMarketit + β8Pjt

+ β9Fit*Pjt + β10Pijt*Fit*FPMarketit




                                                 9
where all the variables are the same as in equation 1 above, with the addition of variables to

account for ownership spillover effects. We include FPMarket, an indicator variable for high for-

profit markets, interacted with the hospital’s own ownership type (matrix F). The key additional

variable, Pijt*Fit*FPMarketit (coefficient β10), measures the differential impact of profitability for

a hospital of a given type between low and high for-profit markets. As in the previous model, we

correct standard errors by clustering at the hospital level.

Single Service, Hospital Level Specification. Finally, we estimate a market level model to the

probability of a hospital offering each individual service, analogous to the hospital level

specification in equation 2 above:

(4)    E(ServiceProvided)it = βo + β1Fit + β2Yt + β3Yt*Fit + β4Hit + β5Dit + β6Rit + β7FPMarketit +

β8 Fit*FPMarketit + β9Yt*Fit*FPMarketit

       As with the results from equation 2, we use the estimates to predict the effects of

ownership and market mix on service provision by varying only the corporate form and market

type of each hospital observed in the middle year of 1996 while holding the independent

variables constant (at 1996 levels). We then average the individual predicted probabilities to

obtain the probability that a hospital type offers a service each year.



RESULTS

Descriptive Results

Like their urban counterparts, most rural hospitals are nonprofit. The distribution of ownership

types, however, differs considerably. Rural hospitals are less likely than non-rural hospitals to be

either nonprofit or for-profit corporations (See Exhibit 1). From 1988 to 2005, rural hospitals

were 50.06 percent nonprofit, 41.34 percent government, and only 8.60 percent for-profit owned.



                                                  10
Weighting by hospital admissions to account for hospital size, rural hospitals were 61.03 percent

nonprofit, 28.49 percent government, and 10.48 percent for-profit owned. As this distribution

implies, nonprofit and for-profit hospitals tend to be larger than government hospitals.

       Not surprisingly, rural hospitals are farther from their nearest potential competitor (the

nearest hospital) than are urban hospitals. Rural for-profits are closer to their nearest competitors

than are either government or nonprofit hospitals, although these differences are not large. Half

of for-profits face a nearest competitor 12 miles away or less, whereas half of nonprofits have

their nearest competitor 15 miles away or less. Further, rural are more likely than non-rural for-

profits to operate near another for-profit; rural are less likely than urban nonprofits to have a for-

profit nearest neighbor. These geographic differences suggest different competitive strategies in

rural and urban settings.



Direct Effects of Ownership Type. For-profit hospitals offer fewer services than do nonprofit

hospitals in rural markets, even controlling for hospital size and the other factors listed above,

but the difference is much more pronounced for unprofitable services. This can be seen in

Exhibit 2a, where a negative coefficient on for-profit hospital (FP Hospital) indicates lower

probability of offering an unprofitable service than reference group nonprofit hospitals, and the

coefficient on the interaction with profitable service is not large enough to offset that negative

coefficient.

       Nonprofit hospitals are less likely than for-profit hospitals and more likely than

government hospitals to offer profitable services. This can also be seen in Exhibits 2a&b where

coefficients on the interactions between the dummy variable of service profitability (ProfServ)

with ownership types are all negative for the interactions with government hospital ownership




                                                  11
and positive for the interactions with for-profit ownership type. We present estimates from linear

regressions to facilitate comparisons to the fixed effect results with minimal distributional

assumptions; generalized linear models tailored to binary outcomes produce similar marginal

effects estimates.

         To help illustrate our results, we present two examples from the specifications in which

we tested the relationship between ownership and service provision by each individual service

(Equation 2). Although the results for many of the services are similar, particularly for

unprofitable services, there is some variation in the results by service. For a full list of the results

by service see the Appendix.

         For-profit are less likely than nonprofit and government hospitals to offer psychiatric

emergency care, a service that was unprofitable relative to other services throughout the study

period. On average from 1988 to 2005 in rural areas, for-profit hospitals were almost 9

percentage points less likely than nonprofit hospitals (12.78 percent versus 21.62 percent,

p<0.01) to offer psychiatric emergency services7 (See Appendix). Nonprofit hospitals were not

significantly more likely than government hospitals (21.78 percent versus 18.36 percent, p>0.10)

to offer psychiatric emergency services (See Appendix). It is easiest to see this graphically in

Exhibit 3.

         A second example is also instructive. The profitability of home health care varied

dramatically over the study period. During the time that home health was a profitable service

(1988 to 1997), the likelihood a for-profit hospital offered home health rose more than threefold

(the chance was 3.3 times as high, rising from under 20 percent to over 66 percent), while it


7
  By varying only the corporate ownership and market type of each hospital, while holding the other variables
constant (at 1994 levels), we predict the probabilities that each hospital in each year
would offer a given service. Then we average the individual predicted probabilities to obtain the probability that a
hospital type offers a service each year. Statistical significance is assessed by tests on probit coefficients.


                                                          12
nearly doubled at nonprofit hospitals (increasing from 35 to 65 percent; this difference in growth

is statistically significant, p< .01), and more than doubled at government hospitals (increasing

from 27 to 63 percent; p<.01). As profitability decreased (from 1997 to 2005), the probability of

offering home health care halved among for-profits (67 percent to 33 percent), but declined

modestly at nonprofit (falling from 65 to 58 percent; p <.01), and government hospitals (falling

from 63 to 59 percent; p<.01).

Ownership Mix and Spillover Effects. We also identify the indirect effects of hospital ownership

on medical service offerings by examining the relationship between the mix of ownership types

in rural markets and service offerings. Without any fixed effects, we find that nonprofit hospitals

in markets with higher for-profit market penetration are less likely to offer unprofitable services

than nonprofits in markets with lower for-profit penetration (Exhibit 2b, Columns (1) and (2),

coefficient on HiFP Mkt*NFP Hosp* Unprof Serv).

       Without any fixed effects, we find that nonprofit hospitals in markets with higher for-

profit penetration are also less likely to offer profitable services than nonprofits in markets with

lower for-profit penetration (Exhibit 2b, Columns (1) and (2), coefficient on HiFP Mkt*NFP

Hosp* Prof Serv). However, these results are not robust. Indeed, in the fixed effects tests

(columns 3-5) the sign flips. This could be because markets in which ownership is in flux are

different from more stable markets, or it could more accurately reflect the causal effect if the

identification is superior using fixed effects to sweep out time-invariant differences across

hospitals and/or services. Nonprofits consistently, in markets with either high or low for-profit

penetration, do not contribute to the fixed effects estimates, so if the former are less likely to

offer profitable services and the latter more likely due to historical factors and the differential

service provision has actually induced the difference in for-profit penetration, the regressions




                                                  13
without fixed effects could incorrectly attribute this cross-sectional difference to and effect of the

market penetration rather the reverse.

       The estimates from the individual service regressions were mixed. Although we find no

clear pattern in the propensity to offer profitable services across market types, nonprofits with

relatively few for-profit competitors were more likely to offer many unprofitable services such as

psychiatric, hospice, substance abuse, and social work services (Appendix, Columns 6&7). In

addition, nonprofits in markets with more for-profit competition were more profit-seeking in

their provision of services where profits varied over time.

       As with the direct effects results, it is easiest to understand the results by looking at

representative services. On average over the study period, nonprofits in high for-profit markets

were predicted to be 7.77 percentage points less likely to offer psychiatric emergency care than

those in low for-profit markets (15.50 versus 23.10 percent, p<.01).

       In addition, nonprofits in for-profit markets were more responsive to financial incentives

than other nonprofits. Nonprofits were more likely to offer home health services over time in

both high and low for-profit markets during the profitable period of 1988-1997), but rose more

dramatically in high for-profit markets (43.5 to 68.4 percent compared to 34.8 to 63.4 percent,

Appendix 1c). As profit-making fell after 1997, nonprofits were less likely to offer home health

in both types of markets, but the fall was more dramatic in high-for-profit markets (falling from

68.4 to 60.0 percent instead of 63.4 to 56.7 percent). Nonprofits were more likely to offer home

health in high than low for-profit markets during the profitable period (1988-1997) and less

likely to offer it in high than low for-profit markets during the unprofitable period (post-1997)

(Exhibit 4, panel 4), though the difference between high and low for-profit markets in the




                                                  14
nonprofit likelihood of offering home health during 1993 to 1997 is only marginally significant

(p=.0586).



Fixed Effects Models and Other Robustness Checks

The biggest challenge to studying hospital ownership is potential endogeneity of hospital

location. We cannot rule out the possibility that an unobserved market trait -- one which attracts

for-profit hospitals and causes them to specialize in profitable services -- explains our results.

However, there are several reasons to suggest we have identified the effects of ownership. It is

likely that the detailed demographic control variables used in our estimations are correlated with

unobserved market demand characteristics. Moreover, although hospitals do open, close, and

convert among ownership forms, market share changes little over time (Santerre and Vernon

2005) and is related primarily to historical and social characteristics (Grabowski and Hirth 2002;

for more detail see Horwitz and Nichols 2007, 2009).

       Nonetheless, we conducted additional analyses to test the robustness of our results. First,

we redefined market type (high v. low for-profit market) based on the for-profit market

penetration of the first year a hospital is observed in our data (typically 1988). The unreported

results differ only modestly, suggesting that they do not reflect selective for-profit entry in

markets with relatively high demand for profitable services.

       Second, we implement specifications using hospital and hospital-service fixed-effects. In

all fixed effects specifications we exclude the demographic and rural payment and population

control variables since these variables are unlikely to change much over the sample period and,

therefore, including them would likely only contribute noise to the estimates. Excluding the




                                                  15
variables do not materially change the results in the cross-sectional specifications (compare

columns (1) and (2) in Tables 2a and 2b).

       In the fixed effects regressions much of the identification comes from changes in for-

profit market share, although service profitability and ownership also change over time.

Although fixed effects models may address locational endogeneity, it can be difficult to

generalize from their results because markets and hospitals that change ownership form,

particularly from nonprofit to for-profit ownership, are likely different from other hospitals and

markets.

       Nonetheless, the fixed effects estimates results support our findings. For example, for-

profit hospitals are less likely to offer unprofitable services (Exhibit 2b, Column 2, Row 2) and

more likely to offer profitable services (Exhibit 2b, Column 2, Row 3) than nonprofits in a low-

for-profit-penetration market. Similarly, the hospital-service level fixed effects, which identify

the effects off of services that change profitability in hospitals that change form, also support the

results. Again, nonprofits are more likely than for-profits to offer these services when profitable,

and less likely than for-profits to offer them when unprofitable (Exhibit 2b, Columns 3 & 4, Row

2), and more likely to offer profitable services (Exhibit 2b, Columns 3 & 4, Row 3) than

nonprofits in a low-for-profit-penetration

       Finally, some of our findings regarding the spillover effects of ownership are also

supported by the fixed effects results. Nonprofit hospitals are more likely to offer profitable

services in high for-profit penetration markets (Exhibit 2b, Columns 2 & 3, Row 10) and less

likely to offer unprofitable services in high for-profit penetration markets (Row 11). Government

hospitals also appear more likely to offer profitable services and less likely to offer unprofitable




                                                 16
services in markets with high for-profit penetration (Rows 6 and 7), though the apparent effects

are not always statistically significant.



DISCUSSION

Despite the importance of identifying the relationship between ownership and medical services,

ownership has not previously been studied among rural hospitals. Patient treatment is

constrained by the range of services a hospital chooses to offer. Knowing whether and how

ownership determines the availability of services, therefore, contributes to an understanding of

access to medical care. Moreover, hospital administrators may more readily control service

offerings than ownership status or market environment than through more direct means of

selecting patients (e.g. turning away the uninsured) or regulating physician behavior.

        Our approach demonstrates that ownership affects service delivery, a finding that is often

obscured by the research design typically used in ownership studies. For example, a study may

conclude that patient mortality is the same at for-profit and nonprofit hospitals – even controlling

for factors such as billing practices, capacity, staff, the patient pool, market characteristics, and

service offerings. Such a study, however, would not allow one to conclude that ownership does

not matter because it would mask the fact that nonprofits and for-profits offer different services,

and these differences might matter a great deal for quality and access.

        Further, even if the hospital types did not differ in service offerings – although we find

that they do a great deal – the presence of nonprofits or for-profits in a market could, as we find,

affect the distribution of services offered in a market. Therefore, the mix of ownership types

could have important consequences for the well-being of patients, government finances, returns

on investment, and the economic efficiency of the market. Understanding the size of these



                                                  17
potential effects is a necessary prerequisite to evaluating the potential benefits of different

market structures for hospital care.

        Nonprofit regulations, particularly those focused on tax-exemption, have been focused

elsewhere. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) includes new requirements

for nonprofit hospitals to maintain their federal tax exempt status such as conducting community

health needs assessment every three years and implementing programs to address these needs

(ACA 2010). In addition, PPACA requires nonprofit hospitals to develop financial assistance

policies, refrain from engaging in extraordinary collection activities, and limit billing before

determining patients’ eligibility for financial assistance. Whether these new rules will limit

charges in practice is uncertain as PPACA includes a substantial modification to the original

language in the Act: whereas section 9007 forbids nonprofit hospitals from charging individuals

eligible for financial assistance who receive emergency or medically necessary care an amount

“more than the lowest amounts charged to individuals who have insurance coverage,” Section

10904 of the Act modifies this restriction by allowing hospitals to charge no more than “the

amounts generally billed.” Moreover, investigations have largely centered on the differences

between nonprofit and for-profit hospitals, particularly in the financial treatment of indigent

patients.

        Differences in the amount of charity care provision are not the most significant

differences in nonprofit and for-profit hospital behavior. Nonprofits may disproportionately

provide other beneficial but low-profit, undersupplied medical services, particularly in rural

areas that are already poorly served. The provision of these and other services depend upon the

reactions of competitors in mixed-ownership markets which, unfortunately, are not well-




                                                  18
understood. Indeed, it may be that a nonprofit’s biggest contribution is not that it offers

underprovided services but that its presence influences the behavior of its for-profit competitors.

(1). The results in column (2) and the fixed-effects specifications reported in columns (3)-(5) correspond to equation
(1), with the exception that they do not include demographic or rural control variables as they would contribute noise
to the estimation and increase measurement error bias, given the fixed effects structure; column (2), which reports the
cross-sectional results with the same limited control variables as columns (3)-(5) is offered for comparison to column
(1). All specifications are estimated as linear regressions. t statistics in parentheses.
