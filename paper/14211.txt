                                             ABSTRACT

Sizeable achievement differences by race appear in early grades, but substantial uncertainty exists
about the impact of school quality on the black-white achievement gap and particularly about its evolution
across different parts of the achievement distribution. Texas administrative data show that the overall
growth in the achievement gap between third and eighth grade is higher for students with higher initial
achievement and that specific teacher and peer characteristics including teacher experience and peer
racial composition explain a substantial share of the widening. The adverse effect of attending school
with a high black enrollment share appears to be an important contributor to the larger growth in the
achievement differential in the upper part of the test score distribution. This evidence reaffirms the
major role played by peers and school quality, but also presents a policy dilemma. Teacher labor market
complications, current housing patterns, legal limits in segregation efforts, and uncertainty about the
overall effects of specific desegregation programs indicate that effective policy responses will almost
certainly involve a set of school improvements beyond simple changes in peer racial composition and
the teacher experience distribution.

                   Achievement Gap
                            By Eric A. Hanushek and Steven G. Rivkin


        Perhaps no other social policy issue has been as important or as stubborn to deal with as

racial gaps in economic outcomes. Black-white differences in academic attainment, occupation,

and earnings, while showing some improvement over the past quarter century, have remained large.

Much of the policy effort aimed at reducing these gaps focuses on public elementary and secondary

schools. This emphasis hinges upon the widespread beliefs that school and peer characteristics

disadvantage blacks relative to whites and that appropriate interventions can raise achievement and

future life outcomes. This paper investigates the first of these beliefs through an examination of the

changes in the black-white achievement gap as students progress through school. The findings

suggest that the achievement gap increase across grades is larger for blacks with higher initial

achievement, and that this is due primarily to stronger deleterious effects for initially high

achieving blacks of attending schools with a high black enrollment share.

        Differences by initial achievement in both the growth in the achievement gap and

relationship to school racial composition are striking and carry important implications for the future

education and earnings distributions. The expanding achievement racial gap as students progress

through school is fueled by relatively constant gaps at the bottom of the black and the white

distributions and a dramatically increasing gap at the top. Given the relationship between cognitive

skills and economic outcomes, the truncation at the top of the black achievement distribution does

not bode well for the future expansion of the number of blacks who complete college and graduate

school and who enter high prestige occupations and positions of power.

        We begin with a description of the evolution of achievement differences by initial

achievement level, focusing on problems introduced by test measurement error induced regression

to the mean. We follow this with an investigation of the contributions of school and peer


                                                                                                    2
characteristics to these changes, paying particularly attention to the possibility that the importance

of specific factors may differ by initial achievement. The findings indicate that both the growth in

the achievement gap and the effects of specific variables differ significantly by position in the

achievement distribution at entry to elementary school with the largest adverse impacts on blacks

who enter being the best prepared.


1. Economic Motivation


        Table 1 provides a stark picture of the black-white differences in academic, economic, and

social outcomes that have survived the schooling policies of the last decades. Among men and

women 20 to 24 years old, blacks are far less likely to complete or be in the process of completing

college, far less likely to work, and far more likely to be in prison or other institutions. The rates of

incarceration and non-employment for young black men paint a particularly dire picture.

        Cognitive skills appear strongly correlated with black and white gaps in school attainment

and in wages, and this has motivated aggressive policies to raise the quality of education for

blacks.1 The landmark decision in Brown v Board of Education that attacked racial segregation of

schools was the modern beginning of concerted federal, state, and local actions directed at

improving black achievement.2 Along with subsequent court cases, Brown ushered in a profound

change in both school and peer characteristics, while contemporaneous increases in school

spending, brought on in part by school finance litigation, further raised the resources devoted to

black students in the public schools. Nonetheless, racial disparities have been stubbornly resistant

to policy, raising the possibility that schools really cannot be effective policy instruments.3

2. Strands of Literature on the Racial Achievement Gap

        The original Coleman Report (Coleman et al. (1966)) was mandated by the Civil Rights

Act of 1964 and motivated by concerns about racial justice in the schools. It described a situation

where the gap in student performance, measured in terms of grade-level equivalents, expanded over

time. Its analysis, however, did not suggest that the achievement differences existing in 1965 had

much to do with the schools but rather were driven by family and peers.4 Its companion report, U.S.

Commission on Civil Rights (1967), focused on the role of racial concentration in the schools as a

primary factor in the existing achievement gaps.

        This time period was also central to the development of several different policy thrusts that

were directly related to achievement gaps. The U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Brown was slow to be

implemented as many Southern districts resisted desegregation and as the Court repeatedly refined

and sharpened its message of 1954. As a result, the most significant changes in school

desegregation occurred in the late 1960s and during the 1970s (see Welch and Light (1987),

Clotfelter (2004)). Although the policy innovations were dramatic, the research on implications of

desegregation has been slower in coming. Much of the early work focused on the outcomes of

desegregative acts (court orders, busing programs, and the like) and failed to separate the

immediate reactions from the long term impacts. See, for example, Crain and Mahard (1978),

Cook (1984), Armor (1995), and the assessment in Linn and Welner (2007).

        A second policy initiative also expanded the federal role in education, particularly for

disadvantaged groups. With the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965, the

federal government entered into the funding and operations of schools more forcefully than ever

before, initiating compensatory education programs designed to bring up performance by




4
  This analysis was subjected to considerable criticism; see, for example, Bowles and Levin (1968) or
Hanushek and Kain (1972).


                                                                                                        4
disadvantaged students.5 A variety of assessments about the impact of these compensatory

programs for the disadvantaged raised questions about the effectiveness of ESEA, but it continued

to be one of the most significant federal education programs.6

         The implications of these programs and other factors on the racial achievement gap have

not surprisingly received considerable attention. Studies of National Assessment of Education

Progress (NAEP) scores document a lessening of the black-white gap during the 1980s and early

1990s and a roughly stable gap thereafter.7 The impacts of specific family, school, peer, and

community factors on this pattern have been examined, but the limited and often contradictory

statistical evidence raises doubts about the efficacy of desegregation and other policies as

mechanisms for addressing racial inequalities.8

         Research on “summer fall back” supports the notion that increasing achievement gaps

through the schooling years is largely not a product of the schools per se. This work, relying on

summer and fall testing of achievement, suggests that learning during the school year might on

average be the same for blacks and whites but that the amount of learning during the summer

months heavily favors white students (Heyns (1978), Downey, von Hippel, and Broh (2004),

Alexander, Entwisle, and Olson (2007)).


5
   Federal involvement in school accountability under the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 is in fact the
latest reauthorization of the ESEA statutes.
6
   Before each re-authorization, the federal government hired an outside evaluator to judge the effectiveness
of the compensatory funding. Invariably, these studies found little success in terms of achievement (see
Vinovskis (1999)). These findings dovetail with direct analyses of how school resources tend not to be
related to student outcomes (e.g., Hanushek (2003)).
7
  See, for example, Congressional Budget Office (1986), Grissmer, Kirby, Berends, and Williamson (1994),
the collection of research in Jencks and Phillips (1998), and Hanushek (2001).
8
  Earlier optimism about narrowing gaps (Jencks and Phillips (1998)) largely dissipated with new evidence
that the black-white achievement gap stayed constant or even grew during the 1990s (National Center for
Education Statistics (2005)). In terms of the specific policies that have been pursued, direct evidence on the
benefits of school desegregation remains limited. Review of the evidence surrounding desegregation actions
provides limited support for positive achievement effects (Schofield (1995)); Guryan (2004) finds that
desegregation reduced the probability of dropping out of high school, though data limitations and
methodological concerns raise questions about the findings. Accumulated evidence does not provide strong
support for the belief that higher expenditure typically leads to substantial improvements in the quality of
instruction, particularly with regard to higher pay for teachers with a masters degree or substantial experience
(Hanushek (2003)).



                                                                                                              5
         Other recent research generally provides additional support for that view. For example,

Fryer and Levitt (2004, (2005) find that a substantial racial achievement gap exists at entry to

school and increases with age but that the majority of the increase occurs within schools and is not

explained by quantifiable school characteristics.9 Clotfelter, Ladd, and Vigdor (2005) document a

large third grade achievement gap in North Carolina that does not increase with schooling. Our

past work, on the other hand, highlights meaningful achievement impacts of specific peer and

teacher inputs whose distributions differ substantially by race, suggesting possible school based

explanations of at least a portion of the black-white achievement differences.10

         The concentration on the average achievement gap, however, may mask important effects

that vary across the achievement distribution. For example, discussions of peer pressures on blacks

– the “acting white” literature – raises the possibility that high achieving black students may face

very different pressures than lower achieving blacks.11 In addition, academic preparation relative to

the median or mean student in the school likely affects the extent to which the curriculum

approaches the ideal level of challenge for a student. These and other considerations suggest the

possibility of differential responses across the initial achievement distribution to particular factors.


3. Texas Schools Project Data


         The UTD Texas Schools Project (TSP) data set provides a unique stacked panel of school

administrative data that allows us to track the universe of Texas public elementary and middle

school students as they progress through school. For each cohort there are over 200,000 students in


9
  Note that Murnane, Willett, Bub, and McCartney (2005) cannot replicate either the basic school patterns of
the achievement gap or the influence of measured family background on the gaps when they go to a different,
but in some ways richer, data base. Neal (2006) finds little evidence of a growing gap past entry to school and
discounts the role of schools in either creating or ameliorating any gaps.
10
   Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin (2004) investigate the effects of student mobility; Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain
(2005) investigate the effects of teacher experience; and Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin (2006) investigate the
effects of racial composition.
11
   See, for example, Fordham and Ogbu (1986), Cook and Ludwig (1997), McWhorter (2000), Ogbu (2003),
Austen-Smith and Fryer (2005), Fryer (2006).



                                                                                                             6
over 3,000 public schools. Unlike many data sets that sample only small numbers from each school,

these data enable us to create accurate measures of peer group characteristics. We use data on four

cohorts for grades three (the earliest grade tested) through eight. The most recent cohort attended

eighth grade in 2002, while the earliest cohort attended eighth grade in 1999.

         The student data contain a limited number of student, family, and program characteristics

including race, ethnicity, gender, and eligibility for a free or reduced price lunch (the measure of

economic disadvantage). The panel feature of the data, however, is exploited to account implicitly

for a more extensive set of background characteristics through the use of a value added framework

that controls for prior achievement. Importantly, students who switch schools can be followed as

long as they remain in a Texas public school.12

         Beginning in 1993, the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) was administered

each spring to eligible students enrolled in grades three through eight. The tests, labeled criteria

referenced tests, evaluate student mastery of grade-specific subject matter. This paper presents

results for mathematics. Because the number of questions and average percent right varies across

time and grades, test results are standardized to a mean of zero and variance equal to one. Because

these tests cannot be used to measure knowledge growth with age, they provide no information on

absolute racial differences. If the variance in knowledge grows with age and time in school, as we

believe most likely, any deterioration in the relative standing of blacks on the achievement tests

would understate the increase in knowledge inequality.

         The student database is linked to detailed information on teachers including grade and



12
   Given the high rate of school switching, particularly among lower income and minority students, the
possibility of following movers is an important asset of the data. In contrast, such mobility presents a serious
sampling problem for survey data sets including the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey (ECLS) that has
been used in recent work on the racial achievement gap (Fryer and Levitt (2004, 2005) and Reardon (2008)).
The descriptive analysis the ECLS data in Hanushek and Rivkin (2006) shows that blacks who move between
grades 1 and 3 in the ECLS sample exhibit larger test score growth than stayers, a pattern contrary to that
observed in most longitudinal data sets. This highlights the difficulty of generating a representative sample of
a mobile population. More generally, sample selection problems in survey data almost certainly grow in
magnitude with age.



                                                                                                              7
subject taught, class size, years of experience, highest degree, race, gender, and student population

served. Although individual student-teacher matches are not possible, students and teachers are

uniquely related to a grade on each campus. Students are assigned the average class size and the

distribution of teacher characteristics for teachers in regular classrooms for the appropriate grade,

school, subject, and year.

        We also exclude students with any missing grade-appropriate test observations, making

two aspects of the data important for the subsequent comparisons. First, differential rates of special

education placement directly affect the achievement comparisons because of the higher incidence

among blacks. Second, we exclude all students retained in grade at any point between grades three

and eight. Because the tests are not vertically linked across grades, it is not possible to locate a

grade g test score in a grade g+1 distribution. Consequently, since blacks are more likely to be

retained in grade, the resulting sample of blacks is further positively selected relative to the sample

of whites.

        The pattern of grade retention and exclusion from tests, shown in Appendix Table A1, has

implications for the description and analysis of racial achievement gaps.13 Specifically, because of

the racial differential, it is necessary to interpret the descriptive patterns as understating the full

extent of racial achievement differences, particularly differences in the shares of students in the

lower tail of the distribution.


4. Racial Achievement Differences in Texas


        We begin with descriptive information about the achievement gaps as students progress

from third to eighth grade in Texas public schools. Because of our interest in distributional issues,

however, it is necessary to discuss first the approach used to divide students by initial achievement


13
   As Hanushek and Rivkin (2006) show, the achievement gap of students who progress with their class
understates black-white differences in academic progress at any point in time given the much higher rates of
grade retention and missing tests due primarily to special education classification (particularly for boys)
among blacks. For test taking and placement in special education, see Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin (2002).


                                                                                                          8
score. The impact of test measurement error evokes particular concern, because it is complicated by

the substantial difference in initial achievement distributions by race.

A. Division by Initial Achievement

        By dividing the third grade achievement distribution into quartiles, systematic variation in

the change in the achievement gap between third and eighth grades across initial achievement

categories can be identified. This is complicated, however, because test scores measure actual

knowledge with error. This means two individuals with identical knowledge can be placed into

different categories if one is lucky and the other unlucky in guessing or having been exposed to

specific vocabulary words or mathematics problems. If such errors are uncorrelated over time,

those initially placed in high achievement categories (partly on the basis of “good” errors) will tend

to draw less positive errors in the subsequent year and have lower average achievement gains than

those initially placed in lower categories.

        Such regression to the mean also complicates black-white comparisons by achievement

level because of race differences in the actual initial skill distributions. Table 2 illustrates the

general problem using a stylized bivariate distribution of actual skill and measurement error that is

randomly distributed and does not differ by race. The top panel reports the assumed distributions of

actual skill for blacks and whites, where the distribution for blacks is more concentrated in the

lower categories than the distribution for whites. The bottom panel describes the resulting

distribution of observed test scores, where Pij is the probability that somebody with true ability in

category i is observed in category j. Importantly, these identical conditional probabilities are

assumed for blacks and whites, based on the assumption that the distribution of test errors does not

differ by race.

        Given the assumptions regarding race differences in knowledge and measurement error,

the bottom panel illustrates that a higher proportion of whites than blacks are misclassified into the

lower observed skill category, while the opposite is true for the highest observed skill category. A

higher percentage of the blacks in the lower achievement category are classified correctly, while a


                                                                                                       9

higher percentage of the whites have negative errors. In contrast, a higher percentage of the whites

in the high achievement category are correctly classified, while a higher percentage of the blacks

have positive errors. This implies that the average errors for blacks in each observed achievement

category are higher than the average errors of whites. Because the expected error in the next period

is zero if test errors leading to are uncorrelated over time, the expected achievement gain in the next

period is higher for whites than for blacks throughout the observed initial skill distribution.

Therefore a finding that the gap grows in each category would be expected even if there was no

increase in the true knowledge differential.

         The pattern illustrated in Table 2 invalidates the simple categorization of students on the

basis of initial mathematics test scores. To overcome this problem, we use a test in a different

subject to categorize students by initial skill level, based on the assumptions of positive correlations

across subjects in true skill and of no correlation in the test measurement errors across subjects.

This approach severs the link between initial category and expected difference in the error

realizations for the initial and subsequent periods if the assumption of uncorrelated errors is true.

However, the extent of teaching to the test, the probability of cheating (particularly by teachers),

and the likelihood a student is ill (different subject tests are administered on adjacent days), are

probably similar across subjects, raising the possibility of correlated errors and potentially

invalidating this approach to categorizing students.14

         The determination of the group cutoffs provides an additional issue to resolve. Because the

distribution for whites has less dispersion than that for blacks and because there are far fewer blacks

in the sample, we chose to divide the sample on the basis of the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile of third

grade test scores computed only over the sample of blacks. This leaves blacks split almost evenly

into the four categories, while whites are concentrated in the highest quartile.

B. Growth in the achievement gap

   Notice that even if the errors are not correlated, this approach provides valid estimates of changes over
time in the achievement gap and not of the magnitude of differences at any point in time.

         Table 3 reports the evolution of the black-white achievement gap for all students combined

and by initial test score quartile. Note the particularly large change between third and fourth grade

in the top half of the distribution, suggesting that simply using the reading score for categorization

is insufficient. Given both a priori concerns about correlated errors and this initial investigation,

we drop third grade changes and focus on changes between grades 4 and 5 and between grades 8

and 9.

         A clear pattern emerges showing similar increases between grades 4 and 5 across the initial

achievement distribution but much larger increases between grades 5 and 8 in hither initial score

categories. Between grades 4 and 8 the gap rises by only 0.02 standard deviations for students in the

lowest initial achievement group, by 0.08 for students in the 2nd group, by 0.11 for students in the

third group, and by 0.14 for students in the top initial achievement quartile. The larger increase for

initially high achievers raises serious concerns about the existence of academic opportunities for

some students striving to succeed and motivates our detailed investigation.


5. The Impact of Teacher and Peer Effects on Achievement Gaps

         The role of schools in affecting the evolving racial achievement gap is controversial. Prior

work suggests uncertainty about whether the racial gap expands or contracts with schooling. More

importantly, since the earliest work on achievement gaps in Coleman et al. (1966), pinpointing any

specific school influences has proven difficult. On the other hand, external factors have seemed

clearer, such as the case of summer achievement fallback (cf. Downey, von Hippel, and Broh

(2004), Alexander, Entwisle, and Olson (2007)).

         We investigate the extent to which specific teacher and school variables account for the

growth in the achievement gap during the school years and differences by initial third grade

achievement. Our primary goal here is to assess whether schools have a discernible impact on the

growth of the racial achievement gap. We focus on teacher experience and school proportion black.

These two school factors have been previously shown to be significant determinants of



                                                                                                   11

achievement and to be distributed differently by race. Further, we have a strategy for credible

identification of these effects. While other school factors may also be important, investigation of

these specific factors is the natural extension of previous analyses.15

        The potential import of these two factors is readily apparent in Table 4. Blacks are more

likely than whites to have teachers with little or no experience and on average attend school with a

much higher black enrollment share, regardless of initial achievement quartile.

        Interestingly, there is little or no systematic variation in initial achievement of blacks

across schools of differing proportion black, raising doubts about the importance of demographic

composition as a determinant of achievement. However, as Table 5 shows, a pronounced

relationship develops as students age. By eighth grade the average black math score equals -0.15

for students in schools that are less than 25 percent black, -0.28 in schools in which the black

enrollment share lies between 25 and 50 percent, and -0.40 in schools that are majority black. Our

question is how much of this divergence is caused by demographic composition and how much is

caused by other school and family factors.

A. Empirical Model

        Identifying the effects of teacher and peer characteristics on achievement is difficult

primarily because the distribution of peer and teacher variables is not an accident but rather an

outcome of government, teacher, and family choices. Their endogeneity impedes efforts to isolate

exogenous variation in these variables.




15
   Note that by concentrating on these two factors we ignore other components of schools such as school
leadership that are likely distributed more favorably for whites than blacks. We return to this below.

        Our approach takes advantage of the stacked panel data from the Texas Schools Project to

account for systematic factors related to choices by schools and parents that affect teacher and peer

characteristics on the one hand and achievement on the other. The underlying value added models

use the quasi-random variation in teacher and peer characteristics that remains following the

removal of the multiple levels of fixed effects to identify the effects of specific peer and teacher

characteristic.

        Equation (1) highlights the key identification issues that must be addressed in the absence

of random assignment. Here achievement ( AiGsy ) for student i in grade G and school s in year y is

modeled as a function of student, family, school, and peer factors:

(1)      AiGsy = α iGy + β X iGsy + δ SiGsy + λ PiGsy + eiGsy



where P is peer composition, S is school quality (including teacher quality) in grade G, X is a vector

of flows of contemporaneous family background during grade G, α is an individual-specific

intercept specific to grade G in year y that captures the cumulative effects of family, neighborhood,

and school experiences and characterizes the knowledge and skills that each student separately

brings at entry to grade G, and e is a stochastic term capturing other unmeasured influences.

        If P and S were uncorrelated with e and α,, OLS would yield unbiased estimates of the

effects of peer and school characteristics. But as noted above, the complications inherent in the

sorting of students, teachers, and administrators among schools – combined with existing evidence

about the importance of each – strongly suggest that typically available variables contained in X

will not account adequately for potentially confounding factors.

        Our approach is to use the panel data techniques to control for student, family, school, and

community factors that could potentially bias the estimated effects, leaving only exogenous

variation in the variables of interest to identify the parameter estimates. Specifically, because we

follow students over time and observe how different students perform in given schools, we can



                                                                                                    13
remove systematic components of student, school, and peer factors by including a series of fixed

effects in the model.

         Perhaps the easiest way to see it is by considering the introduction of a school fixed effect –

or separate intercept for each school – that captures time invariant differences in neighborhoods

and schools, many of which are likely related to both achievement and school racial composition.

These include school facilities, public services, community type, and working conditions that

influence teacher supply.

         But, because school quality undoubtedly varies over time and by grade for each school, we

also includes interactions between school and both grade and year.16 School-by-grade fixed effects

capture any systematic differences across grades in a school that are common to all years, including

elements of curriculum, testing programs, and grade retention policies. The school-by-grade fixed

effect also accounts for the possibility that achievement and racial composition vary systematically

with age due to potentially confounding factors, as would be the case if white exit from schools

rises at the same age as achievement of blacks declines because of influences other than school

racial composition. School-by-year fixed effects account for systematic year-to-year differences

that are common to all grades in a school. These school-by-year fixed effects remove not only

school trends in a very general way but also idiosyncratic variation over time. For example,

changes in school administration and in neighborhood and local economic conditions that might

affect mobility patterns (including such things as the introduction of new race-related school

policies or the myriad changes documented to occur in “transitional neighborhoods”) are all

captured by these fixed effects without having to resort to available but imperfect proxies for each.

An economic shock that reduces neighborhood employment and income would not bias the

estimates; nor would a shock to local school finances or the quality of the local school board,

because each of these would affect all grades in a school.


16
   Note that we discuss both school and school-by-year fixed effects purely for expositional purposes. It is
not possible to estimate both jointly.


                                                                                                         14
            It is also important to account for statewide factors that might be correlated with overall

changes in racial composition and achievement. Grade, year, and year-by-grade fixed effects

account for statewide trends in racial composition and achievement by grade and year and other

factors including changes in test difficulty, accountability policies, textbooks and curriculum, and

the like.

            These fixed effects go significantly beyond studies that attempt to characterize differences

in schools, neighborhoods, and policies by various direct measures of their attributes. Nonetheless,

they do not account for grade specific, time varying factors that might be related to peer racial

composition or teacher experience.

            A clear and important example of possibly confounding effects would be any selective

placement of students into classrooms that is correlated to both unobserved determinants of

achievement on the one hand and classroom teacher or student characteristics on the other.

Consider the possibility that parents who are stronger advocates for their children may be more

likely to succeed in placing children with experienced teachers. Alternatively, principals may be

more likely to place high achieving blacks in racially mixed classrooms. To deal with this potential

problem, we restrict attention to variations in racial composition and teacher attributes at the grade

rather than classroom level. This use of grade rather than classroom level information is closely

related to the use of grade average percent black as an instrumental variable, although the IV

estimator would also use within grade black-white differences in the classroom proportion black in

the computation of standard errors.17

            A second concern not addressed by aggregation to the grade level is the possibility that a

spurious correlation is introduced between achievement and the variables of interest as a result of


17
    Clotfelter, Ladd, and Vigdor (2003) find significant variations in the racial composition of classrooms by
district, school, classroom, and academic track in middle school but much less so in primary school. Their
descriptive analysis does not address implications for student performance, but, given our inclusion of
school-by-year and school-by-grade fixed effects in regressions estimated separately by race, any such
variation likely has a negligible effect on the estimates in this paper. Because our data do not include
classroom identifiers, classroom differences cannot be used in this analysis.


                                                                                                          15
parental decisions to switch schools. If the presence of more inexperienced teachers increases the

likelihood that families leave the school, it becomes difficult to separate the influence of attrition

from the true effect of teacher inexperience.

        Bias from such selection emerges only if the selection is related systematically to within

school-by-grade differences over time in the variables of interest and, importantly, to unobserved

determinants of achievement. The fact that teacher assignments and other relevant aspects of

school decisions are frequently not known until immediately prior to the beginning of school year

argues against the presence of this potential source of bias. Moreover, transactions costs and the

presence of multiple children in the majority of families would tend to limit family mobility in

response to concerns about school quality for a single grade, even if relevant teacher and classroom

assignments were known in a timely manner.18 Nonetheless, we do account directly for student

heterogeneity as we describe below.

        The variation used to identify the parameter estimates can be illustrated by considering

racial composition for a single school (In a more general case with multiple schools, the

coefficients would reflect the average of these within-school relationships across the sample). With

multiple years of data for one grade, we could use cohort differences in achievement and racial

composition to identify the racial composition effect. However, unobserved changes over time

could bias the estimates produced by this school-by-grade fixed effects model. Alternatively, with

multiple grades of data for a single year, we could use grade differences in achievement and in

racial composition to identify the racial composition effect. However, systematic differences by

cohort or grade could bias the estimates produced by this school-by-year fixed effects model.

        Fortunately, the availability of data for multiple years and grades permits the simultaneous

inclusion of school-by-grade and school-by-year fixed effects. In addition, the presence of multiple

schools in the sample allows for the inclusion of grade-by-year fixed effects that account for any


18
   As noted, however, ny potential reactions yielding different classroom assignments within a given school
do not cause problems.


                                                                                                       16
grade specific, statewide changes in policy, curriculum, or the difficulty of tests. Therefore the

racial composition and teacher characteristic effects are identified by deviations from school

averages for each grade and year.

         In this framework, the remaining variation in racial composition and the other variables

comes both from students switching schools and from persistent cohort-to-cohort differences

reflecting natural demographic variations in cohort composition within schools. But, because either

of these sources of variation may be systematically related to student and family determinants of

achievement, we must account for student heterogeneity directly as well as the direct effects of

mobility.

         Mobility induced changes, although frequently ignored in research based on cohort

comparisons, introduce potentially serious problems.19 Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin (2004) show

that blacks are much more likely to change schools than whites and thus to contribute

disproportionately to year-to-year changes in school racial composition. Moreover, the evidence

shows that movers tend to have lower prior achievement. In order to purge these contaminating

influences, we control directly for the effects of moving on school changers with a vector of

mobility variables that allow for different effects by timing, number, and type of move.20

         The key remaining issue is the appropriate method for controlling for student-specific

heterogeneity, αiGY in Equation (1). Many prior authors have emphasized the role of fixed ability

differences, but concerns go considerably beyond this notion of heterogeneity. Equation (2)




19
   An identifying assumption in a number of studies that make use of cohort differences is that either raw
cohort differences or differences remaining following the removal of school specific trends over time are not
correlated with confounding factors. This approach, which builds on the intuition that students close in age in
the same school have many similar experiences, has been used in a variety of circumstances (e.g., Ehrenberg
and Brewer (1995), Ferguson and Ladd (1996), and more recently generalized by Hoxby (2000)).
20
   Indicator variables differentiate both among those moving during the summer, school year, or at least twice
in the same year and among within district changes, district changes within geographic region, and moves
across regions.

specifies αiGY as a function of prior school, peer, and family variables in previous grades, and

unobserved “ability” γ, a function of early childhood experiences, prenatal care, and heredity.21

         This formulation captures the cumulative effects of families, communities, and schools

that establish the knowledge base at the start of grade G and therefore affect achievement at the end

of grade G.22 The effects of prior period variables are assumed to decline exponentially as a

function of time from the present at a constant rate (1-θ), where 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1 . At the extreme of θ =0,

past inputs are not relevant for current achievement, i.e., having a good fourth grade teacher does

not have any implications for math achievement at the end of the fifth grade. (Note that θ =0

corresponds to estimating models of the level of achievement along with an individual student

fixed effect). On the other hand, θ =1 implies no depreciation of the influence of past inputs, i.e.,

that the impact of a good fourth grade teacher on fourth grade achievement equals her impact on

fifth grade achievement and achievement in all future grades. (θ =1 corresponds to estimating

models specified in terms of ΔA , or the simple change in achievement across grades).

         Equation (2) includes a mixture of time invariant and time varying differences that could

potentially bias estimates of racial composition effects if not incorporated directly into the

estimation. But, as can be readily seen by writing equations 1 and 2 for grade G-1, including the

student’s prior test score on the right hand side of equation 1 captures the cumulative effects of

prior school, community, and family influences that might be systematically related to peer and


21
   Boardman and Murnane (1979) and Todd and Wolpin (2003) also highlight the importance of unobserved
ability and the cumulative nature of learning.
22
    This representation makes clear the interpretation of the various inputs (X, S, and P) in equation 1. These
represent the flow of these inputs in each grade, while the cumulative inputs in equation 2, appropriately
weighted, provide the stock of each input prior to grade G. At times the flows are measured by the level of
specific inputs that do not change frequently, such as the educational attainment of parents, but the
conceptual idea is that parents with different educational attainment provide differing flows of inputs to their




                                                                                                            18
teacher variables without imposing an assumption about the value of θ. The coefficient on prior

achievement is thus a direct estimate of θ.

         Notice that our formulation is learning-based in that the value of γ affects the quantity of

skills and knowledge acquired at each grade, and these increments to achievement are subject to

depreciation. This explicitly permits the affects of ability on achievement to increase with age. The

exact formulation and interpretation depends, however, on the measurement of achievement. If

measured with vertically integrated tests, differences in γ would contribute to a widening of the

skill distribution over time as long as θ were not equal to zero.23 On the other hand, if skills were

measured by location in the distribution (as we do here with standardized scores), the complicated

final term in parentheses could be replaced with γi, because ability induced differences in relative

achievement would remain constant over time.24

         The formulation with lagged achievement does not account explicitly for the

contemporaneous effect of unobserved ability, and a key identifying assumption is that any

variation in γ not correlated with the prior test score is orthogonal to the variation in the teacher and

school characteristics that remains following the inclusion of the multiple levels of school fixed

effects. We do not believe that this is a strong condition. To be violated, it must be the case that –

conditional on prior score – schools or parents take actions to alter average teacher or peer

characteristics for a specific grade in ways that are related systematically to unobserved ability.

         In sum, the approach is aimed at eliminating in a very general way any systematic family,

school, and neighborhood factors that might be correlated with the focal determinants of



child’s learning. Moreover, with separation and new family relationships, these inputs can themselves vary
over time.
23
   In testing terms this implies having vertically scaled scores that indicate skills and knowledge over time
and not just measurement relative to a grade-specific norm for learning.
24
   Note that, more generally, this holds for all time invariant factors. Consequently, if the distributions of
school quality and family and community environments were fixed through grade G, current characteristics
would fully describe schooling, family, and community histories. Of course this would rule out the use of
panel estimators and make it virtually impossible to identify the causal effects of specific factors. Moreover,
the notion of constant school and teacher quality contradicts evidence of substantial student mobility and
within-school variation over time in the quality of education.


                                                                                                           19
achievement, i.e., with teacher quality and racial composition. The remaining exogenous variation

through natural demographic differences among cohorts and inter-temporal movements in school

circumstances thus allows for identification of how specific teacher and peer characteristics

influence racial achievement gaps.

B. Results

         The analysis focuses on the effects of racial composition and initial teacher experience;

class size is also included in all specifications though the small differences by race rules out a

sizeable role for class size in explaining growth in the achievement gap. We also considered other

factors including teacher education, average teacher experience, and proportion of students who are

Hispanic.25 Consistent with prior work, however, no teacher education variable or measures of

experience beyond the initial years were significant determinants of achievement, and their

exclusion from the analysis had virtually no effect on the other coefficients. A similar result was

found for the proportions of students who are Hispanic and Asian. Finally, the effects of all

variables are allowed to differ by race and achievement quartile.

         Table 6 reports estimates by race and initial achievement quartile and robust standard

errors clustered by school for three specifications that progressively add school-by-year and

school-by-grade fixed effects estimated separately for elementary and middle school grades.26 In

addition to the reported estimates, all specifications include indicators for subsidized lunch

eligibility, participation in special education, female, a family initiated move, and a transition to


25
    Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain (2005) finds that teacher experience is important in the first two years of a
teaching career (but not thereafter) and that class size has small effects in earlier grades. These patterns are
consistent with a number of other high-quality recent works including Rockoff (2004), Boyd et al. (2006),
and Kane, Rockoff, and Staiger (2006). Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin (2006) find increased concentration of
black students has a particularly deleterious effect on black achievement. This finding is consistent with
Guryan (2004), Angrist and Lang (2004), and Hanushek and Raymond (2005).

   In order to reduce computation time substantially we aggregate the data by race, initial achievement
quartile, school, grade, and year and weight the regressions by the number of students in each cell. Given that
the models are linear, it is not surprising that preliminary estimates of the weighted aggregate and student
level models were quite similar in magnitude and significance. Estimates are based on a total of 445,741
observations in the elementary school regressions and 552,382 observations in the middle school regressions.

a. Robust standard errors clustered by school in parenthesis. All specifications include a black and female indicators, indicators for a transition to junior high,
subsidized lunch eligibility, special education participation, and a non-structural move (all fully interacted with black), and a full set of grade-by-year variables.
middle school (in the middle school regressions), the share of students who are new to the school,

and the share of teachers with two years of experience, all fully interacted by initial achievement

quartile and race.

           The results reported in the first panel of Table 6 reveal substantial differences in the effects

of proportion black by initial achievement quartile, race, and schooling level. Consider first the two

lower achievement quartiles. Estimated effects of school proportion black on blacks and whites are

quite similar in both elementary and middle school. In the elementary school regressions, the

hypothesis that racial composition has no effect on elementary school achievement cannot be

rejected at conventional levels for either blacks or whites. In the middle school regressions, by

comparison, the effects are larger and more precisely estimated; they remain quite similar in

magnitude for blacks and whites, significant at the five percent level in the specification with

school-by-grade fixed effects and only slightly smaller and almost significant at the five percent

level in the model that also includes school-by-year fixed effects. The fact that the addition of

school-by-year fixed effects causes slight reductions in coefficient magnitudes and slight increases

in standard error magnitudes is consistent with possibility that the additional fixed effects

exacerbate any measurement error induced attenuation bias.

           In contrast, there are substantial differences across race in the estimates for students in the

two higher quartiles, particularly those with the highest initial scores. The full fixed effect

estimates of proportion black on achievement for blacks in the top initial achievement quartile are

-0.20 (significant at the 5 percent level) in elementary school and -0.35 (significant at the one

percent level) in middle school. The estimated effects for whites in the highest initial quartile,

however, are small and statistically insignificant in all specifications with campus-by-grade fixed

effects.

           The pattern of proportion black estimates suggests peer influences that are largest for high


grades three through eight are included in the sample. A small number of observations are excluded because
of missing information on teachers.


                                                                                                        21
achieving blacks. Not only does the stability of the estimates across specifications support the

notion that the estimates identify a causal effect, but it also suggests that the underlying mechanism

relates to peers and not to school factors such as curriculum or school quality. Given that only

grade specific variation over time is used to identify the estimates, it is unlikely that grade specific

school or teacher quality that is correlated with proportion black in a particular grade and year is

driving the estimates. The finding of larger effects in middle school and for initially high achieving

blacks is also consistent with the beliefs that peer influences grow as students enter adolescence

and that high achieving blacks come under pressure not to achieve, though the precise causal

mechanism cannot be understood in the absence of more detailed information on peer interactions.

        The next two panels show a strong negative relationship between achievement and the

share of teachers with little or no experience. All coefficients for the share with no prior experience

reported in the top panel are negative; many are significant at the five percent level for blacks, and

all are significant at the five percent level for whites. For whites, a similar pattern to that observed

for the peer proportion black estimates appears, as the coefficient magnitudes decline in both

elementary and middle school as initial achievement rises, though in this case estimated effects

tend to be larger in the younger grades. No such clear ordering appears for blacks, though the lack

of precision in the estimates may conceal a true underlying pattern.

        The impact of teachers with only one year of prior experience (panel 3) tends to be smaller

and less precisely estimated. Regardless of initial achievement, all of the coefficients for whites in

the elementary school regressions are much smaller in magnitude, and none are significant at the

five percent level. For whites in the middle school, estimated effects of teachers with one year

experience are quite similar to the corresponding coefficients for those with zero years of

experience, with the exception of students in the bottom initial achievement category for whom the

estimate is quite small and imprecise. The impact for black students in middle school tends to be

similar to that of teachers with zero years of experience, but these effects are quite imprecisely

estimated for elementary school.


                                                                                                     22
Implications of School Effects
        The combination of disparate circumstances in black and white schools and of strong and

racially divergent impacts of the included school and peer variables suggests that schools account

for at least a portion of the growth in the racial achievement gap. Blacks typically attend schools

with a much higher black enrollment share and, as often discussed, attend schools with a larger

portion of rookie teachers. To understand the impact of these on achievement, we use the estimates

from the full fixed effect model reported in Table 6 to simulate the impact of setting the racial

composition and teacher distribution faced by black students to the average in all of Texas schools.

These simulations assume a rate of knowledge depreciation of 0.3, roughly equal to one minus the

coefficient on lagged achievement score for blacks.

        Table 7 shows the simulated impact on the achievement of blacks from reducing the

proportion of schoolmates who are black, the proportion of teachers with no prior experience, and

the proportion of teachers with one year of experience from their actual levels to the average for

whites and blacks combined in the state of Texas. Other than for the lowest initial achievement

group that experienced a very small increase in the gap, the simulations suggest that race

differences in school proportion black and teacher experience explain between 25 and 50 percent of

the growth in the achievement gap between grades four and eight. School proportion black has a

much larger impact than does teacher experience for all groups, though it is important to recognize

that unmeasured differences in teacher quality may be important as well.

        Indeed, the impact of schools is almost certainly much larger than we show here: As Rivkin,

Hanushek, and Kain (2005) indicate, easily quantifiable variables do not explain the bulk of the

variance in teacher and school quality. Our analytical strategy focuses entirely on identifying

causal impacts of a small number of variables, and thus a portion of the systematic influences of

schools and peers were undoubtedly ignored because of impediments to the measurement and

identification of variable effects.27

        Our estimation approach relies entirely on within-school variation (across grades and

years) in the teacher and peer variables. We then combined these estimates with between-school

differences in the specific factors to simulate their contributions to the achievement differential. As

noted earlier, we believe that other differences in teachers and schools also tend to favor whites

over blacks and widen the achievement gap. One hint at the potential magnitude comes from

decomposing the growth in the achievement gap into between-school and within-school

components. Although the sharp divergence in school attendance patterns and accompanying

uncertainty about the appropriate method for weighting observations introduces some uncertainty,

several different decomposition algorithms suggest that roughly two-thirds of the growth in the gap

occurred between schools for all four groups. Of course family and community differences across

schools also contribute to the between-school component, so this estimate should not be interpreted

as the contribution of schools per se. 28



The Policy Dilemma
        By any measure, black-white differences in schooling outcomes are a matter of enormous

concern. The early progress toward racial convergence that followed Brown v. Board of Education

and the civil rights legislation of the 1960s has slowed if not stopped over the past two decades

(Neal (2006)). The implications of this slowdown for earnings inequality and the economic

well-being of blacks have been magnified by the substantial increase in the return to skill

experienced over the past 30 years. The differences in measured skills between blacks and whites

are enormous. By age 17, the average black student is performing at around the 20th percentile of




27
    One example is the possible importance of the race match of students and teachers. Ehrenberg and
Brewer (1995), Dee (2004), and Hanushek, Kain, O'Brien, and Rivkin (2005) find that black students do
better when matched with a black teacher. However, because we cannot investigate classroom linkages here,
we cannot pursue this element of schools.
28
    In earlier grades, Fryer and Levitt (2006) estimate a smaller between-school share.


                                                                                                      24
the white distribution.29 This performance feeds directly into further schooling and into the labor

market, contributing to substantial black-white differences in lifetime earnings and occupational

prestige.

        A central component of public policy to address this situation is to use schooling

investments to increase the skills of minorities and disadvantaged populations and thus to

ameliorate the disparate economic outcomes. To this end, two aspects of the current situation –

vividly depicted in Figure 1 – are particularly telling. First, the black-white achievement gap

appears to increase, not decrease, with schooling. Second, the observed gap grows most for blacks

who start out at higher achievement levels.

        Nonetheless, implications for policy remain uncertain. At first blush, effective policy

initiatives would seem straightforward. Blacks suffer from a concentration of new teachers and

from the racial concentrations in the schools they attend. Further, because black students are

differentially affected by these, particularly in the case of racial composition, there appears to be

room for Pareto improving policies – since according to the estimates black students can be helped

at little or no cost to white students. However, Supreme Court decisions, housing patterns, and

evidence regarding teacher labor markets suggest limited policy options with regard to altering

student racial composition and potentially high costs to altering the distribution of inexperienced

teachers.

        Perhaps the most easily identified policies revolve around ensuring that black students do

not draw a disproportionate share of beginning teachers. However, because a substantial portion of

the existing teacher experience differential appears to result from the teacher preferences related to

working conditions including location and because teachers cannot be required to teach in

particular districts, urban districts may have a very difficult time raising salaries high to attract

experienced teachers to high poverty, high proportion black schools. (Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin

which districts allocate teachers to schools that disadvantage experienced teachers is likely to

induce exit from the district unless salaries are increased, perhaps substantially.30

        Reducing the impact of peer composition is even more problematic. The recent U.S.

Supreme Court decisions concerning schools in Seattle and Louisville severely limited if not

curtailed the use of race-based policies in public schools.31 But, more important, as Rivkin and

Welch (2006) report, housing patterns account for the bulk of school segregation, and prior court

decisions limit inter-district desegregation programs.32 Moreover, our sample covers a period

without much systematic desegregation activity, and the relationship between achievement and

racial composition might depend upon both programmatic and historical factors that determine

school attendance patterns in a given district. Consequently, active initiatives designed to increase

substantially black exposure to whites might produce a different relationship between achievement

and racial composition that we identify here.

        The implication is that, while we identify specific school and peer factors that

systematically affect racial achievement gaps, policy directed at just these factors is unlikely to be

very successful. Instead, looking at a more comprehensive set of policies aimed at improving the

quality of schools attended by blacks – such as improving teacher quality in those schools perhaps

by a combination of an expansion in the pool of potential teachers through deregulation, salary

increases and improvements in working conditions– will be required. Nonetheless, the magnitude

of the achievement gaps is truly large, and the large gaps at entry to school point to the further need

for a broader set of policies.

        Finally, it is crucial to recognize that test score differences do not provide adequate

information for those not in the test sample, which in this case includes students retained in grade or

those excused from test taking because of a disability or other circumstance.33 Given the much

higher rate of special education classification and grade retention for blacks than for whites and for

black boys in particular, the achievement comparisons do not capture fully the gap in education

progress and do not illustrate the educational difficulties of many at the lower end of the

achievement distribution including those that will likely experience poor academic, social, and

labor market outcomes in the future.34

   The low rates of test taking for blacks and to a lesser extent whites among those who participate in all five
waves in the ECLS sample raise the possibility that the reported growth in achievement differences
understates the actual increase during the early elementary school years.
