Neighbors as Negatives: Relative Earnings and Well-Being

                                        ABSTRACT

This paper investigates whether individuals feel worse off when others around them earn more. In

other words, do people care about relative position and does "lagging behind the Joneses" diminish

well-being? To answer this question, I match individual-level panel data containing a number of

indicators of well-being to information about local average earnings. I find that, controlling for an

individual's own income, higher earnings of neighbors are associated with lower levels of self-

reported happiness. The data's panel nature and rich set of measures of well-being and behavior

indicate that this association is not driven by selection or by changes in the way people define

happiness. There is suggestive evidence that the negative effect of increases in neighbors' earnings

on own well-being is most likely caused by interpersonal preferences, i.e. people having utility

functions that depend on relative consumption in addition to absolute consumption.

1. Introduction



         Classical economists understood that individuals are motivated at least partly by concerns

about relative position. Adam Smith (1759), for example, wrote: “Nothing is so mortifying as to

be obliged to expose our distress to the view of the public, and to feel, that though our situation

is open to the eyes of all mankind, no mortal conceives for us the half of what we suffer. Nay, it

is chiefly from this regard to the sentiments of mankind, that we pursue riches and avoid

poverty.” Arthur Pigou (1920) approvingly quotes John Stuart Mill’s observation that “men do

not desire to be rich, but richer than other men.”1 Of course, the belief that people may compare

themselves to others around them goes back much further. After all, the framer of the Ten

Commandments apparently judged it necessary to forbid humans from coveting their neighbor’s

possessions. Not all humans, however, appear to abide by this Commandment and possible

effects of social comparisons on consumption and savings behavior are analyzed in the classic

works of Veblen (1899) and Duesenberry (1949).

         Though contemporary economists are aware that individuals may care about relative

position, the accepted mainstream model states that individuals derive utility from their own

consumption, U(C), rather than from a combination of own and relative consumption, U(C,

C/ C ), where C denotes some measure of the consumption of relevant others.2 For many

applications it does not matter whether utility has a relative component; whenever C is fixed or

given, U(C) and U(C, C/ C ) are isomorphic. Indeed, unless an individual’s behavior can affect

  This is quoted in Graham and Pettinato (2002).
2
  Becker (1974) introduces a more general framework for incorporating social considerations into a utility function.
 C need not be the simple average of the consumption of relevant others, but could be some weighted average with
the weight depending on the similarity of the respondent to the other person or on the level of consumption of the
other person.


                                                         1
C , U(C) and U(C, C/ C ) cannot be distinguished by individual behavior without placing

additional structure on the utility function.3 In light of this, it is perhaps not surprising that most

economists tend to rely on an absolute formulation of utility: U(C).

        Whereas individuals may in many cases take C as given, policy decisions often affect

C . Hence, the distinction between absolute and relative formulations of utility has important

implications for tax and expenditure policy, as analyzed by Boskin and Sheshinski (1978),

Layard (1980), Oswald (1983), Ng (1987), Seidman (1987), Ireland (1998), Ljungqvist and

Uhlig (2000) and Abel (2003). In particular, if utility depends on relative consumption, one

person’s increase in consumption has a negative externality on others because it lowers the

relative consumption of others. In this case, taxes that discourage consumption are not as

distortionary as previously thought because they also serve to internalize the negative externality

of consumption on others.

        When utility depends on one’s consumption relative to nearby others, residential sorting

by consumption level will reduce inequality of utility because people will compare themselves

with others more like themselves. Comparing oneself to similar others reduces inequality in

perceived relative position, which is one component of inequality of utility. If utility is linear in

relative consumption and additive in absolute and relative consumption, then residential sorting

by consumption level does not affect average utility, but for other functional forms it can

increase or decrease average utility. Thus, when people care about relative position, the degree

  A structure that specifies that relative concerns are more important for some goods (e.g. present consumption or
luxury consumption items) than for other goods (e.g. leisure or future consumption) yields behavioral implications.
See, for example, Pollak (1976) or Frank (1985). As Dupor and Liu (2003) make clear, if the consumption of others
affects own marginal utility rather the level of own utility, the consumption of others can influence asset pricing,
risk taking, savings, intensity of job search, work effort, economic growth and income inequality. See, e.g., Abel
(1990), Robson (1992), Galí (1994), Carroll, Overland and Weil (1997), Campbell and Cochrane (1999), Stutzer and
Lalive (2001), Becker, Murphy and Werning (2003) and Zeckhauser and Rizzo (2003).


                                                         2
of residential sorting has direct effects on the distribution of well-being in addition to the indirect

effects usually identified (e.g. due to the financing of local public goods).

        The distinction between relative and absolute formulations of utility is also pertinent to

the longstanding debate on whether the poverty line should be absolute (a fixed consumption

basket), as it is in the U.S. and in many developing countries, or relative (a fraction of mean or

median income), as it is in much of Europe (Sen, 1983). It also matters for the question whether

increases in inequality due to a rise in the top incomes are a matter of policy concern. Feldstein

(1998), for example, argues forcefully that only poverty, not increases in inequality due to

increased top incomes, warrant policy attention because the latter is a pure Pareto improvement

under the assumption that people only derive utility from their own consumption. He notes that

this argument would not hold for “spiteful egalitarians,” or people who say “It makes me worse

off to see the rich getting richer.” While one may reject spiteful egalitarianism on moral grounds

(and therefore use a paternalistic argument to exclude this spiteful utility component from any

social welfare function), it is an empirical question to determine whether people actually suffer

from this affliction. In other words, do people actually feel worse off when those around them

are richer?4

        This paper tries to answer that question and finds evidence of “spiteful egalitarianism.” I

use panel data on individuals’ self-reported happiness, other measures of well-being and other

characteristics from the 1987-88 and the 1992-94 waves of the National Survey of Families and

Households (NSFH). I match this data to information on local earnings, where localities are so-

called Public Use Microdata Areas (“PUMAs”), which have about 150,000 inhabitants on

average. Average annual earnings in each PUMA are estimated by applying national earnings by

 Samuelson (2004) and Rayo and Becker (2004) offer evolutionary explanations of relative consumption effects.
Postewaite (1998) discusses the advantages and drawbacks of modeling relative position as an argument of the
utility function rather than as an instrument to getting more own consumption in the future.

industry, occupation and year from the Current Population Survey to the industry and occupation

mix of that PUMA from the 1990 Census five percent Public Use Micro Sample. I find that

higher PUMA-level earnings are associated with lower levels of happiness, controlling for a host

of individual characteristics including income.5 This effect is large, robust to changes in

specification and highly statistically significant. An increase in neighbors’ earnings and a

similarly sized decrease in own income each lead to a reduction in happiness of about the same

order of magnitude.

         This paper builds on previous papers that have empirically examined the relationship

between relative position and well-being.6 In a series of papers, Easterlin (1974, 1995 and 2001)

notes that income and self-reported happiness are positively correlated across individuals within

a country but that average happiness within countries does not seem to rise over time as countries

become richer. Easterlin interprets these findings as evidence that relative income rather than the

level of income matters for well-being. Veenhoven (1991) and Diener et al. (1993) show that

happiness is not purely a relative concept, but they cannot rule out that concerns about relative

position matter. Van de Stadt, Kapteyn and Van de Geer (1985) find that the income level that

respondents say they need to reach a certain level of satisfaction rises both with own income and

with income in one’s reference group as defined by education and age. They interpret this as

5
  Though, at a conceptual level, relative consumption rather than relative income or earnings affects well-being, I
use measures of earnings and income as proxies for consumption in the empirical section because of data
availability.

  Frey and Stutzer (2002) provide an excellent review of this literature. Layard (2003) also discusses much of this
literature as part of his engaging Lionel Robbins Memorial Lectures on happiness. Relative position may affect
outcome variables other than subjective well-being. Clark and Oswald (1996) show evidence on job satisfaction
while Neumark and Postlewaite (1998) and Bowles and Park (2002) relate it to labor supply decisions. There is a
long literature on the effects of inequality on health outcomes. Deaton (2003) surveys this literature and concludes
that the evidence on the relation between income inequality and health needs to be treated skeptically though he
believes there is convincing biological evidence that increases in rank can be protective of health. Eibner and Evans
(2001) find evidence for the U.S. that relative deprivation (which is a measure of rank and the income gap with
those who are richer) increases mortality. Similarly, local variables other than income may affect well-being. Clark
(2003) finds effects of local unemployment on happiness that may be explained by concerns about relative position.
Alesina, Di Tella and MacCulloch (2001) investigate how inequality affects well-being and, intriguingly, find
negative effects in Europe but not in the U.S.


                                                          4
evidence that utility is (partly) relative, but the findings could also be driven by reference group

income proxying for poorly measured own income.7 Using a self-reported measure of relative

position, Graham and Pettinato (2002) find suggestive evidence in developing countries that

well-being is influenced by relative income concerns though their measure of relative position

might also proxy for own income.

         Using Canadian data, Tomes (1986) relates self-reported happiness and life-satisfaction

to own income and income in the local community. In a number of specifications, he finds that

increases in income in certain parts of the community income distribution reduce well-being and

he concludes that his “results support the interdependent preferences model, but defy any simple

characterization in terms of inequality aversion or relative economic status.” Using the German

Socio-Economic Panel, Ferrer-i-Carbonell (2004) finds compelling evidence that, controlling for

own income, subjective well-being is decreasing in income of the reference group defined by

education × age × region cells where region is East or West Germany. Stutzer (2004) shows that

self-reported happiness of Swiss individuals depends negatively on income aspirations when

own income is held constant. Income aspirations, in turn, depend positively on the average

income in one’s community, thus providing a mechanism by which average local income reduces

self-reported happiness. Using U.S. data, McBride (2001) and Oswald and Clark (2004) both

find tantalizing evidence that relative income affects subjective well-being but they caution about

the statistical reliability of their findings.8


7
  Van Praag and Kapteyn (1973) found previously that income needed to reach a certain level of satisfaction rises
with own income and interpret this as “preference drift,” or evidence of habit formation. See Van Praag and Frijters
(1999) for more details on the approach to measuring welfare using income need questions.
8
  Using a sample of 324 individuals from the General Social Survey, McBride (2001) finds that, controlling for own
income, self-reported happiness depends negatively on the average income in one’s age cohort defined as those
within 5 years of the respondent’s age though this effect is only just significant at the 5% level in one of his two
specifications and not significant in the other. Oswald and Clark (2004) find that, controlling for own income, there
is a sizeable but statistically insignificant negative effect of per capita state income on self-reported happiness,
providing suggestive evidence that individuals care about relative position. They also find that relative income


                                                          5
         This paper contributes in three ways to this literature. First, it takes seriously the concern

that living in a prosperous area might affect one’s definition of happiness even if it does not

affect one’s true or experienced well-being. I use other outcome measures that are less prone to

definition shifts in response to neighbors’ earnings to investigate this concern and conclude that

this concern is not driving the results.

         Second, the paper examines whether the inverse relationship between happiness and

neighbors’ earnings might be spurious due to omitted individual or local characteristics. The

panel nature of the NSFH data enables me to run specifications with individual fixed effects, its

detailed geographical information allows for the inclusion of state×time-specific fixed effects,

and the use of a predicted measure of local earnings filters out many local earnings shocks

caused by unobserved local factors that might simultaneously influence happiness. The results

hold up under these specifications, reducing the concern that they are due to omitted variable

bias.

         Third, the paper offers suggestive evidence concerning the mechanism mediating the

negative relationship neighbors’ earnings and happiness. Is it a psychological externality of the

form U(C, C/ C ) as laid out above? Or might there be market interactions (e.g. in the housing

market) that give rise to this pattern? In contrast to what one would expect if the findings were

driven by effects in local housing markets, I find no evidence that there is any difference in the

effect for renters and owners. Yet, I do find evidence that the results are stronger for people who

socialize more with neighbors but not for those who socialize more with friends outside the

neighborhood. I also find that the effects on happiness are mostly driven by changes in one’s


enters significantly if entered as household income per capita / state income per capita. However, because this
regression controls for the log of household income per capita rather than the level of household income per capita,
the relative income term may be significant because it offers an alternative functional form for own household
income and not because of variation in state income per capita.


                                                          6
satisfaction with one’s material position (e.g. one’s financial situation) rather than changes with

one’s satisfaction with other aspects of life (e.g. one’s family life). Finally, individuals’

happiness decreases if neighbors with the same educational attainment earn more but hardly

responds to earnings of neighbors with different levels of educational attainment. Together, these

findings indicate that interpersonal preferences that incorporate relative income concerns, rather

than other mechanisms, drive the negative association between neighbors’ earnings and own

well-being.




2. Empirical Strategy



         Can data on behavior reveal whether people’s well-being is affected by the incomes of

others around them? Unless one assumes that neighbors’ incomes affect an individual’s

marginal utility of other goods, the only behavior affected is the individual’s choice of reference

group implicit in the decision where to locate.9 Individuals’ concerns about relative position

might then be capitalized in house prices with houses in high-income neighborhoods costing

relatively less than similar houses in low-income neighborhoods because a homeowner in a rich

neighborhood needs to be compensated for being relatively poor.10 This prediction, of course,

only holds if individuals are both (i) aware that their utility depends on relative position and (ii)

correctly forecast the utility effect of the change in reference group associated with moving.



9
 See, Falk and Knell (2003) for evidence on reference groups choices from a questionnaire study.
10
  This prediction is derived from Frank’s (1984) model in which he analyzes the effects of relative income concerns
on wage distributions. He assumes that the reference group consists of coworkers and deduces that a worker in firm
with highly productive (and highly paid) workers must be paid more than a similar worker in a low productivity firm
because the worker needs to be compensated for the utility loss of being a relatively low earner if he joins the firm
with the high earners.


                                                         7
Loewenstein, O’Donoghue and Rabin (2003) describe a number of experiments that show

systematic biases in individuals’ predictions of their future utility. With respect to endogenous

reference groups, they note that “when people make decisions that cause their comparison

groups to change – such as switching jobs or buying a house in a new neighborhood – projection

bias predicts that people will underappreciate the effects of a change in comparison groups and

hence, consistent with Smith’s assertion, overestimate the long-term satisfaction that would

accompany such a change. As a result, people may be prone to make reference-group-changing

decisions that give them a sensation of status relative to their current reference group. If a

person buys a small house in a wealthy neighborhood in part because it has a certain status

value in her apartment building, she may not fully appreciate that her frame of references may

quickly become the larger houses and bigger cars that her new neighbors have.” These

considerations make credible identification of relative income concerns from mobility decisions

or housing price information very challenging.

         The identification of relative income concerns therefore probably falls in the limited set

of research questions for which one needs to turn to a proxy for utility to answer it (see, Di Tella

et al., 2001, Gruber and Mullainathan, 2002, or Frey et al., 2004, for other examples of such

questions).11 Though some skepticism towards self-reported measures of well-being is

warranted (see, Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2001, and Ravallion and Lokshin, 2001), there is

ample psychological evidence that confirms the validity and reliability of self-reported happiness

as a measure of well-being (see, e.g. Kahneman, 1999). Frey and Stutzer (2002) therefore

conclude that “the existing research suggests that, for many purposes, happiness or reported

subjective well-being is a satisfactory empirical approximation to individual utility”

11
  Zeckhauser (1991), Solnick and Hemenway (1998) and Johansson-Stenman (2002) find evidence for positional
concerns by asking subjects to make choices over hypothetic scenarios with different levels of absolute and relative
income.


                                                         8
         To determine whether well-being depends partly on relative income concerns, one might

then estimate an equation of the form:12

(1)      self-reported well-being = f(own income, average income in locality, controls)

To make the discussion of the empirical strategy more concrete, a very basic linear OLS

regression with self-reported happiness (on a 1-7 scale) as the outcome variable yields a

coefficient of 0.20 (s.e. of 0.014) on log own household income and a coefficient of -0.20 (s.e. of

0.04) on log average per capita income in one’s locality (PUMA).13 This regression previews the

general findings of the more elaborate regressions presented in detail in the results section below.

Can this finding of a negative coefficient on average income in locality (and a positive one on

own income) be interpreted as evidence that utility is at least partly determined by relative

income? Or are there plausible alternative stories that could give rise to the same result even if

utility is purely a function of own income? Below, I discuss the three most serious threats to a

causal interpretation of the coefficient on average income in locality and consider ways of testing

them.

         The first alternative story is that the definition of happiness shifts: people answer the

question about their happiness in relative rather than absolute terms (Tversky and Griffin, 1991,

and Frederick and Loewenstein, 1999).14 In this case, self-reported happiness would be a proxy

for relative experienced well-being rather than absolute experienced well-being. Suppose, for

example, that each individual’s experienced well-being, Ui, is equal to her income, Yi, and that

individuals are asked whether they are happy or not. Individuals now face the task of translating


12
   I enter average income in locality separately in this specification rather than in form of the ratio of own income to
average income in locality. I do this because, in practice, I have a number of proxies for own income instead of a
single measure.
13
   For simplicity, no other controls are included in this illustrative regression. Standard errors are adjusted for
clustering at the PUMA level.
14
   King et al. (2004) explain how vignettes can be used to anchor the scale of subjective questions thereby making
the answers comparable across people. No such vignettes, however, were used in the NSFH.


                                                           9
experienced well-being into an answer to this question. If people respond that they are happy

whenever Ui exceeds some fixed (but possibly individual-specific) cutoff value, then they answer

the question in absolute terms. In this case, an increase of everyone’s income by the same factor

would increase the fraction of people answering they are happy. However, if people respond that

they are happy whenever their Ui exceeds some cutoff value that is a function of the population

distribution of Ui (such a the mean or median Ui), they are answering the question in relative

terms. In this case, an increase of everyone’s income by the same factor may not affect the

proportion of individuals answering that they are happy even though every individual’s

experienced utility is higher.15 I address this concern by using alternative indicators of well-

being that have a relatively objective definition, such as the frequency of financial worries or the

frequency of marital disagreements.

         The second alternative story is that the results are driven by unobserved local area

characteristics that are both correlated with average local income and self-reported happiness.

One might expect most of this type of omitted variable bias to go in the other direction; e.g., one

would expect higher income areas to have less crime, better local schools and other positive

amenities that raise happiness. The concern about local omitted variables driving the result is

addressed in three ways. First, if the results hold up after inclusion of state×time fixed effects,

they cannot be driven by unobservables that operate at that level, such as climate, state policies,

or regional shocks. Second, one may be concerned that local incomes just proxy for the local

price level. Thus, conditional on nominal income, an individual living in a high-income area

would face higher prices and thus have less real income, reducing happiness.16 However, if we


15
   This is also a potential explanation for the findings in a number of studies that levels of self-reported happiness or
life satisfaction remain remarkably constant in a country over time even as incomes rise. See, e.g. Easterlin (1974).
16
   Note however that if higher price levels reflect positive local amenities, they do not reduce real income; in effect,
the individual is purchasing the local amenity by locating in an expensive area. This means that only unobserved


                                                           10
control for real income instead, there is no longer a role for local area incomes to proxy for local

price levels, and any negative effect of local income on happiness cannot be explained by this

price level story. To control for real income, I include only those individual controls that do not

vary with local prices. This excludes nominal earnings and home value, but still includes

education, age, and average national earnings for someone in the same industry and occupation

as the respondent. Third, instead of using actual local income, I use a predicted measure of local

earnings. The predictor is based on the industry×occupation composition of the locality at one

point in time (1990) and national industry×occupation earnings trends (excluding data from

one’s own state).17 Thus, predicted local earnings vary across areas for two reasons: (i) the

industry×occupation mix at a point in time, which we can control for using area fixed effects,

and (ii) national earnings trends by industry and occupation, which we have no reason to believe

to be correlated with unobserved local shocks. This predictor therefore filters out any local

shocks (such as quality of local government) that may both affect local incomes and happiness. I

refer to this measure as LnPumaEarnings or more informally as neighbors’ earnings and use it as

the measure of local earnings throughout this paper unless otherwise noted. The use of predicted

local earnings, however, does not rule out that higher local earnings affect an unobserved local

variable, which in turn reduces happiness. Two obvious candidates for such unobserved

variables are quality of local schooling and changes to the housing market. If this is the case, we

expect to see different effects by homeownership and by presence of children in the household.




variation in local prices due to transportation cost or local production costs could possibly explain the findings.
Since we can control for state×time fixed effects, the transportation or production cost differences should be within
states to explain away the results. The scope for such variation is considerably less than the scope of transportation
and production cost differences in the nation as a whole.
17
   This predictor follows similar predictors used by Bartik (1991), Blanchard and Katz (1992), Bound and Holzer
(2000) and Autor and Duggan (2003). See appendix B for details on the construction of this predictor.


                                                          11
       The third story is that the results are driven by omitted individual characteristics that

influence both the decision where to live and self-reported happiness. In particular, selection of

individuals with unobservables that make them relatively happy (or relatively likely to report

being happy) into localities with relatively low incomes would also result in a negative

coefficient on average income in locality. Though one might expect that most selection would

go in the opposite direction (high income in one’s locality proxying for higher unobserved own

income), there could be selection effects that lead to a spurious negative effect of average

income in locality. For example, individuals receiving an inheritance may be relatively unhappy

(because of the unobserved death of a relative) but able to move to a relatively high-income

locality, or intrinsically happy people might be better able to deal with the rougher aspects of

low-income areas thus selecting to live there. This paper exploits the panel aspect of the NSFH

data to deal with this concern. If, after inclusion of individual fixed effects, average income in

the locality still matters, then we know that time-invariant unobserved individual characteristics

cannot be driving the results.

       To preserve statistical power, the baseline specification to test for relative income

concerns is a pooled cross-section OLS regression of the form:

(2)    Happinessipt = LnPumaEarningspt β1 + Xit β2 + wavet β3 + εipt

where i indexes individuals, p indexes PUMAs, and t indexes the wave of the survey. In the

baseline specification, Happiness is self-reported happiness (measured on a seven-point scale),

but other correlates of well-being are used in alternative specifications. LnPumaEarnings are

average predicted earnings in the PUMA of the respondent where the prediction is based on the

PUMA’s industry×occupation composition and national earnings trends. The vector Xit is a set

of individual-specific controls that include a number of proxies for income as well as basic




                                                 12
demographics. Finally, wavet is a dummy for the wave of the survey and εipt is an error term that

may be clustered within PUMAs. If individuals derive utility in part from relative position, we

would expect β1 to be negative.

         The baseline sample consists of individuals who are married or cohabitating in both

waves of the NSFH. I limit the sample to married or cohabiting individuals for two reasons.

First, for these observations, we also have information about spouses or interactions with one’s

spouse, which are useful in a number of further tests of the baseline results. Second, it turns out

that married individuals drive the baseline results, though neighbors’ earnings still have a

negative and significant effect on happiness in the full sample that includes non-married

individuals.

         Since most questions are asked of both the main respondent and his or her spouse, it

makes sense to also exploit the spousal information. Adding the spousal information as a

separate observation to the regression may bias standard errors downwards because the error

term of the respondent and the error term of his or her spouse are likely to be correlated.18

Instead, I average the values of the individual level variables for the main respondent and his or

her spouse, and enter those as a single observation in the regression. I thus do not exploit intra-

household level variation, but this does not matter since the main explanatory variables of

interest (neighbors’ earnings and own household income) do not vary within households.

         In the results section, I will present various modifications of this baseline regression to

investigate whether the baseline results are spurious, whether they are robust, and what

mechanisms drive them. These modifications will be explained in detail later and include adding

  I already cluster at the PUMA level (the level at which neighbors’ earnings vary), and therefore cannot easily
cluster at the household level at the same time.

variables, and interacting LnPumaEarnings with other variables.




3. Data



National Survey of Families and Households

        The data on subjective well-being as well as the individual-level control variables come

from the National Survey of Families and Households.19 The NSFH consists of a nationally

representative sample of individuals, age 19 or older (unless married or living in a household

with no one age 19 or older), living in households, and able to speak English or Spanish. The

first wave of interviews took place in 1987-88 and a second wave of interviews took place in

1992-94. Though the questionnaires are not identical in both waves, many questions were asked

twice making it possible to treat the data as a panel of about 10,000 individuals. What makes

this dataset particularly well-suited for this paper is that, in addition to being a panel with both

measures of well-being and extensive demographic information, it can be merged with detailed

geographic information. The respondents of the baseline sample live in 580 separate Public Use

Microdata Areas in the first wave, in 965 PUMAs in the second wave, while 555 PUMAs have

respondents living there in both waves (more about the definition of PUMAs later).

        The main outcome variable is self-reported happiness, which is the answer to the

question: “Next are some questions about how you see yourself and your life. First taking things

all together, how would you say things are these days?” Respondents answer on a seven-point

19
   The NSFH is a survey that was primarily designed for demographers interested in family and household issues.
More information on the NSFH can be found in Sweet, Bumpass and Call (1988), in Sweet and Bumpass (1996) or
at the NSFH website: http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/nsfh/home.htm

scale where 1 is defined as “very unhappy,” 7 is defined as “very happy” but intermediate values

are not explicitly defined. Other measures of well-being include the frequency of financial

worries, the frequency of open disagreements with one’s spouse on a number of topics, items

from Lenore Radloff’s (1977) depression scale, and, only in the second wave, self-reported

satisfaction with various aspects of one’s life. Detailed descriptions of these variables are

included in appendix A.

           The individual-level controls in the baseline specification consist of income proxies,

labor market variables, demographic characteristics and religious affiliation. The main income

variable is log household income while log value of the home and a dummy for being a renter

may also proxy for own income. Any missing values are dummied out as are logarithms of any

dollar amounts smaller than $100/year.20 The demographic controls consist of gender, a set of 4

race/ethnicity dummies, log household size, and a 3-segment spline in age (breakpoints at 35 and

60). Religious affiliation is controlled for by 12 dummy variables.



Census and Current Population Survey

           The smallest geographical area in the 1990 Census 5% Public Use Micro Sample

(PUMS) is the so-called Public Use Microdata Area. PUMAs consist of neighborhoods, towns

or counties aggregated up, or subdivided, until they contain at least 100,000 inhabitants. In

1990, there were 1726 PUMAs in the U.S. and the median and mean size of a PUMA was

respectively 127,000 and 144,000 inhabitants. The 1990 Census microdata are used to estimate

the 3-digit industry × 3-digit occupation composition of each PUMA, which is later used to

predict PUMA earnings. In addition, I use the Census to estimate average 1989 earnings for

each PUMA, which will serve as a check on the predictor.
20
     All $ amounts are in real 1982-84 dollars using the CPI-U.


                                                           15
       I use the Merged Outgoing Rotation Groups (MORG) from the Current Population

Survey (CPS) in the years 1987-88 and 1992-94 to estimate average earnings by 3-digit industry

× 3-digit occupation cell in each of the two time periods when NSFH interviews took place. For

each PUMA, I calculate these average national earnings by time-period×industry×occupation

cell excluding data from the state in which this PUMA lies.

       Predicted PUMA earnings for each wave are formed by applying average national

earnings by industry×occupation cell during that time period to each observation in the

corresponding industry×occupation cell in the PUMA. Details of this procedure are found in

appendix B. Appendix A gives summary statistics and precise definitions of all variables.




4. Results



Basic results

       Column 1 of Table 1 shows the baseline specification in full. This is a pooled cross-

section OLS regression of self-reported happiness on log predicted PUMA earnings and

individual controls. Individual level variables in this regression are averages of the main

respondent and his or her spouse. Standard errors are corrected for clustered error terms at the

PUMA level and the sample includes all NSFH respondents who are married or cohabiting in

both waves. The first row shows that, controlling for own income and other own characteristics,

predicted PUMA earnings have a significantly negative effect on self-reported happiness. In

other words, individuals with richer neighbors report being less happy. As expected, own

household income has a positive effect on happiness but its coefficient may be relatively small




                                                16
because the regression includes other proxies for income, such as the value of one’s home and a

dummy variable for renting.21 Usual working hours has an insignificant negative effect,

unemployment status has a large and significant negative effect while a dummy for being out of

the labor force has a significant positive effect on happiness.22 The other demographic controls

yield few surprising insights.

         Column 2 shows the same regression using only data from the main respondent rather

than averaging the respondent’s data with that of the spouse. This regression confirms that the

results are not sensitive to the averaging procedure used in the baseline regression though power

increases moderately when the data of the main respondent and the spouse are averaged.23

         The coefficient on own household income in the baseline regression is likely biased

downwards due to measurement error in income and the inclusion of other income proxies. In

specification 3, I try to get a more accurate estimate of the effect of own income by eliminating

two other income proxies (home value and the dummy for renter) and by instrumenting log

household income by the predicted household earnings, where the prediction based on the

industry×occupation information of the respondent and the spouse and national earnings

information (excluding the own state) by industry×occupation and time period from the CPS

MORG.24 Instrumenting results in an estimated effect of own household income on happiness

that is about three times as large as the estimate in the baseline specification. Moreover, the

estimate is now larger than the absolute value of the estimate of neighbors’ earnings, though this

difference is not statistically significant. The point estimates imply that if both own income and

21
   Ln Value of home has been demeaned. Hence, the dummy for renter is relative to a homeowner with a home of
average value.
22
   Ln Usual working hours has been demeaned. Hence, the dummies for unemployment and out of the labor force
are relative to an employed person working the average number of hours.
23
   I also stacked the data for the main respondent and the spouse, thus treating each as a separate observation in the
regression. This yields essentially the same coefficients but the standard errors are smaller than those of the baseline
regression.
24
   See appendix B for details on the construction of this predictor.


                                                          17
neighbors’ earnings rise by the same percentage, a person would feel better off, indicating one’s

absolute economic situation matters for happiness in addition to one’s relative position.



Could the results be spurious?

       Table 2 investigates whether selection or omitted area characteristics could be driving the

results. The first row of Table 2 replicates the baseline regression.

       The second row includes individual-specific fixed effects, thus controlling for all time-

invariant individual characteristics. The coefficient on neighbors’ earnings remains negative and

similar in magnitude though it is now only significant at the 10% level. This finding discounts

the possibility that the cross-section results are driven by selection of people who are happier by

nature into areas that are relatively poor. Of course, this specification does not rule out selection

based on unobserved time-variant characteristics. The third row shows a regression that is

identical to the baseline regression, except that a full set of state×wave fixed effects, a dummy

for living in a metropolitan area and log metropolitan population size are added as controls.

Both the coefficients on neighbors’ earnings and on own income change little and remain

statistically significant. Hence, the results are driven by variation in neighbors’ earnings within

states at each point in time. This specification thus rules out that the baseline results are spurious

due to unobserved variables that operate at the state level or above, such as a poorer (southern)

states having happier residents on average, for example because of unobserved better weather.

One might worry that movers have something unobserved happen to them and that perhaps this

unobserved factor causes the happiness to be inversely related to average neighbors’ earnings.

The fourth row tests this by showing the baseline regression excluding all respondents who




                                                 18
moved to a different PUMA. Again the coefficients on neighbors’ earnings and own income are

hardly affected, showing that the baseline results are not just driven by movers.

       The regression in the fifth line is identical to the one in the fourth row, except that it

includes individual fixed effects. Because the sample is limited to non-movers, the individual

fixed effects also serve as PUMA fixed effects (i.e., any PUMA fixed effects would be absorbed

by the individual fixed effects). Thus, the coefficient on neighbors’ income in this regression is

purely identified off of changes in neighbors’ earnings that are solely due to different national

trends in earnings in different industry×occupation cells. The individual fixed effects absorb any

time-invariant individual characteristics as well as any effect correlated with the

industry×occupation composition of each PUMA. Time-varying unobserved characteristics

cannot affect one’s neighbors’ earnings because the sample is limited to non-movers.

Unfortunately, the standard error in this specification is too large for this regression to provide

any evidence on selection.

       Could neighbors’ earnings proxy for local price levels? In this case, the negative

coefficient on neighbors’ earnings would simply reflect that happiness falls as real incomes fall.

Recall that neighbors’ earnings are measured by LnPumaEarnings, which is a predictor of local

earnings based on the local industry×occupation mix but national earnings data (excluding data

from one’s own state). Hence, local price variation would only be picked up by

LnPumaEarnings to the extent it is correlated with the local industry×occupation mix.

Moreover, we saw in row 3 that the estimates are robust to the inclusion of state×wave fixed

effects, implying that only local price variation within states at a point in time could possibly be

driving the results. Since migration within states is relatively easy, one would wonder what the

source of such price variation is. If higher prices merely reflect better local amenities (such as




                                                 19
better schools or less crime), one shouldn’t deflate incomes by local prices, because the higher

local prices simply imply that one substitutes amenities for physical goods. Thus, in that case,

higher local prices should not reduce well-being. On the other hand, if higher local prices reflect

transportation costs or higher local production cost, local wages would need to rise

proportionally to prevent an outflow of labor. In this case, individuals in an area with high local

prices would earn more but not be any better off than similar individuals in an area with low

local prices. Thus, if we don’t measure a respondent’s income by monetary variables (such as

household income, home value) but instead use proxies that don’t respond to local wage levels

(national earnings in the respondent’s industry ×occupation cell), then there would be no role for

LnPumaEarnings to serve as a control for local prices. Hence, the coefficient on

LnPumaEarnings should become insignificant if it were just spuriously picking up local price

variation. The sixth row of table 2 estimates the baseline regression purged of any controls that

proxy for the respondent’s nominal income. The coefficient on LnPumaEarnings drops in size

but remains negative and significant. This rules out that LnPumaEarnings is just picking up

variation in local price levels.

        Table 3 investigates the robustness of the baseline results. The first row again reproduces

the baseline regression. One might be concerned that the results are driven by the somewhat

complicated procedure used to predict LnPumaEarnings. The second row alleviates this

concern; if anything, the estimate on LnPumaEarnings becomes more negative and more

significant if we replace the predicted value by the actual value in 1989. Similarly, the third row

shows that using log PUMA income instead of earnings yields similar results. The fourth row

runs the baseline regression on all the observations in the balanced panel (rather than only the

ones married in both waves). The coefficient on neighbors’ earnings remains highly significant,




                                                20
but drops somewhat in magnitude, giving a first indication that the estimates are primarily driven

by the married subsample. This issue will be explored further in Table 7, discussed below.

Could neighbors’ earnings proxy for non-linearities in the effect of own income? This concern is

ruled out by the fifth row, which shows that the estimate on neighbors’ earnings hardly changes

after the inclusion of a 5th-order polynomial in log household income. Since the outcome

variable, self-reported happiness, is ordinal rather than cardinal, an OLS regression may not be

appropriate. Specification six estimates the baseline regression using an ordered Probit and finds

that the coefficient on neighbors’ earnings remains negative and highly significant. Moreover,

the ratio of the coefficient on neighbors’ earnings to the coefficient on own income remains

roughly constant.25 Finally, the seventh row shows that the results are insensitive to replacing

log own household income by the couple’s log total earnings.



Do neighbors’ earnings affect other outcomes?

         Could an increase in neighbors’ earnings merely change what individuals define as happy

rather than their true underlying well-being? This concern is hard to rule out definitively, but

using other outcome measures that may be less prone to shifts in definition yields some insights.

         The first specification in Table 4 uses a measure of financial worries as an alternative

outcome measure. If increases in neighbors’ earnings reduce happiness because one cannot

afford the goods that neighbors consume, one would expect respondents to have more financial

worries. Financial worries are measured by the question “How often do you worry that your

total family income will not be enough to meet your family’s expenses and bills?” I find that

respondents in areas with higher average earnings indeed have more financial worries after

25
  The coefficients in the ordered Probit turn out to be similar in magnitude to those in the baseline regression partly
because the root mean square error of the baseline regression is 1.06 and thus close to unity, to which the error term
in the latent model of the ordered Probit is normalized.


                                                          21
controlling for own income and other own characteristics. Because this question is less prone to

a definition shift in response to neighbors’ earnings, this finding alleviates the concern about a

shifting definition in the happiness question.

        One might also expect that a couple surrounded by neighbors earning more, would have

more disagreements about material issues as their aspirations might be shaped by spending

patterns of those around them (Stutzer, 2004). The regressions in specification 2 show that

higher neighbors’ earnings are significantly associated with more frequent disagreements about

money, marginally significantly associated with more frequent disagreements about household

tasks, but not significantly with the frequency of fights about the children, sex, in-laws or

spending time together. It may be less clear why neighbors’ earnings would be associated with

disagreements about household tasks, though one can make up plausible stories to explain this

finding.26 Because the questions about open disagreements seem less prone to a shift in

definition in response to neighbors’ earnings, this finding also offers suggestive evidence that the

estimated effect of neighbors’ earnings on self-reported happiness is not solely due to a shift in

the definition of happiness.

        The third specification in Table 4 considers a measure of depression, which is the sum of

the 12 items of the Radloff depression scale that are included in both waves of the survey. Since

many of the items have more of an absolute definition (e.g. “having a poor appetite,” “sleeping

restlessly”) or at least a definition for which it might be hard to use neighbors’ behavior as a

reference, the depression scale may be less prone to shifting definitions. On the other hand,

depression and well-being, though correlated, are two distinct concepts and it is very well

possible that increases in neighbors’ earnings reduce true well-being without increasing


26
  For example, financial stress could reduce the room for contracting out household tasks or buying appliances that
ease household chores, leading to more disagreements about household tasks.


                                                        22
depression. As the regression shows, neighbors’ earnings have no significant impact on the

depression index. Because the depression index is quite skewed, I also looked at the effect of

neighbors’ earnings on the probability of being in each part of the distribution of depression

index. As specification four shows, higher neighbors’ earnings significantly increase the

probability of being in the top four quintiles of the depression index but do not significantly

affect the probability of being in the top three, top two or top quintile of the depression index.

Thus, the effect of neighbors’ earnings seems to be limited to the bottom of the depression index

distribution (i.e., only those furthest removed from being depressed come somewhat closer to

being depressed). Overall, the findings with depression as an outcome variable only slightly

alleviate concerns about shifting definitions of happiness, though depression might be a

sufficiently different concept from well-being to pick up relative position effects.27

         Since a large literature examines the effect of relative position on health outcomes, the

fifth specification uses self-reported health status (relative to one’s age group) as an outcome

measure.28 I find no significant relation between average neighbors’ earnings and self-reported

health. This finding, of course, does not rule out that such a relationship might exist, but it does

not show up using my baseline specification.29



Mechanisms behind the association between neighbors’ earnings and happiness


27
   In their study of the randomized Moving to Opportunity experiment, Kling et al. (2004) find that individuals
moving to lower poverty census tracts report lower levels of psychological distress. Thus, for mental health
measures such as depression or psychological distress the benefits associated with richer areas (such as lower crime)
apparently outweigh any relative position effect.
28
   Self-reported health is measured by the question “Compared with other people your age, how would you describe
your health?” with possible answers being very poor, poor, fair, good and excellent. Since the question about health
explicitly asks respondents to compare themselves to other people of their age, this outcome cannot be used to
address any concerns about a shifting definition of happiness.
29
   Many papers on relative position and health use relative deprivation (the income gap with those earning more)
rather than average neighbors’ income to measure status. In addition, my sample might be too small or the measure
of self-reported health too noisy to pick up an effect.


                                                         23
        One can think of overall self-reported happiness as being driven by one’s satisfaction

with various domains of life, such as one’s family life, financial situation or friendships (Van

Praag, Frijters and Ferrer-i-Carbonell, 2003). Only in wave 2, the NSFH asks respondents to rate

their satisfaction with 11 such domains on a 7-point scale. Table 5 shows a regression of self-

reported happiness on these 11 measures of satisfaction (but no other controls) to give the reader

a sense of the relative importance of these satisfaction components for self-reported happiness.

According to this regression, the top three predictors of self-reported happiness are satisfaction

with family life, financial situation and sex life (in that order).

        Table 6 explores which mechanisms underlie the relationship between happiness and

neighbors’ earnings by adding satisfaction measures as additional control variables. If the

addition of a control variable reduces the magnitude of the coefficient on neighbors’ earnings,

some of the effect of neighbors’ earnings apparently runs through that control variable. The first

row of the table replicates the baseline regression for wave 2 because the satisfaction measures

are only available in wave 2. Specification 2 shows the effects of including satisfaction

measures as additional controls. None of the satisfaction measures alone can render the effect of

neighbors’ earnings insignificant, but the effect of neighbors’ earnings is reduced most strongly

if satisfaction with one’s home, financial situation or amount of leisure time is included as a

control. Simultaneously controlling for these three satisfaction measures makes the relationship

between neighbors’ earnings and happiness statistically and economically insignificant. Thus,

apparently, higher neighbors’ earnings reduce happiness for a large part through their effect on

satisfaction with one’s home, finances and leisure time. If neighbors’ consumption patterns

shape one’s aspirations, it is not surprising that higher neighbors’ earnings reduce one’s

satisfaction with one’s financial situation or one’s home. Perhaps less expected is that




                                                   24
satisfaction amount of leisure can account for part of the relationship between neighbors’

earnings and happiness, but higher neighbors’ earnings could reduce satisfaction with the amount

of leisure time because one might cut back on the purchase of certain services (cleaning, yard,

maintenance) in order to keep up with the neighbors in the consumption of more visible goods.

        Even if status influences happiness, one would not expect it to affect happiness with

aspects of life that are largely unaffected by comparisons with neighbors. Indeed, the remaining

eight questions on life satisfaction cannot account for much of the relationship between

neighbors’ earnings and happiness, even though they include important general predictors of

happiness such as satisfaction with family life and health (recall Table 5).30 Even controlling for

all eight simultaneously leaves the relationship between neighbors’ earnings and happiness

significant at the 5% level. Thus it seems that, by and large, neighbors’ earnings affect

happiness primarily through those components of happiness for which one would expect relative

earnings to matter most.



Interaction effects

        Table 7 investigates whether the relationship between neighbors’ earnings and happiness

operates across a range of demographic subgroups. Specification 1 shows that both females and

males report being less happy if earnings in their area rise. Specification 2 shows that the

happiness of individuals in various age ranges is negatively related to neighbors’ earnings. Even

though the coefficients on neighbors’ earnings are not statistically significantly different from

each other at the 10% level, the effect seems least strong for individuals aged 30 or younger,




30
  One might have expected satisfaction with present job to be influenced by neighbors’ earnings. Perhaps this
question measures job aspects (such as corporate culture) that are less subject to comparison with neighbors.


                                                        25
which may not be surprising because this group is probably less settled and therefore less

inclined to compare themselves to their current neighbors.

           Specification 3 finds that both those with more and with less education report lower

levels of happiness when surrounded by richer neighbors. For each educational group, the point

estimate is negative and the point estimates are not significantly different from each other at the

10 percent level. Specification 4 shows the relationship between local earnings and happiness

across groups based on marital status. Though the hypothesis that the coefficients on neighbors’

earnings are all equal to each other cannot be rejected at the 10% level, there seems to be little or

no effect of neighbors’ earnings on happiness for never-married individuals or those

experiencing marital status transitions. This is not surprising because these individuals are likely

to be less settled and thus less inclined to consider their neighbors as their reference group.

           Might neighbors’ earnings not matter by themselves but only affect people’s happiness

because they are correlated with the price of housing? In this case, we would expect to see a

differential effect between renters (who dislike increases in the price of housing) and

homeowners (most of whom like seeing the value of their home rise). Specification 5 shows that

this is not the case. Or might neighbors’ earnings somehow operate through the quality of

schooling (e.g. richer neighbors leaving the public school system)? In this case, we should see

different effects for those with and without children, which, as specification 6 shows, is not the

case. Finally, specification 7 finds that the effect of neighbors’ earnings seems to be somewhat

stronger for relatively new residents (less than 7 years) than for longer-term residents, but the

difference is not statistically significant.31

           To investigate which parts of the happiness distribution are affected by neighbors’

earnings, I create four dummy variables corresponding respectively to reporting a level of
31
     Looking at finer partitions of duration of residence did not reveal any interesting patterns.


                                                             26
happiness of at least 4, 5, 6 and 7.32 Regressions (not-reported) of these dummy variables on

neighbors’ earnings and the remaining controls of the baseline regression yield a significantly

negative coefficient on neighbors’ earnings in all four cases, showing that the effect of

neighbors’ earnings operates throughout the happiness distribution. In additional unreported

regressions, I also examine whether the relation between neighbors’ earnings and happiness

displays non-linearities but I find no evidence of such effects. The point estimates of neighbors’

earnings on self-reported happiness are similar and not significantly different for those above

mean earnings in their PUMA compared to those below. Other specifications show that the point

estimates on a quadratic term in neighbors’ earnings or the interaction between own household

income and neighbors’ earnings are both small and statistically insignificant.

         If the neighbors’ earnings reduce self-reported happiness because people engage in social

comparisons, we would expect a stronger effect for those with more contacts with their

neighbors. Table 8 investigates this hypothesis. The NSFH asks all main respondents about the

frequency of social interactions with neighbors, relatives, friends living outside the neighborhood

and people they work with. Each specification in Table 8 compares the effect of neighbors’

earnings for those who have infrequent social contacts (less than once a month) to those with

frequent social contacts with the type of person indicated, controlling for the direct effect of

social interactions.33 The table shows that the effect of neighbors’ earnings is significantly

stronger for those who socialize frequently with neighbors but not for those who socialize more

frequently with relatives, friends outside the neighborhood or people they work with. These




32
   I don’t partition the happiness distribution at 3 and 2 because only 3.5% and 1.0% of the observations respectively
report levels of happiness lower than these values.
33
   The direct effect is positive in all cases but only significant for socializing with neighbors or relatives. Of course,
the direct effect should not be interpreted causally.


                                                           27
findings are consistent with what one would expect if social comparisons with neighbors partly

determine people’s happiness.

        Table 9 explores whether individuals predominantly compare themselves with neighbors

who have a similar level of education. For each PUMA, I constructed predicted earnings for

PUMA residents with a college degree and for those without.34 Specification 1 shows the

regression of self-reported happiness on the interaction of these two measures of local earnings

with own educational attainment. The regression also includes all the controls of the baseline

regression. Though standard errors are large, the point estimates indicate that the happiness of

those without a college degree declines with the earnings of neighbors without a college degree

but is insensitive to the earnings of neighbors with a college degree. Similarly, the happiness of

those with a college degree declines with the earnings of neighbors with a college degree but is

relatively insensitive to the earnings of neighbors without one. Moreover, for both those with

and without a college degree, the point estimates on the earnings of one’s own education group

are similar (the diagonal coefficients are -0.28 and -0.40) as are the point estimates on the

earnings of the other group (the off-diagonal coefficients are 0.02 and -0.07). In specification 2,

I restrict the diagonal coefficients to be the same and the off-diagonal coefficients to be the same.

Now there is a marginally significant relationship between happiness and earnings of neighbors

with the same level of education but not between happiness and earnings of neighbors with a

different level of education, though the test of equality of all coefficients is not rejected at the

10% level. Though the results in table 9 should be treated with caution because of low statistical

power, they are suggestive of respondents comparing themselves mostly with neighbors who are

similar in terms of educational attainment.

  This measure is constructed the same way as the predicted Ln PUMA earnings measure used in the baseline
regression, except that everything is done separately by level of education.

5. Conclusion

       This paper shows that individuals’ self-reported happiness is negatively affected by the

earnings of others in their area. By looking at alternative outcome measures, such as frequency

of financial worries, I provide evidence that this finding is not simply an artifact of the way

people report happiness. I investigate the concern that the finding could be driven by omitted

variables, but find no evidence of selection in a number of specification tests. Though the

mechanism by which increases in neighbors’ earnings reduce happiness is hard to identify

precisely, I provide suggestive evidence that interpersonal preferences are likely to be

responsible for them. Increased neighbors’ earnings by and large reduce satisfaction with

material (rather than immaterial) aspects of one’s life and have the strongest negative effect on

happiness for those who socialize more in their neighborhood. I therefore conclude that the

negative effect of neighbors’ earnings on well-being is real and that it is most likely caused by a

psychological externality, i.e. people having utility functions that depend on relative

consumption in addition to absolute consumption.

       The size of the effect is economically meaningful. An increase in neighbors’ earnings

and a similarly sized decrease in own income each have roughly about the same negative effect

on well-being. This suggests that an increase in own income leads to a negative externality on

neighbors’ well-being that is of the same order of magnitude as the positive effects on own well-

being. Unless one chooses to disallow these negative externalities on the ground that they appear

to stem from an interpersonal preference component that is morally questionable, externalities of

this size can in principle substantially affect the optimal policies dealing with income taxation,

consumption taxation and residential sorting.

Appendix A: Variable Definitions and Summary Statistics

The baseline sample consists of individuals who are married or cohabitating in both waves of the
NSFH and have non-missing information on own household income. Unless otherwise noted,
the variables in the baseline sample consist of the average of the non-missing values of that
variable for the main respondent and his or her spouse. All dollar amounts are converted to
1982-84 real dollars using the CPI-U from Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Radloff)                         a list of the ways you might have felt or behaved during the past week. On how
                                 many days during the past week did you: [Feel bothered by things that usually don't
                                 bother you?; Not feel like eating; your appetite was poor?; Feel that you could not
                                 shake off the blues, even with help from your family or friends?; Have trouble
                                 keeping your mind on what you were doing?; Feel depressed?; Feel that everything
                                 you did was an effort?; Feel fearful?; Sleep restlessly?; Talk less than usual?; Feel
                                 lonely?; Feel sad?; Feel you could not get going?] (number of days).” The answer
                                 to each question is the number of days (0-7) on which the condition applied. The
                                 depression index is the sum of the answers to these 12 questions. This variable is
                                 only based on the responses by the main respondent because the depression items
                                 were not asked of the spouse in the first wave.

Appendix B: Construction of Predictor for PUMA- and Industry×Occupation Earnings

       This appendix provides a detailed description of the construction of both the PUMA-level
earnings predictor and the predictor of average earnings at the industry×occupation level. The
construction of these predictors is described in seven steps.

Step 1: Creation of a common set of industry×occupation codes
        The industry and occupation codes in the first wave of the NSFH as well as in the 1987
and 1988 CPS MORG files are 3-digit 1980 Census codes, while 3-digit 1990 Census codes were
used in the second NSFH wave, the 1992-1994 CPS MORG files and (obviously) the 1990
Census PUMS. I create a crosswalk to make these two sets of codes compatible. In general, the
1980 and 1990 Census industry and occupation classification is very similar. In a few cases, I
need to merge several 3-digit occupations or industries together in order to make the codes
comparable. I exclude the active-duty military. The crosswalk transforms 231 industry codes
from the 1980 Census and 236 industry codes from the 1990 Census into a set of 225 unique and
comparable industry codes. Similarly, it transforms 503 occupation codes from the 1980 Census
and 501 occupation codes from the 1990 Census into a set of 496 unique and comparable
occupation codes.

Step 2: Calculation of average industry×occupation×time-period earnings from CPS MORG:
        I use the NBER CPS labor abstracts to obtain usual weekly earnings (“earnwke”) by
industry×occupation for the years 1987-88 and 1992-94 for all employees (self-employed
individuals are excluded because their earnings data is often unreliable). To ensure compatibility
over time, all earnings are deflated by the 1982-84 CPI-U, all topcoded earnings are replaced by
twice the value of the topcode35, and the sum of weights is made identical across years. Step 2
yields two variables: LnEarn1, average log annual earnings by industry×occupation cell in 1987-
1988, and LnEarn2, average log annual earnings by industry×occupation cell in 1992-1994.
These variables differ by state because data from the own state is excluded in calculating the
average.

Step 3: Prediction of average earnings by industry×occupation×time-period cell
        Because many industry×occupation cells have very few observations or are empty in the
CPS data but are non-empty in the NSFH or Census PUMS, I use a linear regression to predict
earnings in each industry×occupation cell in each time period. I regress LnEarn1 on a full set of
3-digit industry dummies and a full set of 3-digit occupation dummies where each
industry×occupation cell is weighted by the weighted number of observation in that cell in the
MORG. I run this regression separately for each state (because of the exclusion of the own state
information). On average, these regressions have about 20,000 observations. The regressions
yield the earnings predictor LnEarnPred1. Similar regressions for wave 2 yield the earnings
predictor LnEarnPred2.

Step 4: Taking a weighted average between actual and predicted earnings
        The benefit of the predictor described in step 3 is that it yields predicted earnings for
industry×occupation×time-period cells that are empty in the CPS MORG and that it increases the

35
   This is the expectation of a topcoded earnings variable if the tail of the earnings distribution follows a Pareto
distribution with a parameter of 2, which seems to be the case empirically (Saez, 2001).


                                                           38
precision of the earnings estimate for industry×occupation×time-period cells with very few
observations (in wave 1 (2), 75% of the industry×occupation cells have 8 (9) or fewer
observations in them). However, by not allowing industry×occupation interactions, the
regression may not be the best predictor of earnings for cells with a large number of
observations. To balance these two concerns, I take a weighted average, LnEarnHatt, between
predicted earnings and actual earnings, where the weight depends on n, the number of
observations in that cell. Specifically, for wave 1:

              n1eff                  n 
LnEarnHat1 =  eff    LnEarnPred 1 +  eff    LnEarn1
              n1 +n                  n1 +n 

and similarly for wave 2. The parameter, nteff or the relative weight on predicted earnings is
estimated by a non-linear least squares regression of log average earnings from the PUMS on the
left hand side of the equation above, where industry×occupation cells are weighted by the
weighted number of observations in them in the PUMS. This yields neff of 22.9 and 25.1 for
wave 1 and wave 2 respectively. The R2 of these regressions are 0.74 and 73 respectively. The
variable LnEarnHatt is merged to the NSFH data (based on the wave of the survey and the
respondent’s industry, occupation and state) and is the instrument for own household income
used in specification 3 of table 1.

Step 6: Prediction of PUMA-level earnings
        Using data from the 1990 Census 5% PUMS, I assign to each non-institutionalized
person aged 16-65 the level of the predicted earnings, exp(LnEarnHat), based on that person’s
industry, occupation and state. I do this both for predicted earnings in 1987-88 and in 1992-94.
Next, I calculate the average predicted level of earnings for each PUMA for each time period.
The log of the average predicted level of earnings for each time period and PUMA is the variable
LnPumaPred.

Step 7: Rescaling of LnPumaPredt
        To test the predictive power of LnPumaPredt, I regress both LnPumaPred1 and
LnPumaPred2 on log actual PUMA-level earnings in 1989 (from the 1990 Census) for the
sample of 1315 PUMAs that occur in the NSFH data.36 Though both regressions have a high R2
(0.846 and 0.861 respectively), the coefficient on log actual 1989 PUMA level earnings is only
around a half. Thus, while the predictor apparently does a good job ranking PUMAs by
earnings, it underestimates earnings differences. To correct for this underprediction, I multiply
each predictor by 2.19. After this rescaling, a regression of the average of LnPumaPred1 and
LnPumaPred2 on log actual PUMA-level earnings in 1989 yields a coefficient of exactly one.
This rescaling reduces the coefficient on PUMA-level earnings as an independent variable by a
factor of about two but it of course does not affect the statistical significance of any of the results
in the paper. In the rest of the paper, I refer to the rescaled predictor of PUMA-level earnings as
Ln Puma Earnings (predicted) or, when there is no risk of confusion, Ln Puma Earnings for
short.

  Some of these PUMAs do not contain NFSH main respondents but only secondary NSFH respondents (such as
ex-spouses). Hence, there are more PUMAs in this sample than in the baseline sample described in the data section.


                                                       39
Validation using NSFH data
        As a check on both the PUMA-level and industry×occupation-level predictors of
earnings, I regress log earnings of NSFH respondents (with earnings of at least $100/year) on
these predictors. The first row shows that the predictor of PUMA level earnings is highly
significant, has a coefficient of about 0.75 and explains about 3.5% of the individual-level
earnings variation. The second row shows that results are similar if we use the log of average
actual earnings in the PUMA of the respondent in 1989. This shows that the use of predicted
rather than actual earnings does not entail a huge loss of predictive power. The third, fourth and
fifth row show that the results are similar for each wave and hold up if state fixed effects are
included.
        Rows (6) through (10), repeat these checks for the measure of industry × occupation
earnings constructed in step 5 above. This measure is highly significant and has a coefficient
reasonably close to one in all cases. Row (7) shows that results remain similar if we instead use
log average earnings in 1989 by industry×occupation cell from the 1990 Census. This confirms
that results are not driven by any peculiarities of my procedure of creating the measure for
industry×occupation earnings.

Robust standard errors are adjusted for clustering at the PUMA level. All regressions include the same controls as the baseline regression
reported in table 1, column 1. The terms in the polynomial in specification 5 are demeaned. Hence, the coefficient on the first term (reported in
the table) is the slope of Ln household income for someone with mean Ln household income. The regression in specification (4) also included 4
marital status dummies as controls.

Robust standard errors are adjusted for clustering at the PUMA level. All regressions include the same controls as the baseline regression
reported in table 1, column 1 except for the regressions in specification 2, which also control for self-reported quality of relationship with spouse.
The variable Financial worries exists only in wave 2 and is the answer to the question “How often do you worry that your total family income
will not be enough to meet your family's expenses and bills?” where 1 corresponds to “never” and 5 to “almost all the time.” The frequency of
open disagreements is measured on a scale of 1 (“never”) to 6 (“almost every day”). The depression index is the sum of the 12 Radloff items that
appear in both waves of the NSFH. Each item is the number of days in the past week that the respondent felt or experienced a symptom related to
depression. Examples of such symptoms are “sleeping restlessly,” “talking less than usual,” and “feeling sad.” Self-reported health status is the
answer to the question “Compared with other people your age, how would you describe your health?”, where 1 corresponds to “very poor” and 5
to “excellent.” Specifications 3 and 4 only use data from the main respondent because the depression questions were only asked of the main
respondent in all waves.

Robust standard errors are adjusted for clustering at the PUMA level. Not reported but included in the regression are dummies variables for
missing values of the satisfaction questions. The satisfaction variables are answers to the question; “Overall, how satisfied are you with... X,”
where X is “your family life,” “your financial situation,” etc. The answers are recorded on a 7-point scale with 1 corresponding to “very
dissatisfied” and 7 corresponding to “very satisfied”.

Robust standard errors are adjusted for clustering at the PUMA level. Each specification is a single OLS regression in which Ln PUMA earnings
and Ln household income are interacted with an exhaustive set of dummies. All regressions also include as controls the uninteracted set of
dummy variables as well as the same controls as the baseline regression reported in table 1, column 1. Except for specification (4), the baseline
sample consisting of individuals married or cohabiting in both waves is used. In specification (1) only information from the main respondent is
used (because there is virtually no variation in the average gender of couples). In specification (4), no interactions with PUMA earnings or own
household income are included for 2 observations with missing marital status transitions. The hypothesis that the coefficients on Ln PUMA
earnings are all equal to each other cannot be rejected at a significance level of 0.10 or lower for any of the specifications. The number of
observations in each category is denoted between square brackets.

often they “spend a social evening” with various types of people while in wave 2 they were asked how often they “get together socially” with
these types of people. The number of observations in each category is denoted between square brackets. Frequency of social contacts is the
frequency of social contacts of the main respondent because this variable was not collected of spouses in both waves.
