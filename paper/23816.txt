Is There Still Son Preference in the United States?

                                             ABSTRACT

In this paper, we use 2008-2013 American Community Survey data to update and further probe
evidence on son preference in the United States. In light of the substantial increase in immigration,
we examine this question separately for natives and immigrants. Dahl and Moretti (2008) found
earlier evidence consistent with son preference in that having a female first child raised fertility
and increased the probability that the family was living without a father. We find that for our more
recent period, having a female first child still raises the likelihood of living without a father, but is
instead associated with lower fertility, particularly for natives. Thus, by the 2008-2013 period, any
apparent son preference in fertility decisions appears to have been outweighed by factors such as
cost concerns in raising girls or increased female bargaining power. In contrast, some evidence for
son preference in fertility persists among immigrants. Immigrant families that have a female first
child have significantly higher fertility and are more likely to be living without a father (though
not significantly so). Further, gender inequity in source countries is associated with son preference
in fertility among immigrants. For both first and second generation immigrants, the impact of a
female first-born on fertility is more pronounced for immigrants from source countries with less
gender equity. Finally, we find no evidence of sex selection for the general population of natives
and immigrants, suggesting that it does not provide an alternative mechanism to account for the
disappearance of a positive fertility effect for natives.

I.      Introduction

        Economists have long been interested in studying the unequal treatment of women and

men in families. These inequities may even manifest early in the life cycle as a son preference.

Specifically, a child’s gender has been shown to impact family structure and future fertility, sex-

selective abortion, and sex differences in parental time inputs, as well as access to health care

and nutrition. 1 Some of the strongest evidence of son preference comes from developing

countries. Sen (1990), for example, inferred that there were millions of “missing women” in

China and India, due largely to neglect in health care and nutrition. With the advancement and

increased availability of “safe, effective, inexpensive and accessible technologies to determine

the sex of a fetus and to abort unwanted pregnancies,” sex selective abortion came to play a

major role in unbalanced gender ratios, with (male/female) sex ratios at birth rising in a number

of countries, mostly in Asia (Bongaarts 2013, p. 185). 2 Moreover, as Anderson and Ray (2010)

note, unequal survival rates from specific diseases such as AIDS can also create sex imbalances

in the population. Beyond leading to lower female birth or survival rates, the unequal treatment

of women and men also potentially affects gender inequality in the family and in society.

        Studies by sociologists and psychologists, but more recently by economists as well, have

also found evidence of differences in the behavior of parents of sons and daughters even in

developed countries. In a comprehensive review, Lundberg (2005) points to two fairly robust

findings: sons increase family stability and, overall, fathers tend to spend more time with sons

than daughters; however, recent research by Baker and Milligan (2016) finds that parents of

(2009), Almond, Edlund and Milligan (2013), and Lundberg (2005).

  See, for example, Sen (2003) on India and Ebenstein (2010) on China. More recently, (male/female) sex ratios at
birth in Korea, which used to also be extremely high, have declined to natural biological levels along with other
indicators of son preference (Choi and Hwang, forthcoming).

                                                        1
preschoolers invest more time in girls than boys in teaching activities (e.g., reading to children).

While differences may be identified, as Lundberg (2005) notes, it is unclear whether they reflect

son preference or constraints, like differences in the productivity of fathers and mothers in

parenting sons vs. daughters or differences in costs of boys vs. girls. In a landmark study for the

United States, Dahl and Moretti (2008) found evidence consistent with son preference. They

estimate that having a female first child increased the probability of living without a father and

also raised fertility. However, the evidence on fertility in the United States and other developed

countries is somewhat mixed, with several studies finding evidence of a negative effect of girls

on fertility for some countries including the U.S. (Abrevaya 2009; Ichino, Lindström, and

Viviano 2014; Andersson, Hank, Ronsen and Vikat 2011).

           In this paper, we revisit the question of son preference, adding to the literature in several

ways. First, we use 2008-2013 American Community Survey (ACS) data to update and further

probe Dahl and Moretti’s (2008) son preference results for heterogeneity by immigrant status.

Updating is important because their analysis of family structure used data from 1960-2000, and,

more significantly, their results for fertility were for the 1960-80 period. Like Dahl and Moretti

(2008), we exploit the apparent randomness of the gender of the first child to address the

endogeneity of family structure and fertility to child gender. 3 Moreover, we address the mixed

evidence from other studies by more closely following the Dahl and Moretti (2008) research

design and explicitly exploring the impact of any departures. Further, in light of the increase in

immigration and research showing that more recent immigrant waves tend to come from

countries with a more traditional gender division of labor than in the United States (Blau, Kahn

and Papps 2011), it is desirable to analyze immigrants and natives separately.



3
    Below, we discuss in detail whether one can in fact make such an assumption about the sex of the first child.

                                                            2
       Among the population in the aggregate, as well as among the native-born separately, we

find that having a female first child continues to raise the likelihood of living without a father.

However, in contrast to Dahl and Moretti’s (2008) earlier findings, we find that for the overall

population, as well as among natives separately, having a female first child is now associated

with lower fertility, significantly so for natives. Thus, for the U.S., by the 2008-2013 period, son

preference among natives in their fertility decisions appears to have been reversed or outweighed

by factors such as a higher cost of raising girls or increased female bargaining power.

       Considering immigrants separately, we find some evidence that having a female first

child contributes to the incidence of living without a father, although the impact is statistically

insignificant. However, in contrast to our findings for natives, we do find a positive effect of a

female first child on fertility, suggesting son preference in fertility among immigrants. This

interpretation is further supported by evidence that, for both first and second generation

immigrants—immigrants and their native-born children—having a girl has a more positive effect

on fertility for those from source countries with less gender equity, as measured by the World

Economic Forum’s (WEF) Global Gender Gap Index and other indicators. (The second

generation was examined using the 1995-2014 Current Population Surveys, which have

information on the birthplaces of respondents’ parents.)

       We also examine another indicator of son preference, sex selection, by estimating the

impact of the sex composition of previous children on the probability that a given birth is a boy.

We find no evidence that sex selection characterizes the aggregate native and immigrant

populations, although previous work indicates it occurs for some groups (e.g., Almond and

Edlund 2008; Abrevaya 2006). This suggests that an increase in sex selection among natives as

an alternative manifestation of son preference is not driving our fertility findings.



                                                  3
II.     Literature Review and Our Contribution

        As noted above, Dahl and Moretti (2008) made a major contribution in finding evidence

of son preference in the United States. Specifically, using data for the 1960-2000 period, they

found that first-born girls were less likely to be living with their father than first-born boys.

While such a result is consistent with fathers’ preference for sons, there are other possible

explanations. One is that raising girls is more expensive than raising boys, making fathers more

reluctant to shoulder this burden (e.g. Lundberg 2005; Dahl and Moretti 2008). We note that this

possibility is especially plausible in more recent decades given girls’ greater propensity to attend

college than boys’ beginning in the 1980s (Goldin, Katz and Kuziemko 2006), and we will

present some direct evidence on the relative expense of raising girls that is consistent with the

cost argument. Another possibility is that parents believe the lack of a male role model is more

harmful for boys than girls or that fathers have a comparative advantage in raising sons (e.g.

Lundberg 2005; Dahl and Moretti 2008). This is consistent with recent empirical evidence

suggesting the negative effects of growing up with economic disadvantage, and particularly in a

single-mother family, are more harmful for boys than girls. For example, Autor, Figlio,

Karbownik, Roth, and Wasserman (2019) find larger negative effects for boys than for girls on a

number of education-related outcomes of being born to low-educated, unmarried mothers and

raised in disadvantaged neighborhoods. 4 And, as another example, Bertrand and Pan (2013) find

that being raised in a single-mother household has major negative consequences for boys’

noncognitive development but much less so for girls.




4
 These outcomes include being kindergarten-ready, incidence of truancy and behavioral problems in elementary and
middle school, performance on standardized tests, and high school graduation.

                                                       4
        In order to distinguish between a preference for sons from these other explanations for

the effect of girls on family structure, Dahl and Moretti (2008) examine the impact of a female

first child on a couple’s subsequent fertility. While son preference implies that the probability of

having additional children should be higher for all-girl than for all-boy families, the alternatives

discussed above suggest, if anything, it should be lower. If girls are more costly (e.g., due to

education expenses), the probability of having an additional child for all girl families should be

lower than for all boy families. Similarly, if fathers have a comparative advantage in raising

boys, this would also make girls more expensive to bring up and lower the probability of having

additional children.

        Using Census data for 1960-80, Dahl and Moretti (2008) find that the effect on fertility of

having a female first child is positive, supporting an interpretation that their finding for family

structure reflects son preference. We are able to substantially update Dahl and Moretti’s (2008)

fertility analysis because our 2008-2013 ACS data contain crucial information on marital history

that they argue is needed for the fertility analysis and has been otherwise unavailable in Census

data since 1980: whether the respondent had been married more than once. As explained below,

it may be argued that using a sample of women in first marriages provides the cleanest test of son

preference in fertility.

        As we mentioned, evidence on the impact of girls on fertility is mixed, with a number of

studies finding a negative effect for the United States and other developed countries, unlike Dahl

and Moretti (2008). Abrevaya (2009) found, for whites in the U.S., that families whose first

child is a boy are significantly more likely to have a second child than a family whose first child

is a girl. Moreover, Ichino, Lindström, and Viviano (2014) found for the U.S., UK, Italy and

Sweden that a first child boy increased the probability that a woman would have more children.



                                                  5
In addition, Andersson, Hank, Ronsen and Vikat (2011) found for Denmark, Norway and

Sweden (but not Finland), fertility effects consistent with daughter preference for third births,

with no effect of child gender on second births. These results are not directly comparable to

Dahl and Moretti’s (2008), however, due to differences in the empirical designs. Specifically,

unlike Dahl and Moretti, the samples used were not restricted to married women. Indeed, Ichino

et al (2014) show they are able to replicate Dahl and Moretti’s finding of a negative effect of first

child boy (implying a positive effect of first child girl) on fertility when they restrict the sample

to married couples. 5

        Ichino, Lindström, and Viviano (2014) add an additional outcome variable to consider

when examining son preference. Specifically, using a sample of all women, they study the

impact of a male first child on the mother’s labor supply, finding a negative effect. They offer

two reasons for such an impact. First, a boy first child raises the probability of being married,

which lowers the mother’s labor supply; second, within marriages, a boy first child raises

fertility, which also lowers the mother’s labor supply.

        Another strand of research on son preference examines North Americans with a heritage

from countries that have been known to practice sex-selective abortion, an extreme form of son

preference: China, Korea, and India. For example, Almond and Edlund (2008), using 2000 U.S.

Census data, found evidence consistent with sex selection increasing the male/female sex ratio at

the birth of the third child for Chinese, Asian Indian, or Korean women. Similar findings for

Chinese and Asian Indian mothers have been found by Abrevaya (2009), who used California

birth record data. Almond, Edlund and Milligan (2013), using Canadian Census data, found a

similar result for first and second generation South and East Asian immigrants. Moreover,


5
  In an additional difference in design, Andersson, Hank, Ronsen and Vikat (2006) use the gender composition of
the first two children as explanatory variables for the third birth, rather than sex of the first child.

                                                        6
Abrevaya (2009) finds a positive relationship between having girls and subsequent fertility for

U.S. immigrants from these areas, as did Almond, Edlund and Milligan (2013) for Canada. The

finding of son preference in influencing family gender composition has been recently questioned

by Persaud, Kalantry, Citro and Nandi (2015), using more recent U.S. data, who found some

evidence in favor of a preference for diversity rather than for son preference among these groups.

        In this paper, we add important new findings to the literature on son preference that cast

doubt on its continued prevalence among the native born in the United States. In particular, our

finding that there is no longer a positive effect on the future fertility of a first child girl is

significant because it raises a question about whether the findings on living without a father are

due to son preference or one of the alternative interpretations discussed above. In obtaining our

results we either adhere to the Dahl and Moretti (2008) research design or track the impact of

any departures, ensuring that we are able to reach conclusions about trends over time in the

impact of child gender on family structure and fertility in the U.S. based on comparable data.

Further, while maternal labor force participation is not a major focus of our paper, in light of the

findings of Ichino, Lindström, and Viviano (2014), we examine it briefly.

        Given the growth in the immigrant share of the population and the tendency of

immigrants to come from countries with a more traditional gender division of labor (Blau, Kahn

and Papps 2011), we present results analyzing immigrants and natives separately. This

investigation is also motivated by recent research highlighting the role of culture in affecting

gender-related outcomes such as fertility and labor supply. 6 Specifically, we compare results for

living without a father and fertility among first or second generation immigrants whose source

  See, for example, Fernandez and Fogli (2006, 2009), Blau (1992), Antecol (2000), Blau, Kahn and Papps (2011),
Blau, Kahn, Liu and Papps (2013), and Blau and Kahn (2015) for studies of the impact of culture on female labor
supply and fertility behavior among first and second generation immigrants. See also Nollenberger, Rodríguez-
Planas, and Sevilla (2016) for an impact on the gender math gap.

                                                       7
countries differ with respect to the WEF’s Global Gender Gap Index or alternative indicators of

female status including female labor force participation rates and (boy-to-girl) sex ratios among

births. These comparisons in effect provide an estimate of the impact of different “doses” of son

preference as indicated by measures of gender equity differences across source countries.

        Finally, while alternative manifestations of son preference may be viewed as

complementary pieces of information in establishing son preference, it is also possible that they

are to some extent substitutes. For example, if sex selection has become more prevalent

throughout the general population, it might help to account for the decline we observe in son

preference in fertility. Thus, we briefly examine the impact of the sex composition of previous

children on the probability that a given birth is a boy. As noted previously, we find no evidence

that sex selection has come to characterize the general population of natives and immigrants.

This rules out the possibility that an increase in sex selection among natives could account for

our fertility findings for this group.



III.    Data and Research Design

        Our central goal is to study the incidence of living without a father and fertility in order

to make inferences about son preference in the contemporary United States. Following Dahl and

Moretti (2008), our key explanatory variable for studying son preference is the gender of the first

child, which, in the absence of sex selective abortion, is expected to be roughly random. 7 In

contrast, if child gender influences family structure (Dahl and Moretti 2008) or if there are son-

biased fertility stopping rules (Choi and Hwang forthcoming), the gender composition of



7
 Others who employ this specification for similar reasons include, for example, Ichino, Lindstrom, and Viviano
(2014) and Choi and Hwang (forthcoming). We present evidence on randomness below where we consider the
possibility that maternal condition could affect the gender of the first child.

                                                        8
subsequent births will be endogenous, potentially biasing the estimate of child gender on family

structure and fertility. To see this assume that, given son preference, a first born girl is expected

to increase the probability that the mother is unpartnered (due to an unwed birth or divorce) and

that single parenthood is likely associated with lower fertility. If this is the case, if we condition

on, say, the sex of the first two children in studying the probability of living without a father, we

would be missing some of the effect of the first child sex on family breakup, which would have

lowered the probability of having a second child. Moreover, for both living without a father and

for fertility (even if it is restricted to married couples), conditioning on the sex of say the first

two children would produce a self-selected sample with respect to the strength of parents’

preferences for boys and for family size; that is, sex-biased stopping rules would lead to biased

comparisons between, say, families with two boys vs. two girls (Choi and Hwang forthcoming).

          We use American Community Survey (ACS) data for 2008-2013 to study the behavior of

the full population and of natives and immigrants separately. And, since information on parental

birthplace is not available in the ACS, we use the March Current Population Survey (CPS) data

for 1995-2014 to study the immigrant second generation (native-born individuals with at least

one foreign born parent). We use a wider time window for the CPS to increase sample size. 8

          We begin by estimating equation (1):

    (1)      𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾 ′ 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + ϕ𝑡𝑡 + θ𝑟𝑟(𝑖𝑖) + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

where for each woman i in year t, 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is an outcome variable including a binary for living

without a father and indicators of fertility (the number of children and, in some specifications, a

binary for having n or more children, n = 2, 3, or 4); 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a binary equal to one if the firstborn




8
 Information on parental birthplace became available in the CPS starting in 1994. We begin our analysis of the
CPS with the March 1995 wave because the 1994 survey had insufficient detail on parents’ birthplaces.

                                                                    9
child is female, 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a vector of controls (including an intercept), ϕ𝑡𝑡 and θ𝑟𝑟(𝑖𝑖) are respectively

year and region (based on 9 Census categories) fixed effects, and 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a disturbance term.

        The vector 𝑋𝑋 includes a cubic in respondents’ age, respondents’ education (based on <

HS, HS only, Some College and College Degree), and race/ethnicity (based on non-Hispanic

White, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic Asian, non-Hispanic Other, and Hispanic). For

analyses estimated on married samples, analogous spouse education, race/ethnicity and age

variables are also included. Standard errors are heteroskedasticity robust and regressions are

weighted by adjusting the ACS sampling weights so that each sample year of data contributes

equally to the estimation.

        When we study fertility, we focus on married couples. As mentioned above, having a

first child girl raises the probability of single parenthood or living without a father, which likely

lowers fertility. Thus, using a sample that includes nonmarried as well as married individuals

would combine the direct effect of son preference on desired fertility and the negative indirect

effect of son preference on fertility via its impact on single parenthood. Even if couples do have

a preference for sons, if the first child is a girl, the couple is less likely to form or sustain a

marriage, reducing the opportunity for the effect of son preference on fertility to be observed in

realized fertility. Thus, studying fertility among married individuals is likely to give a more

accurate assessment of desired fertility than including nonmarried women. The inclusion of the

indirect effect of first child girl on fertility through its effect on single parenthood is also of

concern because we seek evidence on the impact of son preference on fertility to aid in the

interpretation of the single parenthood effect as a manifestation of son preference or as due to

other factors. Moreover, since women who have been previously married and divorced would

have spent some of their time unpartnered, following Dahl and Moretti (2008), in some


                                                    10
additional specifications, we capitalize on the marital history information in the ACS to restrict

the sample to women in their first marriage who are married to men also in their first marriage. 9

However, given that even a first marriage may be endogenous to the birth or expected birth of a

girl, in our main specifications, we also estimate our fertility models on a sample of all women.

Using a sample of all women likely results in an underestimate of the effect of a female first

child on fertility preferences due to son preference. This is the case because, again, this estimate

combines the direct effect of first child girl on fertility preferences with its negative indirect

effect on fertility via single parenthood. Nonetheless, it may be of interest as a parameter

summarizing the total effect (direct plus indirect effect) of a first child girl on a woman’s

fertility.

          Finally, we note that we do not control for the age of the mother at first birth in our

fertility regressions. This is because we view mother’s age at first birth as endogenous to the

fertility decision itself and thus an inappropriate control. A particular concern is that, for

immigrants, maternal age at first birth may be an indicator of the broader cultural factors that we

are trying to capture with our source country variables. 10

          To further probe our findings from estimating equation (1) for immigrants in the ACS

and for second generation respondents in the CPS, we explore the impact of source country

characteristics on the response to a first child girl on the probability of living without a father and

  While Dahl and Moretti (2008) only apply this restriction to the wife, it seems reasonable to apply it to the husband
as well since a child or children born during a previous marriage could affect his preferences for the number and sex
of children in the current marriage.
10
   Nonetheless, when we include such a control in our analyses, the fertility results (available on request) are similar
to those reported here.

                                                                      11
where, the additional variables in (2) are 𝑆𝑆—an indicator or set of indicators of gender equity in

the (own or parental) source country; 𝑍𝑍—a set of (own or parental) source country characteristics

used as further controls; 𝐼𝐼—a set of variables referring to individual characteristics specific to

immigrants; the disturbance term u; and we again include year and region fixed effects (ζ and η).

Regressions are weighted by adjusting the ACS or CPS sampling weights so that each sample

year of data contributes equally to the estimation and standard errors are clustered at the (own or

parental) source country level.

        The variables measuring source country gender equity in 𝑆𝑆 include both main effects and

interactions with first child girl. 11 For immigrants, these variables relate to conditions in the

country from which the individual migrated; for the second generation, these variables relate to

parental source country. Our key variable is the WEF’s Global Gender Gap Index (which we

term the “Equity Index”). This is an annual index computed for each country that is based on the

treatment of women on four dimensions: a) Economic Participation and Opportunity; b)

Educational Attainment; c) Health and Survival; d) Political Empowerment. 12 The index is

calibrated so that higher values signify more favorable outcomes for women. We use the

average of the 2006 and 2007 values of the Equity Index for each source country; the variable is

therefore measured before the data we use from the ACS, which as noted covers the years 2008-

13. The Index is not available prior to 2006.

        While the Equity Index provides an overall indicator of the favorableness of a country’s

environment to women, it imposes a specific weighting on its components. To investigate the

separate impact of some important gender-related source country characteristics, in additional


11
  For descriptions of and sources for the source country variables, see the Data Appendix.
12
 This Index has been used as an indicator of gender equality in a number of other studies. See, for example, Guiso,
Monte, Sapienza, and Zingales (2008); Zentner and Mitura (2012); Fryer and Levitt (2010); and Nollenberger,
Rodríguez-Planas, and Sevilla (2016).

                                                        12
specifications, we replace the Equity Index with either (1) the female labor force participation

rate relative to that of men or (2) the relative labor force participation variable and the country’s

(boys/girls) sex ratio at birth. Note that the measure of source country female labor supply we

employ is women’s labor force participation relative to men’s (female LFP/male LFP). This

relative measure is appropriate in that it captures the gender division of labor explicitly. A

further advantage is that it implicitly adjusts for problems in measuring the labor force,

particularly at different levels of economic development, at least to the extent that such problems

affect men’s and women’s measured participation rates similarly. We follow the WEF in left-

censoring the sex ratio at birth at 1.059 to identify son preference rather than natural biological

variation. The labor force participation and sex ratio variables are averaged over the 2000-2007

period, thus measuring source country conditions for a reasonable period prior to our ACS data.

        The regressions with source country variables also include controls for the main effects

of basic influences on family structure and fertility, 𝑍𝑍, including total fertility and the log of GDP

per capita in the source country, which are also averaged for the 2000-7 period. By including a

measure of total fertility in the source country, we are interpreting the impact of having a female

first child, controlling for overall tastes for family size in the source country.

        The immigrant-related variables 𝐼𝐼 in equation (2) for the immigrant sample include the

woman’s years since migration and years since migration squared, and, in the fertility

regressions, include those variables for her spouse as well as an indicator for whether her spouse

was an immigrant. For the second-generation sample, the immigrant-related variables include




                                                  13
indicators for whether her spouse was an immigrant and whether her spouse was second

generation. 13

         Finally, we examine sex selection. Our goals in doing so are two-fold. First, we seek to

confirm that it is reasonable to view the sex of the first child as exogenous—given the

fundamental importance of this issue for our research design, we turn to it shortly below. Second,

we wish to examine the extent of sex selection for the broad population (beyond the subgroup of

individuals of Chinese, Korean, and Indian origin who have been previously examined) to see

whether sex selection now constitutes a significant complement to or substitute for son

preference in family structure and fertility decisions for broad swaths of the population. In

particular, sex selection could provide an alternate channel for influencing the sex composition

of children and thus help to account for our failure to find evidence consistent with son

preference in the fertility decisions of natives. We consider the latter exercise a robustness check

and explore this question after our examination of family structure and fertility. We study

whether sex ratios are outside what Anderson and Ray (2010) have identified as a normal

biological range of 1.03 to 1.07 (boys to girls), as well as whether the sex composition of prior

children influences the sex composition of subsequently born children.

         The databases used in this and previous studies do not provide a fertility history for the

woman who is the respondent. Thus, following the existing literature (e.g., Dahl and Moretti

2008; Almond and Edlund 2008), we infer birth order, number, and sex composition of children

from the children present in the household. We thus impose some sample restrictions in order to

increase the likelihood that we are observing all the children born to the respondent. We



13
  Note that apart from broad region controls, we do not control for an immigrant’s residence in an “enclave” with
others from the same source country. This is because location is endogenous and part of the cultural or attitudinal
effect we seek to capture with the source country variables.

                                                         14
construct two samples: the core sample places stronger restrictions on sample composition, but

allows us to better identify important variables, such as the gender of the first-born child. The

extended sample is more representative of the population, but as explained below we are less

confident that important variables are accurately measured.

        The core sample includes women, ages 18-40, who are the household head or spouse of

the household head, with one or more children, where the oldest child is twelve years old or

younger and all children are born in the U.S. These age restrictions on mothers and the oldest

child present are made to reduce the probability that there is an older child who has left the

household. Households with adopted, step or foster children are dropped in the ACS. This

restriction is not implemented in the CPS because we are unable to identify adopted and step

children in the CPS in all sample years, but we are able to drop CPS households with foster

children. Same-sex couples, respondents living in group quarters, respondents born abroad to

American parents, widows, as well as mothers with multiple children born in the same year and

quarter (ACS) or same year (CPS) are excluded. When the dependent variable is fertility, the

sample is additionally limited to married women with a spouse present, and, in some

specifications, to women in their first marriage who are married to men also in their first

marriage. Regressions that use the core sample are weighted by household weights that are

normalized to provide equal weighting for each sample year.

        The extended sample expands the core sample by including father-only families and

parents who are not the household head or spouse of the head (i.e., in subfamilies). Men are

included in the sample only if their children do not have a mother in the household and if they

are ever married (i.e., never married men are excluded). 14 We also expand the sample to include


14
  We follow Dahl and Moretti (2008) in excluding never married fathers because they rarely have custody of their
children.

                                                       15
step and adopted children since we are not able to identify these categories of children for

subfamilies. We continue to exclude foster children, but, in the spirit of inclusiveness, not their

households. Additionally, regressions that use the extended sample are weighted by person

weights (as suggested by IPUMS when one is analyzing members of subfamilies:

https://usa.ipums.org/usa/volii/subfamilies.shtml , accessed 9/10/19) that are normalized to

provide equal weighting for each sample year.

         We choose to limit the core sample to women who are the household head or spouse of

the household head in order to properly identify family relationships. The ACS and CPS ask each

individual for their relationship to the household head. This provides us with the necessary

information to match each child in the primary family to his/her parent(s). However, in both the

ACS and the pre-2007 CPS, in the case of subfamilies (family units that live in someone else’s

household), parent and child links “are not based on explicit survey items about how one is

related to others in one's household. Rather, they are educated guesses based on other variables”

(https://usa.ipums.org/usa/volii/subfamilies.shtml , accessed 9/10/19). 15 We are concerned that,

in the absence of precise information, including subfamiles will add measurement error to our

data. Furthermore, due to data limitations the identification of step or adopted children is not

possible for subfamilies. As the gender of these children is potentially endogenous their

inclusion can bias our results, which depend on the gender of the first child being as good as

random. It is also unclear when they entered the household and thus they may contribute to

errors in identifying the gender of the first child at the time marital and fertility decisions were



15
   See also Schroeder (undated). To see how ambiguity in parent-child links may arise, consider a household in
which a child who is the grandchild of the household head is present and the household also includes, e.g., (i) two
unmarried daughters of the head of childbearing age or (ii) an unmarried son and daughter of the head of
childbearing age; or (iii) a married and a single daughter of the head of childbearing age, etc. In instances like these,
IPUMS uses information on age, sex, marital status and other variables with sequential assignment rules to link
children to (possible) parents.

                                                           16
made. Consequently, we drop subfamilies in our core sample in order to reduce measurement

error and bias. Further, we do not include fathers because we can be less confident than for

mothers that the children in the household represent all the respondent’s children and thus less

confident we have correctly identified the sex of the first born child. This is the case because

mothers generally receive custody of children in the case of unmarried births or divorce. Below

we present data suggesting that our sample restrictions in the core sample do correctly identify

women’s number of children ever born in the overwhelming majority of cases.

       While the core sample is desirable due to its accuracy, it does exclude two categories—

subfamilies and single father families—that may be of interest, particularly in exploring the

determinants of living without a father. Moreover, the extended sample more closely

corresponds to that used by Dahl and Moretti (2008) thus facilitating a comparison to their

results and enabling us to chart trends over time in the impact of a first-child girl on living

without a father and fertility. Thus, while we focus on the core sample, we initially present some

results for the extended sample in our main tables, and also ascertain the robustness of all our

findings to using the extended sample. We do indeed find that our results are robust to

estimation on the extended sample.

       Finally, we exclude respondents who were born abroad to American parents because it is

difficult to categorize such individuals as either natives or immigrants (foreign born). In models

that use country characteristics, we additionally exclude respondents who report being born in

US territories or country aggregates. We also exclude respondents born in countries with low




                                                  17
frequency and a high number of missing values in the data or countries with missing data on

labor force participation in the source country. 16

        For selected waves of the June CPS, we know the total number of children ever born to

each female respondent during the ACS sample period (2008, 2010 and 2012). 17 While these

samples are of course much smaller than the ACS, they allow us to determine, for our core

sample, the degree to which the number of children living in the household (our measure of

fertility) accords with the number of children ever born to the female respondent. The data

suggest that our sample restrictions lead to a sample for which these numbers are well matched.

This may be seen in Appendix Table A-1, which shows the extent to which the number of

children we assign to each woman using our sample restrictions matches the number of children

ever born to that woman (based on the June CPS). The first thing to note is that our other sample

restrictions do substantially contribute to the accuracy of the match, above and beyond

restrictions on the age of the woman. In our married sample we correctly match 92% of the

cases for both immigrants and natives, while in the sample of all women, we match 91% of the

cases for both immigrants and natives. Subgroups such as Asian immigrants, Hispanic

immigrants, and second generation immigrants are also well-matched, with match rates ranging

from 90 to 94%.

        Recall that, because fertility is endogenous, we follow Dahl and Moretti (2008) in

focusing on the sex of the first child, rather than the sex composition of all children present.

However, if couples practice sex selection on first births, the gender of the first birth would not

be random. This is unlikely, given that, even for subgroups in which there is evidence of sex


16
   These countries include Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, Bermuda, Micronesia, St. Kitts & Nevis, Marshall
Islands, and Dominica. For CPS analyses, we also drop respondents born in countries not included in the 1995 list of
countries. This restriction drops respondents born in Ivory Coast and Mongolia.
17
   This information is also available for 1995, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2006.

                                                        18
selection, it has not been found to be present on the first birth (Almond and Edlund 2008), but it

is important to confirm this. Moreover, several studies have found that the environment can

affect the sex ratio at birth, results that may also call into question the assumption that the sex of

the first child is indeed exogenous. For example, some researchers have found that conditions of

stress lower the sex ratio (boys to girls) at birth. Examples of such conditions include alcoholism

(Barreca and Page 2015), pollution (Sanders and Stoecker 2015), terrorist attacks (Catalano,

Bruckner, Marks and Eskanazi 2006), earthquakes (Fukuda, Fukuda, Shimizu, and Møller 1998),

and maternal anxiety disorders (Subbaraman et. al 2010). While these conditions may be

extreme, there is other evidence of the impact of maternal circumstances on the gender of

children even beyond this. Trivers-Willard (1973) hypothesized that natural selection would

result in a relationship between parental resource status and the sex ratio at birth, with mothers in

good condition having a higher ratio of sons. Norberg (2004) found that women who were living

with a spouse or a partner before the child’s conception or birth had a higher ratio of sons than

those who were not. And, Almond and Edlund (2007) found that married women, younger

women and more highly educated women were more likely to bear sons. These findings

regarding marriage and living with a partner raise a possible concern about reverse causality, and

we consider this issue below. 18

         In light of the possibility that sex selective abortion is a feasible option, 19 as well as

research on the impact of maternal condition on the sex ratio at birth, we next examine data on


18
   There is also some mixed evidence on the impact of economic prosperity (a perhaps negative indicator of stress)
on the sex ratio at birth, with Catalano and Bruckner (2005) finding that prosperity raised the incidence of boys in
Sweden, while Fernández, et al (2011) found that a recession also raised the incidence of boys in Cuba.
19
   Although in principle, Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) can be used for nonmedical sex selection
purposes, this potential method of sex selection is extremely rare. According to the Society for Assisted
Reproductive Technology, a member organization that registers 95% of in vitro fertilization cycles in the United
States (www.sart.org), 63,286 babies were born in the United States in 2013 using in vitro fertilization
(http://www.sart.org/news/article.aspx?id=14570. In such cases, Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD)—the
technology that in principle can be used for sex selection-- is used 4-6% of the time, and of these, 9% involved

the sex of the first child and examine the impact of our explanatory variables on the probability

of a first child girl.

        Appendix Table A2 presents the sex ratio (male to female) of the first birth for natives

and immigrants for (i) all married women; (ii) married women in their first marriage; and (iii) all

women regardless of marital status. (All of the other sample restrictions are retained.) For all

three samples, the first child sex ratio (boys to girls) is well within the range suggested by

Anderson and Ray (2010) as indicating a biologically-normal ratio, i.e., 1.03 to 1.07. The table

shows the boy-to-girl ratio, and the 95% confidence interval endpoints. 20 In particular, the sex

ratio ranges from 1.043 (for immigrants among all women) to 1.057 (for natives among women

in their first marriage). The ratio is slightly lower for all women than for the married samples,

although the differences across samples are not statistically significant. This slightly lower ratio

of boys to girls among all women than among married women is consistent with the birth of a

girl increasing the probability of a woman being a single parent (Lundberg 2005; Dahl and

Moretti 2008).

        While the overall incidence of male births is within biological norms, it is possible that

variations in this incidence are related to maternal condition. Therefore, we examine the impact

of our explanatory variables on the probability that the first child is a girl. The results are shown

in Appendix Table A3. First, among natives, the only significant effect is that black women are

more likely to bear a son, an effect that has been noted in previous literature and is believed to

reflect biological differences (Anderson and Ray 2010). Second, among immigrants, the less



nonmedical sex selection in 2005 (Baruch, Kaufman and Hudson 2008). These percentages imply that an upper
bound of (0.06)·(0.09)·(63286)=342 babies born in the United States using nonmedical sex selection. This
represents a miniscule fraction (0.00009) of the 3,912,181 births registered in the United States in 2013 (Martin et
al. 2015).
20
   We calculate these endpoints based on the endpoints of the 95% confidence intervals for the means of the fraction
of first children who are boys.

                                                        20
educated are more likely to bear daughters, an effect consistent with Almond and Edlund’s

(2007) findings, although we do not find a significant effect for natives. Moreover, among

immigrants, there is regional variation in the probability of having a first-born daughter, and

women migrating from high-fertility countries are less likely to bear daughters, an effect that is

marginally significant. Importantly, however, the key gender equity index variable is not

significantly related to the sex of the first child.

        Appendix Table A3 shows that in most cases, our explanatory variables are not

significantly related to the sex of the first child. Moreover, our explanatory variables control for

some of the factors that previous research has found to influence the sex ratio at birth, including

education, race, age, economic conditions (at least as proxied by the individual characteristics,

region and year). Thus, even if the sex of the first child is endogenous, this effect is at least

partially absorbed by the control variables. Further, while some individual coefficients are found

to be significant, based on the F statistics reported in Table A3, we reject the hypothesis that the

variables are jointly insignificant for only one of the three specifications (the regression for

immigrants that includes source country characteristics). Nonetheless, we acknowledge that, if

the sex of the first child is affected by unmeasured maternal conditions, then regressions that

condition on this variable could yield biased results. Later in the paper, we perform a bounding

exercise to ascertain the likely maximal impact of maternal conditions on the estimated effect of

first child girl on living without a father and also consider whether the impact of maternal

condition could account for the pattern of results reported in this paper. We conclude that this is

very unlikely.

IV. Living Without a Father and Fertility: Aggregate Results

       We begin our data analysis of son preference by presenting regression results for the

determinants of living without a father and fertility at the aggregate level in order to characterize

the United States as a whole, including both pooled results for the full population and for natives

and immigrants separately. In the next sections, we consider educational differences in these

outcomes for both natives and immigrants and cultural (source country) differences for

immigrants and the second generation.

       Table 1 shows native, immigrant and pooled results for the determinants of living without

a father for the core and the extended samples. We find for both samples that having a first child

girl significantly raises the probability of living without a father both overall and for natives

separately, with effects ranging from 0.0031-0.0032 (1.1-1.2% of mean) for the core sample, and

0.0050-0.0056 (1.6-1.7% of the mean) for the extended sample. The higher point estimates that

we obtain for the extended sample are quite similar to that reported by Dahl and Moretti (2008)

who used a similar sample definition. For immigrants the effect is similar across the two

samples (0.0023-0.0027 or 1.1-1.6% of the mean) but the point estimates are not significant.

       As discussed above, there is a concern that maternal condition could result in reverse

causality from marriage to sex of the first child, biasing our results. However, using existing

evidence on the impact of marital status on the sex of a newborn, we can place an upper bound

on any such bias. For example, Almond and Edlund (2007) find that being married increases the

likelihood that a newborn is male by 0.001. Using the theoretical result in Basu (2015) and the

coefficients on first child girl for the pooled samples in Table 1, we estimate that these

coefficients (0.0032 for the core sample and 0.0050 for the extended sample) are biased upward

by at most 0.0006 and 0.0007 respectively, or only 14-19% of the reported coefficient



                                                  22
estimates. 21 We believe that these are overestimates of the bias because some of the apparent

effect of marriage on child gender at birth found by Almond and Edlund (2007) is likely due to

the greater likelihood of “shotgun marriages” if the child is a boy (Dahl and Moretti 2008), rather

than the biological conditions of pregnancy.

         Table 2 shows companion results for the impact of a female first child on total fertility

among married women for the core and extended samples, again estimated for natives and

immigrants separately and for both groups pooled. In Panels A-D, we show estimates for the all

marriages and first marriages samples, while in Panels E and F, we show results for all women

(including those who are not married spouse present).

         Among married women (Panels A-D), the results are very similar across the core and

extended samples and are not sensitive to the restriction to first marriages. First, among natives,

having a first child girl has a small but significantly negative effect on fertility (“Total # of

Children”), with the effects ranging from -0.0070 to -0.0078 or -0.4 percent of the mean fertility

level. This significant negative effect shows up for both the probability of having two or more

and three or more children. We also find negative point estimates for immigrants and natives

pooled (“Both”), although the coefficient estimates are smaller in magnitude and are not

statistically significant. These results strongly contrast with Dahl and Moretti’s (2008) finding

from the 1960-1980 Censuses that, among first marriages, having a female first child raises

fertility by 0.3% of the mean.




21
   Basu (2015) shows that the OLS bias = (Var(z)(1-r2zx)-1(a2/(1-a1a2))σ2, where z is the first child girl dummy
variable, r2zx is the squared correlation coefficient between z and the inner product of coefficients and variables other
than first child girl from the equation for living without a father, a2 is the effect of living without a father on first
child girl, a1 is the coefficient of interest, and σ2 is the variance of the regression error. The figures in the text use
the OLS estimates for a1 and Almond and Edlund’s (2007) estimate of 0.001 for a2. Because the OLS bias on a1 is
positive, using the OLS a1 in Basu’s (2015) formula produces a slight overestimate of the OLS bias in this case.

                                                           23
         Second, Table 2 (Panels A-D) also shows that, in contrast to the findings for natives,

there does appear to be a fertility effect consistent with son preference among married immigrant

women. The impact of having a female first child among immigrants is very similar across the

core and extended samples and for all marriages and first marriages. It ranges from 0.015 (0.8%

of the mean) to 0.018 (1.0% of the mean) and is highly significant in each case. These effects

are larger than those obtained for the full population for the 1960-80 period examined by Dahl

and Moretti (2008). As in Dahl and Moretti’s estimates, this effect does not show up until

beyond the margin of having two or more children, probably because having at least two children

is so prevalent. To the extent that having a preference for boys characterizes values emphasizing

traditional gender roles, the contrast between immigrants and natives shown in Table 2 suggests

that, overall, immigrants have more traditional values than natives. 22 Below, we probe this

possibility, explicitly examining the impact of source country characteristics on the effect of a

female first child on living without a father and fertility among immigrant and second generation

women. 23

         The results for all women shown in Table 2 (Panels E and F) are very similar to those for

married women for both the core and extended samples, with first child girl having a

significantly negative effect on native fertility and a significantly positive effect on immigrant

fertility. Moreover, the estimated effects of first child girl for immigrants and natives pooled for

all women are significantly negative, in contrast to the insignificant negative effects estimated



22
   Blau, Kahn and Papps (2011) found that immigrants had a more traditional division labor in the home than
natives, as indicated by women’s labor supply behavior, which reflected the lower female- to-male labor supply
ratios in immigrant source countries compared to the United States.
23
   Not surprisingly, the impact of a first child girl tends to affect child spacing in the opposite direction as fertility.
We found that a first child girl generally had a positive effect on child spacing for natives and a negative effect for
immigrants in both all and first marriages (with the exception of a negative effect obtained for natives in first
marriages in the extended sample). However, only the effect for natives in all marriages in the core sample was
significant: 0.015 (se 0.008).

                                                             24
for married women. Also of interest, the estimated effects of first child girl for all women tend

to be slightly smaller (more negative or less positive) than those estimated for the married

samples. These smaller coefficient effects are as expected if first child girl increases the

probability of a mother being unpartnered (single or divorced) and unpartnered women have

lower fertility. This would result in a more negative effect of first child girl for natives and a less

positive effect of first child girl for immigrants for all women than for their married counterparts.

This is what we observe with the exception of the effect for native women in the extended

sample, which is now slightly less negative than for married women, but still significant.

       As noted earlier, first child gender may affect the mother’s labor supply through its effect

on fertility (Ichino, Lindström and Viviano 2014). In Appendix A4, we examine this for the core

sample, showing results for the impact of first child girl on the mother’s labor force participation

for married women and for all women (regardless of marital status). The table shows that for

native women, a female first child has positive effects on labor supply, while for immigrant

women, the effects are negative. Although these effects are significant in only one case (natives

among all women), they are fairly large in absolute value (1.1 to 1.7 times) relative to their

standard errors. The estimated effects are consistent with the fertility patterns shown in Table 2.

Specifically, a female first child lowers fertility and raises maternal labor supply for natives,

while raising fertility and lowering maternal labor supply for immigrants. The effects are

slightly smaller in absolute value for all women than for married women, although not

significantly so. These results are as expected for immigrants but not for natives, given the

positive effect of first child girl on living without a father for both groups and the consequent

reduction in fertility. For immigrants, this works to reduce the negative effect of first child girl

on women’s labor supply for all women compared to married women. However, for natives, the



                                                  25
positive effect of first child girl on women’s labor force participation is a bit smaller for all

women than for married women, which is counter to what we would have expected.

         It is also of interest to know how the estimated effects of the impact of first child girl on

family structure and fertility have changed over time so we can ascertain whether these possible

manifestations of son preference have been increasing or decreasing. Fortunately, we are able to

examine these trends using Dahl and Moretti’s (2008) data for 1960-2000 combined with our

own data for 2008-13. For the Dahl and Moretti data we use some results reported in their paper

as well as own regression estimates based on their data (available at:

http://econweb.ucsd.edu/~gdahl/sons-code.html) to obtain separate effects for each decade in

their period. For comparability with Dahl and Moretti for the most recent period, we use our

extended sample for immigrants and natives pooled and adopt their specification. 24 Our results

are shown in Figures 1-3.

         In Figure 1, we chart the trends in the impact of first child girl on living without a father.

In addition, following Dahl and Moretti (2008), in Figure 2, we decompose the effect of first

child girl on living without a father into its component channels. Specifically, a child can be

living without a father if i) the mother has never married; or ii) there has been a divorce; or iii)

the mother has custody of the children in the event of divorce. 25 Two overall conclusions arise

from the Figures. First, while the impact of first child girl on the probability of living without a

father rose steadily from about 0.2 to 0.8 percentage points between 1960 and 1990, it then fell

sharply to about 0.5 percentage points by 2000 and has remained at roughly that level since then.



24
   Dahl and Moretti control for decade of birth fixed effects, three (rather than four) categories of education (<HS.
HS and College), and do not have a separate indicator for Hispanics. A further difference for the fertility regressions
is that Dahl and Moretti do not control for spouse characteristics and include women who are married spouse absent;
they also determine first marriage based solely on the wife’s marital history (rather than both the husband’s and
wife’s as we do). Our results were virtually unaffected by the slight differences in specification.
25
   For details on this decomposition, see the discussion in Dahl and Moretti (2008), p. 1088.

                                                          26
Second, the relative importance of the never married channel to the impact of first child girl on

living without a father has grown, increasing particularly sharply between 2000 and 2008-2013.

There is also, as noted by Dahl and Moretti (2008) a noticeable growth in the importance of the

custody channel relative to the divorce channel compared to the earliest years (1960 and 1970).

        The results for fertility are shown in Figure 3 for all married women and, where

available, women in their first marriages. Figure 3 indicates that, between 1960 and 1980, the

effect of first child girl was positive for both first marriages and all marriages. These effects

were significant for both samples for the 1960-80 period pooled and for 1980 separately. For

1990 and 2000, there is no information on first marriages; however, the effect of a female first

child on fertility for all marriages falls to virtually zero (-0.0002) by 1990 and further to -0.0034

by 2000, with both effects insignificant. In our data, the effects for first and all marriages are

both about -0.003 and insignificant, or roughly the same magnitude as for 2000’s sample of all

marriages. These results strongly suggest that the disappearance of a positive effect of first-child

girl on fertility reflects a fairly permanent shift. And, as we have seen, for natives, this effect is

now significantly negative. One additional piece of data lends support to the conclusion that

these are relatively long-term shifts. Below, we examine similar specifications for the 1995-

2014 CPS, in order to see results separately by immigrant generation. For natives with native

parents (3rd+ generation)—who comprise the majority of natives—our results are similar to those

obtained for natives in Table 2: a female first child leads to lower fertility.

V.      Living Without a Father and Fertility: Heterogeneity by Education

        We now explore whether the aggregate findings for living without a father and fertility

vary by education. Figures 4 and 5 show the results for the impact of a first child girl on living

without a father (Figure 4) and fertility (Figure 5) disaggregated by education group. For



                                                  27
natives, with the exception of high school graduates, results are broadly consistent with the

aggregate results presented in Tables 1 and 2, although the magnitude and significance of the

estimated coefficients varies. Except for those with exactly a high school degree (high school

graduates), having a female first child is found to have a positive effect on the probability of

living without a father and a negative effect on fertility. The results for high school graduates,

however, show a pattern more consistent with son preference on both dimensions. The impact of

a female first child on living without a father is larger for high school graduates than for the other

education groups, although not significantly so, while the effect on fertility is large, positive and

significant. The more traditional patterns that we find for the high school educated compared to

the more highly educated are consistent with findings in the literature that the more highly

educated are less likely to have traditional gender role attitudes. 26

           For immigrants, the results for living without a father are mixed. The effect of a female

first child on living without a father is positive for high school and below and significant or

larger than its standard error. However, the impact for those with more than high school is

negative in both cases, although not significant. These mixed results by educational attainment

contribute to the weaker results for the impact of first child female on living without a father for

immigrants than natives in the aggregate, which were obtained in Table 1. For fertility, the

impact of a female first child is more consistent with the effect being positive for each education

group. Interestingly, the estimated effect is especially large (and significant) for those with a

high school degree.

     See, for example, Campbell and Horowitz (2016); and Davis and Greenstein (2009).

                                                        28
VI. Source Country Characteristics and First Child Girl Effects for Immigrants and the

Second Generation

         Overall, we do not find direct evidence of son preference for fertility for natives or in the

aggregate, although the results for living without a father are possibly consistent with this

phenomenon. However, immigrants, on average, do exhibit son preference in their fertility

behavior. This potentially provides supporting evidence for the (weaker) findings of female

headship among immigrants and might indicate son preference along this dimension as well. If

the immigrant results for living without a father and fertility reflect son preference, they would

likely be tied to source country variables reflecting gender equity in these countries. We thus

examine these relationships for both immigrants and second generation natives—evidence of

such an association would provide further support for interpreting the estimated effects as

indicators of son preference.

         Table 3 presents results for living without a father and fertility for immigrants. 27 The key

results concern the interactions between first child girl and indicators of gender equity in the

source country; as noted above, all regressions additionally control for total fertility and the log

of GDP per capita in the source country. In Columns 1 and 4, we summarize women’s status

using an Equity Index (based on the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Index). In

additional specifications, we investigate the separate impact of some important gender-related

source country characteristics by replacing the Equity Index with either (i) the female labor force

participation ratio (the rate relative to that of men) (Columns 2 and 5) or (ii) the female labor

force participation ratio and the country’s sex ratio at birth (boys/girls) (Columns 3 and 6). We




27
  In the fertility regressions, we show results for all married couples but results were similar when immigrants were
restricted to their first marriage.

                                                         29
find strong evidence of an effect of source country gender equity on fertility but relatively little

evidence of such an effect for living without a father.

        Looking first at the results for the probability of living without a father shown in

Columns 1-3, we see that the effect of first child girl is weaker for women migrating from

countries with higher Equity Index scores; the interaction effect is not significant but is larger

than its standard error in absolute value. However, we do not obtain significant results for the

labor force participation ratio in either specification or for the sex ratio (the latter is also “wrong

signed”); and these estimated effects are small relative to their standard errors.

        In contrast, the results for fertility shown in Columns 4-6 provide strong evidence of a

link between these source country characteristics and immigrant fertility behavior in the United

States that is robust across all of our alternative measures of gender equity in the source country.

Column 4 shows a significant negative interaction between first child girl and the Equity Index;

Column 5 shows a significant negative interaction between first child girl and the female relative

LFP rate; and Column 6 shows a significant negative interaction between first child girl and the

female relative LFP rate and a significant positive interaction between first child girl and the sex

ratio at birth. Thus, in all cases we find that the apparent preference for boys is stronger among

immigrants coming from societies with lower gender equity.

        To illustrate the magnitude of the source country effects, we evaluate the interaction

effect between first child girl and the Equity Index shown in Column 4 using the sample

distribution of the Equity Index. Specifically, we contrast the effect of first child girl on the

fertility of women migrating from a country at the 75th percentile of the Equity Index in our

immigrant sample (0.6796) with that of women migrating from a country at the 25th percentile




                                                  30
(0.6459). 28 As examples, Thailand has an index near the 75th percentile, and Mexico’s index is

near the 25th percentile. In contrast, the Equity Index for the United States is 0.7022, or above

the 75th percentile for immigrants, providing further evidence that gender roles are more

traditional on average in immigrant source countries than in the United States. We find that the

impact of first child girl on fertility is relatively large and statistically significant for women

coming from a country at the 25th percentile of the Equity Index (0.0183, se 0.0050) and smaller

and not statistically significant for women coming from a country at the 75th percentile (0.0092,

se 0.0077). This simulation shows that the impact of first child girl on fertility of women coming

from a country where women have lower gender equity is large and highly statistically

significant, while, for women coming from countries where women have higher gender equity, it

is small and not statistically significant. 29

           The results for immigrant fertility are consistent with son preference in the aggregate for

this group, as well as the importance of source country characteristics or culture in affecting the

degree of son preference. An interesting question is whether immigrant preferences for sons and

the cultural differences implied in the impact of source country characteristics persist into future

generations. To address this question, we take advantage of information on parental birthplace

for respondents in the CPS, which, in conjunction with information on where they themselves

were born, allows us to study son preference separately for the foreign born (the 1st generation),

natives with either parent foreign born (the 2nd generation) and natives with native-born parents

(the 3rd+ generation). Our results are shown in Tables 4 and 5.

           Table 4 shows the overall effects of first child girl on living without a father and fertility

for each immigrant generation. These results can give an indication of whether the CPS is


28
     These percentiles are implicitly weighted by the (weighted) frequency of immigrants from each source country.
29
     A similar exercise using the results of Columns 5 and 6 yields a similar conclusion.

                                                          31
yielding broadly similar overall results to the ACS and also provide our first look at the 2nd

generation before we consider finer distinctions among them based on parental source country.

In terms of the signs of the effects, the CPS results are broadly similar to those obtained from the

ACS. For the probability of living without a father, we find a positive effect of first child girl for

both the 3rd + generation—the majority of natives—and the 1st generation, although the estimated

effects are not statistically significant. For fertility, as in the ACS, a female first child leads to

significantly lower fertility for the 3rd + generation and significantly higher fertility for the 1st

generation. 30 The results for the 2nd generation are a bit anomalous. On the one hand, we find

that first child girl raises fertility, although the effect just misses statistical significance at

conventional levels, suggesting that the 2nd generation is a traditional group on average. On the

other hand, in contrast to the other groups, first child girl has a negative effect on the probability

of living without a father, although this effect is not statistically significant.

         Regardless of overall average effects for the second generation, the more interesting

question is how their behavior tracks with parental source country gender equity. This is shown

in Table 5. Looking first at the results for fertility, where we had stronger results for the

immigrant generation, we see that our findings for the second generation are qualitatively quite

similar to those we obtained for immigrants. Specifically, those whose parent(s) came from a

country with a higher Equity Index exhibit significantly less son preference in fertility than those

whose parent(s) came from a country with a lower Equity Index. Further, the interaction effect

for Girl*LFP Ratio is significantly negative (Columns 2 and 3), while the interaction with Sex




30
  Although the fertility results for immigrants and natives in the CPS are similar in sign to the results we obtained
with the ACS, the magnitudes of the estimated effects are larger in the CPS than in the ACS. This was not due to
our wider time window in the CPS analysis (1995-2014): when we restricted the CPS analysis to the same years as
the ACS—2008-2013, the effects for immigrants and 3rd+ generation natives remained larger than in the ACS.

                                                          32
Ratio at Birth is positive, though not statistically significant (Column 3). 31 Overall, the results

suggest that cultural transmission of son preference in fertility from source country to

immigrants continues into the second generation.

        Looking next at the impact of parental source country variables on living without a

father, perhaps not surprisingly given the weak evidence we found for the immigrant generation,

the second generation results offer little evidence in the expected direction. We do find a

positive and significant interaction between first child girl and sex ratio at birth; however, the

Equity Index and Labor Force Participation Ratios interactions with First Child Girl are “wrong

signed,” and insignificant.

VII. Sex Selection

        Our findings for fertility do not suggest son preference overall on the part of natives,

while we do find some evidence for immigrants that having a girl raises fertility, particularly for

immigrants from countries with lower gender equity, and second generation individuals whose

parents came from such countries. However, sex selection can serve as another, perhaps

substitute option for exercising son preference, and, nearly a decade ago, Dahl and Moretti

(2008) warned that the United States might see increases in such behavior due to technological

advances in sex selection technology (p. 1087). We therefore have examined this issue by

studying the impact of first child sex on the sex of the second child among those with at least two

children, and the impact of the sex composition of the first two children on the sex of the third

child among those with at least three children.




31
  As was the case with the overall effects for immigrants and natives in Table 4, the interactions for second
generation women shown in Table 5 are larger in magnitude for the Equity Index and LFP Ratio than for immigrants
shown in Table 3; however, the effect for Girl*Sex Ratio at Birth is smaller for second generation women than for
immigrants.

                                                       33
         Table 6 shows these results. For both natives and immigrants, we find no evidence of son

preference through sex selection. For natives, the boy/girl ratios are all between 1.034 and

1.058, within the normal biological range of 1.03-1.07 suggested by Anderson and Ray (2010).

Moreover, the probability that the second or third child is a boy is never higher for all girl

families than for all boy families. What associations there are between the sex composition of

past and future births for natives appear to be consistent with a biological tendency of future

children to be of the same sex as previous children. 32 Among immigrants, in all cases, the 95%

confidence interval for the sex ratio is within the biologically normal 1.03-1.07 range.

Moreover, as was the case for natives, the probability that the second or third child is a boy is

never higher for all girl than for all boy families. These results for immigrants, like the ones for

natives, do not suggest sex selection.

         While some researchers have found evidence of sex selection for specific groups such as

women of Chinese, Indian or Korean heritage (Almond and Edlund 2008; Abrevaya 2009;

Almond, Edlund and Milligan 2013; Persaud, Kalantry, Citro, and Nandi 2015), 33 the results of

Table 6 suggest that these instances are not numerous enough to characterize the full population

of immigrants or natives. Therefore, the disappearance of the effect of a first girl on fertility for

the general population and the reversal of the effect of a first girl on fertility that we found for

natives likely indicate a general weakening of son preference in the United States rather than a

shift to sex selective abortion as an alternative mechanism.

         VIII. Discussion




32
   Some researchers have found such a correlation between the sex composition of previous births and the sex of
future children (Ben-Porath and Welch 1976; Gellatly 2009), although some find no such pattern (Rodgers and
Doughty 2001; Jacobsen, Møller and Mouritsen 1999).
33
   Interestingly, while most authors found evidence of son preference, the recent paper by Persaud, Kalantry, Citro,
and Nandi (2015) reports results consistent with a demand for diversity.

                                                         34
        We find that effect of first child girl now has a negative effect on fertility in the aggregate

and is significantly negative for natives. Our findings for fertility contrast with those of Dahl

and Moretti (2008) for an earlier period but are consistent with those reported in Ichino, et. al

(2014), Andersson, et. al (2011), and Abrevaya (2009). Our results remove a crucial piece of

supporting evidence for the current period that the positive effect of a first girl on the probability

of living without a father is due to son preference as opposed to other factors.

        Looking at trends in the effects of first child girl, we found that the positive impact of

first child girl on living without a father has declined since 1990, while, since 1980, the impact of

first child girl on fertility has fallen from a positive effect in the earlier period to the

insignificantly negative effect in the aggregate and the significantly negative effect for natives

that we find for the current period. This combination of results suggests that son preference has

declined in the aggregate and particularly for natives.

        Do parents in the aggregate and natives in particular now prefer daughters? This might

be the case but we note that there are alternative explanations for our findings than daughter

preference. One factor that could contribute would be a rise in the costs of raising girls. This is

plausible in that, today, the majority of college students are female, in contrast to the higher male

representation during the 1960-80 period (Goldin, Katz and Kuziemko 2006). Thus, it is

possible that families who have girls today are more likely to anticipate higher college costs for

their children than in the past. Kornrich and Furstenberg (2013) provide some direct evidence on

the relative cost of raising girls and boys. They find that, in 1972-3, households with all boys

spent significantly more on their children than households with all girls; this gap was largely

accounted for by educational expenses. However, by 2006-7, this pattern had reversed, with all




                                                    35
girl households spending significantly more than all-boy households, particularly, again, on

education (p. 16). 34

        The cost data are consistent with the pattern of our results for the current period in the

aggregate and especially for natives that a female first child both lowers fertility and raises the

probability of living without a father. They are also broadly consistent with Dahl and Morreti’s

(2008) findings suggesting son preference, at least for the pre-1980 period (see Figures 1-3).

Since girls were less expensive than boys, costs cannot account for the positive effect of female

first child on living without a father, although the lower costs of girls do provide an alternative

interpretation for the positive effect of first child girl on fertility. Moreover, the increase in the

cost of girls is consistent with the decline in the effect of female first child on fertility since 1980

(Figure 1). However, despite these rising costs, the effect of first child girl on living without a

father has also decreased since 1990, falling to below the 1980 level and only slightly higher

than the 1970 level. This change could not have been driven by costs and thus suggests a decline

in son preference likely played a role. Moreover, the spending data could themselves reflect a

reduction in son preference, since they indicate that families are now willing to spend more on

girls, particularly their education.

        The increased expenditure on girls and the less positive effect of girls on fertility than in

the past could also reflect an increase in bargaining power of wives as their labor force

participation and relative wages have increased. Some data suggest aggregate preferences for the

sex of a child have not changed and that son preference appears to be a male phenomenon—that

is, that while men have a preference for boys over girls, women show no preference either way




34
  In their online appendix (available at: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13524-012-0146-4), the
authors show that these patterns hold up in a regression context and for mixed gender families.

                                                        36
(Newport 2011). 35 Thus, the disappearance of a positive effect of a first child girl in the

aggregate and for natives could indicate that women have a greater say in this decision than

previously. This is plausible in light of rising female labor force participation and relative wages

(Blau and Kahn 2017). Another possible factor potentially influencing fertility and family

structure (single female parenthood) relates to the economic returns to boys relative to girls.

While in principle these returns could have been increasing with the rise in female labor force

participation and the decline in the gender pay gap, it seems unlikely that material returns play a

major role in a developed country like the U.S., where children do not have an important role in

supporting their parents economically. 36 However, increases in life expectancy might result in a

greater value being placed on the future caretaker role of daughters than in the past, since women

shoulder a disproportionate share of elder care (Grigoryeva 2017).

        The findings for 1960-80 suggest that preferences for boys outweighed such

considerations (if any) during that period. Our findings imply either a reduction among natives

in preferences for boys and/or an increase in the impact of these other factors sufficient to

outweigh any preference for boys. The possible impact of these various factors makes us

reluctant to interpret our finding of a negative effect of first female child on native fertility as

indicating a shift from son to daughter preference, although of course it might.

        Maternal condition is another factor potentially influencing single female parenthood

(living without a father). As we have seen, a reasonable bounding exercise suggests that the

impact of this factor, if any, is not large. Here we consider whether the impact of unmeasured


35
   Specifically, in 2011, when asked about sex preference supposing that one could have only one child, men
preferred a boy to a girl by a margin of 49 to 22 percent, whereas women were split roughly equally with 31 percent
preferring a boy and 33 percent preferring a girl. (A higher proportion of women (36 percent) than men (28 percent)
also said responded “Doesn’t matter,” “Not sure,” or “No opinion.” See Newport (2011).
36
   Lundberg (2005) notes that differences in material returns are not expected to play a large role in developed
(“wealthy”) countries, although, this factor receives considerable emphasis in analyses of son preference in
developing countries.

                                                        37
maternal condition could be consistent with the pattern of our findings. In considering this

possibility, it is useful to specify the possible effects. For living without a father, the concern

would be that an unmeasured factor like stress on the mother raises both the probability of a

female first child and the probability of her being unpartnered, since stress is likely to contribute

to the breakup of the couple or the failure of the parents to form a family in the first place. For

fertility, the expectation would be that unmeasured maternal condition would raise the

probability of a female first child but lower fertility. This is based on evidence that maternal

stress lowers one’s own fertility (Louis, et. al 2011) and the fertility of one’s daughters (Plana-

Ripoli, et al (2016). Moreover, health problems associated with being over- or underweight, as

well as the excessive intake of caffeine, tobacco and alcohol have been found to also reduce

fertility (Ruder, Hartman and Goldman 2009).

        The pattern of our findings does not fit what would be expected based on the impact of

unmeasured maternal condition. A potential correlation between having a first-born girl and

poor maternal condition could help explain the positive effect of first-born girls on living without

a father and its negative effect on fertility that we find for natives. However, it cannot explain

our finding for immigrants that a first-born daughter raises fertility as well as the probability of

living without a father. Moreover, when we look at the trends in the impact of a first-born girl

on living without a father and fertility for the full population, changes in maternal condition do

not appear to be a plausible explanation for the pattern. Specifically, the positive impact of first

child girl on living without a father has declined since 1990. For changing maternal conditions

to explain this development would suggest an improvement in maternal conditions. However,

since 1980, the impact of first child girl on fertility has decreased. For this change to be due to

maternal conditions, would suggest maternal stress and maternal conditions have worsened.



                                                  38
       Further, our findings for source country variables reflecting gender equity for immigrants

also cast doubt on the idea that maternal conditions could explain our results. Specifically, we

might expect that women migrating from countries with lower status of women would find

adapting to US society more stressful than those migrating from societies with more equal status

of women. Nonetheless, a female first child has more pronounced positive effects on future

fertility for immigrant women from source countries with less gender equality, again, seemingly

in contrast to what one might expect from the medical literature.

       IX.      Conclusion

       In this paper, we have used 2008-2013 ACS and 1995-2014 CPS data to generate new

findings on the extent of son preference in the United States. In light of the large increase in

immigration and the changes in immigrant source countries towards countries with a more

traditional status for women than in the United States (Blau, Kahn, and Papps 2011), we

introduce a new dimension into this literature by analyzing natives and immigrants separately.

Perhaps most importantly, we find that, among native women, as well as among the aggregate

population (immigrants and natives pooled), having a female first child reduces future fertility

(significant effects for natives and insignificant in the aggregate). This result stands in sharp

contrast to earlier research by Dahl and Moretti (2008) which found for the 1960-80 period that

having a girl led to higher fertility levels among the aggregate population. As with their earlier

work, we do continue to find that first child girl increased the likelihood of living without a

father. However, our fertility findings cast doubt on son preference as the explanation for this

relationship.

       Our findings for fertility and living without a father are more consistent with the

hypothesis that girls are more expensive to raise, or that boys especially benefit from having a



                                                 39
father living with them than with the hypothesis of son preference. We presented data from

Kornrich and Furstenberg (2013) that showed that, indeed, raising girls, which was cheaper in

the 1970s than raising boys, had by the 2000s become more expensive than raising boys. Other

factors may have further contributed to the disappearance of son preference for natives. Some

evidence suggests that women do not share men’s preferences for sons (Newport 2011). Thus,

the fertility changes may reflect an increase in women’s bargaining power in the family, perhaps

due to rising female labor force participation and relative wages. Another possibility is that, with

rising life expectancy, parents have come to more highly value the caretaker roles daughters

disproportionately shoulder. These various shifts, in conjunction with the rising costs of girls,

may have reversed or outweighed son preference in fertility for this group.

        For immigrants, we also find a positive effect of a female first birth on living without a

father, although it is not statistically significant. In contrast to natives, however, we find that, for

immigrants, having a first child girl significantly raises future fertility, providing direct evidence

consistent with son preference for fertility for this group. Moreover, such fertility preferences

are stronger for immigrants coming from countries with lower gender equity and also appear to

carry over into the second generation. In contrast, we found little evidence that the impact of

having a girl on living without a father was stronger among first and second generation

immigrants from source countries with lower gender equity. Thus, in contrast to the fertility

results, we do not provide support that the relationship between first child girl and living without

a father for immigrants or the second generation is tied to son preference.

        We also studied the issue of sex selection, a perhaps extreme manifestation of son

preference. Overall, despite warnings that sex selection could spread among the wider

population (Dahl and Moretti 2008), we found no evidence of such behavior in the aggregate



                                                  40
native and immigrant populations for our relatively recent period of analysis. The findings for

sex selection reinforce our overall conclusion that preference for sons appears to have

diminished among US natives in that sex selection does not provide an alternative mechanism to

account for the disappearance of a positive effect of first child girl on fertility.

Variable Definitions

Variables from the ACS and CPS

        Race and Ethnicity
    •   We control for race and ethnicity using a set of indicator variables for five mutually-exclusive
        categories: White non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, Asian non-Hispanic, and other
        non-Hispanic.
    •   Respondent is classified as Hispanic if the respondent reports being Hispanic or reports race as
        Spanish, Portuguese, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Latin American Indian, South American Indian, or
        Mexican American Indian.
    •   Respondent is classified as black non-Hispanic if the respondent reports being any detailed race
        that includes black (except for Black and Chinese, Black and Asian Indian, or Black and Korean)
        and is not classified as Hispanic.
    •   Respondent is classified as Asian non-Hispanic if the respondent is not classified as Hispanic or
        black non-Hispanic and reports race as Asian or any mixed race including Asian.
    •   Respondent is classified as white non-Hispanic if the respondent is not classified as Hispanic,
        black non-Hispanic, or Asian non-Hispanic and reports race as white.
    •   Respondent is classified as other non-Hispanic if none of the above classifications apply.

Immigrant Status and Years Since Migration
  • Respondents are classified as natives if their birthplace is one of the fifty states or the District of
      Columbia.
  • For foreign-born persons and persons born in outlying U.S. areas, we define years since migration
      as the lesser of age or reported years in the United States.

First, Second, Third + Generation (CPS only)
    • Respondents are classified as 1st generation if they report their birthplace as outside the fifty
        states or the District of Columbia.
    • Respondents are classified as 3rd + generation if they report that they and both of their parents
        were born in were born in the fifty states or the District of Columbia.
    • Respondents are classified as 2nd generation if they were born in the fifty states or the District of
        Columbia and they report that either of their parents was born outside the United States. Parental
        source country characteristics are allocated based on mother’s birthplace, if she is foreign born,
        and father’s birthplace otherwise.

Living Without a Father
    • We classify a respondent as living without a father if the respondent is female, unmarried (where
       married, spouse absent is considered married), and has at least one child. (The oldest child must
       be 12 years of age or younger for sample inclusion.) In the core sample, we include only women
       who meet these requirements and are listed as head of household. Note that if the respondent has
       an unmarried partner present, she can still be classified as a female head of household.




                                                    42
    •   Single fathers are included in the extended sample. Single fathers are included and given a 0 for
        living without a fatheronly if their children do not have a mother in the household and if they are
        ever married (i.e., never married men are excluded).

First Marriage
    • Respondents are classified as being in a first marriage if both the respondent and her spouse
       report that their current marriage is their first marriage.

Country Characteristics Variables

Total Fertility

Total fertility data comes from the World Bank, available at
http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN. In the regressions with country characteristics, we
include 2000-2007 country averages of total fertility.

GDP Per Capita

Most GDP per capita data comes from the World Bank, available at
http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.KD. For Taiwan, data comes from the Chinese
Statistical Yearbook 2013, available at
http://ebook.dgbas.gov.tw/public/Data/3117141132EDNZ45LR.pdf. GDP for Argentina, Burma and
Syria is constructed from UN Stats data on GDP by Type of Expenditure at current prices and at constant
2005 prices in national currency units, available at
http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=SNAAMA&f=grID%3A101%3BcurrID%3ANCU%3BpcFlag%3A0 and
http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?q=gdp&d=SNAAMA&f=grID%3a102%3bcurrID%3aNCU%3bpcFlag%3a0
, respectively. PPP conversion rates come from http://icp.worldbank.org/icp/QueryResults.aspx?r=-
1&ds=0&y=3&ws=1. We use the World Bank methodology to convert to GDP per capita, PPP. In the
regressions with country characteristics, we include the natural log of 2000-2007 country averages of
GDP per capita.

Ratio of Female to Male Labor Force Participation

Data on male and female labor force participation come from the International Labor Organization’s Key
Indicators of the Labor Market. We use labor force participation for the population 15 years of age and
older. In the regressions with country characteristics, we include 2000-2007 country averages of the ratio
of female to male labor force participation.

Sex Ratio at Birth

Sex ratio at birth comes from UN Data, available at
http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?q=sex+ratio+at+birth&d=PopDiv&f=variableID%3a52. We follow the WEF
in censoring the sex ratio at birth at 1.059 to identify son preference. In the regressions with country
characteristics, we include 2000-2007 country averages of sex ratio at birth.

Equity Index


                                                    43
The equity index is based on the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Index from “The Global
Gender Gap Report, 2012,” available at
http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GenderGap_Report_2012.pdf. In the regressions with country
characteristics, we include 2006-2007 country averages of the index, unless a 2006 value is not available,
in which case we use the earliest value available up until 2012. (Note that the index first became
available in 2006.)

Sample Selection and Weighting

Unless otherwise noted, analyses with the American Community Survey (ACS) use data from the 2008-
2013 waves and analyses with the Current Population Survey (CPS) use data from the 1995-2014 March
CPS. Regressions for the core sample are weighted by household weights that are normalized to provide
equal weighting for each sample year; regressions for the extended sample are weighted by person
weights (as suggested by IPUMS when one is analyzing members of subfamilies:
https://usa.ipums.org/usa/volii/subfamilies.shtml , accessed 9/10/19) that are normalized to provide equal
weighting for each sample year.

Our core sample includes women between the ages of 18 and 40, who are the head of household or spouse
of the household head, with one or more children, where the oldest child is twelve years old or younger
and all children are born in the U.S. Households with adopted, step or foster children are dropped in the
ACS. We unable to identify step or adopted children in the CPS, but we are able to drop CPS households
with foster children. Same-sex couples, respondents living in group quarters, respondents born abroad to
American parents, widows, as well as mothers with multiple children born in the same year and quarter
(ACS) or same year (CPS) are excluded. When the dependent variable is fertility, the sample is
additionally limited to married women with a spouse present, and, in some specifications, to women in
their first marriage who are married to men also in their first marriage.

The extended sample expands the core sample by including father-only families and parents who are not
the household head or spouse of the head (i.e., in subfamilies). Men are included in the sample only if
their children do not have a mother in the household and if they are ever married (i.e., never married men
are excluded). We also expand the sample to include step and adopted children since we are not able to
identify these categories of children for subfamilies. We continue to exclude foster children, but, in the
spirit of inclusiveness, not their households.

In analyses that include country characteristics, we exclude respondents who report being born in US
territories or country aggregates. We also exclude respondents born in countries with low frequency and a
high number of missing values in the data or countries with missing data on labor force participation.
These countries include Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, Bermuda, Micronesia, St. Kitts & Nevis,
Marshall Islands, and Dominica. For CPS analyses, we also drop respondents born in countries not
included in the 1995 list of countries. This restriction drops respondents born in Ivory Coast and
Mongolia.

      Child Girl on the Prob. of Living without a Father, by Year (%)




Notes: Decomposition of the overall effect of first child girl on the probability of living without a father into component
channels: never married, divorce, and custody. For example, the figure indicates that, in 1960, 20% of the impact of first child
girl on living without a father was due to its effect on the mother being never married. Estimates for 1960-2000 are based on
DM (2008) Figure 1. Estimates for 2008-2013 are calculated using the American Community Survey with the Dahl and Moretti
(2008) sample restrictions and specification.

Notes: Estimates for 1960-2000 are calculated using Dahl and Moretti (2008) data, available at
https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~gdahl/sons-code.html. Estimates for 2008-2013 are calculated using the American Community
Survey with the Dahl and Moretti (2008) specification and sample restrictions. Information on first marriages is not available for
1990 and 2000.

     Figure 4: Effects of a Female First Child on the Probability of Living
      without a Father by Education Level (Linear Probability Models)




Sample from the ACS 2008-2013, includes women, ages 18-40, who are the household head or spouse of the household head,
with 1 or more children, where the oldest child is 12 or younger and all children are born in the US. Households with adopted,
step or foster children are dropped. Same-sex couples, respondents living in group quarters, respondents born abroad to
American parents, widows, as well as mothers with multiple children born in the same year and quarter are also excluded. The
dependent variable is a binary equal to one if there is no father in a household. Controls include a cubic in mother’s age as well
as dummies for year, region (based on 9 Census categories), and race/ethnicity (based on White-nonHispanic, Black-
nonHispanic, Asian-nonHispanic, Other-nonHispanic, and Hispanic). Regressions are weighted by normalized household
weights that provide equal weighting for each sample year; the bars report the 95% confidence interval calculated with robust
standard errors.

Sample from the ACS 2008-2013, includes women, ages 18-40, who are married, spouse present, and who are the household
head or spouse of the household head, with 1 or more children, where the oldest child is 12 or younger and all children are
born in the US. Households with adopted, step or foster children are dropped. Same-sex couples, respondents living in group
quarters, respondents born abroad to American parents, widows, as well as mothers with multiple children born in the same
year and quarter, are also excluded. Controls include a cubic in both parents' ages as well as dummies for year, region (based
on 9 Census categories), spouse’s education (based on < HS, HS, Some College and College Degree), and both parents'
race/ethnicity (based on White-nonHispanic, Black-nonHispanic, Asian-nonHispanic, Other-nonHispanic, and Hispanic).
Regressions are weighted by normalized household weights that provide equal weighting for each sample year; the bars report
