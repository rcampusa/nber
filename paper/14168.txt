                                              ABSTRACT

We evaluate whether the Renminbi (RMB) is misaligned, relying upon conventional statistical methods
of inference. A framework built around the relationship between relative price and relative output
levels is used. We find that, once sampling uncertainty and serial correlation are accounted for, there
is little statistical evidence that the RMB is undervalued, even though the point estimates usually indicate
economically significant misalignment. The result is robust to various choices of country samples
and sample periods, as well as to the inclusion of control variables. We then update the results using
the latest vintage of the data to demonstrate how fragile the results are. We find that whatever misalignment
we detected in our previous work disappears in this data set.

1.     Introduction
       China’s currency, the Renminbi (RMB), has occupied a central role in the
ongoing debate over the source of global current account imbalances. In this paper, we
step back from the debate over the merits of one exchange rate regime versus another and
whether a currency realignment is desirable, and focus on the issue of currency
misalignment in terms of economic theory and empirics. As in Cheung et al. (2007), we
focus on the difficulty in measuring the “equilibrium real exchange rate” and on
quantifying the uncertainty surrounding the measurement of the level of the equilibrium.
       We exploit a well-known relationship between deviations from absolute
purchasing power parity and real per capita income using panel regression methods. By
placing the RMB in the context of this well-known empirical relationship exhibited by a
large number of developing and developed countries, over a long time horizon, this
approach addresses the question of where China’s real exchange rate stands relative to
the “equilibrium” level. In addition to calculating the numerical magnitude of the degree
of misalignment, we assess the estimates in the context of statistical uncertainty. In this
respect, we extend the standard practice of considering both economic and statistical
significance in coefficient estimates to the prediction aspect.
       We then update this basic set of results using the most recent vintage of available
data, released in April 2008. This revision has been discussed extensively, as it
incorporates substantial changes in estimates of price levels, and hence in income levels.
We find that the estimated misalignment detected in our previous study disappears
completely with this new data set. This finding highlights the fact that statistical
uncertainty is something that needs to be taken seriously in policy debates.
       We also extend the analysis by allowing for heterogeneity across country
groupings and time periods. After conducting various robustness checks, we conclude
that although the point estimates indicate the RMB is undervalued in almost all samples,
in almost no case is the deviation statistically significant, and indeed, when serial
correlation is accounted for, the extent of misalignment is not even statistically
significant at the 50% level. These findings highlight the great degree of uncertainty
surrounding empirical estimates of “equilibrium real exchange rates”, thereby
underscoring the difficulty in accurately assessing the degree of RMB undervaluation.



                                              1
        We further assess the robustness of the results in the presence of several
conditioning variables. These additional factors include demographic variables, measures
of trade openness, policy factors such as the extent of capital controls, and institutional
factors. While these conditioning variables exert significant effects, their inclusion does
not change the basic message: the RMB does not appear to be undervalued.


2.      Absolute Purchasing Power Parity
        At the heart of the debate over the right way of determining the appropriate
exchange rate level are contrasting ideas of what constitutes an equilibrium exchange
rate, what time frame the equilibrium condition pertains to, and, not least, what
econometric method to implement.1 Some short cuts have been used so often that some
forget that they are short cuts.
        Most of the extant studies fall into some familiar categories, either relying upon
some form of relative purchasing power parity (PPP) or cost competitiveness calculation,
the modeling of deviations from absolute PPP, a composite model incorporating several
channels of effects (sometimes called behavioral equilibrium exchange rate models), or
flow equilibrium models.2 In Cheung et al. (2007), we review these alternative
approaches.
        In this study, we appeal to a simple, and apparently robust, relationship between
the real exchange rate and per capita income. We will then elaborate the analysis by
stratifying the data along other dimensions (level of development, time period), and by
adding in other variables that might alter one’s assessment of the fundamental
equilibrium level of the exchange rate.


2.1     The Real Exchange Rate – Income Relationship
        First, let us consider the basic framework of analysis. Consider the law of one
price, which states that the price of a single good should be equalized in common
currency terms (expressed in logs):


1
        One relevant work is Hinkle and Montiel (1999).
2
        See Table 1 of Cheung, Chinn and Fujii (forthcoming) for a typology of these
different approaches.


                                              2
         pi ,t = st + pi*,t                                                                            (1)

where st is the log exchange rate, pi ,t is the log price of good i at time t, and the asterisk

denotes the foreign country variable. Summing over all goods, and assuming the weights
associated with each good are the same in both the home country and foreign country
basket, one then obtains the absolute purchasing power parity condition:
         pt = st + pt*                                                                                 (2)
where for simplicity assume p is a arithmetic average of individual log prices. As is well
known, if the weights differ between home and foreign country baskets (let’s say
production bundles), then even if the law of one price holds, absolute purchasing power
parity need not hold.
         The “price level” variable in the Penn World Tables (Summers and Heston,
1991), and other purchasing power parity exchange rates, attempt to circumvent this
problem by using prices (not price indices) of goods, and calculating the aggregate price
level using the same weights. Assume for the moment that this can be accomplished, but
that some share of the basket (α) is nontradable (denoted by N subscript), and the
remainder is tradable (denoted by T subscript). Then:
         pt = αp N ,t + (1 − α ) pT ,t                                                                 (3)

By simple manipulation, one finds that the “real exchange rate” is given by:
         qt ≡ st − pt + pt* = ( st − pT ,t + pT* ,t ) − α [ p N ,t − pT ,t ] + α [ p*N ,t − pT* ,t ]   (4)
Rewriting, and indicating the first term in (parentheses), the intercountry price of
tradables, as qT ,t and the intercountry relative price of nontradables as ωt ≡

[ pN ,t − pT ,t ] − [ p*N ,t − pT* ,t ] , leads to the following rewriting of (4):

         qt = qT ,t − αω t                                                                             (4’)

This expression indicates that the real exchange rate can appreciate as changes occur in
the relative price of traded goods between countries, or as the relative price of
nontradables rises in one country, relative to another. In principle, economic factors can
affect one or both.
         Most models of the real exchange rate can be categorized according to which
specific relative price serves as the object of focus. If the relative price of nontradables is


                                                               3
key, then the resulting models – in a small country context – have been termed
“dependent economy” (Salter, 1959, and Swan, 1960) or “Scandinavian” model. In the
former case, demand side factors drive shifts in the relative price of nontradables. In the
latter, productivity levels and the nominal exchange rate determine the nominal wage
rate, and hence the price level and the relative price of nontradables. In this latter context,
the real exchange rate is a function of productivity (Krueger, 1983: 157). Consequently,
the two sets of models both focus on the relative nontradables price, but differ in their
focus on the source of shifts in this relative price. Since the home economy is small
relative to the world economy (hence, one is working with a one-country model), the
tradable price is pinned down by the rest-of-the-world supply of traded goods. Hence, the
“real exchange rate” in this case is (pN-pT).
       By far dominant in this category are those that center on the relative price of
nontradables. These include the specifications based on the approaches of Balassa (1964)
and Samuelson (1964) that model the relative price of nontradables as a function of
sectoral productivity differentials, including Hsieh (1982), Canzoneri, Cumby and Diba
(1999), and Chinn (2000a). They also include those approaches that include demand side
determinants of the relative price, such as that of DeGregorio and Wolf (1994). They
observe that if consumption preferences are not homothetic and factors are not perfectly
free to move intersectorally, changes in per capita income may result shifts in the relative
price of nontradables.
       This perspective provides the key rationale for the well-known positive cross-
sectional relationship between relative price (the inverse of q, i.e., -q) and relative per
capita income levels. We exploit this relationship to determine whether the Chinese
currency is undervalued. Obviously, this approach is not novel; it has been implemented
recently by Frankel (2006) and Coudert and Couharde (2005). However, we will expand
this approach along several dimensions. First, we augment the approach by incorporating
the time series dimension.3 Second, we explicitly characterize the uncertainty
surrounding our determinations of currency misalignment. Third, we examine the


3
        Coudert and Couharde (2005) implement the absolute PPP regression on a cross-
section, while their panel estimation relies upon estimating the relationship between the
relative price level to relative tradables to nontradables price indices.

stability of the relative price and relative per capita income relationship using a)
subsamples of certain country groups and time periods, and b) control variables.
       Before proceeding further, it is important to be explicit about the type of
equilibrium we are associating with our measure of the “normal” exchange rate level.
Theoretically, the equilibrium exchange rate in the Balassa-Samuelson approach is the
one that is consistent with both internal and external balances. In reality, however,
internal and external balance is not guaranteed. Thus, the estimated exchange rate
measure is properly interpreted as a long-run measure and is ill-suited (on its own) to
analyzing short run phenomena. As a remedy, we include control variables that are
relevant for (short-run) variations in internal and external balances in the subsequent
analyses.4


2.2    The Basic Bivariate Results: Using the 2006 Vintage Data
       We compile a large data set encompassing up to 160 countries over the 1975-
2004 period. Most of the data are drawn from the World Bank’s World Development
Indicators (WDI). Because some data are missing, the panel is unbalanced. Appendix 1
gives a greater detail on the data used.
       Extending Frankel’s (2006) cross-section approach, we estimate the real exchange
rate-income relationship using a pooled time-series cross-section (OLS) regression,
where all variables are expressed in terms relative to the US;
        rit = β 0 + β1 yit + uit ,                                                      (5)
where r = -q is expressed in real terms relative to the US price level, y is per capita
income also relative to the US.5 The results are reported in the first two columns of Table
1, for cases in which we measure relative per capita income in either USD exchange rates
or PPP-based exchange rates.
       One characteristic of estimating a pooled OLS regression is that it forces the
intercept term to be the same across countries, and assumes that the error term is

4
         Frankel (2006) discusses whether one can speak of an “equilibrium exchange
rate” when there is more than one sector to consider.
5
         β0 can take on currency specific values if a fixed effects specification is
implemented. Similarly, the error term is composed of a currency specific and aggregate
error if the pooled OLS specification is dropped.

                                              5
distributed identically over the entire sample. Because this is something that should be
tested, rather than assumed, we also estimated random effects and fixed effects
regressions. The former assumes that the individual specific error is uncorrelated with the
right hand side variables, while the latter is efficient when this correlation is non-zero.6
       Random effects regressions do not yield substantially different results from those
obtained using pooled OLS. Interestingly, when allowing the within and between
coefficients to differ, we do find differing effects. In particular, with US$ based per
capita GDP, the within effect is much stronger than the between. This divergence is
likely picking up short term effects, where output growth is correlated with other
variables pushing up currency values. This pattern, however, is not present in results
derived from the PPP-based output data.
       Interestingly, the estimated elasticity of the price level with respect to per capita
income does not appear to be particularly sensitive to measurements of per capita
income. In all cases, the elasticity estimate is always around 0.25-0.39, which compares
favorably with Frankel’s (2006) 1990 and 2000 year cross-section estimates of 0.38 and
0.32, respectively.7
       One of the key emphases of our analysis is the central role accorded the
quantification of the uncertainty surrounding the estimates. That is, in addition to
estimating the economic magnitude of the implied misalignments, we also assess whether
the implied misalignments are statistically different from zero. In Figure 1, we plot the
actual and resulting predicted rates and standard error bands derived from the PPP-based
data. The results pertaining to US$ based per capita GDP data are qualitatively similar
and, thus, are not reported for brevity.
       It is interesting to consider the path that the RMB has traced out in the graph. It
begins the sample as overvalued, and over the next three decades it moves toward the
predicted equilibrium value and then overshoots, so that, by 2004, it is substantially

6
        Since the price levels being used are comparable across countries, in principle
there is no need to incorporate country-specific constants as in fixed effects or random
effects regressions. In addition, fixed effects estimates are biased in the presence of serial
correlation, which is documented in the subsequent analysis.
7
        Note that, in addition to differences in the sample, our estimates differ from
Frankel’s in that we measure each country’s (logged) real GDP per capita in terms
relative to the US rather than in absolute terms.

                                              6
undervalued — by 53% in level terms (greater in log terms). It is indeed a puzzle that the
RMB path is different from the one predicted by the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis. In
comparing the observations at 1975 and 2004, we found that countries including
Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore also experienced an increase in their income but a
decrease in their real exchange rates. On the other hand, Japan – a country typically used
to illustrate the Balassa-Samuelson effect, has a positive real exchange rate – income
relationship. We reserve further analysis for future study.
         In this context, we make two observations about these estimated misalignments.
First, the RMB has been persistently undervalued by this criterion since the mid-1980s,
even in 1997 and 1998, when China was lauded for its refusal to devalue its currency
despite the threat to its competitive position.
         Second, and perhaps most importantly, in 2004, the RMB was more than one
standard error—but less than two standard errors—away from the predicted value, which
in the present context is interpreted as the “equilibrium” value. In other words, by the
standard statistical criterion that applied economists commonly appeal to, the RMB is not
undervalued (as of 2004) in a statistically significant sense. The wide dispersion of
observations in the scatter plots should give pause to those who would make strong
statements regarding the exact degree of misalignment.


2.3      Controlling for Serial Correlation
         Notice that the deviations from the conditional mean are persistent; that is,
deviations from the real exchange rate - income relationship identified by the regression
are persistent, or exhibit serial correlation. It has an important implication for interpreting
the degree of uncertainty surrounding these measures of misalignment. Frankel (2006)
makes a similar observation, noting that half of the deviation of the RMB from the 1990
conditional mean exists in 2000. We estimate the autoregressive coefficient in our sample
at approximately 0.95 (derived from PPP-based per capita income figures) on an annual
basis. A simple, ad hoc adjustment based upon the latter estimate suggests that the
standard error of the regression should be adjusted upward by a factor equal to [1/(1-
ρ̂ 2 )]0.5 ≈ 2.




                                               7
        To provide a temporal dimension of the estimated misalignment, we trace the
evolution of the RMB level over time, its predicted value, and the associated confidence
bands adjusted to account for the serial correlation in Figure 2. The figure shows a
striking feature – after controlling for serial correlation, the actual value of the RMB is
always within one standard error prediction interval surrounding the (predicted)
equilibrium value in the last 20 plus years! Combining this result and the large data
dispersion observed in Figure 1, we have the impression that the data are not informative
for a sharp misalignment inference – not just for the recent period but for the entire
sample period.
        While the ad hoc adjustment procedure offers a more accurate assessment of the
degree of uncertainty surrounding the predicted level of misalignment, it gives no
information on the estimated real exchange rate-relative income relationship that is free
of serial correlation effects. In order to obtain estimates that are statistically correct in the
presence of serial correlation, we implemented a panel version of the Prais-Winsten
procedure.8 The results are reported in the third column of Table 1.
        The pooled OLS estimate using PPP-based per capita income indicates a short
run elasticity of 0.15, which is about one-half of the coefficient estimate without the
serial correlation adjustment. The implied rate of adjustment is about 0.93 and the
implied long-run elasticity is an implausibly high value of around 2. Relaxing the
assumption that the errors are the same across time and individual countries (i.e., the
random effects regression), we obtain a smaller short-run and hence long-run elasticity –
0.13 and 1.8, respectively. Since the Hausman tests rejects the orthogonality of the
constant and the right hand side variable, we also consider the fixed effects regression

8
        In essence, the Prais-Winsten method is an efficient procedure that incorporates
serial correlation into the estimation process. We also implemented the Arellano-Bond
approach that introduces lagged dependent variables into the model to account for serial
correlation. The validity of the Arellano-Bond depends on the use of “good” instruments
and the assumption that the number of time series observation is greater than the number
of cross-sectional variables. In the current case, the choice of instruments is a practical
issue and the time series dimension is smaller than the number of economies. In any case,
the Arellano-Bond result is qualitatively similar to the one based on the ad hoc AR1
adjustment – the procedure gives a much larger standard error for a comparable estimate
of undervaluation estimate given in Figure 1 These results are not presented for brevity.



                                                8
results. These indicate the cross-country elasticity as being 0.4 (that is the “between”
effect), and the short run elasticity 0.04 (not significant).
        Figure 3 shows the predicted RMB exchange rate based upon the pooled OLS
estimates. Two observations are in order. First, for most of the sample period, the actual
RMB value is within the one standard error prediction band – that is, the currency is
insignificantly different from its predicted equilibrium value. The result is similar to the
one depicted in Figure 2. Second, while the actual RMB value has been slightly below its
predicted value since the 1997 Asian financial crisis year, the two values virtually have
converged by 2004 and there is little indication of undervaluation. In fact, the 2004 actual
value slightly exceeds the predicted one; suggesting an overvaluation of 0.2 percent albeit
statistically insignificant. The surprising result is a consequence of taking serial
correlation seriously – that is dealing with the high degree of persistence in the real
exchange rate over time.
        That being said, most of the time, the actual exchange rate is within about one
standard error of the predicted, suggesting that the case for overvaluation is about as
strong (or weak) as the case for undervaluation.9 In other words, we can have little
certitude about RMB misalignment using this oft-used cross-country relationship
between the real exchange rate and per capita income, once issues of serial correlation
are explicitly accounted for.
        It is well-known that serial correlation, if not appropriately corrected for, can lead
to biased estimates and unreliable inferences. In the current exercise (illustrated in
Figures 2 and 3), serial correlation is handled using two different approaches and yet
yield similar inferences regarding RMB misalignment. Despite the apparent RMB
undervaluation, both cases show that adjustment for serial correlation effects results in a
much weaker case for a significantly undervalued RMB. In the next two sections, we
shift our attention to other factors that might mediate the real exchange rate-relative
income relationship.

  Frankel (2008) observes that the 5% significance level might be too stringent a criterion
in this context. For instance, a 50% significance level would be consistent with a
plus/minus 0.67 standard error band.

2.4    The Basic Specification Updated: The 2008 Vintage Data
       We now repeat our basic analysis, using the 2008 vintage of data. Recently, the
World Bank has reported new estimates of China’s GDP and price level in 2005,
measured in PPP terms. These estimates, based on the International Comparison Project’s
work, incorporated new benchmark data on prices. The end result was to reduce China’s
estimated GDP per capita by about 40%, and increasing the estimated price level by the
same amount. 10 Using the previous vintage of data, and our previously estimated
regression line, the RMB misalignment is eliminated.
       However, taking proper account of this issue involves a slightly more involved
approach. This is because data for many countries were substantially revised as well. This
means that we need to re-estimate the regressions. We report these results in Table 2.
       Focusing on the PPP based data, one finds that the pooled OLS results indicate a
smaller impact of income on relative prices than obtained using the earlier data. The
coefficient drops from 0.3 to 0.2. In fixed effects regressions, the between coefficient
drops while the within rises. Given the change in the sample period and the change in the
estimated coefficients, one would not be too surprised to find the estimated
misalignments change. However, the magnitude of the change in the implied
misalignment for the RMB is surprising. Essentially, as of 2006, there is no significant
misalignment, in either the economic or statistical sense. The undervaluation is on the
order of 10% in log terms, and the maximal undervaluation is in 1993.
       This outcome is clearly illustrated in Figures 4 and 5, where we present
scatterplots of the price level against per capita income (using PPP and USD conversion
rates, respectively), but utilizing the most recent data. These figures summarize our basic
finding: namely that the substantial misalignment – on the order of 40% – detected in our
previous analysis disappears in this analysis.
       One might take this development as justification for our earlier conclusions that
the statistical evidence for undervaluation was misplaced. However, our confidence
bands were drawn based upon sampling uncertainty. The revision in China’s position
reflects measurement error, which we did not take into account in our previous analysis.

        In Figures 6 and 7 we show the time series path for the RMB, against the
predicted value, and the two standard error bands (not accounting for serial correlation11).
It is clear from these graphs that there is no statistically significant misalignment.


3.      Analyses of Subsamples
        In the current and subsequent sections, we consider several variations of the basic
bivariate structure in order to assess the robustness of our findings. To simplify
presentation and conserve space, we focus on results pertaining to PPP-based output data
and omit plots of the estimated misalignment profiles. In general, the results are quite
robust to the choice of output data.


3.1     Developed/Developing and Income Stratifications
        In Table 3, we report the results obtained from developed and developing
countries. Interestingly, we find that the pooled OLS estimate is much larger for the
developed countries than for the developing. This is somewhat surprising, given the
widespread belief that Balassa-Samuelson effects are more pronounced in developing
countries. Furthermore, the F-test indicates that the GDP effects are significantly
different across the two country groups.
        We investigate further by estimating random effects models. For developed
countries, the GDP effect under the random effects model is slightly smaller than the one
under the OLS setting; 0.55 versus 0.65. The change in the case of developing countries
is much more dramatic, and the random effects model gives a stronger GDP effect.
        Using the developing country pooled OLS estimates, we find that the RMB is
about 9.0 % misaligned as of 2006. The actual rate is again within two standard errors of
the predicted.
        When we break the sample into finer categories – namely into high, middle, and
low income groupings – we find a pattern wherein the pooled OLS estimates are highest
in the highest income group, and declines with income grouping (Table 4). A formal F-



11
  Note that the serial correlation in the residual drops only slightly in this data set, to
about 0.94.

                                              11
test confirms that the estimated GDP effects are significantly different across these
income groups.
       Moving to the fixed effects specifications (which appear to be appropriate for the
middle and low income groupings) one finds that the elasticities are about the same, at
0.4, 0.3, and 0.5 for high, medium and low income groups. Table 4 also shows the
between effects’ estimate of the exchange rate-income elasticity of -0.18 for low income
countries, while the within effect is about a half. In other words, for low income
countries, there is substantial variation over time due to income changes.
       Using the middle income country estimates, we estimate the extent of RMB
undervaluation as close to 3.5 % at 2006.


3.2    The East Asian Economies
       One question that stands out in our view is whether East Asia as a whole is
distinguished from other countries in terms of its experience with real exchange rates. In
addition, we have some a priori idea that Africa at the very least behaves in a different
way than other developing countries. Hence, we also stratify the sample by regional
grouping. The estimation results in Table 5 and the F-test statistics in its Notes section
provide some evidence that there are indeed significant regional differences.
       Asia and Latin America do not differ substantially in terms of the pooled OLS
estimates, while Africa’s coefficient is very much lower. The random effects
specification is rejected by Hausman tests only in the case of Africa. Looking to the fixed
effects regressions for Africa, we find the between coefficient is essentially zero, while
the within coefficient is high.12 In sum, we conclude that it is important to differentiate
between country groupings.
       Using the Asia-specific coefficients, we find a 12.6 % undervaluation for RMB,
once again within the two standard error band.


3.3    Different Sample Periods




12
       See Devereux (1999) for an early observation of this pattern.

                                             12
       A third dimension along which to split the sample is along the time dimension. In
particular, we use a break point of 1992/93, approximately halfway through the full
sample.
       The results reported in Table 6 are quite interesting. According to the OLS results,
the slope coefficient is larger, by almost double, in the more recent period.13 However,
this result does not stand up to allowing for random effects. Since the Hausman test
rejects in both subsamples, we discuss the fixed effects estimates, which indicate the
between effect has indeed been quite strong over the last thirteen years, while the within
effect is lower relative to the earlier period. That is important, as we consider the fact that
Chinese per capita income has been rising rapidly over time. These results suggest that
the average per capita income is what is important in assessing under or overvaluation.
Using the pooled OLS estimate results, we find the RMB is undervalued by 5.6 %.
       Although our sample stratification scheme is not exhaustive, the results so far
inspire the following general observation: the GDP effect in the real exchange rate-
relative income regression varies across country groups and across historical periods.


4.     Beyond the Bivariate Framework
4.1    Demographics, Policy, and Financial Development
       One remarkable feature of the previous results, using the newest vintage data, is
the finding that the RMB is almost always undervalued by close 5-15% in log terms –
regardless of the sample used to make the assessment; moreover the null of no
undervaluation cannot typically be rejected. These findings could be driven by the fact
that the bivariate framework does not explicitly consider (short-run) internal and external
imbalances which might be associated with certain variables. In this context, the serial
correlation in the error term could signify the omission of serially correlated explanatory
variables. Even though we can econometrically fix the serial correlation problem (see
Section 2.3), it might be preferable to identify the relevant variables, in order to resolve



13
        The slope coefficient estimates from year-by-year regressions show a similar
upward trend. The slope coefficient starts with a low of 0.14 at 1975 and moves up
gradually to the high of 0.39 at 1995. Then it stays quite steady around the level of 0.36
for the rest of the sample.

                                              13
the problem in economic terms. These points suggest that one might want to broaden the
set of determinants.
        Once one moves away from a simple world where the per capita income
differential is a proxy for Balassa-Samuelson effects, a whole universe of additional
determinants suggest themselves. In particular, if the income variable proxies not only for
productivity differentials, but also non-homotheticity of preferences, savings
propensities, or impediments to the free flow of capital, then one would wish to include
variables that pertain to these factors. Hence we augment the relative per capita income
with demographics – under 14 and over 65 dependency ratios14 – and with an index of
capital account openness developed by Chinn and Ito (2006). Finally, financial deepening
is proxied by an M2/GDP ratio.15
        The results are reported in the first column of Table 7. Interestingly, the elasticity
of the price level with respect to relative income is drastically altered relative to the full-
sample bivariate regression estimates (Table 2); at 0.023, it is now close to zero.16 All the
other variables show up as significant, save the population share over 65.
        Overall, the results suggest that capital account openness decreases the
equilibrium value of the currency. Financial deepening also has a positive effect. This
result does not appear to be the consequence of a spurious “credit boom” effect, since the
“between” coefficient is more important than the “within” (or over time) coefficient.
        Using pooled OLS on this specification implies an 8.6% undervaluation in 2006
in log terms.


4.2     Capital Account Openness and Institutions




14
   See Rose and Supaat (2007) for a discussion. They focus on fertility rate, in their
model of the trade weighted exchange rate, as their key demographic variable.
15
   In our previous analysis, we included a government deficit variable because Chinn and
Prasad (2003) find that it explains part of current account balances over the medium term.
In the newest version of the WDI, there were many missing observations; hence, we
opted to exclude the fiscal variable, in order to maintain the sample size. Note that in our
previous set of results, the budget deficit was seldom statistically significant.
16
   The results are also substantially different from the corresponding results obtained
using the previous vintage of the WDI.

                                               14
       One oft-heard argument is that the Chinese economy is special – namely it is one
that is characterized by extreme corruption, as well as an extensive capital control
regime. We investigate whether these two particular aspects are of measurable
importance in the determination of exchange rates and, if so, whether our conclusions
regarding RMB misalignment are altered as a consequence.
       We augment the basic real exchange rate-relative income relationship with the
aforementioned Chinn-Ito capital account openness index. In addition we use the
International Country Risk Guide’s (ICRG) Corruption Index as our measure of
institutional development (where higher values of the index denote less corruption).
       The results are reported in the right half of Table 7. Since the corruption index is
very slow moving, with a small time-varying component, it does not make too much
sense to look at the fixed effects and random effects estimates. Focusing on the pooled
estimates from PPP-based output data, one observes that the per capita income
coefficient is largely in line with the previous estimates. Similarly, capital account
openness enters in negatively. On the other hand, the (lack of) corruption enters in
positively: The less corruption, the stronger the local currency.
       We include an interaction term to allow for varying effects of capital openness in
the presence of corruption. The estimates indicate that when capital account openness
increases in absence of corruption, then the currency depreciates. This finding implies
that when the capital account openness increases in the presence of relatively high levels
of corruption, the equilibrium value of the currency is higher.
       When we examine the time profile of the implied RMB undervaluation under the
current model specification, we find that the standard error bands are wider, and the
estimated degree of undervaluation commensurately smaller. In log terms, the
undervaluation in 2006 is somewhat smaller than in the previous case, 3.3%. In other
words, to the extent that lack of transparency is given at an instant, the RMB is still not
undervalued at conventional levels of statistical significance.
       In sum, these control variables help explain a small portion of the estimated
undervaluation reported in the previous section. However, when sampling uncertainty is
taken into consideration, we still end up with the same inference: there is no strong and
consistent statistical evidence of RMB misalignment in the recent sample period. Rather,



                                             15
the actual RMB value is in almost every case within the corresponding prediction
interval. It is also noted that, despite the added variables, serial correlation is again found
in specifications considered in Section 4.1 and 4.2.


5.     Some Concluding Thoughts
       While the empirical results thus far point to the difficulty in establishing the claim
that RMB is significantly undervalued, it is imperative to recognize that these results do
not constitute evidence of no undervaluation. Indeed, the statistical evidence is so “weak”
that we cannot reject a wide range of hypotheses. For instance, we could not reject the
null hypothesis that the RMB is 20% undervalued. In other words, the empirical
relationship is very imprecisely estimated. That is, the empirical models and data are not
sharp enough to allow a definite statistical conclusion.
       In addition, the drastic changes in the estimated degrees of misalignment highlight
the uncertainty that is attendant the data we use in these sorts of analyses. Unfortunately,
it is harder to account for this type of uncertainty than it is for model uncertainty.
       We should mention another shortcoming of our approach. Using our older data
set, our bivariate estimation results identify 83 significant overvaluation cases and 78
significant undervaluation cases. Most of these instances correspond to extreme political
and economic conditions. Interestingly, the real exchange rates of Thailand in 1996 and
Argentina in 2001 are identified to be insignificantly (in a statistical sense) misaligned.17
The evidence is possibly indicative of the model’s inability to reveal conditions before
financial crises and the imprecision of the estimates.
       This imprecision appears not to be unique to the current exercise, even though it
is often overlooked. Dunaway, Leigh, and Li (2006) make a similar observation from a
different perspective. These authors, using the RMB as an example, show that
equilibrium real exchange rate estimates obtained from the various approaches and
models commonly used in the literature exhibit substantial variations in response to small
perturbations in model specifications, explanatory variable definitions, and time periods.



17
       The bivariate estimation results indicate that a) the Thai baht was overvalued by
11.5% in 1996, and b) the Argentine peso was overvalued by 35% in 2001.

                                              16
That is, inferences regarding misalignment are very sensitive to small changes in the way
the equilibrium exchange rate is estimated.
        To this conclusion, we add the finding that the results can be very sensitive to the
data set used. The drastic change in our estimates of elasticities and implied
misalignments associated with the mere switch in the vintage of a data starkly highlights
this point.

Notes: The data covers 168 countries over the maximum of a twenty seven-years period from 1980 to 2006. The panel is unbalanced due to some
missing observations. ** and * indicate 1% and 5% levels of significance, respectively. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are given in
parentheses underneath coefficient estimates. For the fixed effects models, the F-test statistics are reported for the null hypothesis of the equality of
the constants across all countries in the sample. For the random effects models, the Hausman test statistics test for the independence between the
time-invariant country-specific effects and the regressor.
                 The third column labeled (Prais-Winsten) gives estimates from data with serial correlation removed using the Prais-Winsten
method. The AR1 coefficient estimate for the Prais-Winsten transformation is 0.943.

Notes: The PPP-based real per capita income is used. The data covers 159 countries over the 1980-1992
period, and 165 countries over the 1993-2006 period. The panels are unbalanced due to some missing
observations. ** and * indicate 1% and 5% levels of significance, respectively. Heteroskedasticity-robust
standard errors are given in parentheses underneath coefficient estimates. For the fixed effects models, the
F-test statistics are reported for the null hypothesis of the equality of the constants across all countries in
the sample. For the random effects models, the Hausman test statistics test for the independence between
the time-invariant country-specific effects and the regressor. The F-test for the equality of the slope
coefficients between the two sub-samples gives a test statistic of 136.705, which rejects the null
hypothesis of equality.

Notes: Under the heading “demographics, policy, and financial development” the sample covers 143
countries with data available between 1980 and 2006. Under the heading “capital account openness and

unbalanced due to some missing observations. ** and * indicate 1% and 5% levels of significance,
respectively. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are given in parentheses underneath coefficient
