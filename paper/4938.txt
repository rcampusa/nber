        This paper addresses a prominent empirical failure of the expectations theory of thetemi

smicture of interest rates under the assumption of rational expectations. This failure concerns

tL magnitude of slope coefficients in regressions of short rate (or long-rate) changes on long-

short spreads. It is shown that the anomalous empirical findings can be rationalized with the

expectations theory by recognition of an exogenous random (but possibly autoregressive) term

premium plus the assumption that monetary policy involves smoothing of an interest rate
instrument -- the short rate -- together with the responses to the prevailing level of the spread.

 I.         Introduction
       In a recent paper. McCallum (1994) argues that a prominent empirical

 puzzle involving exchange rate behavior——namely, the drastic apparent failure

 of uncovered interest parity-—can be rationalized as a consequence of

 systematic monetary policy behavior that has been ignored in most previous
 Studies.      Here it will be argued that a similar result is applicable in the

 context of an apparent failure of the expectations theory of the term
 structure of interest rates.          In particular, the failure of short—rate (and

 long—rate) changes to be related as predicted to prevailing long-short

spreads is shown to be a plausible consequence of monetary policy behavior

 that features interest rate smoothing in combination with policy responses to

movements in the long-short spread.2 This explanation is entirely consistent

with, but more general and more fully developed than, the one proposed in a

notable study by Mankiw and Miron (l986).

       The paper's organization is as follows.                 In Section II,         the

term—structure puzzle is reviewed and the paper's rationalization is

developed for the simplest two—period case.                Then in Section III, the
analysis is extended to long rates of greater maturity.           Additional evidence

is developed in Section IV and concluding remarks appear in Section V.

II.     Two—Period Case

       In this section     we consider the issue and our proposed explanation for

the two-period case, i.e., for the relationship between yields on one—period

and two—period bonds, denoted rt and R respectively.              Assuming      that the
securities     in question are discount        bonds, the expectations theory of the
term   structure posits      that the "long' rate R is related to rt and the
expected    future short rate Er.1      as   follows:4

(1)     R = O.5(r     +    Er,1)   +

               =
Here               E(rIc1)    with      =    {rt,   rt,,    R, R_1.   .   . . } so we are
assuming rational expectations.                 The term Et Is a "term premium' that is

often assumed constant.           Defining the expectational error Ct,i                 rt,   -

Er+1,     equation (1) implies

(2)       1/2 (rt —          (R   —   rt)   —         + 1/2
Then if       is assumed constant,                ,    the orthogonality of        with R and

rt implies that the slope coefficient                  in a regression of the form

(3)       1/2 (rt —   rti)    +   (R-1      —    rt)     +    disturbance,
should have a probability limit of 1.0.                       An estimated value significantly

different from 1.0 Is Inconsistent either with the expectations theory or one

of the maintained hypotheses.

      In fact,        It has been documented by many researchers that slope

coefficients tend to be well below 1.0 in post-1914 data for the United

States, often significantly so in terms of estimated standard errors.                    Point

estimates obtained in a number of studies are reported in Table 1.                    There we

see that the slope coefficient values are all well below i.0, with the

exception of Mankiw and Hiron's value for 1890—1914 and Campbell and

Shiller's final value.5 The former, which pertains to observations taken

before the founding of the Federal Reserve, will be discussed In Section IV.

The latter is accompanied by a rather large standard error and pertains to an

exceedingly long short rate.6

      One possible explanation for these findings Is, of course, that the

expectations theory is simply untrue——but the quantitative extent of the

discrepancy seems surprisingly large.                 Another possibility is invalidity of

the rational expectations (RE) hypothesis,7 but it seems unlikely that the

same general type of systematic expectational error would prevail over

different sample periods.         In any event, our proposed explanation is that

is not constant-—i.e., that there is a variable term premium—-and that

monetary policy is conducted In a manner to be explained momentarily.                     The

process generating               is assumed to be covarlance stationary but not

necessarily white noise. For specificity, the                process will be taken to be

autoregressive of order one (AR (1)1:

(4)         t Pet-i + Ut
Here ut is white noise and IpI<l.0. To this writer it seems implausible that

there would not be           period—to—period variability In the discrepancy term

      in (1), a term that reflects changes in tastes regarding the need fox-

financial flexibility and a myriad of other disturbing influences, none major

enough to justify separate recognition.                In any event, It is not the case

that the inclusion of a random                        disturbance in Ci)   converts    the

expectations theory into a tautology.                 That would be the case if       were

related to rt.             and R as in (1) without restriction. But Instead the

present asswnptlon is that                  is exogenous with respect to rt and R. This

reflects the idea that the expected one—period holding yields on one—period

and two-period bonds are equal up to a constant plus a random disturbance

term; that these yields differ from that constant only randomly.                  This is,

for the case at hand, the essence of the expectations theory.

          Regarding monetary policy, our hypothesis begins with the observation

that actual policy behavior in the U.S. (and many other nations) involves

manipulation of a short—term interest rate "instrument" or "operating

variable." Specifically, we assume that8

(5)         r ort_ + A(R     —
                                  rt)   +

where o a 0 is presumed to be close to 1.0 and X m 0 to be smaller than 2.

Thus there Is a considerable element of Interest rate "smoothing" —-               keeping
rt close to rt_i —— and also a tendency to tighten policy (by raisingr)

whenever the Spread R -          rt   Is higher than normal. Whether this reaction to
      —
          rt   occurs because the central bank views It as a good predictor of

future output growth or as a good indicator of recent policy laxity does not



                                                  4
matter for current purposes.          The final term (       reflects   other components of

policy behavior.           It would not impair our               analysis to    let      be

autocorr-elated, but it       would not help, either. Accordingly, we shall assume
that    t is   white noise.
         It   may be helpful to briefly consider the rationale for the
specification of policy behavior in (5).                 Regarding the rt_i term, there

exists some controversy regarding the reason behind central banks' proclivity
for     interest rate smoothing——and, Indeed, for their use of interest rate
instruments.       But there Is virtually no disagreement with the proposition
that the Fed——and other major           central banks——have in fact employed such

practices     during   most (If   not all) of      the last 40 years.0 (For some useful
discussion, see Goodfrlend (1991) and Poole                 (1991).)     In addition (5)
reflects      the assumption that the central bank          tends   to tighten policy when

the spread R—r is large. One possible rationalization is that the spread
is     an indicator of    monetary policy expansiveness, as suggested by Laurent
(1988), so that an        unusually   high value indicates the need for corrective

action.       A different idea is that the spread provides an indicator of the

state of the economy from a cyclical perspective.                   Various Investigators,

including Estrella and Hardouvelis (1991) and Mu (1993), have documented that

spread measures have predictive value for future real GNP growth rates.

Also, Hishkin (1990) has shown          that    a spread variable has some predictive

content for future inflation rates.             Thus an attempt by the central bank to

conduct a forward-looking countercyclical policy would call for a response of

the                          i.e., a tightening when R — rt is high.11
        type Indicated in (5),

Admittedly, In actual practice the Fed has used other predictor variables
instead of the spread. But to the extent that these and the spread are
useful predictors, the policy response would be much the same as implied by
(5).

       Relations (1) and (5) constitute only a portion, of course, of a

macroeconomic system.       But if we assume that the disturbances                   and      are

independent of those In the remaining relations, the system will be recursive

and the subsystem (l)(5) will determine rt and R without reference to the

other variables or shocks.         Whether the remainder of the model does or does

not feature relations of the XS—LM type Is irrelevant, for example, as Is the

extent to which prices of goods are flexible.                       Let us consider, then, a

rational expectations solution to the system (j)(5)•12

       Presuming that attention Is to be focused on the fundamental or

bubble—free solution yielded by the minimal—state—variable (MSV) criterion

discussed by McCalluxn (1983). we combine (1) and (5) to yield

(6)     (1 + ) r, =    art_t   + A [1/2 (rt + Etrt,1) + ) +

and seek values of the undetermined coefficients #0, #i. #2. and                     that will

provide a rt solution of the form



                                                                    (
(7)     rt = #0 + Øirti +          +

Clearly, the latter implies that Er,1 —                 +   •           + #irt-, +         + *t)
+ •2P so   we substitute these into (6) to obtain

(8)     (1 + A)[#0 + #trt_i + #t + #tI = ort_t + A [1/2(# + *,rt, +

        + #3t) + 1/2 (Ø +      #(#     + #irt_i    + #2't   + •3t)      + #2Pt) + tl +

ThUS for (7) to be a solution ——         to hold for all ,              Ct realizations ——    it
must be true that:

(9)     (1 + A) #0 = A00 + 1/2 A0t#0

        (1 + A) #i       + 1/2 A# + 1/2 A#12

        (1 + A) 02 =   1/2 A2 + 1/2 X#1#2 + 1/2 Ap2             +   A

        (1 ÷ A)      = 1/2 A03 +   1/2            + j

The second of these is satisfied by two values of #i. namely,



(10)      — (1 + A/2)       [(1 + A/2)2 —    2AoI"2
                              A



                                             6
but the MSV criterion implies that the one with the minus sign is relevant. 13

Then the remaining coefficients are straightforwardly given by the other

three equalities In (9).

       In analyzing the implications of this solution it will be useful to

emphasize the important special case involving u• =                                 1,   which is the value

suggested by interest rate smoothing behavior. When c                                    1, the HSV solution

for        becomes [(1 + J2) — (1 — AJZ))/A = A/A                                   1 and the other three

equalities in (9) are simplified considerably. They yield #                                    0,   #2    A/U
-
    pA/2), and , = 1             so the solution for rt is
                                         A
(11)     rt =   r_1      +
                             (1 — pAJZ)
                                                      +

Furthermore, Er,1 -                  rt      =   *2Pt so      we find that the spread obeys

(12) R —        rt   =   1/2     (Ere+, —           rt)   +       = (1 — pAJ2Y'E.

Finally,      equations (11) and (4) imply
                                 A
(13)     rt   — r1       =
                             1                        + 1                  ut +

so we can combine (12) and (13) to obtain

(14)     1/2(r —         rti)        =             (Rt    —
                                                       —pAJ2
                                                               rt_i)   +          Ut +

But here u and                   are uncorrelated with R1 — rt_i, so (14) represents a

population version of the regression described in (3).                                      Thus the slope

coefficient in (3) is a consistent estimator of pA/2, so the analyst should

anticipate a Slope well below 1.0.                                Indeed, if       were white noise, with

p =   0. a slope coefficient of zero would be implied —— even                               though relation

(1) is the main behavioral relation of the system. That result demonstrates,

I would suggest, not only that the usual regression test is inappropriate but

also that it Is misleading to think of the expectations theory in terms of

the "predictive content" of the spread for future changes of the short rate.

Such predictive content is not a necessary implication of that theory.

       In addition, a zero slope coefficient would be implied if A = 0,                                  i.e.,

if the central bank did not respond to the current value of the spread but



                                                                 7
simply set rt equal to rt_i (plus, perhaps, ).                 This   special case, of the

special case with o        1, represents the hypothesis of Mankiw and Miron

(1986)-—that the Federal Reserve has practiced interest rate smoothing and

thereby induced short rates to approximate a random walk process In their

behavior.   Our result strongly supports the general idea of the Mankiw and

Miron hypothesis, but shows that it holds even if rt behavior is not that of

a random walk.

     A few readers have remarked that (14) appears to be inconsistent with

the fact that a regression of form (3) should yield a slope coefficient of

1.0 in the special case in which the term premium               is a constant. But with
  = 1.0 in (5), a constant        implies that R —             rt   Is also constant-—see

equation (12).   Thus there is a degenerate regressor, in this case, so the

regression cannot be conducted. And in the case with 0 < 1.0, (14) does not

apply so again there is actually no inconsistency.

     Let us now briefly consider the situation with u• < 1.                 In such cases we

would need to include a non—zero constant term in (5) to permit a stationary

equilibrium with E = 0.      The solution In this case yields a relationship

analogous to (14) that is less tidy than the latter, and Includes additional

predetermined variables.    But it remains true that the probability limit of

the slope coefficient In a regression of rt —           rt.i    on R_, — rt_, is not in

general equal to 1.0 and is most likely to be smaller than 1.0; a
demonstration Is provided in Appendix A.              Accordingly, the same general

message applies as in the more tractable case with o                  1.     That message is

that the realization of (say) a positive value of                          will drive up R
relative to rt via (1).    But then R —       rt   will be negatively correlated with

the composite disturbances            +               In (3), implyIng that least—

squares estimation of (4) will yield a slope coefficient that has a

probability limit not equal to 1.0.

 ilL        N—Period Case

        Now we turn to the more interesting case in which the long rate, R, is

 for a bond with a maturity of more than two periods.                                  In this case an

approximation to the expectations—hypothesis relationship between R and rt
can    be written as
 (15) R —       N   E(R,1 —           = rt      +

where N+1 is a measure of the duration of the long rate.14                                  In (5) the
left-hand side is an approximation to the one—period holding return on the

long—rate bond, the inexactness arising because the term R should pertain

to a maturity one period less than that for R.                                  Thus for many-period

maturities, the approximation should be adequate. 15

        In this case the apparent empirical failure to be explained arises from

writing (15) as

(16)      N (R.1 —    R) = (R     —   rt)    —         +

where     c.1 =            — ER,1 is an expectational error that with RE is
uncorrelated with R and rt.             Thus if              were constant, the Slope coefficient
in a regression of N(R,1 -            R)            on R —    rt    should have a probability limit

of 1.0 according to the expectations theory.                             But such regressions again

actually yield slopes well below 1.0 with U.S. data.                              Indeed, the values

reported by Evans and Lewis ('1994) and Campbell and Shiller (1991) are

predominantly negative, as is documented in Table 2, and increase in absolute

value with N.

       As in the last section we assume that the policy reaction equation (5)

obtains with A<1/N and that                 =       Pet-i + Ut.6 Then        one can combine (5) and

(15) to obtain

the expression in (21) with the minus sign.17 Given this value, the second

in (21) becomes 1 - 2NA + N2A2                         (1 — NA)2.       Consequently, we have itj =        ((1   +

Consequently, we see that a regression of N(R — R_1) on                                      —   rtt   will

have a slope coefficient whose probability limit is N(Ap+p—1) or

—N(l—p(1+A)). Clearly. the latter will be negative except for very large

values of p and/or A, and will be larger in absolute value (for a given p)

with longer maturities (larger N).18                         In qualitative terms, both of these

characteristics match the results of Evans and Lewis (1994) and Campbell and

Shiller (1991) reported in Table 2.

IV.      Additional Evidence

       The paper by Campbell and Shiller (1991) concludes with an attempt to

provide a summary characterization of term structure behavior that would be

consistent with their battery of empirical findings, which Include many more

than those reported here.               In their words, The explanations we will consider

are not finance—theoretic models of time—varying risk premia, but simply

econometric descriptions of ways in which the expectations theory might fail"

(1991, p. 510).            In terms of the notation of the present paper, the two

summary characterizations considered are (for the two—period case)

(26)          —
                  rt           0.5 E(rt. —       rt)   + c + Vt.

where Vt is added noise that is orthogonal to Er.i —                        rt,   and

(27)          —
                  rt   =       k0.5E(r,t    —    rt)   + c

where k>1.   The latter "could be described as an overreaction model of the



                                                        12
yield spread,' according to Campbell and Shiller (1991, p. 513).                            They

explore the implications of these two summary characterizations of ways In

which the expectations theory might fail and conclude that (27) is consistent

with the data but that (26) Is not.

       Let us consider how these characterizations compare with the explanation

of the present paper.               Looking back at Section II, we see that equation (12)

is of a similar form to that of (26). but with the crucial difference that

in (12) is g orthogonal to Er,1 —                        rt.   Thus the inadequacy of (26) does

not serve to discredit the model of Section Il.                         Furthermore, using the

expression             —   rt   =   #2Pt   to eliminate         from (12) results In

(28)         R —   r   =   (1/pA)      Et(rt+i —   rt)
for the model of Section II.               But with O<A(2 and IpI<1, (28) Implies that k>1

in (27) if p is positive. So Campbell and Shiller's summary characterization
                                                                         19
is consistent with the present paper s rationalization.

       It was mentioned above that the slope coefficient reported in Table 1

for the years 1890 - 1914 was closer (than for more recent periods) to the

value of 1.0 that has been focused on in previous investigations.                      As Mankiw

and Miron (1986) emphasize, those years precede the founding of the Federal

Reserve System and therefore pertain to a period during which interest rate

smoothing behavior would be absent.                  In a similar vein, Kugler (1988, 1990)

finds that slope coefficients are closer to 1.0 for Germany and Switzerland

than for the United States during recent years. This result he attributes to

a smaller degree of interest smoothing behavior                      by the Bundesbank and the
Swiss National Bank. in comparison with the Fed, a hypothesized behavioral

difference that is consistent with the beliefs of many students of central

banking behavior.           Since the model in Sections II and III presumes a

substantial degree of interest rate smoothing, this paper's explanation is
                                                         20
consistent with both of these findings.

V.     Concluding Remarks

     The discussion of the foregoing paragraph suggests    that one   possible way

of conducting additional tests of this paper's hypothesis would be to

consider different monetary policy regimes corresponding      to   different time

periods for the United States and to different nations. Reaction functions

corresponding to (5) would be estimated and the implications of their

parameter values for the crucial slope coefficients then compared with values

of the coefficients obtained for these different regimes. Now, it may prove

possible to make some progress toward execution of such a study. There is,

however, a substantial difficulty that needs   to be   mentioned. Specifically,

it is the case that actual central banks do not respond only to term spreads

in deciding upon changes in rt.            Thus equation (5) represents a
simplification relative to actual behavior of the Fed, which almost certainly

responds to recent inflation and output or employment movements as well as

the spread.    So, if one were to attempt to econometrically estimate actual

reaction functions, then measures of inflation and output gaps would need to

be included.    But in that case values of these variables would need to be

explained endogenously, so the system of equations in the model would have to

be expanded. Furthermore, the dynamic behavior of inflation and output would

need to be modeled "correctly," which is an exceedingly difficult task given

the absence of professional agreement about short—run macroeconomic dynamics.

In short, this type of study would require specification and estimation of a

complete dynamic macroeconometric model.

     In light of the foregoing discussion it will be seen that, because of

the simplified nature of our policy equation (5), this paper's proposed

explanation might be regarded as more of a parable than a fully—worked—out

quantitative model.   I would argue, however, that this is not a source of

embarrassment, for most knowledge in economics is actually of the parable



                                      14
type.21    The relevant issue is whether a proposed parable Is fruitful in

understanding Important economic phenomena.     In this particular case the

proposed parable suggests that slope estimates in regressions of the form (3)

or (16) differ from 1.0 despite the validity of a versidn of the expectations

theory of the term structure. This version permits the holding—period yields

on securities of various maturities to differ by a random discrepancy that is

exogenous but perhaps serially correlated. The basic idea of the parable is

that the estimated slope coefficient is a composite parameter reflecting

policy behavior as well as the behavior of market participants, with the type

of   policy postulated involving interest rate smoothing and response to the

long—short spread, the latter reflecting important aspects of the state of

the economy.    The fact that essentially the same parable can   rationalize   a

major anomaly in foreign exchange markets must be regarded as a significant

mark In its favor.

 1The hypothesized form of policy behavior involves     smoothing of (relative)

 Interest rates. witl these rates used as Instruments, together with policy

 attempts to 'lean against" exchange rate changes. The analysis also assumes

 random disturbances——from varying risk premia——to the UIP relationship.     No
departure from rational expectations Is involved.

2General aspects of the failure are discussed        by Cook and Hahn (1990).

Campbell and Shiller (1991), and Evans and Lewis (1994), among others.

3SInce drafting this paper I have become aware of a study with a rather

similar objective by Rudebusch (1994). which is also intended to provide a

generalization of the Mankiw-Miron hypothesis.      The type of policy behavior

assumed there is quite different, however, as instrument settings are

responsive to current conditions In my setup but are determined exogenously

in his.         Most significantly, Rudebusch's analysis does not offer an

explanation for the empirical phenomena rationalized below at the end of

Section III and in Section IV.


4The relationship is exact, if the interest rates are based Ofl Continuous

compounding, or an approximation otherwise: see Shiller (1990).

    analogous result holds for the case of three—month and one—month rates;

see Kugler (1988, 1990).


6The Roberds, Runkie, and Whiteman (1993) results      are for treasury bills.

This study also reports results using Federal Funds and Repo securities and

finds one slope coefficient close to 1.0 for the former using the sample

period 1979. 10 — 1982. 10.


7This possibility has been explored, using survey data on expectations, by

Froot (1989).




                                      20
8For values of c less than 1.0, a constant term should also be included in

(5) if E = 0.      4e have not shown   it   here, however, because the case with o
=   1   will be featured below and because little interest attaches to the

constant term in any case.


91n what follows, A<2 will be presumed because such a condition seems

plausible and also because a theoretical issue, concerning the root of (10)

that gives the bubble-free solution, arises when A>2.          (On this issue see

Appendix B. )   But the solutions obtained below, and most of the analysis,

would continue to prevail with Aa2.


10Some analysts are dubious that the Fed's control over the one—day Federal

Funds rate translates into effective control over one—month or three—month

treasury bill rates that are the operational counterpart of rt in (5).        But

the evidence of Cook and Hahn (1989) suggests that three—month rates do, In

fact, respond within the day to policy—induced changes in the Federal Funds

rate.    Furthermore, if the Fed doubted its ability to control treasury bill

rates it could (given its holdings) operate directly in the treasury bill

markets. Consequently, doubts concerning the controllability of rt seem to

be unfounded.




                                        21
111n an influential recent publication, Goodfriend (1993) suggests that the

Fed regards (or should regard?) the long rate as an indicator of "inflation

scares,' behavior that sight be Interpreted as descriptive of a rule of the

form rt =     &rti   +   6(R    -        + t. The              latter can be written in the form (5)

by defining u =           61(1—B)        and A             01(1—0). but then dynamic stability

(non—explosiveness) requires 6<1—0 (assuming that 0<0<1).                               It is not clear

that Goodfriend would agree with the above formulation, however: another

possibility is rt              rt.., +   O(R      -    R.1)       +   . In       any event, the policy

behavior pattern In his article has a substantial degree of similarity with

formulation (5): both call for an increase In the short rate In response to a

ceteris paribus rise in the long rate.


12Students of the price level determinacy literature——e.g., McCallum (1981)

(1986), Dotsey and King (1983), Canzoneri, Henderson, and Rogoff (1985)--wlll

wonder about the absence of nominal variables in the system (1)(5).                             But the

price level can be brought in by adding (e.g. ) an IS—type relation in which a

                                    (Ep,1   —
real rate such as rt —                           Pt)      appears. Pt        being the log of the price
level.     Then determinacy of Pt will require the presence of an additional

term in (5), one that includes a nominal variable such as Pt or Ep+1 or

Pt-i.    Algebraic analysis becomes much more difficult because the counterpart

of (10) below will be a cubic in many such cases. But a cubic must have at

least one real root, so in principle determinacy can be investigated.                                My

examination of a case with Pt included in (5) indicates that determinacy

would be guaranteed unless o =                  1.0    exactly.         Thus for a close to 1.0, the

results would be approximately the same as those emphasized below.

'3mls    is   the root that yields 4, =               0   when o      = 0,   a special case in which It

is clear that rt1 would be an extraneous state variable [as discussed in

McCallum (1983)].




                                                          22
14For pure discount bonds, N+1 Is the maturity.


15Equation (15) can alternatively be written as R (1—6)E' Etrt,1, +            term
premium, with the summation from 0 to .         Thus the approximation amounts to

an infinite—maturity version of the linearization developed by Shiller

(1979), with N    .5/(1—).   This approximation has also been used by Shiller,

Campbell, and Schoenholtz (1983), Campbell and SMiler (1991), Fuhrer and

Moore (1993), and Hardouvells (1994).

16The condition A < 1/N is the counterpart of A < 2 in the two period case (in

which N   1) and is again presumed but not strictly required.        The larger is

N. the smaller will be A in equation (5) because only one A can prevail, but

many long rates can be considered.


17Again this is because with o' =   0,   rt_i should not appear in the solution for




18The policy parameter A would be expected to be smaller for larger N.        This

effect reinforces the tendency for the slope coefficient to increase in

absolute value with N.


19The foregoing discussion implies, incidentally, that there is actually

nothing bizarre or irrational about a finding expressible as k>1 in (27).


20For additional discussion of the Mankiw—Miron hypothesis, see Cook and Hahn

(1990).


21Consider the usual depiction of a production function as y =            f(n,kt),
where the symbols should not reqi1re definition.           Can this depiction be

considered anything more than a parable?




                                          23
                                                          Appendix A

        Here the concern is with the model                               of   Section II when o<1.0.             From (9),

we find that

(A-i)        rt =            + irti                  —pA/2
                                                                     +
                                                                              6
where 6 =    1   — (.p —          l)?.J2.       Then from (A—i) it follows that

(A-2)        Er,i -          rt    =           + (i — i)r        +       Ap/(5        —   pA/2)
and thus using (12) that

(A—3)             —   rt     =    (i/2)[         +   (    —   1)rt       +    (pJ(6        —   p/2))J   +

Now, equation (2) indicates that the plim of the slope coefficient on R -                                                  rt
in the regression (3) will equal 1.0 minus plim T'(R —                                                 rt)/plim T1(R -
rt)2.    Its value will be smaller than 1.0, then, If E(R                                          —
                                                                                                       rt)   is positive.

        From (A—3) it is clear that there are two components to E(R —                                                 rt).
One of these Is

(A—4)            pA.!2
                  — pAJ2           +   1)      o2
which is necessarily positive since the term in parentheses equals
              1 + (1 —
(A—5)
          1 + (1 - •1)A/2 — pAJ2

Here (1 -    1)A/2         is positive, since ,<1 when o<i (see below), and                                      pX!2tl.
Thus expression (A-5) is unambiguously positive. The second component is

(A—6)        (i/2)( —             1)Ert,
in which the term •               — I is         negative but will be small for o (and ,) close

to 1.0. To sign                        we use (A-i) and (4) as follows, assuming                                      0:

(A—7)        Ert E[0 +                     irt_,     +   #2t +
          = jErt.1            +
                                           2
                                                tErt.pt..t           +
                                                                                  2


Then since               =   Ertit.1,           we have
                                       2
             rt,t     —
                      —      ________
                             1    —

The latter is unambiguously positive since #2>0 and I#tpI<l. Thus the second

component is negative but will tend to be small relative to the first.




                                                              24
        It remains to demonstrate that •<1 when c<1. But we have found that
                  (j + A/2) —    + A/2)2 —
(A—9)

With O<o<i, we have 2A>2Xo>O so the terE in square brackets is positive and
                            2
larger than (1 -     A/2)       Thus the value of •i is smaller than when this term

equals (I — A12)2,    i.e., when o — 1.     But #i remains non—negative because the

term in brackets Is smaller than (1 + A/2)2.

mentioned In footnote 9, that would obtain with A ) 2.                               To see the Issue,

consider the case In which c•            1, so that the •           solutions         are [(1 + A/2)

(U   —
         A/2)2)"2)/A.        Denote these solutions as                         and           and define
     as ((1 + A/2) - ((1 — A/2)2)'"'2J/A for A ( 2.                        But then If A > 2, is

                                                                   A/2)1   —   1   or to [(1 + A/2) +

(1 — A./2)I/A = 2/A?       Note that the latter is suggested               by      the convention that

(22)1/2 is a positive number           regardless     of the sign of Z.               But   defining   the

relevant root as             =   I   for all A >      0 seems more appropriate than making

     equal to 1 or 2/A depending on whether A < 2 or A ) 2.                             Then equations

(11) —   (14) are valid even with A > 2.                   (Similar considerations apply to

equatIons    (21)   —   (25) if we permit NA > 1.)
