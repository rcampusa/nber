                     On the Interest Rate Elasticity of
                   the Demand for International Reserves:
                  Some Evidence from Developing Countries



                                  ABSTRACT



        Contrary to what is suggested by the theory, most empirical studies

on the demand for international reserves have failed to find a significant

(negative) coefficient for the opportunity cost of holding reserves.    In

this paper it is argued that the reason for this is that the opportunity

cost of holding international reserves has been measured incorrectly. In

the empirical analysis presented in this paper the spread between the

interest rate at which countries can borrow from abroad and LIBOR is used as

a proxy for the net opportunity cost for holding reserves. The results

obtained using data for a group of developing countries for 1976198O show

that when this net opportunity cost is used, the regression coefficient is

significantly negative.

      Theoretical studies on the demand for international reserves have

generally postulated that the quantity of reserves demanded by a particular

 country will depend, in a negative way, on the opportunity cost of holding

them.' Most empirical studies on the subject, however, have repeatedly failed

to find a significant relation between international reserves and their

opportunity cost. These results have puzzled for a long time economists that

have analyzed international reserves behavior, and a number of possible

explanations have been offered. For example ,      in   his well—known survey John

Williamson writes:

           "Various proxies for [the opportunity cost of reserves
      holdings] ... have been tried, with uniform lack of success.
      Possible explanations are that the proxies chosen are not good
      ones, that there is not in fact sufficient variation in the
      opportunity cost of reserve holding to permit statistical
      estimation, and that the interest elasticity of demand for
      reserves is low." (1973, page 696).

     Other authors ——   Bird   (1978, pp. 88—89), Frenkel (1984, P. 58) and

Edwards (1983, p. 279), for example —— have discussed this apparent insensi-

tivity of the demand for international reserves with respect to their

opportunity cost. As a result of these findings in most recent empirical

studies the opportunity cost variable has been dropped from the regression

analysis of the demand for international reserves.2

     In this paper the empirical relationship between the demand for

international reserves and the opportunity cost of holding them is re-

examined. It is argued that since international reserves are usually held in

the form of short—term interest bearing assets, the appropriate opportunity

cost of holding them is a net cost, which should be computed as the gross

income forgone by holding reserves minus the return obtained from holding

them.3 The analysis is performed using data from 17 developing countries for

1976—1980, and the results obtained indicate that when a net cost is used as
                                          2




the appropriate opportunity cost, the corresponding demand elasticity is in

most cases significantly negative as predicted by the theory.



I. The Opportunity Cost of Holding International Reserves

     One   of   the most difficult problems in the empirical analysis of

international reserves behavior has been to find an adequate measure for the

opportunity cost of holding them. Some authors lKenen and Yudin (1965), Kelly

(1970)1 have used income per capita as a proxy, and have found that its

regression coefficient has the "wrong" sign. Hipple (1974), on the other

hand, used the inverse of the gross marginal capital—output ratio as a proxy

for the opportunity cost of holding reserves, and found that the regression

coefficients either had the "wrong" sign or were insignificant. Courchene and

Youssef (1967) and Frenkel and Jovanovic (1981) have used the domestic rate of

interest as a proxy. While Courchene and Youssef (1967) found that in most

cases the regression coefficients were insignificant, Frenkel and Jovanovic

found a marginally significant negative elasticity of the demand for reserves

with respect to its opportunity cost. Other authors [i.e, Clark (1970b);

Frenkel (1978, 1980); Bilson and Frenkel (1979); Heller and Kabn.(197);

Edwards (1980, 1983)] have simply decided to drop the opportunity cost

variable from their empirical analyses.

     An important aspect of the opportunity cost of holding reserves, that has

been generally ignored in empirical studies, is that international reserves

are usually held in the form of short—term interest bearing assets.4 This

means that the actual opportunity cost of holding reserves is not, as most

authors have assumed, the (social) marginal product of capital in the country

under consideration. The correct measure of this opportunity cost will be a

net cost, given by the difference between the domestic marginal product of
                                         3



capital — which will capture the gross forgone income from holding resources

in the form of international reserves —, and the return obtained from holding

the reserves.

     From the perspective of empirical analysis, however, there are non-

trivial difficulties in computing adequate series for the net opportunity cost

of holding reserves. These difficulties are particularly serious for the case

of develop4ng countries. First, in most LDC's there are no reliable data on

the marginal product of capital, or on other alternative uasures for the

gross forgone income of holding reserves.5 Second, there are no data avail-

able on the composition of reserves, or on the return obtained from these

holdings. For this reason, any attempt to empirically analyze the relation

between the demand for reserves and its net opportunity cost requires finding

a proxy for this net opportunity cost.

     In this paper this problem is handled in the following form: First it is

assumed that, in equilibrium, the gross forgone income from holding one unit

of international reserves can be approximated by the cost at which that

country borrows from the international financial market. This assumption

follows from the well—known principle that countries will borrow from abroad

as long as the cost of borrowing is lower or equal to the (social) marginal

productivity of those funds.6 This is a convenient assumption, since it is

possible to obtain historical data on the cost of borrowing from Euromarkets

for a number of developing countries [see for example, World Bank). Second,

with respect to the return obtained on reserves holdings, it is assumed that

non—gold reserves earn a rate equal to LIBOR. This seems to be an appropriate

assumption since reserves are usually held in the form of highly liquid

assets, which earn a fairly low return. Cline (1983), for example, has

recently assumed that non—gold reserves holdings by developing countries earn
                                          4




1.5 percentage points below LIBOR. In the present study, then, it is assumed

that the net cost of holding reserves can be proxied by the differential

between the cost of foreign borrowing and the LIBOR rate.7 In section II the

results obtained from estimating demand for reserves functions for a group of

17 LDC's during 1976—1980 using this measure of the net opportunity cost are

presented.



II. Empirical Results

     Most studies on the subject have assumed that the demand for reserves is

a stable function of a small number of variables. In particular, it has

generally been assumed that the demand for reserves will depend positively on

the scale of the country (usually measured by GNP, y); positively on the

degree of opennes (usually proxied by the average propensity to import, m);

positively on the degree of variability of international payments (usually

measured as the coefficient of variation of export earnings, a); and

negatively on the opportunity cost of holding reserves.8 It should be noted

that some authors (Heller 1966, Reller and I1In 1978) have postulated that the

coefficient of the propensity to import       in   should be negative. Initially

this view was the dominant one. More recently however, this view has been

superseded on the basis of empirical evidence and the realization that the

sign of the openness variable will     depend on whether expenditure—switching or
expenditure—reducing policies are being pursued.

     Generally speaking, the results obtained from the estimation of demand

for reserves functions have been quite satisfactory, with most of the

regression coefficients ——   with   the exception of the opportunity cost variable

—   being significant and of the expected sign. These empirical studies,
however, have generally been more successful for the case of industrialized
                                            5




 countries. In the case of developing countries it has been found that for the

more recent period the coefficients of the openness variables and of a have

not been significant [Frenkel 1980, Edwards 1984b].

      In this section results from the estimation of a demand function for

international reserves for a group of 17 developing countries for 1976—1980

are presented. Following the literature on the subject it is assumed that the

demand for reserves (R) can be written in the following form:


     log R =     +      log )T + 2 log in       + $3 log a + $4 log r + w           (1)


where, as before, y is GNP expressed in U.S. dollars; in         is   the average

propensity to import; a is the standard error of the log of detrended export

earnings; r is the net opportunity cost of holding reserves, and for each

country it is measured as the difference between the cost of foreign borrowing

and LIBOR; and w is an error term with the usual properties. It is expected

that $1>0, $2>0, $3>0 and $4<0.
     The following countries were included in the estimation: Greece,

Portugal, Spain, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama,

Uruguay, Venezuela, Indonesia, Korea,   Malaysia, Philippines,    Thailand.arid

Morocco. The countries' selection was based on data availability; these are

the only developing countries for which data on the spread over LIBOR and GNP

were available for all the years considered in this study. See the Appendix

for the data sources.

     Equations of the type of (1) have usually been estimated using OLS on

cross—sections for each year (Frenkel 1974). In the present case, however,

the use of OLS is inappropriate since there is evidence that suggests that the

spread between the cost of borrowing and LIBOR (r) will be affected by the

international reserves to GNP ratio (Edwards 1984a).        For this reason a
                                       6                                 -




simultaneous procedure should be used in the estimation of (1). Table 1
presents the results obtained from the estimation of equation (1) using two—

stages least squares, for each year. Since the errors for each cross—section

equation are likely to be correlated across years (Frenkel, 1978), a joint—

generalized—least—squares procedure, that takes into account the error

covariance across equations, was also used.'° The results obtained in this

case are reported in Table 2.

     As may be seen the results obtained are quite interesting. First,

contrary to previous results it is shown that for most of the years considered

the coefficient of the net cost of holding reserves is significantly negative

at the conventional levels. Furthermore, the estimated elasticities of the

demand for reserves with respect to the net opportunity cost are quite large

in absolute terms, indicating that monetary authorities will generally under-

take substantial adjustments in their reserves holdings when the (net)

opportunity cost changes. Also these results indicate that the elasticity of

the demand for reserves with respect to income is not significantly different

from one. This contrasts with previous results that suggested that during the

Bretton Woods system there were diseccsnomies of scales in the holding of

international reserves by developing countries (Edwards 1983, 1984c). The

coefficient of the variability term c is never significantly different from

zero. This coincides with previous findings reported by Frenkel (1978) for an

earlier period, and indicates that during the recent period these LDC's have

not taken into account the variability of their export earnings when

determining the amount of reserves they want to hold. Regarding the openness

variable in,   its estimated coefficient is not significant at the conventional

levels.11

     It should be noted that the period considered in this study (1976—1980)

was characterized by rapid changes in the world economy —    the dollar sharply
depreciated in real terms, the second oil—shock took place, and there were

dramatic changes in the terms of trade between developing and industrial

countries. Possibly, those rapidly changing conditions in the world economy

explain why the hypothesis of a stable demand for reserves across time was

rejected (i.e., these equations cannot be pooled). This contrast with my

previous findings (Edwards 1983) using data for 1964—1972, where I showed that

the demand for reserves had been stable across time for a larger group of

developing countries.

     There is, however, an alternative explanation to the results reported in

Tables 1 and 2.   If when a country runs short of reserves it decides to

rebuild them using foreign borrowing instead of reducing absorption or

devaluing its currency, one would observe, as in these tables, a negative

relation between the cost of foreign borrowing (i.e., the spread over LIBOR)

and reserve holdings. This interpretation, however, assumes that reserves and

debt are "complements' in the adjustment process. There is, however, some

evidence suggesting that, in the case of developing countries, international

reserves and foreign borrowing have been used as "substitutes" during the

adjustment process. [See Eaton and Gersovjtz (1980) and Edwards (l984b)].



III. Concluding Remarks

     Contrary to what is suggested by the theory, most empirical studies on

the demand for international reserves have failed to find a significant

(negative) coefficient for the opportunity cost of holding reserves. In this

paper I have argued that the most likely reason for this is that the opportun-

ity cost of holding international reserves has   been measured incorrectly as
                                      10




the gross forgone income from holding international liquidity. I have argued

that since reserves are usually held in the form of short—term interest

bearing assets, the appropriate cost of holding reserves is a net cost given

by gross forgone income minus the return obtained from the holding of

reserves. In the empirical analysis presented in this paper I have suggested

that the gross forgone income can be approximated by the interest rate at

which a particular country can borrow in the international capital market.

The reason for this is that in equilibrium a country will borrow abroad until

the domestic (social) marginal productivity of capital is equal to the rate at

which it can borrow. On the other hand I have assumed that the return

obtained on reserve holdings can be approximated by LIBOR. Consequently, in

the estimations of the demand function for reserves the spread charged over

LIBOR has been used as a proxy for the net opportunity cost of holding

reserves. The empirical results obtained using data for 17 developing

countries for 1976—1980 indicate that when this net opportunity cost is used

in the analysis, a significantly negative coefficient, as suggested by the

theory, is found. Regarding the other determinants of the demand for

international reserves the results obtained tend to confirm, previous findings.

     'Most studies on the demand for international reserves have assumed that

reserves are held both to finance international transactions and as a buffer

stock to face unexpected payments difficulties. These studies have assumed

that the demand for international reserves is a stable function of a small

number of variables. For reviews of the literature on the demand for reserves

see, for example, Clower and Lipsey (1968), Gruebel (1971), Williamson (1973),

Ripple (1974), Edwards (1984b) and Frenkel (1984).

     2See, for example, Frenkel (1974, 1978, 1980, 1984), Bilson and Frenkel

(1979), Edwards (1983), and Reller and Kahn (1978). It should be noted,

however, that in a recent study Frenkel and Jovanovic (1981) found that the

opportunity cost of holding reserves was marginally significant in their

regression analysis. lyoha (1976) also claimed to have found a significant

coefficient for the opportunity cost variable. His results, however, have

been critized by Hipple (1979) and Shinkai (1979).

     3on this point see, for example, the discussions in Darby (1983), Edwards

(1983, 1984b), and Frenkel (1984).                              -


     41t is important to point out that while empirical studies have tended to

ignore the net cost of holding reserves, analytical discussions on the subject

have sometimes recognized this fact. See, for example, Reller (1966), Ripple

(1974), Darby (1983), Frenkel (1984) and Edwards (1983). See also Cline

(1983).

     5The problem, of course, is that in most developing countries the

domestic capital market is usually "repressed" and there are no reliable data

on domestic interest rates.
                                      13




     6 the relation between the cost of foreign borrowing and the domestic

marginal product of capital see, for example, Thirwall, (1978, p. 298—300) and

Williamson (1983, pp. 108—119).

     7Since the countries considered in this study are    small   open economies,

the opportunity cost measure — the difference between the borrowing rate and

LIBOR — can be interpreted as a risk factor. In this case, the spread over

LIBOR will be an adquate measure of the opportunity cost only if, as has been

suggested by Harberger (1976, 1980) among others, lenders and borrowers have

different perceptions regarding the probability of default. In particular, if

as Harberger (1980, p. 336) suggests borrowers perceive a lower probability of

default than lenders, these small countries will face an upward sloping supply

curve for foreign funds, and the spread over LIBOR will be an appropriate

proxy for the net opportunity cost of holding reserves.

     8See, for example, the discussions in Gruebel (1971), Williamson (1973),

Hipple (1974), Frenkel (1984) and Edwards (l984b). As mentioned, however,

most of the recent empirical studies have dropped the opportunity cost

variables. Also, empirical studies have shown that there was a structural

shift in the demand for reserve functions around 1973, when the international

monetary system abandoned fixed parities and moved towards greater exchange

rate flexibility.

     91n the estimations reported in Table 1 the following instruments were

used: debt—output ratio; average duration of foreign loans obtained by each

country; average value of foreign loans; investment—GDP ratio; current account

to GNP ratio, y, m and a. The estimation reported in Table 2 amounts to

re—estimating simultaneously the equations reported in Table 1 for all years,

taking into account the errors' covariance across years. These results

include the most recent data available. The reason for this is that in 1981
                                         14




the World Bank suspended the publication of Borrowing in International Capital

Markets. For some of the years data were available for a larger number of

countries. The results obtained in this case — not reported here due to

space considerations, but available from the author on request —   basically
confirmed the conclusions discussed in this paper.

     1°It should be noted that the results obtained were somewhat sensitive to

the instruments used. In particular, when some of the instruments listed in

footnote 9 were dropped, the signs and t—statistics of some of the variables

changed. Surprisingly, (sadly?), the problem of choosing instruments,

performing and reporting sensitivity analyses under different sets of

instruments has been largely neglected by econometricians.

during the recent period, for time series regressions that include the terms

of trade and other cyclical variables.
