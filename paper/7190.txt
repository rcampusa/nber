Education for Growth in Sweden and the World
Alan B. Krueger and Mikael Lindahi
NBER Working Paper No. 7190
June 1999

                                           ABSTRACT
        This paper tries to reconcile evidence on the effect of schooling on income and on GDP
growth from the microeconometric and empirical macro growth literatures. Much microeconometric
evidence suggests that education is an important causal determinant of income for individuals within
countries as diverse as Sweden and the United States. At a national level, however, recent studies
have found that increases in educational attainment are unrelated to economic growth. This finding
is shown to be a spurious result of the extremely high rate of measurement error in first-differenced
cross-country education data. After accounting for measurement error, the effect of changes in
educational attainment on income growth in cross-country data is at least as great as
microeconometric estimates of the rate of return to years of schooling. We also investigate another
finding of the macro growth literature -- that economic growth depends positively on the initial stock
of human capital. We find that the effect of the initial level of education on growth is sensitive to
the econometric assumptions that are imposed on the data (e.g., constant-coefficient assumption),
as well as to the other covariates included in the model. Perhaps most importantly, we find that the
initial level of education does not appear to have a significant effect on economic growth among
OECD countries. The conclusion comments on policy implications for Sweden based on the human
capital literature.

         Research on the economic effects of education

 estimates of the monetary return to schooling that exploit natural experiments in which
 variability in workers' schooling attainment was generated by some exogenous and
                                                                                             arguably

                                                                                            a college.
 These studies tended to find that education is an important determinant of income. On the other

 hand, the macro growth literature has found that changes in average schooling levels across
countries are unrelated to the speed of economic growth, although the initial level of schooling is
related to the countries' subsequent GDP growth rate. This paper tries to reconcile these two

disparate but obviously related lines of research.
     The next section reviews the theoretical and empirical foundations of the Mincerian
human capital earnings function. Our survey of the literature indicates that Mincer's (1974)
formulation of the log-linear earnings-education
                                                      relationship fits the data rather well. Each
additional year of schooling appears to raise earnings by 5 to 15 percent, depending
                                                                                     on the
country, with the United States on the high end and Sweden on the low end of the distribution.
The rate of return to education varies over time as well as across countries. Perhaps
                                                                                        surprisingly,
there is little evidence that unobserved variables
                                                     (e.g., inherent ability) that might be correlated
with earnings and education cause simple OLS estimates of wage equations to
                                                                                   significantly
overstate the return to education in most countries. Indeed, consistent with Griliches's (1977)
conclusion, much of the modem literature finds that the upward "ability bias" is of about the
same order of magnitude as the downward bias caused by measurement error in educational

attainment. Evidence on possible differences in the payoff to investments in human capital
across subgroups of the work force is also discussed.
       Section 2 considers the empirical macro growth literature. First, we relate the Mincerian

wage equation to the macro growth model. The Mincer model implies that the change in a
country's average level of schooling should be the key determinant of income growth. The
                                                          growth as a function of the initial level of
macro growth literature, by contrast, typically specifies
education, not the change in education. Moreover, we show that if the return to education
changes over time (e.g., because of exogenous skill-biased technological change), the macro
                                                                                        the
growth models are unidentified. Much of the empirical growth literature has eschewed
Mincer model because studies such as Benhabib and Spiegel (1994) find that the change in
 education is not a determinant of economic growth. We show, however, that Benhabib and
 Spiegel's finding that the growth in education is unrelated to economic growth results because
 there is virtually no signal in their education data conditional on the growth of capital.
         The macro growth literature has devoted only passing attention to problems caused by

 measurement errors (that is, mistakes) in estimated average education. Despite their aggregate
 nature, available data on average schooling levels across countries are poorly measured, in large
                                                                       The reliability of

  average education across 68 countries in 1985 is 0.86, and the correlation between
  schooling between 1965 and 1985 from these two sources is only 0.34. Additional estimates of
                                                                                            data

 recognized that workers who attended school longer may possess inherent abilities that would
 lead them to earn higher wages irrespective of their level of education. If these other
 characteristics are not accounted for, then simple comparisons of earnings across individuals
with different levels of schooling would overstate the rate of return to education. Early attempts
to control for this "ability bias" included the analysis of data on siblings and twins to difference-
out unobserved family characteristics (e.g., Gorseline, 1932 and Taubman, 1976), and regression
analyses which included as control variables observed characteristics such as IQ and parental
education (e.g., Griliches and Mason). By now this literature has been amply surveyed in
Griliches (1977), Rosen (1977), Willis (1986), and Card (1998). Below we briefly review
evidence on the Mincerian earnings equation, emphasizing recent studies that use exogenous
variation in education to estimate the Mincerian earnings equation.


1.1 The Mincerian wage equation
         Mincer (1974) showed that if the only cost of attending school an additional year is the
opportunity cost of students' time, and if the proportional increase in earnings caused by this
additional schooling is constant over the lifetime, then the log of earnings would be linearly
related to individuals' years of schooling, with the slope equal to the rate of return to investment
in education.2 He augmented this model to include a quadratic term in work experience to allow
for returns to on-the-job training, yielding the familiar Mincerian wage equation:

(1) lnW1= p0+         5+ f32X1+ 33X12+ ,
where   in W is the natural log of the wage for individual i, S. is years of schooling, X, is
experience (usually measured as age minus education minus 6), X12 is experience squared, and
is a disturbance term. With Mincer's assumptions, the coefficient on schooling, 13, equals the
discount rate, because schooling decisions are made by equating two present value earnings
streams: one with a higher levei of schooling and one with a lower level. An attractive feature of

2This insight is also in Becker (1964) and Becker and Chiswick (1966), who specify the cost of investment in
human capital as a fraction of earnings that would have been received if the investment were not made.
                                                         6
  Mincer's model is that time spent in school (as opposed to degrees) is the key determinant of

  earnings, so data on years of schooling can be used to estimate a comparable return to education
  in countries with very different educational systems.

             There are, of course, other theoretical models that could yield a log-linear
                                                                                                             earnings-
  schooling relationship. For example, if the underlying production function between human
  capital and earnings is log-linear, and individuals randomly choose their schooling level (e.g.,
  optimization errors), then the coefficient from equation (1) would uncover the educational
  production function. The slope of the earnings-education gradient would then vary with the
 quality of education (see Behrman and Birdsall, 1986 and Card and Krueger, 1996).

       The Mincerian earnings function is one of the great success stories of empirical
 economics. Equation (1) has been estimated for most countries of the world by OLS, and the
 results generally yield estimates of            ranging from .05 to .15, with slightly larger estimates for
 women than men (see Psacharopoulos, 1995). A coefficient of .05, for example, should be
 interpreted as meaning that acquiring an additional year of education is associated with 5 percent

 higher earnings, other things being equal. The log-linear relationship also provides a good fit to
 the data, as is illustrated by the plots for the U.S., Sweden, West Germany, and East Germany in

 Figure i? These figures display the coefficient on dummy variables indicating each
                                                                                                              year of
 schooling, controlling for experience and gender, as well as the OLS estimate of the Mincerian
return. It is apparent that the semi-log specification provides a good description of the data even
in countries with dramatically different
                                                 economic and educational systems.4 Notice also that in
3The German figures are from Krueger and Pischke (1995). The American and Swedish figures are based on the
authors' calculations using the 1991 March Current Population Survey and 1991 Swedish Level of Living Survey.
The regressions also include controls for a quadratic in experience and sex.

4Evaluatirig micro data for states over time in the U.S., Card and Krueger (1992) fmd that the earnings-schooling
relationship is flat until the education level reached by the 2nd percentile of the education distribution, and then
becomes log-linear. There is also some evidence of sheep-skin effects around college and high school completion
(e.g., Park, 1994). Although statistical tests often reject the log-linear relationship for a large sample, the figures
clearly show that the log-linear relationship provides a good approximation to the functional form. It should also be
noted that Murphy and Welch (1990) find that a quartic in experience provides a better fit to the data than a
quadratic.

                                                          7
 Sweden the slope of the relationship between earnings and education is relatively flat, probably a
 result of institutional forces that compress wage dispersion in Sweden.

         Much research has addressed the question of how to interpret the slope of the education
 variable in equation (1). Does it reflect unobserved ability and other characteristics that are
 correlated with education, or the true reward that the labor market places on education? Is
 education rewarded because it is a signal of ability (Spence, 1973), or does the labor market
 value education because it increases productive capabilities? Is the social return to education
 higher or lower than the coefficient on education in the Mincerian wage equation? Would all
 individuals reap the same proportionate increase in their earnings from attending school an extra
 year, or does the return to education vary systematically with individual characteristics?
 Definitive answers to these questions are not available, although the weight of the evidence
 clearly suggests that education is not merely a proxy for unobserved ability. For example,
 Griliches (1977) concludes that instead of finding the expected positive ability bias in the return
to education, "The implied net bias is either nil or negative" once measurement error in education
is taken into account. The more recent evidence from natural experiments also supports this
conclusion.

        Table 1 summarizes estimates of the return to education based on natural experiments. A
hallmark of these studies is that the variations in educational attainment used to identify the
return to education stem from a known and arguably exogenous source. For example, Angrist
and Krueger (1991) observe that the combined effect ofschool start age cutoffs and compulsory

schooling laws produces a natural experiment, in which individuals who are born on different
days of the year start school at different ages, and then reach the compulsory schooling age at
different grade levels. If the date of the year individuals are born is unrelated to their inherent
abilities, then, in essence, variations in schooling associated with date of birth provide a natural
experiment for estimating the benefit of obtaining extra schooling in response to compulsory
schooling laws.

           Using a sample of nearly one million observations from the U.S. Censuses, Angrist and
  Krueger find that men born in the beginning of the calendar year, who start school at
                                                                                                    a relatively
  older age and can dropout in a lower grade, tend to obtain less schooling. This
                                                                                            pattern only holds
  for those with a high school education or less, consistent with the view that
                                                                                    compulsory
  schooling is responsible for the pattern. They further find that the pattern of education
                                                                                                             by
  quarter-of-birth is mirrored by the pattern of earnings by quarter-of-birth: in particular,
  individuals who are born early in the year tend to earn less, on average.5 Instrumental variables
  (IV) estimates that are identified by variability in schooling associated with
                                                                                              quarter-of-birth
 suggest that the payoff to education is slightly higher than the OLS estimate.6 Angrist and
 Krueger conclude that the upward bias in the return to schooling is about the same order of
 magnitude as the downward bias due to measurement error in schooling.
        The other studies listed in Table 1 use a variety of other sources of variability in
 schooling. Harmon and Walker (1995), for example, more directly examine the effect of
 compulsory schooling by studying the effect of changes in the compulsory schooling age in the
 United Kingdom, while Card (1995a) exploits variations in schooling attainment
                                                                                                    owing to
 families' proximity to a college in the U.S. The evidence summarized in the table is drawn from
several countries, and generally supports the conclusion that the private return to education is
                                                                                                             at
least as great as simple OLS estimates would suggest.

         The evidence specifically for Sweden is more limited, but suggests that the private payoff
to education in Sweden is positive but lower than in most of the rest of the world. For example,

Kjellstrom (1997) uses register earnings data to estimate the payoff to years of schooling in 1991
for men. Controlling for family background, experience, school grades, and test
                                                                                           scores at age 12-

5Again, no such pattern holds for college graduates.

Bound, Jaeger and Baker (1995) argue that Angrist andKrueger's IV estimates are biased toward the OLS estimates
because of weak instruments. However, Staiger and Stock
                                                        (1997), Donald and Newey (1997), Angrist, Imbens and
Krueger (1998), and Chamberlain and Imbens (1996) show that weak instruments do not account for the central
conclusion of Angrist and Krueger (1991).

  13, he finds that the return to a year of education varies between .037 and .05 1, depending
                                                                                                 on the
  birth cohort. Using register data on earnings for identical twins in 1987,
                                                                             1990, and 1993,
  Isacsson (1999) finds that the cross-twin OLS estimate of the return to education is
                                                                                         .046, and that
  the within-twin estimate is .022. When he adjusts the within-twin estimate for
                                                                                 measurement
 error in education, however, the return rises to .042, suggesting little downward ability bias.
 Similar to the U.S. literature, Ottersten, et al. (1996) find that the return to education in
                                                                                               Sweden
 falls by about 10 percent when they estimate
                                                   a parametric sample selection model. Meghir and
 Palme (1999) find that the return to years of education stemming from increases in
                                                                                          compulsory
 schooling is about the same order of magnitude as the cross-sectional estimate of the return to
 schooling in Sweden (see the last row of Table 1). They also find evidence that men with higher
 ability tend to earn higher returns to education. Using cross-sections from the Swedish Level of

 Living Surveys (LNU), Palme and Wright (1999) find that the payoff to education fell for both
 men and women from .08 in 1968 to .03-.04 in 1981, and stayed roughly constant between 1981
 and 1991. Edin and Holmlund (1995) also find that the college-high school
                                                                                  wage differential
(both before, and especially after, tax) fell considerably between 1968 and 1984, and then rose
gradually rose between 1984 and 1991. In sum, these studies paint a picture of education in
Sweden that is broadly similar to the rest of the world: the OLS estimate of the
                                                                                      return to
education does not appear to be severely affected by ability bias, although the payoff workers

gain from attaining additional education in Sweden is lower than in most other countries that
have been carefully studied.



1.2 Differences in the payoff to human capital across groups
       The studies listed in Table 1 typically find somewhat higher estimates of the return to
schooling when variability in schooling from exogenous circumstances is used to estimate the
return than when all variability is used. Although the difference between the OLS and IV
estimates is not statistically significant in most of these studies, there is at least a hint that

                                                10
 students who complete more schooling than they would ordinarily choose earn a higher return for
 that schooling than others do from the years they voluntarily selected. Ashenfelter, Harmon and

 Oosterbeek (1998) assemble estimates from many of the studies in the literature, and find that the

 average conventional OLS return to schooling is .065, whereas theaverage IV estimate is .086.

         One possible explanation for the tendency of IV estimates to exceed OLS estimates is that
 IV estimates are more likely to be published when they obtain statistically significant, positive
 coefficients, since there is a presumption that the return to schooling should be positive. Because
 the IV studies tend to have relatively imprecise estimates, there may be a selection process at
 work which leads to an over-representation of IV studies with relatively large returns to
 education in the literature: a larger coefficient is required to have a significant t-ratio the larger

 the standard error. Ashenfelter, Harmon and Oosterbeek (1998) provide some evidence for this
type of selection by showing that the return to education from various IV estimates is positively
related to the standard error of the estimates; absent some form of selection, there is no reason to

expect the true return to education to be correlated with its standard error. Once they adjust for

this form of selection bias, however, they still find that thereturn to education is higher in the IV
estimates on average than in the OLS estimates (.080 versus .065).

        We tentatively conclude from this evidence that the return to an additional year of
education obtained for reasons like compulsory schooling is more likely to be greater than, than

less than, the conventionally estimated return to schooling. Because the schooling levels of
individuals who are from more disadvantaged backgrounds tend to be those who are most
affected by the interventions examined in Table 1, Card (1995b) and others have concluded that
the return to an additional year of schooling would be higher for individuals from disadvantaged
families than for those from advantaged families.

       Other related evidence for the U.S. suggests the payoff to investments in education might

be higher for more disadvantaged youth. First, while studies of the effect of school resources on
student outcomes yield mixed results, there is a tendency to find more beneficial effects of school

                                                 11
  resources on more disadvantaged students (see, for example, Summers and Wolfe, 1977,
  Krueger, 1998 and Rivkin, Hanushek and Kain, 1998). Second, evidence
                                                                       suggests that pre-
  school programs have particularly large, long-term effects for disadvantaged children
                                                                                                         in terms of
  reducing crime and welfare dependence, and
                                                        raising incomes (see, Barnett, 1992). Third, several
  studies have found that students from
                                             advantaged and disadvantaged backgrounds make
  equivalent gains on standardized tests during the school year, but children from disadvantaged
  backgrounds fall behind during the summer while children from advantaged backgrounds
                                                                                                                  move
 ahead (see Entwisle, Alexander, and Olson, 1997). And fourth, recent evidence
                                                                                suggests that
 college students from more disadvantaged families benefit
                                                            more from attending elite colleges
 than students from advantaged families (see Dale and Krueger, 1998).

          Another finding from the U.S. that may have some bearing on Sweden concerns adult
 education and training. Studies of job training programs utilizing randomized
                                                                                                      design have
 typically found modest payoffs for disadvantaged adult males, and larger payoffs for
 disadvantaged women (see, e.g., LaLonde, 1995). Evidence on formal adult education is less
 extensive, but also suggests normal rates of return to adults who return to school after
                                                                                                              being
 displaced. For example, Jacobson, LaLonde and Sullivan (1997) study the experience of workers
 in Pennsylvania and Washington who lost a job that they held for three or more
                                                                                                  years, and then
entered a community college. Typically, workers completed 8 months to a year of education.
They found that the trainees' earnings increased by 2-5 percent more than other workers who did

not enter a community college, but the payoff was substantially higher for those who
                                                                                                          prepared
for jobs in certain technical fields and the health
                                                              professions. Angrist and Newey (1991) also
find that the increase in earnings
                                            experienced by young men who returned to school after
entering the labor market is about as large as conventional estimates of the payoff to education.
         It is unclear whether the evidence of a higher return to human capital for disadvantaged
youth applies outside the U.S. But in all regions of the world, Psacharopolous (1995) concludes
7Evidence on training effects for Sweden is consistent
                                                       with the U.S. experience; see, for example, Forsiund and
Krueger (1997).

  that there is a higher return to primary schooling than to secondary or
                                                                            tertiary schooling, which
  also suggests disadvantaged children benefit most from additional human capital investments.


  1.3 Theoretical reasons for a higher return for investments in
                                                                     disadvantaged groups
         If one tentatively accepts the finding that the return to investments in human
                                                                                        capital is
  higher for less advantaged individuals, what might explain such a phenomenon? Card
                                                                                      (1995b)
  and Lang (1993) present models in which individuals from lower income households have
                                                                                        higher
 discount rates. Since individuals select their level of schooling by
                                                                      equating the payoff to
 schooling to the discount rate, individuals from low-income
                                                                  households naturally have higher
 returns to schooling in these models.

         We would propose a complementary explanation, which can also encompass the related
 facts about the return to human
                                   capital for disadvantaged groups mentioned above. In particular,
 recognize that children acquire human capital from
                                                      many sources, including parents, teachers and
 classmates. To some extent, the human capital from these sources may be substitutable. If
                                                                                           an
 individual from a high-income family, for
                                              example, receives poor reading instruction at school,
the family may compensate by providing tutoring. Low-income families have less
                                                                                   scope to
substitute home resources for schooling resources, and have home environments that
                                                                                    are less
conducive to learning, which might explain why pre-school programs are successful for these
students. It might also be the case that the educational production function is
                                                                                concave, so
students who are at the low end of the ability distribution because of their endowments benefit

more from additional human capital than students at thehigh end.

       Inherently, both these explanations rely on some form of imperfect capital markets
because, if families were not constrained, they would invest in human capital until the point at
which the marginal benefit equals the (universal and constant) marginal cost. But there are
reasons to doubt that the supply of funds for investing in human capital is infinitely elastic at the
market rate for all families. Many authors have noted that future human capital caimot be used
                                                                                                  to

collateralize loans because of moral hazard problems.           Perhaps more importantly, poorly
endowed families may underestimate the value of education -- after all, education is purchased to

improve information and decision making, and those with a low level of education may be
particularly susceptible to making suboptimal decisions.


1.4 Social versus Private Returns to Education
          Thus far, the discussion has focused on the private return to education. The social return
can be higher or lower than the private return. The social return can be higher because of
externalities from education, which could occur, for example, if higher education leads to
technological progress that is not captured in the private return to that education, or if more
education produces positive externalities, such as a reduction in crime and welfare participation,
or more informed political decisions. The former is more likely if human capital is expanded at
higher levels of education while the latter is more likely if it is expanded at lower levels of
education. It is also possible that the social return to education is less than the private return.
For example, Spence (1973) and Machlup (1970) note that education could just be a credential,
which does not raise individuals' productivities. It is also possible that in some developing
countries, where higher education has been associated with a greater incidence of unemployment

(e.g., Blaug, Layard and Woodhall, 1969) and the return to physical capital may exceed the
return to human capital (e.g., Harberger, 1965), increased levels of education may reduce total
output.
          Most of the micro human capital literature focuses on the private rather than social return
to education, but the finding of little ability bias in the Mincerian wage equation casts doubt on at
least some forms of credentialling arguments. The possibility of externalities to education
motivates much of the macro growth literature, to which we now turn.

      Now, feducation produces not only differences in individual capacities but also
      new knowledge resulting in continuous technological, managerial andorganizational
      improvements, the growth in national product due to these improvements can
      reasonably be regarded as an additional contribution of education.

                                                    Fritz Machlup, 1970
        If, as Griliches (1977) observed, the micro human capital earnings function spawned "a
vast river of econometric studies threatening to engulf us all," then it could be argued that the
new macro growth literature has generated a Tsunami of cross-country regression studies
threatening to wash us all away. The literature is voluminous. We do not attempt an exhaustive
review here.       Instead, we summarize the main findings and explore the impact of several
econometric issues.

        The macro growth literature yields three principally different conclusions from the micro
literature. First, the initial stock of human capital matters, not the change in human capital.
Second, secondary and post-secondary education matter more for growth thanprimary education.
Third, female education has an insignificant and sometimes negative effecton economic growth.


2.1 The Mincer Model and the Macro Growth Model

       The typical macro growth model estimated in the literature is motivated by the
convergence literature. This leads to interest in estimating parameters of an underlying model
such as Ay =          -          + ji, where Ay denotes the annualized change in log GDP per
capita in country j between t-1 and t, a denotes country j's steady-state growth rate, y1 is the
log of initial GDP per-capita, y* is steady-state log GDP per capita, and 3 measures the speed of
convergence to steady-state income. The intuition for this equation is straightforward: countries
that are below their steady-state income level should grow quickly, and those that are above it

should grow slowly. A prototypical estimating equation is:
(2) Ay =   f30   + f31y + 132SJI +      +


                                               15
where y is the change in log GDP per capita from year t-1 to t, S1 is average years of schooling
in the population in the initial year, Yti is the log of initial GDP per capita, and 4 includes
variables such as inflation, capital, or the "rule of law index.'8 Sometimes equation (2) also
includes an interaction between years of schooling and initial log GDP, to allow the rate of
convergence to vary across countries with different education levels. Also note that schooling is
sometimes specified in logarithmic units in equation (2). Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995),
Benhabib and Spiegel (1994), and others conclude that the change in schooling has an
insignificant effect if it is included in a GDP growth equation, even though this variable is
predicted to matter in the Mincer model and in some endogenous economic growth models (e.g.,

Lucas, 1988). Equation (2) is typically estimated with data for a cross-section or pooled sample
of countries spanning a 5, 10, or 20 year period.

         The Mincer model in equation (1) can be aggregated to the country level, yielding what
Heckman and Klenow (1997) call the "macro Mincer model." The dependent variable of the
macro Mincer model is the log of the geometric mean of earnings, and the key explanatory
variable is mean years of schooling (taken over all levels) for the workforce. If this equation
holds in year t and t- 1, differences over time can be taken for each country, and the countries can

be pooled together. The first-differenced macro-Mincer equation differs from the macro growth
equation typically estimated in the literature in several respects. First, the macro growth models
use the change in log GDP per capita as the dependent variable, rather than the change in the
mean of log earnings. If income has a log normal distribution with a constant variance over time,
and if labor's share is also constant, then aggregating GDP in this way would not matter.9
Second, and probably more importantly, the macro growth literature typically omits the change
in schooling. Third, because the macro models are motivated by issues of convergence they

8Henceforth we use the terms GDP per capita and GDP interchangeably.

9Heckman and Klenow (1997) also point out that half the variance of log income will be added to the GDP equation
if income is log normal. See Heckman and Klenow (1997) for cross-sectional evidence.

                                                      16
 include the initial level of GDP, capital, and correlates for steady-state income. Indeed, a
 primary motivation for including human capital variables at all in theseequations is to control for
 y*.
          There are at least six ways to interpret the coefficient on the initial level of schooling in

 equation (2).b0 First, schooling may be a proxy for steady-state income. Countries with higher
 levels of schooling conditional on their initial GDP would be expected to have higher steady-
 state income (perhaps because physical capital is easier to obtain than human capital), so we
 would expect countries with higher average education levels to grow more (132>0).                  If this were
the case, more schooling would not change the steady-state growth rate, although it would raise

 steady-state income. Second, schooling could change the steady-state growth rate by enabling
the work force to develop, implement and adopt new technologies (see Nelson and Phelps, 1966

Welch, 1970 and Romer, 1990), again leading to the prediction 132>0. Third, countries with low
initial stocks of human capital could have greater opportunities to grow by implementing
technology developed abroad. In this case, one would expect 132<0. Fourth, a positive (or
negative) coefficient on initial schooling may simply reflect an exogenous, worldwide increase
(or decrease) in the return to schooling (see Krueger and Lindahl, 1998); in this case, countries
with a high initial level of schooling will naturally grow faster (slower). Fifth, anticipated
increases in future economic growth could cause schooling to rise (i.e., reverse causality), as
argued by Bils and Klenow (1998). Sixth, the schooling variable may "pick up" the effect of the
change in education, which is omitted from the equation. Sorting through these explanations is
difficult. Indeed, Topel (1998) argues that "little can be learned" from macro growth equations
because either a positive or negative coefficient on initial human capital is "consistent with the
idea that human capital is a boon to growth and development."




'°The first three of these interpretations are adapted from Topel (1998). Barro (this volume) emphasizes the first
two explanations.

                                                       17
  2.2 Basic Results and Effect of Measurement Error
           Table 2 replicates and extends the "growth accounting" and "endogenous growth"
 regressions in Benhabib and Spiegel's influential paper." Their analysis is based on Kyriacou's
 (1991) measure of average years of schooling for the work force in 1965 and 1985, Summers and
 Heston's GDP and labor force data, and a measure ofphysical capital derived from investment
 flows. Following Benhabib and Spiegel, the regression in column (1) relates the aimualized
 growth rate of GDP to the log change in years of schooling. From this model, Benhabib and
 Spiegel conclude, "Our findings shed some doubt on the traditional role given to human capital
 in the development process as a separate factor of production." Instead, they conclude that the

 stock of schooling matters for growth (see column 2 and 5) by enabling countries to adopt and
 innovate technology faster.

          Topel argues that Benhabib and Spiegel's finding of an insignificant and wrong-signed
 effect of schooling changes on GDP growth is due to their log specification of education. The
 log-log specification follows if one assumes that schooling enters an aggregate Cobb-Douglas
 production function linearly. Given the success of the Mincer model, however, we would agree
 it is more natural to specify human capital as an exponential function of schooling in a Cobb-

Douglas production function, so the change in years of schooling would enter the growth
equation linearly. In any event, the logarithmic specification of schooling does not fully explain
the perverse effect of educational improvements on growth in Benhabib and Spiegel's analysis.'2

Results of estimating a linear education specification in column 4 still show a statistically
insignificant (though positive) effect of the linear change in schoolingon economic growth.
 "We were not able to exactly replicate Benhabib and Spiegel's results because we use a revised version of Summers
and Heston's GDP data. Nonetheless, our estimates are very close to theirs. For example, Benhabib and Spiegel
report coefficients of -.059 for the change in log education and .545 for the change in log capital when they estimate
the model in column 1 of Table 1; our estimates are -.072 and .523. Some of the other coefficients differ because of
scaling; for comparability with later results, we divided the dependent variable and variables measured in changes
by 20.
 '2The log specification is part of the explanation, however, because if the model in column (3) is estimated without
the initial level of schooling, the change in log schooling has a negative and statistically significant effect, whereas
the change in the level of schooling has a positive and statistically significant effect if it isincluded as a regressor in
this model instead.
                                                            18
         Columns 3 and 6 show that controlling for capital is key to Benhabib and Spiegel's
 finding of an insignificant effect of the change in schooling variable. When physical capital is
 excluded from the growth equation, the change in schooling has a statistically significant and
 positive effect in either the linear or log schooling specification. Why does controlling for
 capital have such a large effect on education? As shown below, it appears that the insignificant
 effect of the change in education is a result of the extraordinarily low signal in the education
 change variable. Indeed, conditional on the other variables that Benhabib and Spiegel hold
 constant (especially capital), the change in schooling conveys virtually no signal. If the observed
 changes in schooling in these data consist purely of random mistakes due to imprecise measures
 of education, then one would not expect countries who mistakenly appear to have increased their

 schooling levels to grow any faster as a result of the increased measured schooling.
       Notice also that the coefficient on capital is high in Table 2, around .50 with a t-ratio
close to 10. In a competitive, Cobb-Douglas economy, the coefficient on capital growth in a

GDP growth regression should equal capital's share of national income. Gollin (1998) estimates
that labor's share ranges from .65 to .80 in most countries, after allocating labor's portion of self-

employment and proprietors' income. Consequently, capital's share is probably no higher than
.20 to .35. Since measured capital is derived from investment flows, and GDP is
                                                                                a direct
function of investment, errors in the investment data will mechanically bias the coefficient on the

growth in capital upwards; this might explain why capital has such a large and significant
coefficient in the growth equations. If the coefficient on capital growth in column (5) of Table 2
is constrained to equal .20 or .35 -- a plausible range for capital's share -- the coefficient on the
schooling change rises to .09 or .06, and becomes statistically significant.


2.2.1 The Extent of Measurement Error in International Education Data
       Random measurement errors in the education data have the same impact on regression
estimates as static does on radio reception — they make it harder to detect the message that is

                                                 19
 being transmitted in the data. Measurement error in the education data used for cross-country
 regressions arises because years of schooling are an imperfect measure of human capital, and
 because available cross-country data on average years of schooling are measured with error. We
 focus on the latter problem, although the former may also be significant. Benhabib and Spiegel's

 measure of average years of schooling for the work force was derived by Kyriacou (1991) as
 follows. First, survey-based estimates of average years of schooling for 42 countries in the mid
 1 970s were regressed on the countries' primary, secondary and tertiary school enrollment rates.
 Coefficient estimates from this model were then used to predict years of schooling from
 enrollment rates for countries in other years. This method is likely to generate substantial noise
 since the fitted regression may not hold for all countries arid time periods, and enrollment rates

 are frequently mismeasured. Changes in education derived from this measure are likely to be
particularly noisy. Benhabib and Spiegel use Kyriacou's education data for 1965, as well as the
change between 1965 and 1985.

        The widely-used Barro and Lee (1993) data set is an alternative source of education data.
For 40 percent of country-year cells, Barro and Lee measure average years of schooling by
survey and census-based estimates reported by UNESCO. The remaining observations were
derived from historical enrollment flow data using a "perpetual inventory method." The Barro-
Lee measure is undoubtedly an advance over existing international measures of educational
attainment, but errors in measurement are inevitable because the UNESCO enrollment rates are
of doubtful quality in many countries (see Behrman and Rosensweig, 1994). Additionally,
students educated abroad are miscounted in the flow data, which is probably a larger problem for

higher education. More fundamentally, secondary and tertiary schooling is defined differently
across countries, so the data for secondary and higher schooling are likely to be noisier than
overall schooling. Notice also that because errors cumulate over time in Barro and Lee's stock-
flow calculations, the errors in education will bepositively correlated over time.



                                                20
        Even developed countries' data are sometimes measured with error in the available data
sets. For example, as illustrated in Figure 2, the Barro-Lee data set indicates that average
educational attainment declined by 0.2 years in Sweden between 1980 and 1990. This finding
conflicts with other Swedish data, which show rising educational attainment and enrollment in
this period. Between 1980 and 1990, for example, the Swedish Level of Living Survey (LNU)
indicates that the average number of years of education for those age 18 to 75 increased by just
over one year. The different education trends (as well as different mean education levels)
displayed in Figure 2 may reflect the fact that 8.7 percent of Swedes reported completing a major
part of their education abroad according to the 1991 LNU survey, as well as the recent emphasis
on increasing the educational attainment of adults in Sweden.
        We can estimate the reliability of the Barro-Lee and Kyriacou data if we treat the two
variables as independent estimates of educational attainment. The so called "reliability ratio"
gives an estimate of the "attenuation bias" in the estimated education coefficient from a bivariate

regression (see Griliches, 1986, and Angrist and Krueger, 1999). The education data are likely to
be much less reliable when they are expressed in changes rather than in levels because much
more of the signal than noise in the data is likely to cancel out when differences are taken. Table
3 presents estimates of the reliability ratio of the Kyriacou and Barro-Lee education data. The
reliability ratios were derived by regressing one measure of years of schooling on the other.13
The cross-sectional data have considerable signal, with the reliability ratio ranging from .77 to
.85 in the Barro-Lee data, and exceeding .96 in the Kyriacou data. The reliability ratios fall by
 10 to 30 percent if we condition on the log of 1965 GDP per capita, which is a common
covariate. More disconcerting, when the data are measured in changes over the 20 year period,
 the reliability ratio for the data used by Benhabib and Spiegel falls to less than 20 percent, and

 '3Barro and Lee (1993) compare their education measure with alternative series by reporting correlation
 coefficients. For example, they report a correlation of .89 with Kyriacous education data and .93 with
 Psacharopolous's. Our cross-sectional correlations are not very different. They do not report correlations for
 changes in education.

                                                      21
to 58 percent in the Barro and Lee data. By way of comparison, note that Ashenfelter and
Krueger (1994) find that the reliability of self-reported years of education is .90 in micro data on
workers, and that the reliability of self-reported differences in education between identical twins

is .57.
          These results suggest that if there were no other controls, the estimated effect of
schooling changes in Benhabib and Spiegel's results would be biased downward by 80 percent.
But the bias is likely to be even greater because their regressions include additional explanatory
variables that "soak up" some of the true changes in schooling. Indeed, we estimate that none of
the observed changes in education represent true changes in education once capital growth is
held constant. Instead of rejecting the traditional Mincerian role of education on growth, a more
plausible interpretation is that Benhabib and Spiegel's results shed no light on the role of
education changes on growth because the data contain no signal.
          The Barro and Lee data convey more signal than Kyriacous data when expressed in
changes. Indeed, nearly 60 percent of the variability in observed changes in years of education in
the Barro-Lee data represent true changes. This makes the Barro-Lee data preferable to use to
estimate the effect of educational improvements. Despite the greater reliability of the Barro-Lee
data, there is still little signal left over in these data conditional on the other variables in the
models in Table 2. Conditional on capital growth, population growth, and initial schooling and
GDP, only about 40 percent of the remaining variability in schooling changes in the Barro-Lee
 data is due to true signal.
          Using data on average education for 34 countries from the World Values Survey (WYS),
 in Krueger and Lindahl (1998) we find that all years of education in the Barro-Lee data are
 measured more accurately than secondary and higher education. Since countries use different
 definitions of secondary schooling in the UNESCO data, this finding is not surprising. But it
 does suggest that more accurate results will be obtained if all years of schooling are used to
 measure human capital.
                                                  22
2.3 Additional Growth Models
       Measurement errors aside, one could question whether physical capital should be
included in a GDP growth equation because it is potentially an endogenous variable. Fast
growing countries have more access to investment (see Blomström, Lipsey and Zejan, 1993).
Additionally, considerations of the low signal in schooling changes conditional on capital
growth, and the mechanical correlation between measured capital and GDP (since capital is
typically derived from investment), lead us to prefer parsimonious models that omit capital.
Barro (1997) also excludes capital, so there is some precedent for a parsimonious specification in
the growth literature. We first report models without controlling for capital, and then focus on
the effect of capital in long-difference models in Section 2.5. We return to the effect of
controlling for additional explanatory variables in Section 3.2.

       Table 4 reports "stylized" macro growth models without controlling for physical capital
for samples spanning 5, 10 or 20 year periods. The dependent variable is the annualized change
in the log of real GDP per capita per year based on Summers and Heston's (1991) Penn World
Tables, Mark 5:6. Results are generally similar if GDP per worker is used instead. We use GDP
per capita because it reflects labor force participation decisions and because it has beenthe focus
of much of the previous literature. The schooling variable is Barro and Le&s measure of average
years of schooling for the population age 25 and older. When the change in average schooling is
included as a regressor in these models, we divide it by the number of years in the time span so
the coefficients are comparable across columns, and comparable to Table 2. The equations were
estimated by OLS, but the standard errors reported in the table allow for a country-specific
component in the error term. We initially exclude other variables (such as the fertility rate and
rule of law index) that are sometimes included in macro growth models to focus on education,
 and because those other variables are probably influenced themselves by education. Perhaps
 more importantly, measurement error problems are exacerbated by including covariates. For
                                                 23
example, the correlation between the log fertility rate and education is -.85 in the Barro-Lee data

set, which implies that the relative signal of average schooling falls to only one third if fertility is
held constant.'4
         Our findings parallel Topel's. The change in schooling has little effect on GDP growth
when the growth equation is estimated with high frequency changes (i.e., 5 years). However,
increases in average years of schooling have a positive and statistically significant effect on
economic growth over periods of 10 or 20 years. As discussed below, the magnitude of the
coefficient estimates on both the change and initial level of schooling are large, probably too
large to represent the causal effects of schooling.
         The finding that the time span matters so much for the change in education also suggests
that measurement error in schooling plays a major role in these estimates. Over short time
periods, there is little change in a nation's true schooling level, so the transitory component of
measurement error in schooling would be large relative to variability in the true change. Over
longer periods, true education levels are more likely to change, increasing the signal relative to
the noise in measured changes.
         Measurement error bias appears to be greater over the 5 and 10 year horizons, but it is
still substantial over 20 years. Since the change in schooling and initial level of GDP are
essentially uncorrelated, the coefficient on the 20-year change in schooling in column 8 is biased

downward by a factor of 1               which is around 40 percent according to Table 3. Thus, adjusting
for measurement error would lead the coefficient on the change in education to increase from .18

to .30 = .18/(l-.4). This is an enormous return to investment in schooling, equal to three or four
 times the private return to schooling estimated within most countries. Moreover, even if labor
 only captures two-thirds of the rise in GDP associated with an increase in human capital, as is
 sometimes assumed, the net payoff to labor based on this coefficient is at least double the
 conventional return to schooling.
 ' We arrive at this estimate by assuming that R5 is .81 in the Barro-Lee cross-country schooling data. Using the
 formula in footnote 15, conditional on the log fertility rate the reliability of schooling is (.8l.852 )I(1.852) = .32.
                                                            24
        Like Benhabib and Spiegel, Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995) conclude that
contemporaneous changes in schooling do not contribute to economic growth, although they note
that measurement error in schooling could bias their results. There are four reasons to suspect
that measurement error has a particularly acute effect on their estimates. First, Barro and Sala-i-

Martin analyze a mixed sample that combines changes over both 5-year (1985-90) and 10-year
(1965-75 and 1975-85) periods; examining changes over such short periods tends to exacerbate
the downward bias due to measurement errors. Second, they examine changes in average years
of secondary and higher schooling. As was shown in Table 3, the reliability of secondary and
higher schooling is lower than the reliability of all years of schooling, and the changes are likely
to be less reliable as well. Third, they include separate variables for changes in male and female

years of secondary and higher schooling. These two variables are highly correlated (r.85),
which would exacerbate measurement error problems if the signal in the variables is more highly

correlated than the noise. If average years of secondary and higher schooling for men and
women combined, or years of secondary and higher schooling for either men or women, is used
instead of all years of schooling in the 10-year change model in column 6 of Table 4, the change

in education has a sizable, statistically significant effect. Fourth, they estimate a restricted
 Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) system, which exacerbates measurement error bias
because asymptotically this estimator is equivalent to a weighted average of an OLS and fixed-
 effects estimator, and it is well known that a fixed-effects estimator exacerbates measurement
 error bias.
         Because Barro (1997) stresses male, secondary and higher education as a key determinant
 of growth, we have also explored the sensitivity of our results to using different measures of
 education, namely primary versus higher education, and male versus female education. We have

 a preference for measuring schooling by the average of all years of education, however, because
 this is the variable specified by the Mincer model, and because primary schooling is a pre-


                                                 25
requisite for secondary and higher schooling.'5 Focusing only on secondary and higher education
is analogous to measuring office capital by only counting the number of stories of buildings
above the tenth floor. In any event, when we test for different effects of years of primary and
secondary and higher schooling in the model in column 6 of Table 4, we cannot reject that all

years of schooling have the same effect on GDP growth (p-value equals .40 for initial levels and
.12 for changes). We also find insignificant differences between primary and secondary
schooling if we just use male schooling. We do find significant differences if we further
disaggregate schooling levels by gender, however. The initial level of primary schooling has a
positive effect for women and a negative effect for men, the initial level of secondary school has
a negative effect for women and a positive effect for men, the change in primary schooling has a
positive effect for women and a negative effect for men, and the change in secondary schooling
has a negative effect for women and a positive effect for men. Because schooling levels are
highly correlated for men and women, one needs to be cautious interpreting regressions that
 include disaggregated education variables.
         Barro (this volume) offers an intriguing explanation for his estimated negative effect of
 female education on growth: because of gender discrimination, female labor may not be
 efficiently utilized in the labor market in many countries. In the extreme, women may be
 educated but discouraged from joining the labor force, so their human capital does not directly
 contribute economic output. To test this hypothesis, we used data from the ILO on labor force

 participation by gender, and included interactions between gender-specific schooling and gender-
 specific labor force participation rates in the specification in column 5 ofTable 4, as well as main

 effects of the variables.16 These results yielded partial support for the discrimination hypothesis.
 The interaction between female labor force participation and schooling is positive and

 '  The macro Mincer model would suggest that average years education of all workers is the appropriate explanatory
 variable. Because the Barro-Lee data set does not contain schooling just for workers, we use average schoolingfor
 the population age 25 and older.

 statistically significant, suggesting that there is less of a negative effect of female education on
 growth in countries that have relatively more women in the labor force. But, even for a country
 with a 100 % female labor force participation rate, female education is predicted to have a very

 small, positive effect on growth that is virtually indistinguishable from no effect.


 2.4 Effect of Measurement Error on Initial Level of Education
        The positive effect of the initial level of education on growth is often interpreted as
 evidence of large externalities from the stock of a nation's human capital on economic growth.
Topel (1998), however, argues that "the magnitude of the effect of education on growth is vastly
too large to be interpreted as a causal force." Indeed, Topel calculates that thepresent value of a
one percentage point faster growth rate from an additional year of schooling would be about four
times the cost, with a 5 percent real discount rate. He concludes that externalities from schooling
may exist, but they are unlikely to be so large.
        One possibility is that the level of schooling is spuriously reflecting the effect of the
change in schooling on growth, which could account for its large impact on growth. Countries
with higher initial levels of schooling also tended to have larger increases in schooling over the
next 10 or 20 years in Barro and Lee's data, which is remarkable given that measurement error in

schooling induces a negative covariance between the change and initial level of schooling. We
initially suspected that the initial level of schooling spuriously picks up the effect of schooling

increases, either because schooling changes are excluded from the growth equation or because
the included variable is noisy. In Krueger and Lindahl (1998; section 2.4), however, we show
that this is most unlikely. In particular, we show that if education is measured equally reliably
each period, and if first and second period education are included in the growth regression, then
the sum of the two coefficients on the education variables will be biased toward zero. Since a
test of whether the initial level of education influences economic growth conditional on the
change in education turns on whether the sum of the coefficients on current and lagged education

                                                   27
is positive, measurement error in education would tend to produce a bias against finding that the

initial level of education influences growth.



2.5 Controlling for Physical Capital
         The level and growth rate of capital are natural control variables to include in the GDP
growth regressions. First, initial log GDP can be substituted for capital in a Solow growth model
only if capital's share is constant over time and across countries (e.g., a Cobb-Douglas production

function). Second, and more importantly for our purposes, capital-skill complementaritywould
imply that some of the increased output attributed to higher education in Table 4 should be
attributed to increased capital (see, e.g., Goldin and Katz, 1997). As mentioned earlier, however,
systematic correlation between measurement errors in capital and GDP, as well as endogeneity of

capital, are reasons to be wary about including the growth of capital in a GDP equation.
Nonetheless, here we examine the robustness of our results to controlling for physical capital.

         Column (1) of Table 5 reports an estimate of the same 20-year growth model as in
 column 9 of Table 4, augmented to include the growth of capital per worker. We use Klenow
 and Rodriguez-Clare's (1997) capital data because they appear to have more signal than
 Benhabib and Spiegel's capital data.'7 The coefficient on the change in education falls by more

 than 50 percent when capital growth is included, although it remains barely statistically
 significant at the .10 level. In colunm (2) we add the initial log capital per worker, and in column

 (3) exclude the initial log GDP from the column (2) specification. Including initial log capital
 drives the coefficient on the change in schooling to close to zero. Notice also that the log of
 initial capital per worker has little effect in column (3).18 The growth of capital per worker has

 '7A regression of Benhabib and Spiegel's change in log capital on the corresponding variable from Klenow and
 Rodriguez-Clare yields a regression coefficient (and standard error) of .95 (.065). The reverse regression yields a
 coefficient of .69 (.05). These estimates could be biased toward one because of correlated measurement errors in
 the two variables, since both depend on investment.

  '81f the change in log capital per work is dropped from the model in column (3), then initial log capital perworker
  does have a statistically significant, negative effect, and the schooling coefficients aresimilar to those in column 9
  of Table 4.
                                                             28
an enormous effect on GDP growth, greatly exceeding capital's share in most countries. This
finding is consistent with the errors in capital being systematically related to GDP, since both are
functions of investment. To explore the sensitivity of the results, in column (4) we constrain the
coefficient on the growth in capital to equal 0.35, which is on the high end of the distribution of
non-labor's share around the world. These results indicate that both the change and initial level
of schooling are associated with economic growth. Moreover, as Heckman and Kienow (1997)
find in cross-sectional data, the coefficient on the change in education is similar to
microeconometric estimates.
         As mentioned earlier, including capital could exacerbate the measurement error in
schooling. Indeed, we find that the reliability of Barro-Lee's 20-year change in schooling data
falls from .58 to .46 once we condition on the change in capital, suggesting that the coefficient on
the change in schooling in Table 5 should be roughly doubled. In column (5), to try to overcome
measurement error we estimate the growth equation by instrumental variables, using Kyriacou's
schooling data as excluded instruments for the change and level of schooling. This is the same
estimation strategy previously used by Pritchett (1998), but we employ different schooling data
as instruments, and use a different measure of capital. Unfortunately, because there is so little
signal in education conditional on capital, the IV results yield a huge standard error (.167) for the
effect of the change in education. Pritchett similarly finds a large standard errors from his IV
 estimates, although his point estimates are negative.'9 One final point on these estimates is that,
 to be comparable to the Mincerian return to schooling, the coefficient on the change in education
 should be scaled up by a factor equal to one over labor's share if the aggregate production
 function is Cobb-Douglas and human capital is an exponential function of schooling.20 This
 would raise the cross-country estimate of the benefit of schooling increases even further.



 '9Aside from the different data sources, the difference between our IV results and Pritchett's appears to result from
 his use of log schooling changes. If we use log schooling changes, we also find negative point estimates.

 20 We are grateful to Kjetil Storesletten for pointing this out to us.
                                                              29
       We draw four main lessons from this investigation of the role of capital. First, the change
in capital has an enormous effect in a GDP growth equation, probably because of a mechanical
relationship between the errors in measuring capital and GDP or because of reverse causality.
Second, the impact of both the level and change in schooling on economic growth is sensitive to
whether the change in capital is included in the growth equation and allowed to have a
coefficient that greatly exceeds capital's share. Third, controlling for capital exacerbates
measurement error problems in schooling. Instrumental variables estimates designed to correct
for measurement error in schooling yield such a large standard error on the change in schooling
that the results are consistent with schooling changes having no effect on growth or a large effect
on growth; in other words, these results are uninformative. Fourth, when the coefficient on
capital growth is constrained to equal a plausible value, changes in years of schooling are
positively related to economic growth. Unless measurement error problems in schooling and
capital can be overcome, we do not think the cross-country growth equations that control for
capital growth will be very informative insofar as the benefit of education is concerned.

       In all, we think the results in this section fairly consistently point to an association
between GDP growth and contemporaneous education changes, once measurement error in
education is taken into account. Although this relationship could come about for spurious
reasons (e.g., fast growing countries could choose to spend more of their resources on education),

the growth equations do not reject a "traditional role" for human capital.


3. Robustness of the Effect of Initial Level of Education on Growth

        [lJt is not possible to draw a simple straight line relating secondary education
        to economic growth.

        The macro growth equations impose the restriction that all countries have the same
relationship between growth and initial education, and that the relationship is linear. The first
assumption is particularly worrisome because the micro evidence clearly indicates that the return

to schooling varies considerably across countries, and even across regions within countries. For
example, institutional factors that compress the wage structure in some countries result in lower
returns to schooling in those countries (see, e.g., the essays in Freeman and Katz, 1995). If the
private return to education varies across countries, externalities from the stock of education may
vary as well. Thus, we first allow the effect of the level of education on growth to vary by
country. Next, we examine the effect of relaxing the linearity assumption and controlling for
additional variables. Both of these extensions to the standard growth specification suggest that
the constrained specification estimated in the literature shouldbe viewed with caution.



 3.1 Heterogeneous Country Education Effects
         The specifications previously estimated in the empirical growth literature constrain the
 initial level of education to have the same effect in each country. A more general model would
 allow the initial level of education to have a different effect in different countries. Since there is

 more than one observation per country in the 5- and 10-year growth models, this easily can be
 accomplished by interacting a set of dummy variables indicating each country with the base year

 education level for those countries. The average of the country-specific-education slopes
 provides an informative measure of the effect of initial education on growth for the average
                                                                                             the
 country. It is instructive to note that the coefficient on initial education estimated from
 restricted, single-coefficient OLS model can be decomposed as a weighted average of the more

  general country-specific slopes, where the weights are the country-specific contributions to the
  overall variance in schooling.2' This result is important because it indicates that the source of
                                                                                        1998. If country fixed effects are
  21This results requires that there are no other covariates; see Krueger and Lindahi,
  included in the model, the OLS constant coefficient can still be decomposed as      a weighted  average of the country-
  specific coefficients even if there are other covariates.  But  we exclude  country fixed effects so that these estimates
  are comparable to the earlier ones, and because including      fixed effects would  exacerbate  measurement    error bias.
                                                              31
variation in the single-coefficient regression and average of the variable coefficients model is the

same, but the country-specific slopes are aggregated differently in the two estimates.
       Of course, if the assumptions of the constant-coefficient model hold (and the other Gauss-
Markov assumptions hold), the OLS weights are the most efficient weights. But if a variable-
coefficient model is more appropriate, there is no a priori reason to prefer the OLS weights over
other weights. Indeed, it is rather odd to weight the country-specific slopes by the OLS weights
if the slopes differ across countries. The unweighted-average coefficient is probably a more
relevant summary statistic because it represents the expected value of the education coefficient
 for a random country in the world.
         In Krueger and Lindahl (1998; Table 6) we estimated variable-coefficient models using
                                                                                                                of
 5-year and 10-year changes in GDP; we summarize the results here. First, consider results
                                             assumption in the models in colunm 1 and 5 of

 education slopes are unconstrained. Of more consequence, the average slope coefficient on the
                                                                 statistically significant, in the variable-
  initial level of education is negative, though not

  coefficient models (see Krueger and Lindahi, 1998,
                                                                                         the
  interpretation of initial education in the constrained macro growth equation common in

  higher schooling for males instead of the average years of all education for the adult population.

initial level of secondary and higher education has a statistically significant, negative association
with economic growth over the ensuing 10 years.22



3.2 Exploring the Linearity Assumption and Additional Explanatory Variables
        It is common in the empirical growth literature to assume that initial education has a
linear effect on subsequent GDP growth. Although Mincer (1974) provides conditions under
which education has a linear relationship with log earnings, these conditions do not necessarily
imply that the level of initial education has a linear relationship with income growth. To
examine the linearity assumption, we included initial education and its square in the 10-year
change model in column 4 of Table 4. These results are reported in the first column of Table 6.
The data seem to prefer the quadratic specification, as the squared education term is statistically
significant. More importantly, the relationship is inverted-U shaped, with a peak at 7.5 years of
education. Since the mean education level for OECD countries in 1990 was 8.4 years in Barro
and Lee's data, the average OECD country is on the downward-sloping segment of the education-
growth profile. If we also include the square of log GDP per capita, the initial level of education
continues to have a nonlinear effect that peaks below the average education level of OECD
countries; see column 2. We also find an inverted-U shaped relationship between education and
GDP growth that peaks below the level of education of developed countries when we examine 5-
and 20-year changes in GDP.
        The results in columns 3 and 4 of Table 6 indicate that the effect of the initial level of
education is sensitive to including other covariates in the model. These models hold constant
several additional explanatory variables that are often controlled for in the literature, including
the log of the fertility rate, log life expectancy, and investment and government spending as

22CasselIi, Esquivel and Lefort (1996, Table 4) also find that the coefficient on male secondary and higher education
has a negative effect on growth when they use a generalized method of moments model to estimate a first-
differenced specification of the growth equation. It should be noted that our random coefficient approach uses the
same cross-section variation in education to identif' the coefficient on education as our OLS results in Table 4.

                                                         33
shares of GDP.23 Although one could question whether these variables are appropriate
                                                                                        of the initial
exogenous regressors to include in a growth equation, it is clear that the significance
level of education in either the linear and quadratic specification is greatly diminished when
these variables are controlled for. Indeed, the initial level of schooling becomes statistically
insignificant if just the log of the fertility rate is included in the equation. Average years of
secondary and higher schooling solely for men has a more robust association with economic
growth than the broader education measure used in Table 6 if it is included in the growth
equation instead of the average schooling level of the entire population. But, as we discussed
previously, we believe there are strong reasons for preferring the broader measure of education.


 3.3 Estimates for OECD Countries
            In view of the sensitivity of the effect of the initial education level on economic growth to
                                                           it is worth exploring whether the results hold
 the econometric assumptions investigated above,
 for the sample of OECD countries. Table 7 presents estimates of the effect of initial education
                                                                                           20 year
 on growth for the subset of OECD countries, measuring GDP growth over 5, 10 or
                                                                                         and small
 periods. In each case, the initial level of education had a statistically insignificant
 effect on economic growth. We similarly find that the initial level of secondary and higher
  education for men has a statistically insignificant effect if it is included in the growth equation
                                                                                                   in
  for OECD countries instead of the broader schooling measure. These results are not surprising

  light of the earlier finding that the average OECD country is on the downward-sloping segment
  of the education-growth curve estimated in Table 6.
             Together, the results in this section cast doubt on the likelihood that there are large
                                                                                   in the less
  growth externalities from the initial level of education. The pattern of results
  restrictive (i.e., nonlinear and variable coefficient) specifications, and models with more
   extensive covariates, cast doubt on the view that the initial level of education exerts a strong

 influence on growth, especially in high education countries. Most notably, the initial level of
 education appears to be unrelated to subsequent growth in OECD countries even in the
 parsimonious model.


 4. Conclusion and Policy Implications

        And the preservation of the means of knowledge, among the lowest ranks, is of
        more importance to the public, than all the property of the richmen in the
        country. It is even of more consequence to the rich themselves, and to
        their posterity.

                                                         John Q. Adams, 1765
        The micro and macro literatures both emphasize the role of education for raising income,
 and income growth. An accumulation of research using individual-level education and income
data since the beginning of the 20th century provides robust evidence of a substantial payoff to

investment in education, especially for those who traditionally complete low levels of schooling.
From the micro evidence, it is unclear whether the social return to schooling exceeds the private

return, although available U.S. evidence suggests that positive externalities in the form of
reduced crime and reduced welfare participation are more likely to be reaped from investments in

disadvantaged than advantaged groups. The macroeconomic evidence ofexternalities in terms of
technological progress from investments in higher education seems to us to be more fragile.
Externalities from the initial stock of human capital appear particularly unlikely to apply to
OECD countries.

       Our findings help resolve an important inconsistency between the micro and macro
literatures on education: Contrary to Benhabib and Spiegel's (1994) and Barro and Sala-i-
Martin's (1995) conclusions, the cross-country regressions indicate that the change in education
is positively associated with economic growth once measurement error in education is accounted

for. Griliches (1997) conjectured that the "jarring" finding of no relationship between education
changes and GDP growth was due to either measurement error in education or a tendency for
                                               35
  more highly educated workers to enter sectors of
                                                      the economy whose contribution to GDP are
  systematically under measured. Measurement error in education appears sufficient to
                                                                                            account for
  the insignificant effect of education changes. Indeed, after adjusting for
                                                                               measurement error, the
  change in average years of schooling often has a greater effect in the
                                                                           cross-country regressions
  than in the within-country micro
                               regressions. Controlling for capital growth reduces the effect of
 education changes, but the magnitude of the effect in the cross-country data is still
                                                                                            at least as
 great as the micro return to education oncemeasurement error is taken into account.

        The large return to schooling changes found in the cross-country models
                                                                                   suggests that
 reverse causality or omitted variables create problems at the country level of analysis,
                                                                                          or that
 increases in average educational attainment generate nationwide externalities. Although the
 microeconometrjc evidence in several countries suggests that within countries the causal effect of
 education on earnings can be estimated reasonably well by taking education as
                                                                                         exogenous, it
 does not follow that cross-country differences in education can be taken as a
                                                                                 cause of income as
 opposed to a result of current income or
                                          anticipated income growth. Moreover, countries that
 improve their educational systems are likely to concurrently change other policies that enhance
growth, producing a different source of omitted-variable bias in cross-country analyses.
Education, in the eloquent description of Harbison and Myers (1965), "is both the seed and the
flower of economic development." It is difficult to separate the causal effect of education from
the positive income demand for education in cross-country data. For this reason, Mankiw (1997)

describes the presumed exogeneity of school enrollment as the "weak link" in the
                                                                                            empirical
growth literature. In our opinion, this link is unlikely to be strengthened unless the
                                                                                      cross-country
literature can identify natural experiments in schooling attainment similar to those that have been
exploited in the microeconometrjc literature, and unless measurement errors in the cross-country
data are explicitly taken into account in the econometric modelling.

       For policy makers, the obvious prescription to enhance growth is that, on the margin,
funds should be invested in the components of the education system that generate the highest

                                                36
  social returns. But the micro and macro evidence suggest that the returns to
                                                                                  investing in different
  educational levels are likely to differ across countries, depending on the
                                                                              country's state of
  development, distribution of income, and structure of the education system. There
                                                                                    are unlikely
  to be universal answers. In the United States, there is much support for the view that
                                                                                           investments
  in young, disadvantaged children have the highest returns, and that it is

 the economic circumstances of adolescent high school dropouts with short-term

 (e.g., Heckman, 1998). This view implicitly underlies the recent increased

 out-of-school youth. But the circumstances inthe U.S. may be unique.
         Optimal education policy for Sweden may be quite different than for the U.S. Heckman

 "early learning begets later learning." In the U.S., 22 percent of children under

 families that fall below the poverty line, and an incredible 59 percent of children under
                                                                                           6 who
 live with single mothers are in
                                 poverty (U.S. Census Bureau, 1998). High rates of childhood
 poverty, coupled with a patchwork system of childcare arrangements, may lead to particularly
high payoffs to investments in young children in the U.S. Moreover, the lagging development of

many American children, and high existing subsidies to colleges (see Winston and Yen, 1995),
may reduce the return on investments at older ages. Sweden has a much more equal distribution
of income, and a more extensive and universal system of childcare. As
                                                                          a consequence, Sweden
may be in a situation where investments in education for older
                                                                 students pay a higher return than
investments in programs for very young children. But one must also be concerned that the U.S.
evidence vis-à-vis age may reflect the fact that there are critical stages of
                                                                                development during
childhood that condition the payoff to investments at various ages, and that these stages in
                                                                                                large
part determine the payoff to investing in certain age groups irrespective of economic and social
circumstances.



                                               37
        Another overriding factor in Sweden involves the compression of the wage structure,
 which depresses the private return to acquiring skills compared to the U.S. and most countries of
 the world. Edin and Holmiund (1995) and Fredriksson (1997) find that college enrollment in
Sweden is quite responsive to the private payoff to education prevailing at the time students
make their enrollment decisions. Although Sweden has a high level of
                                                                                  post-secondary
educational attainment by world standards, it is nonetheless likely that the level of educational
attainment is distorted by the depressed private payoff to education and skills. This
consideration may militate in favor of a policy of increasing education at higher levels in
Sweden. How this is best accomplished is unclear, however. The current thrust of subsidizing
dislocated workers to return to school has benefits and costs. For example, older workers will
enter the workforce more quickly than, say, pre-school children, so the gestation period for
investments in older workers' human capital is much shorter. On the other hand, the U.S.
experience has been one of rather ordinary returns to investments in education for dislocated
workers. Moreover, in Sweden some observers are concerned that subsidizing unemployed
workers to return to school may create a disincentive in which some workers intentionally delay

completing their education, find ajob only to become unemployed, and then spend a long period
in school while collecting unemployment insurance benefits.

Notes: Rows 1-6 are adapted from Card (1998); rows 7-10 are authors' summaries. The estimates and standard errors in row
7 are divided by 4 to approximate the yearly returns to schooling. Hausman tests of the equality of OLS and
                                                                                                            IV estimates are
based on authors' calculations; test in row 10 is only approximate because the models are not identical.

Notes: The estimated reliability ratios are the slope coefficients from a bivariate regression
of one measure of schooling on the other. For example, the .851 entry in the first row is the
slope coefficient from a regression in which the dependent variable is Kyriacou's schooling
variable and the independent variable is Barro-Lee's. Sample size is 68 countries. Standard
errors are reported in parentheses.

Notes: Change variables have been divided by the number ofyears spanned by the
change (20 years for schooling and log GDP, 25 years for capital). Schooling data
used in the regressions are from Barro and Lee. The instrumentalvariables model in
column 6 uses Kyriacous schooling data as excluded instruments for the level and
change in Barro-Le&s schooling variables. Capital data are from Kienow and
Rodriguez-Glare (1997), and pertain to 1960-85.

*The coefficient on the change in log capital in column 4 is constrained to equal .35,
which is roughly capitalTs share.

Notes: Sample size is 292 for all columns.      Observations with
missing values of some variables were assigned the mean value for
those variables. Schooling and GDP per capita are initial values
 (i.e., values at the beginning of the 10-year period.)       The
inflation rate is measured from the beginning   to the end of the
10-year period. The terms of trade variable is the growth rate
over each period of the ratio of export to import prices. All
other variables are averages over the 10—year periods.
