                  Testing for Real Effects of
                 Monetary Policy Regime Shifts



                              ABSTRACT




     Huizinga and Mishkin (1986) have recently proposed a simple method for
testing whether monetary policy regime changes have affected the ex-ante
real rate of interest. This paper shows that care must be taken in
choosing the set of variables on which to project the ex-post real rate if
inferences about the ex-ante real rate are to be drawn. It is shown that
Huizinga. and Mishkin's tests cannot distinguish between shifts in the real
rate process and shifts in the inflation process.

1.   Introduction

     One of the most important contributions of the rational expectations

revolution in macroeconomics has been that it has forced economists to

think about macro policy in terms of alternative policy rules or regimes.

Realizations of policy instruments determined within a fixed regime and

changes in the policy regime can have very different effects on both the

evolution of macro variables and on the observed structure of the economy.

Sargent (1976) has shown that it may be necessary to obtain data from more

than one policy regime in order to test hypotheses such as the neutrality

of money.

     Sims (1982) has argued that the notion of a policy regime and of

arbitrary regime shifts is subject to logical problems.1" Despite this,

most economists seem willing to treat episodes like the Federal Reserve's

change in its operating procedures in late 1979 as policy regime shifts.

Following Sargent's suggestion, such episodes may provide evidence useful

for testing important macroeconomic hypotheses.

     Huizinga and Mishkin (1986), for example, have recently argued that

monetary policy has important effects on the ex-ante real rate of interest.

As evidence,they cite apparent changes in the stochastic properties of the

real rate coinciding with major shifts in monetary policy regimes. More

specifically, they claim the real rate process shifted in October 1979, the

month the Fed changed operating procedures, in October 1982 when the Fed

deemphasized monetary aggregates, and in June 1920 when the Fed shifted to

a contractionary policy by raising the discount rate. Mishkin (1986) has

argued that these results suggest monetary policy, not fiscal deficits,

bears responsible for high real interest rates in the early 1980s.
                                   —2—


     Because an understanding of the impact of monetary policy shifts on

real interest rates is important for many issues in macroeconomics, the

method used by Huizinga and Mishkin (hereafter H-M) deserves careful

scrutiny. It will be shown that their approach is theoretically unable to

separate shifts in the real interest rate process from shifts in the

inflation process. Hence, their procedure is likely to "find a shift in

the stochastic behavior of the ex-ante real rate when there is a monetary

policy regime shift, even if the true ex-ante real rate process is

completely invariant with respect to monetary policy. Evidence is

presented to suggest this may explain their finding of a real rate shift in

late 1982.

     The flaw in the H-M methodology is shown formally by way of a simple

example in section 2, but the intuition can be grasped most easily by

considering the special case of an economy in which the real rate process

is, by assumption, completely invariant with respect to perceived monetary

policy shifts. In such an economy, the nominal interest rate will depend

on monetary policy via the expected rate of inflation. Since shifts in

monetary policy can influence the stochastic properties of inflation and

the nominal interest rate, such shifts will also affect the coefficient

obtained when the real rate is projected onto the nominal rate. Even

though the behavior of the real rate is invarient with respect to monetary

policy, the projection coefficient will shift in response to monetary

policy regime shifts. Yet it is just such shifts in projection

coefficients that H—H interpret as measuring shifts in the real rate

process.

     When a variable y is projected onto a variable x, the resulting

projection coefficient depends on the stochastic properties of both x and
                                       —3—


y. Evidence of a shift in the projection coefficient does not, by itself,

allow one to infer that the y process has shifted.

     There is, however, one case that would seem to be an exception to this

general conclusion. If the variable y is defined as the projection on x,

then it follows automatically that a change in the projection coefficient

will represent a change in the y process. It will be argued in section 2

that even if the real rate is defined by a projection equation, neutral

changes in the inflation process will appear to shift the real rate

process, a conclusion that casts doubt on the usefulness of defining the

real rate by a projection equation.

     Section 3 provides some empirical evidence to suggest that the problem

outlined in Section 2 is of quantitative significance. Conclusions are

summarized in Section 4.



2.   Shifts in the Real Rate Process

     In order to discuss shifts in the real interest rate process, it is

necessary to carefully specify what is meant by the real rate process. Two

alternative approaches can be taken. One approach treats the real rate as

a function of its fundamental determinants. The other approach defines the

ex—ante real rate process as a projection equation./' In this section,

both approaches are discussed and it is shown that the H—M procedure will

incorrectly identify changes in the inflation rate process as changes in

the real rate process.

     To first define the notation that will be used throughout, let rt

equal the ex-post (ex-ante) real return from time t to t÷1. The actual

(expected) rate of inflation from t to t+1 will be denoted

Finally, define    as the nominal return from t to t+1. These variables
                                           -4-


are linked by the Fisher relation in both an ex-ante and ex—post sense:

                   e    .        e
                                                                                   (1)




                  r=it_1tt.                                                        (2)




Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2),



                                                                                   (\
                                                                                   '—I
                  .t    .t



where    =    —        is    the expectational error in the market's forecast of

inflation.

     Now suppose the ex-ante real rate of return is a function of a set of

fundamental exogenous variables. Let these be divided into three classes.

First, denote by a vector xt exogenous and predetermined determinants of r

that can be observed by the econometrician. 'Included in x, might be

factors such as the economy's capital stock,, but the current nominal

interest rate would not be contained in x since it is neither exogenous nor

predetermined. Second, let           denote additional determinants of r that

are observable to private agents but are not observed by the econometrician

and that also potentially affect the expected rate of inflation. Finally,

let e denote the net effect of unobserved real rate determinants that have

no effect on inflation. For simplicity, I will assume that x, v, and e are

mutually orthogonal; the basic results of this section are not sensitive to

this assumption. Hypothesizing a linear structure, write



              =                                                                    (4)
                       + v + e= x + Ut,
                                        —5—


where u = vo +   e.   Substituting (4) into (3) yields



                                                                            (5)
          rt = XtB +     Ut - t.

If x, is contained in the information set used to form expectations about

    the expectational error        will be orthogonal to Xt under the

assumption of rational expectations. Hence, consistent estimates of the

parameter vector      can be obtained from the ordinary least squares

regression of r on x since x and u —          are orthogonal. Thus, as Mishkin

(1983) has emphasized, any hypothesis about the ex—ante real rate of

interest that can be expressed in terms of restrictions on B can be tested,

even though the ex—ante real rate is an unobservable variable.

     In practice, of course, the correct elements of the x vector are

unknown, and, as with the specification of any regression equation, the

estimate of B will be influenced by any relevant variables that have been

left out of (5) and that are correlated with those variables that are

included in (5).      In general, this might lead one to include in the ex—post

real rate regression any variable known at time t. Adding extraneous

variables will not affect the consistency of the least squares estimators.

     Instead of testing a particular hypothesis about e under the

maintained hypothesis that the coefficient vector has remained constant

over the sample period, one might wish to investigate possible shifts in

the real rate process. That is, a change in the real rate process might be

defined as a shift in the coefficients in a regression of the real rate on

a set of information variables.       One might then attempt to discover

whether major shifts in monetary policy affect the stochastic properties of

the real rate by testing for coefficient shifts coincident with monetary
                                               -6-



policy changes. In contrast to th case in which a restriction on        is

being tested, testing for shifts in the coefficient vector require a more

careful consideration of the variables to include in the regression.

     To see why, recall that the residual in (4) is equal to v6 + e, and

that Vt consists of factors that influence both the ex-ante real rate of

return and the expected rate of inflation but that are unobserved by the

econometrician. Suppose that the actual rate of inflation is given by



             =
                 xti +   Zy +
                                vta
                                      +
                                          e.                                      (6)




In equation (6), z is a set of variables, known to private agents at time

t, that affect inflation but not the ex-ante real rate. The vector           is

likewise observed by private agents at time t, but is not observed by the

econometrican. To simplify subsequent calculations, z is taken to be

orthogonal to x, v, and e.

     Equations (1), (4) and (6) Imply that the nominal rate of interest is

given by

            =
                 x(+i)    + ZtY + v(S+c) + et.                                    (7)




     Now suppose the econometrican regresses the ex-post rate r on x and,

in order to capture the effects of some of the unobserved variables in v,

the nominal rate of interest. This is the procedure employed by H-.M.

Intuitively, (4) shows that re depends on v, and, from (7), i is correlated

with v. Therefore, including i should help to reduce the problem of

omitted variables. In probability limit, the resulting coefficient on
                                        —7—


is equal to


                  t5(c+)a2   + a2
                  22   + (cz+)2a2 + a2

where a denotes the variance of the random variable s and, for simplicity,

z and v have been taken to be scalars.

     Now assume that there is a change in a in equation (6). This

represents a pure change in the inflation process -—       the process describing

the real rate, equation (5), is completely unaffected. However, as (8)

clearly shows, the change in a   will   affect the coefficient on the nominal

interest rate in the ex-post real rate regression. Shifts in           or

produce similar effects. It follows that evidence of shifts in the

coefficients in the regression of the ex-post real rate on a set of

variables which includes the nominal rate does not allow one to conclude

that a shift in the real rate process has occurred."

    This illustrates that great care must be taken in choosing the

variables on which to project the ex—post real rate. Candidate variables

must be orthogonal to all excluded factors which affect inflation. The

nominal interest rate clearly fails this criterion.

     If the exogenous and predetermined variables in x were known, a shift

in the real rate process could be tested by estimating equation (5). The

orthogonality between xt and u -         insures   that least squares will

provide consistent estimates of B.      The problem, of course, consists in

correctly specifying the elements of x, and this leads to the second

approach to specifyfng the real rate process. This approach defines the

real rate process to be the projection of r on the set of available

information. Since the nominal rate is clearly in        this   set, the real rate
                                                 -8-


process would be defined by
                     e                   *       *                                            (9)
                         =         + X,8 + U
                             Pit


where u =    v   + e*.        If changes in the real rate process are defined as

changes in the projection coefficients p, 8* and o, then it might appear

that the H—M procedure, by providing consistent estimates of the projection

coefficients, can provide a method for testing for shifts in the real rate

process.

     This argument, however, is incorrect. Because the unobservable (to

the econometrician) variables in v. also affect expected inflation, i will

be correlated with the composite error term                       -
                                                                      ct
                                                                           =
                                                                               vt   +
                                                                                        e-
obtained by substituting (9) into (3). In fact, making use of (6), it can
be shown that in the special case of scalar and orthogonal v, z and x, the

probability limit of the least squares projection coefficient on i in (9)

is



                  ( + )(s          +         +             + 'e                              (10)
                             +     22+ 22 +            2
                                    °v


     As equation (10) demonstrates, the estimate of p (and 8* also) will

depend on ,   ', and          — allparameters          which appear only in the equation

generating inflation. Hence, even if p, 8* and                        — the     projection

coefficients assumed to define the real rate — are unchanged, the estimated

coefficients on i and x will shift with changes in the parameters

describing the inflation process. Both alternative approaches to defining

the real rate process — as a function of fundamentals or as a projection

equation —   imply   that the H—M procedure runs the risk of misinterpreting
                                   —g -




pure inflation changes for changes in the real rate process.
     When projecting one variable on another, the resulting projection

coefficient will shift if the behavior of either of the two variables

changes. Increased money growth volatility that affects the behavior of

nominal interest rates would alter the coefficient obtained by projecting

the ex—post real rate on the nominal rate. Such a coefficient shift,

however, does not allow one to conclude that the real rate process has

changed unless one tautologically defines such coefficient shifts to be

real rate process shifts. Such a definition, however, does not seem to be

a very useful one for understanding the real effects of monetary policy

regime shifts.

      Any time a variable y is projected onto another variable x, the

projection coefficient will be a function of the stochastic processes

generating both y and x. All one can legitimately infer from evidence of a

projection coefficient shift is that either the x process, or the y

process, or both, changed. Only if further evidence shows that the x

process remained unchanged can one conclude that the y process changed.



3.   Empjrical Results

     The previous section has shown that testing for shifts in the real

interest rate process requires a careful consideration of the variables to

include on the right-hand side of a regression for the ex-post real rate.

Inclusion of a variable such as the nominal interest rate may cause the

real rate process to appear to shift whenever the stochastic behavior of

inflation changes, even if the underlying behavior of   the real rate is
completely unaffected.
     While the theoretical argument implies that great care must be taken
                                         -10-


in attempting to identify real rate process shifts, theory obviously cannot

determine whether or not real rate shifts were incorrectly identified in

the particular empirical study carried out by H-M. This section attempts

to partially address this issue.

    H—M identify post-war shifts in the real rate process as having

occurred in October 1979 and October 1982. Both of these dates are

associated with changes in monetary policy and so, as seems reasonable, H—M

attribute the real rate shifts to the change in monetary policy. Using

one—month Treasury bill yields and one-month changes in the Consumer Price

Index, these real rate shifts are found by testing for coefficient shifts

in the following equation:



                 +                                                            (11)
      rt = a0        a1   i + a2 _i +   a3   t2 +   a4 SUpplyti,



where supply. is the log of the relative price of fuel and related products

in the producer price index." H-M calculate Quandt likelihood ratios&'

for pairs of breakpoints around October 1979 and October 1982. These two

months were chosen because they were associated with changes in monetary

policy. The Fed shifted from a federal funds rate operating procedure to a

nonborrowed reserves procedure in October 1979, and during the October 1982

FOMC meeting, a decision was made to deemphasize monetary targeting. H-M

present —2 times the log of the Quandt likelihood ratio for all breakpoint

pairs (s, t) where s runs from April 1979 to April 1980 and t runs from

April 1982 to April 1983•L"      The Quandt statistic suggests that October

1979 and October 1982 are in fact the most likely dates for shifts in

equation (11).

     The analysis of the previous section suggested that real rate
                                   —11—


regressions which include the nominal interest rate are particularly

susceptible to apparent shifts when the inflation process changes. To test

whether this problem may have affected H—M's results, the nominal rate was

dropped from equation (11) and the Quandt likelihood ratios were again

calculated for pairs of possible breakpoints around October 1979 and

October 1982. Minus twice these ratios are presented in Table 1.

     The maximum value now occurs at (1979:10, 1983:04). This first

breakpoint at October 1979 coincides with the finding of H-M and serves to

support their view that the change in monetary policy operating procedures

on October 6, 1979 did have an impact on the behavior of the real rate of

interest. However, the second breakpoint, April 1983, does not correspond

to H—M's findings of an October 1982 break. The April date does agree,

however, with the results of Antoncic (1986) who finds a trough in the real

rate during April 1983.

    The results in Table 1 do suggest that the problems with the H—M

procedure discussed in the previous section may be empirically important.

To further investigate this issue, anequa.tion for the rate of inflation

was estimated and used to test for breaks in the inflation process. To

maintain similarity with (11), the inflation equation includes the same

right hand variables as (11) withthe exception that     is again excluded

from the regression. Table 2 reports minus twice the log of the Quandt

likelihood ratios for the inflation equation.

    Quite significantly, the maximum value in Table 2 occurs at (1979:11,

1982:09). Both dates correspond closely to the real rate breakpoints

identified by H—M. Since the results in Table 1 do not support H-Ms

finding of a real rate shift in October 1982, the Table 2 results are quite

significant in that they suggest that the inflation process appears to have
                                          -12-


shifted in September 1982, just one month prior to the date H—M identify

with a real rate shift. Recall that              is defined as the rate of inflation

from period t to t+1; if the inflation rate at time t was defined more

conventionally as the rate from t-1 to t, the breakpoint in the inflation

rate process would be dated at exactly October 1982. Since no shift in

late 1982 was indicated by the ex-post rate regression that excluded the

nominal rate, this evidence seems to suggest that the shift in the real

rate found by H-M in October 1982 may actually simply be a reflection of a

shift in the inflation process.

     Further evidence on the dates of shifts in the real rate process can

be obtained by estimating equation (12), which includes only lagged values

of the ex-post real rate and the supply variable as explanatory variables:



                                                                                .(12)
     rt = b0 + b1   ri + b2r      2
                                      +

Table 3 reports minus twice the log of the Quandt likelihood ratio. The

breakpoint pair with the maximal value is (1979:12, 1983:O4).'

Significantly, the second break, in April 1983, agrees exactly with the

results obtained by dropping the nominal rate from the H—M regression.



4. Conclusions

    The empirical results of the previous section clearly indicate that

procedures for identifying process shifts are sensitive to the choice of

variables to include on the right—hand side of a projection equation. For

example, H—Ms conclusion that 1982:10, and not 1983:04, was the most

likely date for a shift in the real rate process depended on the inclusion

of the nominal rate of interest in their regression. This appears to have
                                   —13—


led them to identify the September 1982 shift in the inflation process as a

real rate shift.

     Many important hypothesis in macroeconomics take the form of an

implied invariance across regime shifts. Hence, it is important to be able

to empirically identify the timing of shifts in variables such as the real

rate of interest. The analysis of this paper has shown that the problem of

omitted variables can lead to incorrect inferences if "process shift" is

interpreted to mean 'projection coefficient shift."

     While the focus has been on the problems created by including the

nominal interest rate in a regression for the real rate of interest, the

same problems are created by the inclusion of any variable that is

correlated with omitted variables that affect the rate of inflation. Thus,

while the focus here has been on the nominal rate of interest, lagged rates

of inflation are also likely to give rise tosimilar problems. Thus, the

empirical results reported in Section 3 should only be taken as

illustrative of the care that must be exercised in testing for real rate

shifts.

    *1 would like to thank Tom Sargent for helpful discussion, the referee

for useful comments, and John Duffy for research assistance. This research

was partially supported by the National Science Foundation. Any views

expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views

of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco or the Federal Reserve System.



     1.   See also Sargent (1984).



     2.   That the real rate process might be defined by a projection

equation was suggested to me by the referee.



     3.   Note that this conclusion holds even if s =   0;   i.e. the factors

represented by v do not need to directly effect the ex—ante real rate.

Also, this result does not depend on the unobservability of re, as can be

seen by noting that (8) is independent of a2. The same point can be

illustrated using the model of Litterman and Weiss (1985, p. 145). The H—M

method would find apparant shifts in the real rate whenever a monetary

policy shift occurred, even though the real rate in the Litterman and Weiss

model is, by construction, exogenous with respect to monetary policy.



    4.    Huizinga and Mishkin explicitly recognize that the projection

coefficients they estimate will incorporate the effects of any ommitted

variables correlated with x (see pp. 235-236). This does not create a

serious problem for the H—M procedures, since a change in the stoch4ic
                                              —15—


behavior of the omitted variables will produce a shift in the projection

coefficients H-M estimate. The case not considered by H—M occurs when the

variables omitted from (4) also affect inflation.



      5.   For a complete description of the data, see Huizinga and Mishkin

(1986, pp. 238—239).         I would like to thank John Huizinga and Rick Mishkin

for supplying me with their data.
