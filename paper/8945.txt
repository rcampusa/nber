       This paper analyzes the determinants of homeownership in immigrant households over the
1980-2000 period. The study finds that immigrants have lower homeownership rates than natives and that
the homeownership gap widened significantly during that period. The differential location decisions of
immigrant and native households, as well as the changing national origin mix of the immigrant
population, helps explain much of the homeownership gap. The evidence also indicates that the growth
of ethnic enclaves in major American cities could become an important factor in increasing immigrant
demand for owner-occupied housing in many metropolitan areas.

                   HOMEOWNERSHIP IN THE IMMIGRANT POPULATION

                                              George J. Borjas

I. Introduction

        The social, demographic, and economic changes initiated by the resurgence of large-scale

immigration to the United States are of historic proportions. In 1970, 4.8 percent of the U.S.

population was foreign-born. By 2000, there were 28.4 million foreign-born persons in the

United States, pushing the foreign-born share to over 10 percent [24]. Moreover, because of the

decline in the birthrates of native families, immigration now accounts for nearly half of the

growth in population. In short, immigration inevitably plays an increasingly important role in

determining demographic and economic trends in the United States.1

        Although some observers have argued that the resurgence of immigration may offset the

decline in the demand for owner-occupied housing that may occur as the baby boom ages [7, 17],

the studies that examine the economic performance of immigrants suggest that the link between

immigration and housing demand may not be as straightforward as it seems. For instance, there

exists a large gap between the wages of immigrant and native workers. In 1998, the typical

immigrant worker earned 23 percent less than the typical native worker. Moreover, a great deal

of research has documented that immigrants who arrived in the 1980s and 1990s are relatively

less skilled—and have correspondingly lower wages—than immigrants who came in earlier

waves [2]. Finally, the wages of immigrant and native workers tend to converge, but slowly. As a

result, the immigrant waves that arrived in the 1980s and 1990s may have a 10 to 20 percent

wage disadvantage over much of their working lives. All of these trends imply that a much more



        1 The resurgence of large-scale immigration has generated a large literature that analyzes the economic
impact of immigration, focusing particularly on the labor market consequences [4, 11]
                                                         3

careful study of homeownership in the immigrant population is required before one can assess

how immigration will affect the aggregate demand for owner-occupied housing.2

        This paper uses data drawn from the 1980 and 1990 U.S. Censuses and the 1998-2000 the

Current Population Surveys (CPS) to provide a comprehensive empirical study of the

determinants of homeownership in the immigrant population. The analysis addresses two related

questions. First, what are the trends in homeownership rates in the immigrant population?

Second, which are the key factors that drive these trends?

        It turns out that two variables—which been somewhat neglected in earlier studies of

immigrant homeownership—play a central role in determining differences in homeownership

rates between the immigrant and native populations: The national origin of immigrants and the

residential location choices made by different immigrant groups. It is well known that different

national origin groups experience very different socioeconomic outcomes and that different

groups cluster in different localities. The empirical analysis reported below shows that these two

variables are responsible for many of the key trends in immigrant homeownership rates in the

past two decades, explaining why immigrant households are less likely to own their homes than

native households and why the “homeownership gap” widened substantially since 1980. The

evidence presented in this paper also suggests that the continuing growth of ethnic enclaves in




        2 Earlier studies of homeownership in the immigrant population include Alba and Logan [1], Coulson [8],
Krivo [14], Myers and Lee [18, 19], and Myers, Megbolugbe, and Lee [20]. Many of these studies focus on
documenting the trends in the demand for owner-occupied housing in the immigrant population—and in comparing
homeownership rates between immigrants and natives. Myers and Lee [18] and Myers, Megbolube, and Lee [20],
for example, apply the econometric framework developed in the labor market literature to examine if the newer
immigrant arrivals have different rates of homeownership than earlier immigrant waves, and to determine the rate at
which a given immigrant cohort moves into owner-occupied housing. These studies typically find that more recent
immigrant waves have somewhat lower homeownership rates than earlier waves, but that the immigrant population
experiences relatively fast assimilation into homeownership. The important question of whether immigration affects
housing prices in the localities where immigrants cluster remains unexplored. An important exception is Saiz [22],
who investigates the impact of the Mariel flow of Cuban immigrants in 1980 on rental housing prices in Miami.

American cities could increase demand for owner-occupied housing in immigrant communities

in the years ahead.




II. Descriptive Statistics

         This section describes the basic trends in the demand for owner-occupied housing in the

immigrant and native populations over the 1980-2000 period. The empirical analysis uses data

drawn from the Public Use Microdata Samples of the 1980 and 1990 decennial U.S. Census, and

the 1998-2000 Annual Demographic Files of the CPS.

         The unit of observation is the household. A household is classified as an immigrant

household if the head of the household was born outside the United States and is either an alien

or a naturalized citizen; all other households are classified as “native” households.3 The study is

restricted to households that do not reside in group quarters and that live in one of the

identifiable metropolitan areas in the Census or CPS data.4 The household head must be at least

18 years old to be included in the analysis. I extracted a 1/100 random sample of native

households and a 5/100 random sample of immigrant households from each of the two decennial

Censuses. To increase the sample size in the CPS data, I pooled the data available in the 1998,




         3 I experimented with alternative definitions of the immigrations status of the household. For example, I
used a more stringent definition of an “immigrant household” as a household where all persons are foreign-born.
This alternative definition leads to results that are quite similar to those reported in this paper.

         4Restricting the analysis to households residing in identifiable metropolitan areas affects relatively few
households in the immigrant population. In 2000, for example, 94.2 percent of the immigrant households resided in
these metropolitan areas, as compared to 75.2 percent for native households.
                                                          5

1999, and 2000 surveys. For descriptive convenience, I will refer to these pooled data as the

“2000” CPS data.5

         Table 1 summarizes the key trends revealed by these data. Homeownership rates are

lower among immigrant households than among native households. Further, the homeownership

gap between the two groups widened substantially between 1980 and 2000, with much of the

widening occurring during the 1990s. In particular, the rate of homeownership among immigrant

households declined during this period, at a time when homeownership rates increased steadily

among native households. In 1980, for example, 51.2 percent of immigrant households owned

their homes. This fraction fell to 49.9 percent in 1990, and to 47.4 percent by 2000. In contrast,

the rate of homeownership for native households increased from 63.2 percent in 1980 to 67.2

percent by 2000. Put differently, the 12-percentage point gap in homeownership rates that

existed between immigrants and natives in 1980 grew to a 20-point disadvantage by 2000.6

         Table 1 also reports homeownership rates for various immigrant waves throughout the

1980-2000 period. The observed trends in homeownership rates for the various immigrant

cohorts yield two key findings that will be explored further below. As in Myers and Lee [19], the

data suggest that immigrant households experience a high rate of assimilation into

homeownership. Consider, for instance, the homeownership rate of the immigrants who arrived


         5 The three CPS extracts contain roughly the same number of observations. I constructed household
weights for the pooled sample by assuming that the total number of weighted households in each of the CPS
calendar years was exactly equal to one-third of the total number of weighted households in the pooled sample.

         6 Because much of the widening in the homeownership gap occurred between 1990 and 2000, some of the
pattern could arise because of a data comparability problem: the 1990 homeownership rates are calculated using
Census data while the 2000 rates are based on CPS data. It turns out, however, that there is a significant widening of
the homeownership gap even when one considers only the trend contained in the CPS files. Prior to the mid-1990s,
the CPS conducted occasional surveys that reported the immigration status of households. In general, the
homeownership rates reported in the June 1988 CPS Supplement are quite similar to those reported by the 1990
Census. In 1988, the homeownership rate for native households was 63.6 percent, while the homeownership rate for
immigrant households was 50.3 percent (as compared to 64.2 and 49.9 percent in the 1990 Census, respectively).
                                                           6

between 1975 and 1979. In 1980, shortly after their arrival, only 19.5 percent of the immigrant

households in this cohort owned their homes. By 1980, the cohort’s ownership rate had increased

to 45.7 percent, and by 2000 it had increased further to 56.4 percent. It is evident, therefore, that

homeownership rates rise substantially over time for specific immigrant cohorts. Of course, this

increase must be contrasted with the rise in homeownership experienced by comparably aged

native households in order to determine if there is rapid assimilation into homeownership.

Nevertheless, the data seem to suggest that there may well be a great deal of assimilation.

         Second, it seems that more recent immigrant waves tend to have lower homeownership

rates than earlier waves. This finding, of course, mirrors the well-known result of declining

relative skills for successive immigrant waves, where it is typically found that later immigrant

waves have relatively lower educational attainment and wages than earlier immigrant waves,

holding constant the number of years the worker has resided in the United States. To illustrate,

the 1980 Census indicates that 35.9 percent of the immigrants who had been in the country

between 5 and 10 years (i.e., the 1970-74 arrivals) owned their homes. In contrast, the 1990

Census reveals that only 30.6 percent of the immigrants who had been in the country between 5

and 10 years owned their homes, and the 2000 CPS reveals that 26.4 percent of those who have

been in the country between 5 and 10 years owned their homes. Over a 20-year period, therefore,

the homeownership rate of immigrant households who have been in the country between 5 and

10 years fell by almost 10 percentage points.




The difference in the homeownership rate between these two data sets is not statistically significant for either native
or immigrant households, and is not significant even within narrowly defined year-of-arrival immigrant cohorts.

   Measuring Cohort Effects and Assimilation

       The intercensal tracking of immigrant cohorts conducted in Table 1 does not provide a

complete description of the extent of assimilation into homeownership that actually takes place

in the immigrant population. The intercensal comparison of a sample of immigrants who are

aged 18 or above is contaminated by the fact that later Censuses include a number of persons

who migrated as children. It is likely that immigrant children do not experience the same process

of assimilation into homeownership as immigrants who entered the country as adults. Therefore,

a better description of the assimilation experience of an immigrant cohort requires that the

analysis also control for age at migration. In effect, one can then compare how an age-adjusted

immigrant cohort performs relative to natives who are at the same stage of the life cycle. Myers

and Lee [18] introduced this notion into the housing literature by conducting a “double-cohort”

analysis of homeownership rates in the immigrant and native populations, which accounts for

both calendar year of arrival and age-at-migration when tracking immigrant cohorts across

Censuses.

       Table 2 summarizes the descriptive evidence on assimilation for these narrowly defined

immigrant cohorts over the 1980-2000 period. It is clear that tracking specific age groups across

Censuses reveals the existence of sizable assimilation effects into homeownership in the

immigrant population. Consider, for example, the sample of immigrants who arrived in the

United States between 1975 and 1979 and who were 25-34 years old in 1980 (so that most

household heads in this sample migrated as young adults). In 1980, just after entry, the

homeownership rate for this group of immigrant households was 16.5 percent. By 1990, the

homeownership rate for this cohort had risen to 53.1 percent, a remarkable rise during the first

ten years in the country, and increased further to 68.3 percent by 2000. In contrast to the 52-point
                                                        8

rise in homeownership rates experienced by this immigrant cohort, the homeownership rate of

natives who were aged 25-34 in 1980 increased from 49.8 percent in 1980 to 76.8 percent in

2000, a 27-point increase. In short, the young immigrants who arrived in the late 1970s

experienced a remarkable degree of assimilation into homeownership. It seems as if

homeownership is an important part of the “offer” of political, cultural, and economic benefits

that draws immigrants to the United States.

        The remaining rows of Table 2 show the same rapid assimilation into homeownership for

most immigrant cohorts, particularly those who arrived in the country in their 20s and 30s. Not

surprisingly, the rate of assimilation is not as fast—although it is still sizable—for immigrants

who entered the country at an older age. Consider, for instance, the experience of immigrants

who arrived between 1985 and 1989 and who were 45-54 years old at the time of arrival. The

homeownership rate for this cohort increased “only” from 25.4 to 40.5 percent between 1990 and

2000. Nevertheless, this 15-point rise in homeownership rates is substantial when compared with

the 4.6 percentage point rise exhibited by comparably aged native households over the same time

period, from 76.2 to 80.8 percent.

        Finally, the descriptive data in Table 2 shows that cohort effects, with more recent

cohorts having lower homeownership rates, remain important even after controlling for age-at-

migration. Consider, for example, the experience of the immigrants who have been in the United

States fewer than five years and who are relatively young (25 to 34 years old) at the time of

entry. The homeownership rate for this group of young arrivals was 16.5 percent in 1980, 12.2

percent in 1990, and 10.0 percent in 2000, a drop of 6.5 percentage points.7 In contrast, the group



        7A potential data problem arises when one compares the homeownership rates of the “most” recent
immigrants across data sets. Table 2 defines this cohort as immigrants who arrived between 1975 and 1979 in the
1980 Census; 1985 and 1989 in the 1990 Census; and 1995 and 2000 in the pooled 2000 CPS. Because the pooled
                                                        9

of native households aged 25-34 had a homeownership rate of 49.8 percent in 1980 and 46.7

percent in 2000, a much slower decline than that observed among comparably aged immigrant

cohorts. In short there is a persistent decline in homeownership rates across successive

immigrant cohorts, both in absolute terms and relative to the trends in homeownership observed

in the native population.

        It is important to note that there is one crucial difference between the homeownership

trends revealed by Table 2 and the assimilation and cohort effects that have been measured in

studies of immigrant skills or labor market performance. Although both sets of results indicate

that more recent waves perform relatively worse than earlier waves along some basic economic

dimension, the two sets of findings differ in one fundamental way: There is a significant amount

of assimilation into homeownership, but there is relatively little assimilation in wages or in skill

accumulation. It would be of great interest to determine why this important difference in the

assimilation experience arises. Unfortunately, there has been relatively little study of the

variables that determine the rate of wage convergence between immigrants and natives. As a

result, the available evidence provides little hint as to the underlying factors that facilitate or

hamper the economic progress of immigrants.



    National Origin Differences in Homeownership Rates

        Studies that examine the trends in immigrant economic performance in the United States

have often emphasized the importance of national origin in generating many of these trends [3].

The national origin mix of the immigrant population is an important part of any attempt to

understand aggregate trends for two reasons. First, there are huge differences in skills and


2000 CPS consists of the 1998, 1999, and 2000 surveys, these pooled data cannot provide a representative sample of
persons who migrated between 1995 and 2000.
                                                 10

economic performance across national origin groups in the United States, with groups that

originate in the industrialized countries performing better in the U.S. labor market than groups

originating in less-developed countries. For example, immigrants from El Salvador or Mexico

earn 40 percent less than natives, while immigrants from Germany or the United Kingdom earn

30 to 40 percent more [4, p. 1686]. Second, there has been a substantial “redistribution” of

admissions, away from the traditional European countries and towards less-developed countries

in Asia and Latin America. Over two-thirds of the legal immigrants admitted during the 1950s

originated in Europe or Canada, 25 percent originated in Latin America, and only 6 percent

originated in Asia. By the 1990s, only 14 percent of the immigrants originated in Europe or

Canada, almost half originated in Latin America, and 31 percent originated in Asia. In view of

these trends, therefore, it is not surprising that the changing national origin mix of immigrants

can “explain” a large part of the decline in relative wages across successive immigrant waves.

      The first four columns of Table 3 document the huge differences in educational attainment

and log of household income across national origin groups in 1990. Mean years of schooling

range from 8 years for immigrants originating in Mexico or Portugal, to about 15 years for

immigrants originating in such diverse countries as India and the United Kingdom. Similarly,

immigrants from El Salvador or Mexico have household income that is 30 percent lower than

that of native households, while immigrants from the United Kingdom have 6 percent higher

household income, and immigrants from India have 38 percent higher household income.

Moreover, these differences cannot be attributed to the fact that some national origin groups have

lived in the United States for longer periods. The data reported in Table 3 also shows that there is

substantial dispersion in both educational attainment and household income even among

immigrants who have been in the country more than 10 years.
                                                 11

      In view of these huge differences in skills and household income among immigrant groups,

it is not surprising that there are also huge differences in homeownership rates among national

origin groups. The last two columns of Table 3 document some of these differences. In 1990, the

homeownership rate was 78.8 percent for Italian immigrants, 70.5 percent for German

immigrants, 56.5 percent for Chinese immigrants, 38.4 percent for Mexican immigrants, 17.3

percent for Salvadoran immigrants, and 14.2 percent for immigrants from the Dominican

Republic. Moreover, as the last column of the table shows, these differences cannot be dismissed

as reflecting the possibility that some groups have, on average, spent a longer time in the United

States and hence have had more time to assimilate. The national origin differences in

homeownership rates remain strong and significant even among immigrants who have been in

the United States at least 10 years. For instance, even after 10 years in the United States, the

homeownership rate of immigrants originating in Canada (70.6 percent) is more than 50

percentage points larger than the homeownership rate of immigrants originating in the

Dominican Republic (18.4 percent).

      The huge national origin differentials in homeownership rates raise a number of interesting

issues that will be explored in what follows. In particular: What factors explain the sizable

national origin differences in tenure choice? To what extent does the changing national origin

mix of the immigrant population account for the aggregate decline in homeownership rates

observed between 1980 and 2000? And do ethnic enclaves—which may capture a crucial

interaction between national origin and the geographic location of immigrants—speed up or slow

down the move to owner-occupied housing by immigrant groups?
                                                12


   Geographic Clustering of Immigrants

       It is well known that immigrants and natives tend to live in different places. Table 4

illustrates the extreme geographic clustering that exists in the immigrant population. In 1990,

32.5 percent of the immigrant population lived in only three metropolitan areas (Los Angeles,

New York, and Miami). In contrast, only 9.1 percent of the native population was clustered in

the three largest metropolitan areas housing natives (New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago).

       Not surprisingly, there are sizable differences in homeownership rates across

metropolitan areas, for both immigrant and native households. In 1990, the homeownership rate

for immigrants in Los Angeles was only 39.1 percent, while the homeownership rate for

immigrants in Chicago was 55.5 percent. In contrast, the homeownership rate for natives in Los

Angeles was 55.3 percent, while the homeownership rate for natives in Chicago was 63.2

percent.

       The extreme geographic clustering of immigrants—and the fact that homeownership rates

vary dramatically across metropolitan areas—may be a particularly important determinant of the

homeownership gap between immigrant and native households. In particular, even a superficial

look at the data reported in Table 4 suggests that a relatively large number of immigrants tend to

live in metropolitan areas where even native households have low homeownership rates. For

example, the two metropolitan areas with the largest immigrant populations in 1990 were Los

Angeles and New York (accounting for 27.4 percent of all immigrant households). It turns out,

however, that the homeownership rate in these two metropolitan areas is relatively low even for

native households—55.3 percent in Los Angeles and 37.9 percent in New York—far below the

national average of 64.2 percent. As a result, it seems likely that part of the homeownership gap

between immigrants and natives can be attributed to the fact that many immigrants just happen to
                                                13

live in areas that have relatively low homeownership rates—for reasons that may have much

more to do with the structure of the housing market and housing costs in these areas, rather than

with the specific disadvantages faced by immigrant households.

       The extreme geographic clustering of immigrants is likely to play an important role in

determining demand for owner-occupied housing for yet another reason. In particular, not only

are immigrants—as a group—clustered in a few geographic areas, but different types of

immigrants tend to be clustered in different places. A disproportionately large number of

Mexican immigrants, for instance, reside in Los Angeles; a disproportionately large number of

Cuban immigrants reside in Miami, and a disproportionately large number of immigrants from

the Dominican Republic reside in New York. This geographic sorting of the immigrant

population has given rise to the large ethnic enclaves that are a prominent characteristic of major

American cities.

       It is likely that the enclave economy alters the incentives for homeownership. After all,

the enclave changes economic opportunities as well as provides a clustering of persons who

share the same preferences and attitudes as the immigrants, thus perhaps affecting the value of

the amenities that the local area has to offer. Section IV will examine the empirical impact of the

ethnic enclave on homeownership rates in the immigrant population.




III. Determinants of the Homeownership Gap

       A voluminous literature examines tenure choice in the United States [12, 13, 21]. This

literature has shown that household income, credit constraints, labor market conditions, and

housing prices play a crucial role in determining the household’s tenure choice. In addition, the

literature documents that many socioeconomic variables, such as educational attainment,
                                                        14

household composition, race, and ethnicity, are important determinants of homeownership rates.

I adopt the basic model used in this literature to examine the determinants of the homeownership

gap between immigrants and native. In particular, consider estimating the following linear

probability model separately in each cross-section data set:



(1)              Hit = Xit βt + δt Iit + εit ,



where Hit indicates the homeownership status of household i at time t (set to one if the household

lives in owner-occupied housing, and zero otherwise); X gives a vector describing the

socioeconomic background of the household (described below); and Iit equals one if the

household is an immigrant household, and zero otherwise. For computational convenience, I use

the linear probability model throughout the study. The regression models will often have large

numbers of observations (in the hundreds of thousands) and contain many standardizing

variables (over 400 regressors). I estimated somewhat similar models using the logistic

specification in smaller, randomly drawn samples, and obtained numerically similar results. The

linear probability specification implies that the coefficient δt gives the difference in

homeownership rates between immigrants and natives at time t after adjusting for differences in

the characteristics X between the two groups.8 Since the regression in (1) is estimated separately




         8 Because of the rotation sampling used by the CPS, 50 percent of the observations can theoretically appear
in two consecutive March surveys. In practice, the fraction of observations that can be matched across years is
considerably lower [16]. The regressions reported below do not adjust the standard errors of the regression
coefficients estimated in the 2000 cross-section for the correlation that this sampling methodology imparts in the
residuals. To check the reliability of the evidence, I estimated some of the regression models on a sample of
household heads that could not be matched across CPS surveys, ensuring that there were no repeat observations for
the same household. The regression coefficients were quantitatively similar, and the key effects discussed in this

in each cross-section, the trend in the parameter δt will indicate if the adjusted homeownership

gap is narrowing or widening.

        Table 5 presents summary statistics describing differences in a large vector of

background socioeconomic characteristics between immigrants and natives in the various

samples. It is clear that immigrants and native households differ in fundamental ways:

immigrant households, for instance, have lower household income (about 18 percent lower in

2000), are larger (by about .7 persons per household), have more children (.3 more children per

household), and are more likely to contain both spouses (51 percent of native household heads

are married, spouse present, as compared to 58 percent of immigrant households).

        It turns out, however, that these differences in socioeconomic characteristics do not play

an important role in determining the homeownership gap between immigrants and natives. Table

6 summarizes the evidence. The first row of the table reports the unadjusted differences in

homeownership rates, while the remaining rows use alternative specifications for the regression

model in (1). The second row reports the coefficient δ after the regression controls for the

detailed vector of socioeconomic variables summarized in Table 5, including the age, sex, and

educational attainment of the household head; the household’s log income; the number of

persons and children in the household; and dummy variables indicating if the head is married

spouse present, or married spouse absent.9 The data reveal a surprising fact: differences in these

socioeconomic variables between immigrants and natives explain relatively little of the gap in

homeownership rates. In 2000, for example, the unadjusted gap is 19.7 percentage points, and




        9 The full regressions (not shown in the table) suggest that the standardizing variables typically have the
expected impact on homeownership. Homeownership rates are higher in high-income households or in households
where the head is highly educated, and are lower in households headed by a woman or a by relatively young person.
                                                          16

falls to only 16.4 percentage points even after controlling for this extensive set of differences in

socioeconomic background between the two populations.10

         However, the third row of Table 6 shows that there is one important variable—which has

not been widely stressed in earlier studies—that explains a larger part of the homeownership gap:

the difference in the residential location choices made by immigrant and native households. As I

documented earlier, the rate of homeownership varies systematically across cities (e.g.,

homeownership rates are low in New York City and high in San Jose). These metropolitan area

differences probably have little to do with immigration, and may be attributable to differences in

the structure of the housing market or to regional differences in housing costs. One can easily

control for these differences in homeownership rates across metropolitan areas, regardless of

their source, by simply including a vector of almost 300 metropolitan area fixed effects in the

vector X. Table 6 shows that including a vector of dummy variables indicating the metropolitan

area where the household resides in the regression model narrows the homeownership gap in

each cross-section: from 12.0 percent to 6.0 percent in 1980, from 14.4 percent to 9.2 percent in

1990, and from 19.7 percent to 13.5 percent in 2000.11

         The evidence summarized in Table 6, therefore, provides one important insight into how

the homeownership gap between immigrants and natives arises: immigrants and natives simply

tend to choose to live in different areas. In fact, the comparison of rows 2 and 3 of the table

suggest that locational differences between the immigrant and native populations explain a far


         10  The homeownership gap between immigrants and natives is evaluated at the point where the years-since-
migration variable takes on the mean value for the immigrant population. The inclusion of the years-since-migration
variable in the regression models helps to control for differences that may exist across immigrant waves due either
to the process of assimilation or to cohort differences in homeownership rates.

         11The F-statistic associated with the vector of metropolitan area fixed effects is 140.2 in 1980, 137.9 in
1990, and 18.7 in 2000, implying that metropolitan area fixed effects play a very significant role in determining
homeownership rates.
                                                 17

larger part of the homeownership gap than do differences in background characteristics.

However, the table also indicates that the relative importance of locational differences declined

somewhat between 1980 and 2000. In 1980, differences in location between the two populations

explain almost one-half of the homeownership gap; by 2000, differences in location account for

about a third of the gap. The available evidence suggests that immigration began to “spread”

from the traditional gateway cities to many other locations in the United States during the 1990s

[6]. As a result, the location decision of the two populations could have become a somewhat less

important determinant of the homeownership gap during this period. Note, however, that despite

their declining importance, the differences in location decisions made by the two populations still

play a crucial role in determining the homeownership gap, generating a 6-point gap in

homeownership rates in 2000.

       Finally, the fourth row of the table includes both the socioeconomic variables and the

vector of metropolitan area fixed effects. It is evident that there remains a great deal of

unexplained variation in homeownership rates between immigrant and native households. More

importantly, this unexplained gap is growing rapidly over time, from 5.7 percentage points in

1980 to 10.3 percentage points in 2000.



   National Origin

       I showed earlier that there are substantial differences in homeownership rates among

national origin groups. In addition, it is well known that the national origin mix of the immigrant

population in the United States changed substantially in recent decades. It is reasonable,

therefore, to suspect that some of the aggregate trend in the homeownership gap may be linked to

the changing national origin mix of immigrants.
                                                           18

         Before proceeding to examine this relationship, it is instructive to examine the extent to

which the differences in homeownership rates across national origin groups simply proxy for

differences in socioeconomic or demographic characteristics. I estimated the following

regression model separately in each of the cross-sections:



(2)               Hijt = Xijt βt + njt + εijt ,



where njt denotes a national origin fixed effect indicating if the household head was born in

country j. I construct this vector of national origin fixed effects so that the left-out dummy

variable indicates if the household is a native-born household. The coefficients of the fixed

effects, therefore, give the adjusted difference in homeownership rates between a particular

national origin group and the native population. I restrict the analysis to the 90 largest national

origin groups.12 These 90 national origin groups contain over 90 percent of the immigrants who

entered the United States between 1960 and 1990.

         The top panel of Table 7 summarizes some of the results of the analysis. To simplify the

presentation of the evidence—and because the qualitative nature of the results was quite similar

across the various cross-sections—Table 7 only reports the results obtained with the 1990

Census data. The two columns of the table represent alternative specification of the regression

model in (2). The coefficients reported in the first column come from a regression that do not

contain any explanatory variables in the vector X, so that the reported coefficients give simply

the unadjusted difference in homeownership rates between the immigrant group and the native




         12 This restriction ensures that there are sufficient observations for each of the groups to reliably estimate
the national origin differentials in homeownership rates.
                                                          19

population. The second column includes the detailed vector of socioeconomic variables

described earlier as well as the vector of metropolitan area fixed effects.

         It is evident that the inclusion of the background variables and metropolitan area fixed

effects explain part of the differences in homeownership rates across national origin groups. For

example, the unadjusted gap between Mexicans and natives is 25.9 percentage points. This

narrows down to 11.1 percentage points when the regression adjusts for differences in

background characteristics and area of residence.

         However, it is also evident that these explanatory variables do not account for most of the

differences in homeownership rates across national origin groups. For instance, even after

controlling for background characteristics and metropolitan area fixed effects, the

homeownership gap was 16.5 percentage points for immigrants from the Dominican Republic,

8.2 percentage points for immigrants from India, and 12.0 percentage points for immigrants from

Korea.13

         The bottom panel of the table presents some statistics that further describe the dispersion

in the vector of the national origin fixed effects estimated from the regression model in equation

(2). In particular, I present the standard deviation of the coefficients in this vector (weighted by

the sample size of the national origin group in each particular Census year). The standard

deviation in the unadjusted homeownership gap across the 90 national origin groups in 1990 is

.157, and declines to .085 when all the explanatory variables are included in the regression

model. In other words, an extensive set of observable characteristics describing the determinants




         13 Although there exist sizable national origin differences in homeownership rates, the inclusion of the
national origin fixed effects into the regression model does not alter the coefficients of most of the socioeconomic
background variables. In 1990, for example, the coefficient of log of household income is .128 in the absence of
national origin fixed effects and .129 when the national origin fixed effects are introduced.
                                                        20

of the homeownership decision explains only about half of the observable differences across

national origin groups.

         As noted earlier, the labor economics literature has documented the existence of national

origin differences in many economic outcomes, and has stressed that as a result of these

differences, the changing national origin mix of immigrants can help explain aggregate trends in

the immigrant population. The available evidence, however, does not help us understand the

source of much of the national origin differentials. Evidently, these differences persist even after

controlling for a detailed set of background characteristics. It is plausible that such factors as

discrimination against particular national origin groups, or differences in the way that the

immigrant population is self-selected from each source country’s population could be

responsible for the remaining differences. The importance of national origin in determining

tenure choice for the immigrant population suggests that the continuing study of these

differences is an important area for further research.



      National Origin and the Widening Homeownership Gap

         The evidence reported in Table 6 suggests that differences in location decisions or

background variables between the immigrant and native populations cannot account for the

widening gap in homeownership rates between the two populations. To more directly ascertain

the source of this increasing disparity, consider the following empirical exercise. Suppose we

pool two of the cross-sections, such as the 1980 Census and the 2000 CPS, and consider the

linear probability regression model:



(3)             Hit = Xit γ + π Rit + δt Iit + θ (Iit × Rit) + εit ,
                                                 21




where Rit is a dummy variable set to unity if the observation is drawn from the 2000 CPS, and

zero otherwise.

       The key feature of the regression specification in equation (3) is that it includes the

immigrant dummy variable, a dummy variable indicating whether the observation was drawn

from the 2000 CPS, and an interaction between these two variables. In the absence of any

explanatory variables in the vector X, the coefficient of this interaction term (or θ) would

measure how much faster the homeownership rate changed in the immigrant population relative

to the change observed in the native population over the 1980-2000 period.

       To give an example, the descriptive statistics presented earlier imply that the

homeownership rate rose by 4.0 percentage points in the native population between 1980 and

2000. I will restrict the empirical analysis reported in this section to either native households or

to immigrant households belonging to one of the 90 largest national origin groups. The data

indicate that the homeownership rate of immigrants (in this restricted sample of 90 national

origin groups) was 51.6 percent in 1980, and 47.7 percent in 2000, for a decline of 3.9

percentage points over the period. The coefficient θ would then give the difference-in-

differences estimate of the widening in the homeownership gap, which equals –7.9 percentage

points (or –3.9 – 4.0). In other words, the parameter θ measures the rate of change in the

homeownership rate of the immigrant population relative to what was happening in the native

population. The inclusion of socioeconomic variables in equation (3) does not change the basic

interpretation of the coefficient θ; the coefficient now simply gives the relative rate of change in

homeownership rates after adjusting for differences in background characteristics.
                                                        22


        Table 8 reports the coefficient θ estimated from a number of alternative specifications of

the regression model in (3) for the 1980-90 and 1980-2000 periods, respectively. The first row

indicates the value of the coefficient θ in the absence of any controls in the regression model. As

we saw from the numerical exercise in the previous paragraph, the coefficient θ takes on a value

of –7.9 percent for the 1980-2000 period.

        The second row of the tables adds the detailed vector of background variables described

earlier to the regression specification (including the age, sex, educational attainment, and marital

status of the household head, the income of the household, the number of persons and children in

the household; and the number of years that immigrants have resided in the United States). The

coefficient θ now takes on a value of -5.1 percentage points, so that the homeownership gap

widened substantially even after controlling for differences in background characteristics

between the two populations.14 The third row includes only a vector of metropolitan area fixed

effects in the vector X, and shows that the different location decisions of immigrants and natives

do not help explain the widening of the homeownership gap at all. Put differently, the evidence

indicates that the homeownership gap between immigrants and natives widened even within

metropolitan areas.

        The specification of the regression model in (3) implies that the metropolitan area fixed

effects control for factors that are specific to the metropolitan area and that did not change over

the 1980-2000 period. It is likely, however, that there were factors, such as housing prices, that

changed within a metropolitan area, and that the rate of change varied across areas. In other



        14  It is worth noting that the vector of socioeconomic characteristics includes a variable indicating the
length of time that immigrant households have resided in the United States. The evidence reported in Table 8
indicates that changes in the mean number of years-since-migration do not explain the widening homeownership
gap. The main reason is that this variable was roughly constant over the 1980-2000 period. The typical immigrant in
1980 had been in the United States for 22.1 years, in 1990 for 21.1 years, and in 2000 for 21.3 years.
                                                       23

words, there are likely to be trends in homeownership rates that are specific to metropolitan

areas. To account for these varying trends across metropolitan areas in a very general way,

consider the expanded regression model:



(3′)           Hit = Xit γ + π Rit + δt Iit + θ (Iit × Rit) + ρikt + (ρikt × Rit) + εit ,



where ρikt denotes a vector of fixed effects indicating if the household resides in metropolitan

area k, and (ρikt × Rit) denotes the interaction of this vector with the dummy variable indicating if

the observation was drawn from the 2000 CPS. The coefficients of these interaction variables are

fixed effects giving the adjusted rate of change in homeownership rates within a metropolitan

area. The expanded specification in equation (3′), therefore, controls both for the fact that

metropolitan areas are different at the beginning of the period, and that the homeownership rates

were changing differentially across metropolitan areas. The fourth row of Table 8 reports the

coefficients obtained from this more general specification. The verdict is clear: controlling for

the varying trends in homeownership rates across metropolitan areas does not help explain the

widening homeownership gap between immigrants and natives. There is still a 7.7 percentage

point unexplained widening over the period.

       It is worth stressing that by interacting the period effect (R) with the metropolitan area

fixed effects, equation (3) completely controls for the possibility that the 1980-2000 trend in

homeownership rates varies systematically across metropolitan areas. Note that it would be

statistically impossible to include either a measure of the price level in the metropolitan area as

of 1980 or the change in the price level in the metropolitan area over the 1980-2000 period into

this regression model. After all, these price indices would be perfectly collinear with the two
                                                   24


vectors of metropolitan area fixed effects (ρitk and ρitk × Rit) included in the regression model.

The regression specification in equation (3), therefore, already controls for any factors that are

specific to the metropolitan area either in the cross-section or over time, regardless of their

source.

          It turns out, however, that there is an additional vector of variables that can be included in

the regression model in (3) that can completely account for the widening homeownership gap.

The fifth row of the table includes a vector indicating the country of birth of the immigrant

household, so that the coefficient θ now estimates what happened to the homeownership gap

within national origin groups. The coefficient reported in row 5 of the table for the 1980-2000

period is zero, both numerically and statistically. In other words, the homeownership gap was

constant between 1980 and 2000 within national origin groups. It is evident, therefore, that the

changing national origin mix of the immigrant population is the key variable that explains the

widening homeownership gap between immigrants and natives. Put differently, we would not

have observed an increase in the homeownership gap over these two decades had the national

origin mix of immigrants remained constant over the period.

          The evidence summarized in this paper, therefore, implies that the “newer” national

origin groups tend to have relatively lower homeownership rates than “earlier” national origin

groups, and that this difference helps explain why homeownership rates have declined in the

immigrant population at a time when they were increasing in the native population. As with the

literature that analyzes the labor market performance of immigrants, national origin plays a

crucial role in the determination of the aggregate level of homeownership rates for the immigrant

population.
                                                  25

       The last row of Table 8 includes all of the explanatory variables in the regression in

equation (3): background characteristics, metropolitan area fixed effects as well as fixed effects

accounting for different trends in homeownership rates across metropolitan areas, and country of

origin fixed effects. It is evident that the results of this most general specification do not change

the key implication of the analysis. Much of the increasing gap in homeownership rates between

immigrants and natives can be attributed to the fact that there are substantial differences in

homeownership rates across national origin groups, and that the changing national origin mix of

the immigrant population over the past two decades has led to a situation where the “average”

immigrant now belongs to a national origin group that simply tends to have a low

homeownership rate.




IV. Ethnic Enclaves

       The evidence summarized in the previous section illustrated the importance of the

geographic sorting of immigrants in the United States as well as the national origin mix of the

immigrant population in generating differences in homeownership rates between immigrants and

natives. There is an additional sense in which the interaction between these two variables might

influence the demand for owner-occupied housing. Because particular immigrant groups tend to

cluster in particular cities, the geographic sorting leads to the creation and growth of ethnic

enclaves. It is likely that ethnic enclaves affect the structure of the housing market and the

amenities available in particular areas to different national origin groups.

       There has been a great deal of debate over how ethnic enclaves affect the economic well

being of immigrants in the United States. One could argue that the geographic clustering and the

“warm embrace” of the enclave helps immigrants escape the discrimination that they might have
                                                         26

otherwise encountered in the labor and housing markets outside the enclave. This argument

would suggest that clustering improves economic opportunities for immigrant families within the

enclave. Moreover, the presence of other immigrants with similar preferences and attitudes in the

neighborhood may make the neighborhood much more welcoming and desirable. These

improvements in housing amenities and in economic opportunities could increase the demand for

owner-occupied housing in immigrant enclaves.

         One can also argue, however, that the clustering can have adverse economic effects. The

ethnic enclave creates incentives for immigrants not to acquire the skills that might be useful in

the larger national market. In other words, the clustering may effectively hinder the move to

better-paying jobs by reducing the immigrants’ incentives to learn the culture and language of

the American labor market. In a sense, immigrants who live and work in an ethnic enclave are

the victims of a monopsony, a “one-company” town. These adverse economic effects would

presumably reduce the income of immigrant families living in the enclaves, lowering their

demand for owner-occupied housing.15

         This section estimates the link between ethnic enclaves and the demand for owner-

occupied housing.16 The empirical analysis exploits the information on national origin and

metropolitan residence contained in the microdata sets used in the previous sections. However,

because the sample size within a cell defined by metropolitan area and national origin is




         15 Although there has been a contentious debate over whether immigrants benefit from working in an
ethnic enclave, a recent comprehensive study by Light and Gold [15, p. 70] concludes that “ethnic economies pay
lower wages than the general labor market.” A recent study by Borjas [5] provides additional evidence that there is a
strong negative correlation between the earnings of immigrants and the fraction of the metropolitan area’s
population that belongs to the immigrant’s ethnic group.

         16Toussaint-Comeau and Rhine [23] conduct a case study of homeownership in an enclave of Hispanic
immigrants in Chicago, and document that immigrants who are not English proficient will seek out Spanish-
speaking lenders.
                                                     27

relatively small in the CPS data, the empirical study is restricted to the larger 1980 and 1990

Census extracts.

       Define a particular immigrant group as the sample of foreign-born households with a

head born in country j and who live in metropolitan area k. To ensure that there is a sufficiently

large number of observations in each (j, k) cell, I again restrict the analysis to the 90 largest

national origin groups in the United States.

       As I showed earlier, different national origin groups in the United States tend to settle in

different areas. To measure the extent of geographic ethnic clustering [9], I use an exposure

measure of ethnic clustering defined by:



                                          N jk
(4)             Exposure Index = S jk =          ,
                                          Nk



where Njk gives the total number of persons who were born in country j and live in metropolitan

area k at a particular point in time (either 1980 or 1990); and Nk gives the total number of persons

(including natives) who live in metropolitan area k at that time. The counts Njk and Nk are

calculated using the entire population of persons aged 18-64 who were enumerated by each

Census in metropolitan area k, regardless of their work status or gender. The exposure index,

therefore, simply gives the fraction of the metropolitan area’s adult-age population that belongs

to the particular national origin group. Ideally, the analysis would relate homeownership rates to

measures of ethnic concentration at a more finely detailed geographic level, but such data are not

available.
                                                           28


      Regression Analysis

         I initially investigate the empirical nature of the link between homeownership and ethnic

enclaves by estimating the following linear probability model separately in the 1980 and 1990

census cross-sections:



(5)               Hijkt = Xijkt βt + αt Sijkt + njt + ρkt + εijkt ,



where Hijkt is a dummy variable indicating if an immigrant household i born in country j and

living in metropolitan area k owns a home at time t; X is a vector of standardizing variables

(described below); Sjkt is the exposure index; nj denotes a vector of fixed effects indicating the

household’s country of origin; and ρk denotes a vector of fixed effects indicating the

metropolitan area of residence.17 Further, I estimate equation (5) using only the sample of

immigrant households that belong to one of the 90 largest national origin groups in the

immigrant population.18

         The coefficient α measures the link between homeownership and ethnic clustering. The

regression model in equation (5) includes two crucial vectors of fixed effects. First, the model

includes a vector of metropolitan area fixed effects. In any given cross-section, these geographic

fixed effects controls for the possibility that housing costs or the structure of the housing market



         17  I also conducted the analysis using an alternative measure of immigrant clustering that divides equation
(4) by the fraction of the total U.S. population that belongs to the national origin group. This index of “relative
clustering” would equal one when the fraction of type-j immigrants who live in metropolitan area k is the same as
the fraction of type-j immigrants in the entire population of the United States. The empirical findings obtained with
this alternative measure of the relative size of the ethnic group were similar to those reported in this section.

         18 Note that the sample of native households is not used in estimating the model. It would be of interest to
investigate how the creation and growth of ethnic enclaves influenced homeownership rates among native
households residing in those areas.
                                                 29

varies across metropolitan areas. In other words, the metropolitan area fixed effects net out any

area-specific effects on the demand for owner-occupied housing that equally affect all groups

living in that metropolitan area. Second, the regression model includes a vector of national origin

fixed effects. As show above, there are sizable unexplained differences in homeownership rates

across national origin groups (just as there are sizable unexplained national origin differentials in

many labor market outcomes). By including these fixed effects, the regression effectively

isolates the impact of different levels of ethnic clustering on the same national origin group.

Hence the impact of the ethnic enclave on homeownership is being identified from within-group

variation, taking advantage of the fact that members of the same national origin group choose to

reside in different metropolitan areas. In other words, the regression model in equation (5)

addresses the following type of question: what happens to the probability of homeownership

when, say, a Mexican household lives in Los Angeles, where there is a large Mexican

population, rather than in Miami, where there are relatively few Mexican immigrants?

       Of course, this methodological approach raises the obvious issue of endogeneity in the

residential location of immigrants. After all, immigrants will likely move to metropolitan areas

where they face better economic opportunities (and perhaps better conditions in the housing

market). I will discuss the bias introduced by the endogeneity of residential location below.

       The first row of Table 9 presents the coefficient α estimated from alternative

specifications of the regression model in (5). The first column reports the coefficient estimated in

the 1980 cross-section, while the second column reports the coefficients estimated in the 1990

data. As before, the regressions control for a detailed vector of background variables, including

the age, sex, educational attainment, and marital status of the household head, the log income of

the household, and the number of persons and children in the household. In both census years,
                                                       30

there is a numerically strong and statistically significant positive relation between the probability

of homeownership and the relative size of the ethnic enclave in the metropolitan area.

        Moreover, the evidence suggests that ethnic enclaves remain important even when we

look at the trend in homeownership within a particular metropolitan area. In particular, consider

the following empirical exercise. Suppose we pool the 1980 and 1990 cross-sections and

estimate the following regression model in these pooled data:



(6)             Hijkt = Xijkt β + π Rit + α Sijkt + njt + ρkt + (ρkt × Rit) + εijkt ,



where Rit is a dummy variable set to unity if the observation is drawn from the 1990 census, and

zero otherwise. As before, the regression includes a vector of national origin fixed effects (nj)

and a vector of metropolitan area fixed effects (ρk). The specification in (6) also interacts the

metropolitan area dummy variables with the dummy variable indicating the Census year (or ρk ×

R). These interaction terms help to control for the fact that conditions in the housing market may

have changed differentially across metropolitan areas over the 1980-90 period. The coefficient α

now measures the extent to which changes in the exposure index within a particular metropolitan

area and national origin group affect homeownership in the immigrant population—after

controlling for changes in the housing market within a metropolitan area that affect all persons

living in that area equally.

        The last column of Table 9 reports the coefficient estimated from the pooled data. The

coefficient is positive and significant, indicating a strong positive correlation between the growth

of ethnic enclaves over the 1980-2000 period and homeownership rates in the immigrant

population. The significance of the coefficient α implies that the geographic clustering of
                                                 31

immigrants has an independent effect on homeownership rates, even within national origin

groups and within metropolitan areas.

        To evaluate the numerical importance of ethnic enclaves, it is instructive to consider a

simple simulation of the estimated regression model. In particular, consider the typical Mexican

household living in Los Angeles, where the exposure index takes on a value of .169 (indicating

that 16.9 percent of the population of the Los Angeles metropolitan area is of Mexican origin).

This household’s probability of homeownership would have fallen by 2.3 percentage points if

this household had chosen to live in Philadelphia, where only .1 percent of the population is of

Mexican origin.19 Ethnic enclaves, therefore, seem to have a numerically important impact on

homeownership rates.

        As noted above, the results summarized in the first row of Table 9 might be biased

because the residential choices of immigrants are likely to be endogenous. The measured impacts

may simply reflect the fact that the same unobserved factors that lead to particular location

choices also lead to particular socioeconomic outcomes. The problem has been difficult to

resolve because there are few valid instruments that can help identify the relevant parameters

[10].

        It is unlikely that immigrants randomly choose which metropolitan areas to reside in

when they enter the United States. Most likely, their location decision will depend both on the

presence of ethnic enclaves, which can transmit a great deal of information about job and

housing opportunities, as well as on the economic and housing opportunities available in

different areas. For example, suppose that immigrants have a strong desire to own their homes,

and, as a result, tend to cluster in areas where it is relatively easy to enter the owner-occupied
                                                         32

housing market. Ethnic enclaves would then form in areas that have relatively high

homeownership rates, creating a spurious positive correlation between any measure of the size of

the ethnic enclave and homeownership rates in the immigrant population.

         The endogeneity issue can be partially addressed by focusing on the sample of

immigrants who entered the country as refugees. Refugees typically have much less choice in

deciding where to live in the United States (at least at the time of their initial entry). The State

Department assigns individual refugees to “sponsoring” private voluntary agencies that provide a

variety of social services, including initial resettlement in the United States [25]. The geographic

location of the refugees’ resettlement is determined by the sponsoring agencies, and depends

partly on the match between a refugee’s socioeconomic background and the availability of jobs

and services in particular localities—as perceived by the sponsoring agency—as well as on the

location of the sponsoring agency itself. It is worth stressing that although the initial placement

of refugees is perhaps more exogenous than that of traditional immigrants, part of the placement

is surely motivated by the agency’s desire to place refugees in areas where they are likely to

thrive. An additional problem is that the U.S. Census does not contain any information on the

type of visa used by a particular person to enter the United States. To approximate the refugee

population, therefore, I classify all immigrants who originate in the main refugee-sending

countries as refugees (all other immigrants are classified as non-refugees).20

         The second row of Table 9 reports the estimate of the coefficient α when equation (6) is

estimated in the subsample of refugees. Ethnic enclaves continue to have a positive impact on


        19 The drop of 2.3 percentage points is obtained by multiplying the regression coefficient reported in
column 3 (.138) times the difference in the exposure index between Los Angeles and Philadelphia (.168).

        20 Thirteen countries account for 90 percent of the refugees awarded permanent residence status during the
1970s and 1980s: Afghanistan, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Ethiopia, Hungary, Laos, Poland,
Romania, Thailand, the former U.S.S.R., and Vietnam.
                                               33

homeownership rates even in the refugee sample. If anything, the numerical impact of the ethnic

enclave on homeownership rates is numerically larger in the refugee sample than in the entire

immigrant population. The evidence, therefore, seems to reject the hypothesis that the strong

positive correlation between ethnic enclaves and homeownership rates can be attributed solely to

endogeneity bias.




V. Summary

       This paper analyzed the determinants of homeownership in immigrant households. The

empirical analysis used data drawn from the 1980 and 1990 Public Use Samples of the U.S.

Census, and from the 1998-2000 Current Population Surveys. The study yields a number of

interesting empirical findings:

        1.   Immigrant households have lower homeownership rates than native households and

             this “homeownership gap” widened significantly in the past twenty years.

        2.   Only a relatively small part of the homeownership gap between immigrants and

             natives can be attributed to differences in such background variables as income and

             household composition between the two populations. A much more important factor

             in generating the sizable homeownership gap is the different location decisions

             made by immigrants and natives.

        3.   There are sizable differences in homeownership rates among the national origin

             groups that make up the immigrant population. The changing national origin mix of

             the immigrant population helps explain much of the widening in the

             homeownership gap observed between 1980 and 2000.

        4.   The interaction between national origin and locational choices is perhaps most

             evident in the creation and growth of ethnic enclaves in major American cities. The

             evidence suggests that ethnic enclaves increase the probability that immigrant

             households own their homes.

       The analysis in this paper suggests that immigration will play an increasingly important

role in determining the demand for owner-occupied housing in the United States. The role played

by immigration, however, does not depend simply on the fact that more immigrants imply more

households, which would then lead to an increase in housing demand. The impact of immigration

on homeownership rates is much more subtle, and it clearly depends on the national origin mix

of the immigrant population and on the locational choices made by immigrants. Moreover, the

evidence presented in this paper suggests that the growth of ethnic enclaves in major American

cities could become an important factor in determining the demand for owner-occupied housing

in many metropolitan areas.

       It is important to note, however, that the link between immigration and homeownership

also depends on how immigrants affect housing prices. For instance, the increasing demand for

owner-occupied housing in ethnic enclaves should lead to a rise in housing prices in the affected

areas. These feedback effects will inevitably influence housing demand for both immigrant and

native households. Surprisingly, the impact of immigration on housing prices has not yet been

explored systematically.

Source: The data on educational attainment refers to completed years of schooling among male workers aged 25-64,
and is drawn from Borjas [4, p. 1686]. The percent gap in household income between the immigrant group and
native households is defined as the difference in household log income between the two groups times 100.

Notes: Standard errors are reported in parentheses. The regression for 1980 has 833,597 observations; the regression
for 1990 has 911,839 observations; and the regression for 2000 has 110,844 observations. The list of socioeconomic
characteristics includes the gender of the household head; the age of the household head (defined as a vector of
dummy variables indicating if the head is 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, or older than 65 years of age); the
educational attainment of the household head (defined as a vector of dummy variables indicating if the head has less
than 9 years of schooling, 9-11 years, 12 years, 13-15 years, or at least 16 years); the log of household income;
dummy variables indicating if the head is married spouse present, or married spouse absent; the number of persons
in the household; the number of children (under age 18) in the household; and the number of years that the
household has resided in the United States (and its square). In the last three rows of the table, the homeownership
gap between immigrants and natives is evaluated at the mean number of years that the household has resided in the
United States in each cross-section. The metropolitan area fixed effects add a dummy variable for each metropolitan
area observed in the data.

Notes: Standard errors in parentheses. Because of the large sample size and the large number of regressors, the
regressions summarized in this table use a 50% random sample of the native extract; the regression has 601,456
observations. The list of “socioeconomic characteristics” includes the gender of the household head; the age of the
household head (defined as a vector of dummy variables indicating if the head is 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64,
or older than 65 years of age); the educational attainment of the household head (defined as a vector of dummy
variables indicating if the head has less than 9 years of schooling, 9-11 years, 12 years, 13-15 years, or at least 16
years); the log of household income; dummy variables indicating if the head is married spouse present, or married
spouse absent; the number of persons in the household; the number of children (under age 18) in the household, and
the number of years that the household has resided in the United States (and its square). The metropolitan area fixed
effects add a dummy variable for each metropolitan area observed in the data.

Notes: Standard errors are reported in parentheses. Because of the large sample size and the large number of
regressors, the regressions summarized in this table use a 33% random sample of the 1980 and 1990 native extracts;
the regression for 1980-90 has 878,725 observations; the regression for 1980-2000 has 509,622 observations. The
list of “socioeconomic characteristics” includes the gender of the household head; the age of the household head
(defined as a vector of dummy variables indicating if the head is 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, or older than 65
years of age); the educational attainment of the household head (defined as a vector of dummy variables indicating if
the head has less than 9 years of schooling, 9-11 years, 12 years, 13-15 years, or at least 16 years); the log of
household income; dummy variables indicating if the head is married spouse present, or married spouse absent; the
number of persons in the household; and the number of children (under age 18) in the household, and the number of
years that the household has resided in the United States (and its square). The metropolitan area fixed effects add a
dummy variable for each metropolitan area observed in the data, and the national origin fixed effects add a dummy
variable for each of the 90 national origin groups in the immigrant population.

Notes: Standard errors are reported in parentheses and are corrected for the clustering of immigrant cohorts within
metropolitan areas. The exposure index is defined as the fraction of the metropolitan area’s population that belongs
to the household’s national origin group. The regression estimated in the 1980 cross-section has 234,432
observations (43,906 observations in the refugee sample); and the regression in the 1990 cross-section has 297,944
observations (50,689 observations in the refugee sample). The list of “socioeconomic characteristics” includes: the
gender of the household head; the age of the household head (defined as a vector of dummy variables indicating if
the head is 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, or older than 65 years of age); the educational attainment of the
household head (defined as a vector of dummy variables indicating if the head has less than 9 years of schooling, 9-
11 years, 12 years, 13-15 years, or at least 16 years); the log of household income; dummy variables indicating if the
head is married spouse present, or married spouse absent; the number of persons in the household; the number of
persons under the age of 18 in the household, and the number of years that the household has resided in the United
States (and its square). All regressions contain a vector of metropolitan area fixed effects, and a vector of national
origin fixed effects. In addition, the pooled regressions include a dummy variable indicating the survey from which
the observation is drawn, and interact this period effect with the metropolitan area fixed effects.
