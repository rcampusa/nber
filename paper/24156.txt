Open enrollment periods are pervasively used in insurance markets to limit adverse selection risks
resulting when enrollees can switch plans at will. We exploit a change in the open enrollment rules
of Medicare Advatage to analyze how beneficiaries responded to the option of switching to a 5-star
rated plan at anytime, in a setting where insurers adjusted premiums and benefit design to counterbalance
the increased selection risk. We present three findings: within-year switches to 5-star plans increase
by 7-16%; demand for 5-star plans across the years does not change; the enrollees who switch to a
5-star plan during the year are in better health status than those who do not switch.

I        Introduction

The growing economic importance of health insurance markets has driven the flourishing
of research into what features of these markets can lead to more desirable social outcomes.
Several of these studies have involved the design of the Medicare system. With expenditures
totalling $646.2 billion in 2015 and growing by 4.5 percent relative to the previous year,
Medicare represents, through its Medicare Advantage and Part D programs, the largest
existing case of a publicly founded, but privately provided health insurance system.
        As is typical in insurance markets, both Medicare Advantage, covering hospital stays and
physician visits, and Part D, covering prescription drugs, have an “open enrollment period”
during which consumers select a plan that will subsequently provide them with coverage
under clearly defined contractual conditions. Among these conditions is the inability for
the enrollee to switch plan at will during the coverage period. Open enrollment periods
(OEPs) play a key role in the stability of health insurance markets as they limit the perverse
dynamics produced by adverse selection: beneficiaries that can remain uninsured (or choose
cheap, low-coverage plans) when they are healthy and then switch to generous plans when
sick pose the risk of sending high-coverage plans into an “adverse selection death spiral” of
increasing costs and increasing premiums, ultimately leading to the collapse of the market.1
        In private insurance markets, insurers can often refuse to sell, but this is typically not
an option for publicly subsidized health insurers programs like Medicare Advantage or the
Affordable Care Act (ACA) exchanges. In these programs, all enrollment requests from
eligible beneficiaries must be accepted. This feature implies that increasing the flexiblity for
enrollees to change plans during the coverage period might come at the cost of worsening
adverse selection. Recent work by Diamond et al. (2018) shows that the ACA exchanges are
currently experiencing this type of problem: attrition is widespread, with more than half
of all new enrollees dropping coverage before the end of the plan year. This paper looks at
the same phenomenon within the context of a 2012 reform of Medicare Advantage under
which the OEP rules were changed to allow enrollees to switch at anytime under the sole
condition that the destination plan is rated 5-star (the highest score in the Medicare plan
quality rating system). This reform, known as the “5-star Special Enrollment Period” (or
5-star SEP), aimed at increasing enrollment in 5-star contracts.2 It involves a large share of

      In Medicare Advantage enrollees choose plans but the star rating system applies to contracts. Contracts
typically include multiple plans. A contract is a particular product type (HMO, PPO or Private FFS)
covering a specific service area (i.e., county or group of counties). Within a contract, different plans typically
have differences in their benefit package (type of coverage, premium, copayment, etc.). In this paper, we use

                                                        2
the Medicare beneficiaries – in 2017 the 5-star SEP was available to 11.5 million individuals
residing in areas with at least one 5-star plan.3
    Various demand and supply forces present in the market are likely to limit the possibil-
ity of this reform triggering an “adverse selection death spiral.” On the demand side, both
consumer inertia in choosing an insurance plan and the inherent complexity of changing a
Medicare Advantage plan – which, as discussed below, implies changing provider network
– are likely to reduce plan-switching behavior. On the supply side, there are at least two
mechanisms at play. First, Medicare Advantage plans receive risk-adjusted payments. Al-
though it may not be possible to perfectly compensate for all cost, risk adjustment serves
to compensate plans receiving an influx of less healthy beneficiaries. Second, insurers can
modify both the premiums and other elements of their plans’ menus.
    In a previous study, we analyzed this latter feature by studying how insurers responded
to the 5-star SEP (Decarolis and Guglielmo, 2017). By exploiting the geographical variation
in the availability of 5-star plans, we identified the causal effect of the 5-star SEP on the
distribution of plan characteristics in the markets affected by the reform. We found strong
empirical evidence in support of the theoretical predictions of models à la Rothschild and
Stiglitz (1976) and Glazer and McGuire (2000) in which plans alter their product in an
attempt to attract good risks: relative to the distribution of competing plans, 5-star plans
lower both their premium and their generosity, especially on those margins most valued by
the enrollees in worst health conditions. That study, however, left open the question of what
the impact on demand has been of the combined effects of free plan switching by enrollees
and changes to plan designs by insurers. Answering this question is the main contribution
of the current study and is key to understanding the potential effectiveness of using open
enrollment rules as a tool to regulate insurance markets with managed competition.
    To identify how demand responded to the SEP reform, we use a similar approach to that
of (Decarolis and Guglielmo, 2017). We exploit the geographical variation in 5-star Medicare
Advantage plans to compare demand in markets with 5-star plans to that in similar markets
where no 5-star plan is offered. Our difference-in-differences strategy is particularly effective
when insurers have limited scope to game the star rating system. Therefore, we focus on
the first two years of the reform (2012 and 2013), when insurers could alter the plan design
but not their star rating due to the lag in the timing of the specific measures that compose

both terms “contract” and “plan,” depending on which of the two is most appropriate.
   3
     As discussed in section 2, the reform was introduced as part of the quality bonus payment demonstration.
The 11.5 million figure is from Q1 Medicare and is based on the fact that in 2017, 5-star rated Medicare
Part D plans were available across all counties in 12 states and 5-Star rated Medicare Advantage plans were
available in 261 counties across 18 states.

                                                     3
the rating. We also restrict the control group to plans with a rating no lower than 4 stars to
account for the different financial incentives created by the bonuses for higher rated plans
introduced by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (see Layton and Ryan (2015)).
   Our main findings are as follows. First, we estimate that the within-year increase in
enrollment due to the 5-star SEP ranges from 7 to 16 percent of the enrollment base of the
5-star plans. This indicates a sizable response by consumers to the new SEP. Second, we
estimate either an insignificant or a positive effect (depending on the model specification) of
the reform on enrollment changes across the years. This is indicative of inertia in plan choice:
enrollees do not take advantage of the possibility to stay outside the Medicare Advantage
program (or to enroll in the cheapest plans) during the open enrollment period and to switch
to 5-star plans only if hit by a health shock. Third, the risk pools of 5-star plans improve,
albeit only by a small amount.
   The latter finding is not indicative of advantageous selection by itself. Before the reform,
5-star plans tended to have particularly high-risk enrollees. Therefore, their average risk
score might have improved because they are bringing in enrollees that, despite being among
the high risk enrollees in their original plan, still represent a lower risk than the average
5-star enrollee. Using detailed claim-level data, however, we estimate that the probability of
switching to a 5-star plan is negatively associated with measures of poor health. In particular,
this is what we obtain for four measures accounting for nearly all the major conditions
characterizing poor health for acute, chronic and mental health pathologies. Therefore, we
conclude that the increased demand for 5-star plans resulting from within-year switches
is not associated with greater adverse selection, but with advantageous selection. This is
consistent with the supply response to the SEP involving changes to the plan characteristics
that made them more appealing to most enrollees (though lower premiums), but less so to
those in worse health (through lower benefit generosity for enrollees in poor health).
   The two, closely connected implications deriving from these three results are that the
5-star SEP was effective in steering enrollees toward 5-star plans, and that insurers offer-
ing 5-star plans were effective in preventing this increase in demand from being driven by
high cost enrollees. These results are therefore informative of the usefulness of designing
special enrollment periods as a tool to guide the functioning of health insurance markets.
Moreover, they indicate that using this tool requires taking into account both supply and
demand responses. Although there is no theoretical literature guiding the design of opti-
mal enrollment periods, as health insurance is increasingly organized in the form of markets
with regulated competition, we expect increasing attention to be paid to a market design
approach to these markets. A recent example of a study taking this perspective is Einav,


                                               4
Finkelstein and Tebaldi (2019), who compare subsidies for consumers and risk adjustment
for insurers and find that the former are a more effective regulatory tool in markets with
adverse selection. With a better understanding of their effects, open enrollment periods rules
might also become a useful tool to steer the market towards socially desirable goals.
       This study is most closely connected to two other existing works on the effects of the 5-star
SEP. The first is our supply-side study, (Decarolis and Guglielmo, 2017), discussed earlier.4
The second, by Madeira (2015), is an early attempt to study behavioral biases among Part
D enrollees exposed to the 5-star SEP in 2012. The 5-star SEP reform involved not just
Medicare Advantage, but also Medicare Part D – the voluntary program for prescription drug
insurance plans. Madeira (2015) studies whether, by removing the typical Part D enrollment
deadline, the 5-star SEP could have induced consumers to switch plans less frequently by
allowing them to procrastinate. His results suggest that switching rates (across the years)
decrease as a result of the policy change in a way that is consistent with a procrastination
bias. Our results complement and substantially extend these findings as they look directly at
the main aspect of the policy (within-year switches, instead of across-years plan changes) and
they do so by using data not only from 2012, but also from 2013.5 More crucially, by focusing
on Medicare Advantage instead of Part D, our analysis benefits from more comprehensive
geographical variation of the policy, which involved nearly 180 Medicare Advantage counties
but only 2 Part D regions.6
       The evidence in this study also complements the very scarce evidence that exists on
the effects of open enrollment periods in other markets. In the ACA exchanges, we have
already mentioned the study by Diamond et al. (2018) documenting how high attrition rates
undermine market stability, leading to insurers’ exit and higher premiums for enrollees who
do not drop out. The only other paper that we are aware of in this area is Ellis and Savage
(2008), which looks at a reform by the Australian government aimed at increasing private
health insurance coverage by introducing selective age-based premium increases for those
enrolling after a deadline. They find the introduction of the deadline to be effective in
inducing consumers to enroll right away rather than delay.

     Related evidence showing insurers’ strategic choice of plan features in environments different from the
one studied here is offered in Cao and McGuire (2003), Batata (2004), McWilliams, Hsu and Newhouse
(2012), Newhouse et al. (2013), Brown et al. (2014), Polyakova (2014), Carey (2016) and Shepard (2016).
   5
     These results also complement the growing literature on demand for insurance. Related works include
Nosal (2012) and Miller et al. (2014) for Medicare Advantage and Abaluck and Gruber (2011), Ketcham
et al. (2012), Marzilli Ericson (2014), Ketcham, Lucarelli and Powers (2014), Abaluck and Gruber (2016),
Ho, Hogan and Morton (2017), Polyakova (2014), Ho, Hogan and Morton (2017) and Heiss et al. (2016) for
Part D. Our analysis is also related to the studies on inertia in employer sponsored health insurance (Handel
and Kolstad, 2015), in auto insurance (Honka, 2014) and in pension plans (Handel and Kolstad, 2015).

     Finally, our micro-level evidence on how different groups of consumers are differentially
affected by the 5-star SEP is a clean example of the distributional consequences of a re-
cent Medicare reform. Due to its size and organization, the question of the distributional
impact of Medicare has received considerable attention in the literature (see, for instance,
Bhattacharya and Lakdawalla (2006), McClellan and Skinner (2006) and Duggan, Starc and
Vabson (2016)). In these studies, quantifying the insurance value of Medicare plays a key
role in assessing its distributional impacts. In this respect, our findings reveal how even
a “small” reform affecting directly just 5-star plans is able to trigger multiple changes in
Medicare Advantage, by inducing both supply and demand responses.



II     Institutions: Medicare Open Enrollment Periods

The Medicare system consists of a series of interlinked programs aimed chiefly at those aged
65 or older in the US. Traditional Medicare (TM) is composed of Medicare Part A, covering
inpatient hospital, skilled nursing, and some home health services, and Medicare Part B,
covering physicians’ services, outpatient care, and durable medical equipment. This study
focuses on the privately provided programs that coexist with TM: Medicare Advantage and
Part D. In both programs, private insurers offer a menu of plans to Medicare beneficiaries:
Medicare Advantage plans are an alternative to TM and so must cover all Medicare Part A
and B benefits (except hospice care), but can also offer additional benefits. Part D plans
complement TM by covering prescription drugs. The two programs are closely connected in
many ways, the most evident being that almost all Medicare Advantage plans also include
Part D benefits. These latter plans will be denoted below as MAPD. As an alternative to
MAPD, enrollees opting for TM, but who want to access the (voluntary) Part D program
can purchase stand-alone Prescription Drug Plans (PDP).
     Both MAPD and PDP offer one-year, renewable coverage coinciding with the calendar
year. The open enrollment period (OEP) is the window of time during which people can
enroll in these plans. It typically spans from October to December of the year before the
coverage period. Although enrollees are generally required to stay on the same plan for
the entire year of coverage, exceptions to the OEP exist. Special Enrollment Periods (SEPs)
permit enrollees to change plans when certain circumstances occur. The most common SEPs
involve individuals turning 65 during the coverage year, changing residency or entering “low-
income enrollee” status. Starting in 2012, an additional SEP was introduced: people eligible
for Medicare residing in an area where one or more 5-star Medicare Advantage or Part D
plan is offered can switch from their plan (or from TM) to a 5-star plan during the coverage

                                               6
year, with the new coverage starting on the first day of the month following the enrollment
request.7 We will refer to this reform as the 5-star SEP. The 5-star plans cannot deny
enrollment. Beneficiaries can use this SEP only once per year and can also use it to switch
from one 5-star plan to a different 5-star plan. To promote this policy, CMS has extensively
advertised this new SEP rule in its communications to potential enrollees.8

       In contrast to all other Medicare SEPs, the possibility of a within-year plan switch is
entirely dependent on a 5-star plan being offered in the enrollee’s area of residency. This
“area” differs between Medicare Advantage and Part D plans: for MAPD it corresponds
to a county, while for PDP it corresponds to one of the 34 macro-regions partitioning the
US. In 2012 and 2013, nearly 180 counties belonging to 17 different states had at least one
5-star MAPD, while only 2 regions had a 5-star PDP (New York and a macro region formed
by 7 midwest states). Given the importance of cross-market variation for identifying the
effects of the 5-star SEP, the remaining part of this study will focus exclusively on Medicare
Advantage, leaving the analysis for Part D to the web appendix. Figure 1 illustrates the
spatial pattern of 5-star MAPD offerings. While not present in the South, 5-star MAPD
are present in all other regions. The heat map also reveals the location of counties whose
highest rated MAPD were either 4 or 4.5 stars.
       In the post-reform period, 7 insurers offer 5-star plans. The main ones are Kaiser, Hu-
   7
      Although not directly included among the provisions in the PPACA, the 5-star SEP is linked to it as
CMS created it through its statutory authority - Section 1851(e)(4)(D) of the Social Security Act - as part
of its efforts to bolster plan quality (see Layton and Ryan (2015) and Li and Doshi (2016)).

mana and Group Health.9 The case of Kaiser offers another reason why it is important to
keep analysis of the 5-star SEP for Medicare Advantage and Part D distinct: switching plans
in response to a health shock is inherently different and less complicated for a PDP than
for a MAPD plan. In the case of switching from a different provider to Kaiser, an enrollee
would need to change the whole network of primary, secondary, and hospital care. It might
also imply changing how the enrollee relates to healthcare provisions, as Kaiser extensively
uses care pathways and electronic medical records. While the case of Kaiser is extreme, it
is clear that for some enrollees changing care providers might be undesirable, even though
they might benefit from some of the high-quality features provided by 5-star plans.



III       Empirical Strategy
Our strategy for identifying the effect of the 5-star SEP on plan enrollment is based on a
difference-in-differences (DID) approach. For MAPD plans, this strategy exploits the fact,
documented in Figure 1, that 5-star contracts are offered in only a subset of US counties.
We consider all contracts that achieved a 5-star rating in the period 2012-2013 as the DID
treatment group (dark red areas in in Figure 1) and all contracts that achieved a rating of
4 or 4.5 stars in the same period and are offered in counties without any 5-star contracts as
the control group (light red areas in in Figure 1).
      Specifically, the regression model that we estimate is:

                                   Yict = βDit5S + αc + γt + δi + εict ,                        (1)


where i indicates the contract, c the county and t the year. The outcome variable is one of the
three variables described in the previous section ((i) the within-year change in enrollment, (ii)
the across-year change in enrollment, and (iii) the plan average risk score). The coefficient
of interest is β, the effect on the dependent variable of a dummy equal to one for 5-star
contracts after 2011, conditional on fixed effects for the county (αc ), time (γt ) and contract
(δi ). Various extensions are presented below.
      In an ideal scenario, this identification strategy allows the causal effects of the 5-star SEP
to be estimated through the random assignment of counties between treatment and control
groups. Clearly, however, the observational data that we use fall short of this ideal scenario,
and so there are challenges to interpret β as the causal effect of the policy change. As usual
in any DID study, the first and foremost concern is to select an adequate control group. In
  9
      In contrast, only 2 insurers (one being Humana) offer 5-star PDP in the same period.

                                                     8
our setting, 4- and 4.5-star contracts offered in counties that do not have any 5-star plans
are a natural control group. First of all, since the regulation separates the geographical
markets, a benefit of the proposed DID strategy is that, by selecting the treatment and
control groups from different counties, it avoids contamination issues. Furthermore, in the
period analyzed, the CMS payment demonstration made the contracts in the control group
face similar financial incentives to those in the treatment group, as all payments linked to
the star rating were similar for these two groups of plans (Decarolis and Guglielmo, 2017).
       Although Figure 1 reveals that the 5-star plans are scattered across many different coun-
ties, this clearly does not ensure their assignment to counties is random. At least two
problems related to selection can emerge: ratings could be subject to manipulations, imply-
ing self selection by the insurers; or, even absent manipulations, counties in the treatment
and control groups might differ.
       Regarding the first problem, we note that it is hard for insurers to perfectly control their
rating. This is due to the institutional features of the Medicare rating system. In particular,
the star rating is derived from a combination of several (about 50) individual measures.10
The use of such a large number of measures, together with the fact that both the exact set
of measures and the scoring formula change from year to year, implies that insurers do not
have full control over their rating. Furthermore, details about the timing of the measures
are crucial for understanding why the 5-star SEP should not trigger rating manipulations
for 2012 and 2013. Several of these measures enter with a two-year lag. Since insurers must
define their plan offerings in June of the year before the enrollment and since the 5-Star SEP
was announced in November 2010, any action aimed at altering the star rating would not
take effect before the 2014 enrollment year. This fact is also consistent with the fact that the
2012 and 2013 offering of 5-star plans remained nearly unaltered relative to 2011 in terms of
counties served and insurers involved.
       Graphical evidence in support of the claim of no rating manipulation is offered in Figure 2.
Underlying the discrete scores (appearing in 0.5 increments) that CMS discloses to enrollees
and that determine the applicability of the 5-star SEP, there is a continuous measure which
summarizes multiple indicators.11 5-star plans are those whose overall score is at least 4.75,
while 4.5-star plans have an overall rating below 4.75, but above 4.25. If we look at this
continuous measure in Figure 2, two elements are suggestive of the adequacy of the proposed
  10
     In Table A.1, we report the 2 areas (managed care and prescription drugs) and the associated 9 domain
measures grouping the 47 individual measures used to determine the 2012 scores. These measures are from
different sources – from survey to call center and administrative data – and at different timings.
  11
     Since CMS does not disclose the continuous measure, this remark is based on the continuous summary
score measure that we constructed by combining the individual measures and the period-specific aggregation
rules. We successfully match the CMS discrete score for 95 percent of the 1,284 contracts in 2011 and 2013.

                                                    9
identification strategy. First, there is no clear jump in the plan density at the relevant cutoff
points, either before or after the reform.12 Second, most 5-star plans fall short of having
an overall continuous score of 5, reaching a score not much higher than 4.75. This is thus
reassuring regarding their comparability to lower-rated plans.

          Regarding the second selection problem, counties in the proposed treatment and control
groups might differ irrespective of the lack of rating manipulations. Our strategy for ad-
dressing this issue involves controlling for observable differences. Furthermore, to the extent
that we can control for both fixed and time-varying unobservables, we gradually expand
the model specification to incorporate both contract fixed effects and linear time trends,
   12
    This is further supported by McCrary tests reported in Figure A.1 in the appendix. Moreover, while
the distribution in Figure 2 is not smooth and appears to have three modes, this is due to the scoring
formula and, specifically, to the fact that, for some measures, plans earn points only if they are above certain
thresholds.

                                                                                         10
separately for treatment and control counties.13 As discussed in the next section, when pre-
senting the summary statistics in Table 1, treatment and control groups do indeed differ
along several observable characteristics, such as size of the enrollment base and features of
the enrollment pool. Hence, to the extent that the selection into the treatment state is based
on these observable characteristics, we can address this threat to identification. Therefore,
as a robustness check, we also present a matching DID strategy. In this case, the control
group observations will be selected to match the characteristics of the treatment group.



IV         Data

The analysis combines several data sources. In the first part of the analysis, we focus on
plan- and contract-level data, while in the second we exploit claims-level data.
       The data for the first part of the analysis are publicly available data from CMS. In
particular, we obtained monthly enrollment data for the years 2009-2013 at the plan level,
as well as plan characteristics and risk scores (both at the yearly level). Also from the CMS
files we obtained the scores that each contract received on each individual measure, which we
used to compute the continuous score. Table 1 shows summary statistics for these data. The
three main outcome variables that we analyze are: (i) the within-year change in enrollment,
(ii) the across-year change in enrollment, and (iii) the plan average risk score. The first
variable is calculated as the difference in the contract enrollment in the last and first month
of the year (i.e., Enrollment12/t − Enrollment1/t , with j/t indicating the j-th month of the
year). It captures changes in plan enrollment within-year, and thus it measures the most
direct effect that the policy produces in terms of increased within-year plan switches.
       The second outcome variable considers the possibility of plan switching across years.
We calculate it as the difference in the contract enrollment in two consecutive years. More
precisely, it is calculated as Enrollment1/t − Enrollment12/t−1 . This variable can capture
a strategic response by consumers, namely, greater plan switching during the regular open
enrollment period driven by the possibility of switching to a 5-star plan later. The third
outcome variable is a proxy for the plan’s risk pool. More precisely, we use the mean
contract risk score, available from CMS at the yearly level and separately for the managed
care (Part C) and prescription drug (Part D) components of the MAPD plans. The risk score
is the key statistic mapping how enrollment composition impacts expected plan costs. In the
  13
    Our unit of observation is a contract-year-county. In most of the control counties, we observe multiple
contracts with 4-4.5 stars. To a lesser extent, we observe multiple contracts also in the treated counties (i.e.,
we observe 7 counties for which there were more than one 5-star plan in either 2012 or 2013).

                                                       11
final part of our analysis, we will look at the demographic characteristics of the switchers to
better understand what drives the findings on plan-level risk scores. The summary statistics
are immediately suggestive of interesting patterns in the data. In particular, we see that the
within-year change in enrollment into treatment plans increases after the 5-star SEP. This
is not the case for the control group.
       In addition to the three outcome variables described above, the dataset allows us to
observe a rich set of plan characteristics, as described in Table 1.14 This allows us to observe
changes in the plan offerings following the 5-star SEP. Table 1 reveals that premiums tend
to decline after the reform more for the treatment than for the control group. Moreover,
those features valued by the least healthy enrollees worsen (as illustrated for, instance, by
the increase in the maximum out of pocket). For both premiums and generosity, the evidence
in (Decarolis and Guglielmo, 2017) indicates that these changes do indeed reflect a strategic
response by insurers to the 5-star SEP. This implies that our analysis below is best interpreted
as an assessment of how enrollment responded jointly to the 5-star SEP and plan design
changes.
       The analysis involving claims-level data, instead, uses the NBER - Medicare Part D
Research Identifiable Files. These data are a 20 percent random sample of all beneficiaries.
For each beneficiary, we observe information on age, sex, place of residence, health conditions,
and plan enrollment. To study within-year switching to 5-star MAPD behavior, we focus on
those enrollees residing in counties where 5-star MAPD were offered in 2012 or 2013. The
resulting sample has 2.4 million enrollees for 2012 and 2.5 million enrollees for 2013. In each
year, about 0.25 percent of these enrollees switch to a 5-star MAPD during the year under

     In particular, the description of each variable appearing in the table is as follows: “Tot. Enrollment”
is the contract enrollment measures as January. “Change Enrollment Dec.-Jan” is the change in enrollment
from January to December. “% Change Enrollment Dec.-Jan” is the percentage change in enrollment from
January to December. “Premium Part C” is the annual premium for Part C. “Premium Part D” is the
annual premium for Part D. “In Network MOOP” is the maximum out-of-pocket expenditure for in-network
service, excluding Part D drugs (we observe it starting from 2011). “Deductible Part D” is the maximum
annual amount of initial out-of-pocket expenses for Part D drugs. “N. Top Drugs” is the number of top
drugs included in the plan formulary. “N. Unrestricted Drug” is the number of drugs without restriction on
utilization included in the plan formulary. “Risk Score Part C” is the average risk score measure for Part C
coverage. “Risk Score Part D” is the average risk score measure for Part D. “Part C OOPC Excellent (Poor)”
is the average yearly out-of-pocket for individuals with excellent (poor) heath status for Part C coverage.
“Drug OOPC Excellent (Poor)” is the average yearly out-of-pocket for individuals with excellent (poor) heath
status for Part D coverage. “Health Care Quality” is a star rating (1-5) for member’s evaluation of health
care quality (CAHPS). “Customer Service” is a star rating (1-5) for the ability of the health plan to provide
information or help when members need it (CAHPS). “Drug Access” is a star rating (1-5) for the ease of
getting prescriptions filled when using the plan (CAHPS Survey). “Tot. Enrollment”, “Change Enrollment
Dec.-Jan”, “% Change Enrollment Dec.-Jan’, “Health Care Quality”, “Customer Service” and “Drug Access”
are measured at the contract level, all other variables are measured at the plan level and aggregated at the
contract level as (enrollment) weighted averages.

contract-level outcomes, while the fourth presents evidence from the claims-level data.




A. Within-Year Enrollment for MAPD
The evolution of the average within-year enrollment change is described in Figure 3 for both
treatment and control plans. In line with the statistics in Table 1, it shows both a relatively
large increase for the treatment group after the 5-star SEP (represented by the straight,
vertical line) and a lack of any increase for the control group.

       Even before 2012, there is a trend for growth in the treated group, compared to a de-
clining path for the control group. Although for both groups these year-to-year changes
are not statistically significant, thus limiting potential bias in the estimate of β, we will also
report estimates including group-specific linear time trends in the DID model specification.16
Nevertheless, since the statistical evidence in favor of a differential trend is rather weak and
since it is conceivable that trends might obfuscate the effects of the 5-star SEP if consumers
learn over time to exploit the new enrollment flexibility, we will also report estimates from
a more parsimonious model without time trends and describe both sets of estimates. As
discussed below, the main findings for the contract-level analysis will remain qualitatively
the same.
       Table 2 displays our DID estimates for the within-year enrollment in MAPD. The depen-
dent variable is thus the within-year enrollment change both in levels (Columns 1-4) and in
percentage terms relative to January enrollment (Columns 5-8). We estimate four models.
Odd numbered columns include county and year fixed effects, and even numbered columns
add contract fixed effects. Columns 3, 4, 7 and 8 add a linear trend at state/treatment
level. Panel A reports the estimates for the baseline sample: the treatment group has 5-star
contracts in 2012 or 2013, while the control group contains 4 or 4.5 star contracts in 2012 or
2013 in counties without any 5-star contracts. The next panel reports the robustness check
involving a matched-DID estimator.
       The estimates in Panel A show that the 5-star SEP has a large and statistically significant
effect on the within-year change in enrollment. The effect reported in columns 1 and 2 implies
that the number of enrollees increases on average by 225-235 enrollees. This effect is quite
substantial, if, for instance, we compare it to an average value of the dependent variable
in the pre-treatment period of 386 enrollees. When including time trends, the effect is still
present, but its magnitude is attenuated. Columns 5-8 report analogous estimates for the
percentage enrollment change. This variable allows the enrollment changes to be normalized
by the existing enrollment base. The estimates that we obtain range from 7% to 9% in the
more parsimonious specifications and from 15% to 16% when including time trends.
       To assess the sensitivity of our estimates to the choice of control group, in Panel B, we use
a matched-DID estimator by constructing a sample of comparable contracts through propen-
sity score matching. In particular, we use an extensive list of socio-economic, demographic
and health indicators to predict the probability that a county has a 5-star contract in the
2012-13 period. Then, we restrict the control group to those contracts in counties belong-
  16
    The presence of an upward trend for the treatment group, can be explained by several factors. CMS has
been strongly advertising star ratings as a measure of quality, possibly impacting the evolution of enrollment
over time. There is no evidence of trends for the other outcome variables used below.

ing to the common support of the propensity score between the treatment and the control
groups.17 The estimates obtained are similar in terms of both magnitude and significance to
those in Panel A. Not all coefficients of the matched-DID, however, lie within the 95 percent
confidence interval of those in Panel A. In particular, the matched-DID indicates a larger
percentage increase, amounting roughly to a 20% effect, when including trends. While these
estimates are likely the preferable ones as they fully exploit the richness of the data, we take
the Panel A estimate of a 15% effect as a more conservative estimate.

Notes: The table reports the DID estimates of the effect of the 5-star SEP. The outcome variable is the
difference in the contract enrollment between December and January (of the same year) calculated either in
levels (first four columns) or as a percentage (latter four columns). The four model specifications considered
for each dependent variable differ in the set of controls used, as reported in the block at the very end of the
table. Panel A reports the estimates for the baseline sample: treatment group contracts with 5-star in 2012
or 2013; control group contracts with more 4 or 4.5 star in 2012 or 2013 in counties without 5-star contracts.
Panel B reports the estimates for a sample matched using a propensity score. The probability that a county
has a 5-star contract is estimated over a range of socio-economic, demographic and health indicators of
the counties. Only the county on common support of the propensity score between the treatment and the
control groups are included. Standard errors in parentheses clustered at county level *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05,
* p<0.1.


       Finally, it is informative to know in which month of the year enrollees use the SEP. Thus,
we consider complementing the above estimates of the December minus January enrollment
change with analogous estimates for the other months preceding December. In Figure 4,
we plot the estimates obtained for the same specification as in model (2) of Table 2. The
  17
   We tried various specification for the propensity score and results were broadly comparable to those in
Panel B. Further details as well as the probit estimates are shown in Table A.1 and A.2 in the web appendix.

Panel A in Table 2. All other estimates are obtained using the same specification.


effect on enrollment of the SEP appears to increase linearly over time up until October and
then it flattens out. Thus enrollees seem to use the new SEP uniformly over most of the year.


B. Across-Years Enrollment for MAPD
Next we explore the behavior of consumers across years. In Table 3, we therefore repeat the
previous analysis using as a dependent variable the change in enrollment across years.
    The effect of the 5-star SEP is, however, ex ante ambiguous in this case. A decrease in
demand for 5-star plans is compatible with consumers acting strategically: that is, enrolling
in cheap, low-coverage non 5-star plans, but with the intention of switching to a more
expensive 5-star plan if hit by a health shock during the year. The previous estimates in
Table 2 indicate that within-year switches do occur. But, this is not enough to also imply
that consumers will act strategically in their choice of switching plan across years. In fact,
increases in enrollment in 5-star plans across years might be driven, for instance, by their
enhanced promotion by CMS. The findings in Decarolis and Guglielmo (2017) also suggest
that their lower post-reform premiums could have bolstered demand for such plans.
    Furthermore, inertia in plan choice might imply a lack of changes in across-year enroll-
ment. Empirical evidence by Handel (2013) and related work has revealed how relevant
inertia is for health insurance plan choices. But it is noteworthy that, in our setting, inertia

Notes: The table reports the DID estimates of the effect of the 5-star SEP. The outcome variable is the
difference in the contract enrollment between January and December (of consecutive years) calculated either
in levels (first four columns) or in percentage (latter four columns). Panel A reports the estimates for the
baseline sample: treatment group contracts with 5-star in 2012 or 2013; control group contracts with more 4
or 4.5 star in 2012 or 2013 in counties without 5-star contracts. Panel B reports the estimates for a sample
matched using a propensity score. The probability that a county has a 5-star contract is estimated over a
range of socio-economical, demographic and health indicators of the counties. Only the county on common

might interact in complex ways with the 5-star reform. In the presence of present-biased ben-
eficiaries, it might drive a drop in 5-star plan enrollment across years due to procrastination
(as argued in Madeira (2015)). Furthermore, while inertia is sometimes observable through
the comparison of the choices of new and continuing enrollees,18 this is not necessarily the
case for the 5-star SEP. In fact, inertia could lead even new enrollees to voluntarily ignore the
possibility of “gaming” the system: selecting a plan during the open enrollment period with
the idea of switching to a 5-star plan during the coverage period might be undesirable for
those consumers who are aware that their inertial behavior is driven by features like search
costs, switching costs, or psychological costs. As discussed earlier, these costs might be se-
vere since switching MAPD typically implies multiple changes (insurer, hospitals, doctors,
and - possibly - more). Below we do not attempt to distinguish between the distinct sources
and consequences of inertia or between new and continuing enrollees, but merely to analyze

       Handel (2013) proposes a test for inertia based on the comparison of new and continuing enrollees.

whether in aggregate the total enrollment in 5-star plans changes across years in response
to the 5-star SEP.
   The estimates in Table 3 reveal that demand for 5-star plans did not decline across
years: there is no specification that results in a negative and significant effect. Statistical
significance is achieved only for the estimates involving percentage increase and, within these
cases, only for the specifications including time trends (models 7 and 8). This finding emerges
for both the baseline estimates (Panel A) and the matched-DID (Panel B). Since we tend to
prefer the more complete specifications of models 7 and 8, we might conclude that there is
evidence in favor of an increase in enrollment across years. However, contrary to the within-
year demand estimates that systematically lead to very consistent estimates in terms of sign
and significance, the lack of stability in the across-years demand estimates suggest caution
should be taken in interpreting the finding as conclusive in terms of any positive effect on
across-years demand.
   In any case, all estimates indicate that any strategic consideration for consumers to leave
5-star plans was muted by the forces inducing a stronger demand. This finding suggests
that the reform was successful in shifting enrollees to 5-star plans in a stable way. Although
a positive coefficient can mechanically result from the combination of increased within-year
switches in 2012 and the presence of plan switching cost, our estimates remain qualitatively
identical if we rule out this channel by excluding 2013 data.
C. Part C and D Risk Scores for MAPD
The final set of results concern the effects of the 5-star SEP on the contracts’ risk pools.
The earlier results offer conflicting predictions on what effect we should expect. On the
one hand, increased within-year enrollment might be a sign of worsening selection for 5-star
plans. On the other hand, increased across-year enrollment could imply improved selection
for 5-star plans, especially to the extent that it is driven by demand from relatively healthy
enrollees attracted by lower premiums. This same force could also be the trigger for within-
year plan switches driven by healthy enrollees looking for high-quality plans, irrespective of
their reduced financial generosity.
   The two dependent variables on which we focus are the yearly average MAPD risk scores
that CMS releases separately for the two components of MAPD plans, Part C and D. Each
one of these two measures is normalized to 1 for the average risk of a TM enrollee; the higher
the risk score the higher the risk (and the expected cost) of the enrollee. The estimates are
reported in Table 4.
   Panel A in Table 4 presents the baseline estimates, separately for Part C (first 4 columns)
and Part D (latter 4 columns). Both the model specifications and the construction of the

Notes: The table reports the DID estimates of the effect of the 5-star SEP. The outcome variable is the
risk score for Part C (first four columns) and Part D (latter four columns). The four model specifications
considered for each dependent variable differ in the set of controls used, as reported in the block at the very
end of the table. Panel A reports the estimates for the baseline sample: treatment group contracts with
5-star in 2012 or 2013; control group contracts with more 4 or 4.5 star in 2012 or 2013 in counties without
5-star contracts. Panel B reports estimates from a sample without observation from 2013. Panel C reports
estimates from a sample without observation from 2012. Standard errors in parentheses clustered at county
level *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.



control group is identical to those described for Table 2 and 3. All the estimates in this panel
show a negative and significant effect on both risk scores. The magnitude of the estimated
coefficients is small, but not negligible. Relative to the summary statistics reported earlier,
the estimates for the effect on Part C of the 5-star SEP roughly correspond to one fifth of a
standard deviation of the dependent variable. The analogous figure for the Part D risk score
is one fourth of a standard deviation.
    The next two panels in Table 4 aim to assess whether the observed improvements in risk
scores might be driven by the timing with which risk scores are measured. The measure that
we use is a yearly average, and a potential worry is whether this variable is unable to capture

                                                       20
in a timely manner the high risk of those joining 5-star plans. However, the annual average
risk score for a plan is built up by taking all of the individual-level risk scores and averaging
them. Hence, when new enrollees join during year t, the risk scores of those enrollees will be
factored into the year t average risk score.19
       Nevertheless, there is a lag in updating the individual-level risk scores. In 2013, an
individual’s risk score is based on his health status (diagnoses) from 2012. Thus, if an
enrollee who used to be healthy switches to a 5-star plan immediately after becoming sick,
our measure might only be able to capture his higher risk a year after the switch. This
feature means the current risk score system is inadequate for dealing with selection driven
by within-year plan changes, and this problem is especially severe in Part C where no ex
post adjustment measures (like the Part D risk corridors and reinsurance) exist.
       Moreover, a more subtle problem could, in principle, involve new Medicare enrollees.
First-time enrollees in Medicare have no diagnoses, so their risk scores are based on age/gender
only and are not particularly indicative of health status. First-time enrollees in After they
have been in Medicare for a full calendar year, their risk scores switch to being based on
diagnoses instead. However, since new Medicare enrollees aren’t actually affected by the
reform as they could join any plan during any month of the year (as long as it is the first
month they enroll), this should not be a concern for our analysis.
       To account for these issues, we exploit the fact that we have two years of data since the
inception of the policy and repeat the DID estimates iteratively dropping from the sample
one of the two post-policy years. Our expectation is that, if the negative estimate in the risk
score regressions is driven by a lag in how the score is recorded, we will likely find that using
2013 exclusively as the post-policy year should lead us to find less negative, if not positive,
estimates relative to when we use only 2012 as the post-policy year. The new estimates are
reported in the latter two panels of Table 4. In Panel B we drop 2013, while in Panel C we
drop 2012. The findings are rather surprising. Both sets of estimates confirm the negative
sign of the coefficient. Moreover, although the magnitudes are similar, there is a tendency
for the Panel C estimates to be larger than those in Panel B. Hence, these results confirm
that the risk pool of 5-star plans effectively improved.
D. Additional Evidence from Claims Data
This last section analyzes the key question associated with the earlier findings of declining
risk scores: is the lowered risk score in 5-star MAPD due to switchers who are healthier
relative to the whole Medicare population or only relative to the risk pool of 5-star plans?

  19
    We also know from Geruso and Layton (2015) that insurers are proactive in adjusting upward the risk
score of their enrollees.

                                                  21
       Figure 5 shows the average risk score separately for MAPD that lose enrollees and those
that gain enrollees during the year.20 The figure shows that there is a change between 2011
and the two previous years, which is likely the result of a revised approach to calculating risk
scores starting in 2011. Regarding the effects of the 5-star SEP, instead, we see that both
before and after the reform, switching tends to be from low-risk plans to high-risk ones.21
Since 5-star plans were characterized by high risk enrollees prior to 2012, the patterns in
Figure 5 are ambiguous as to whether the 5-star SEP produced adverse selection for the
5-star plans. They might have attracted the highest-risk enrollees from the non-5-star plans
(adverse selection) who happen to be, however, lower risk than the average risk in 5-star
plans. But they might also have attracted enrollees that are no more of a risk (no selection)
or even healthier (advantageous selection) than those in non-5-star plans.

       To resolve this ambiguity, we resort to the CMS Part D claims-level data described in
section 4. We estimate the probability of this type of switch through the following logit
model:
                                                       X                                  X
                   P r(Switchit ) = Φ[α +                    βz HealthStatusitz +               γj Xitz + τt ],
                                                       z∈Z                                j∈J


where i indexes the enrollee and t the year. Φ is the CDF of the logistic distribution.
HealthStatus contains Z measures of the health conditions of enrollee i in year t. X contains
  20
     The average is calculated by weighting contracts by their share of switchers in-flow or out-flow. The
fact that both for out flow and in flow the average risk score is below 1 is explained by the fact that our
analysis excludes the southern US regions, as illustrated in Figure 1, where risk scores tend to be higher.
As discussed earlier, within-year switches occurring before 2012 are due to the presence of other SEP (see
section 2).
  21
     Switching in the pre 5-Star SEP period is driven by the presence of the other SEP listed in section 2.

                                                                 22
various additional controls that we will group in three main categories: Demographics (sex,
age and race), F inancials (current and last year OOPC) and P rograms (indicator variables
for whether in January of year t enrollee i is in MAPD, PDP or in TM without any Part
D plan). We are particularly interested in the estimates of the βz coefficients as they can
provide direct evidence regarding the risk of switchers relative to non-switchers.
       Although we cannot replicate exactly the CMS risk score measures used in the earlier
section, the four variables that we use for HealthStatus capture most of the health conditions
behind the determination of the risk scores. In particular, we consider four variables (Acute
High, Chronic Low, Chronic High and Mental ) which are constructed as follows. Each vari-
able is a dummy variable for the existence of a flag for any of the relevant medical conditions
in the chronic conditions component of the master beneficiary summary file. Together they
act as a rough proxy of CMS’ risk adjustment. Acute High accounts for any severe acute
conditions such as heart attacks, strokes, or fractured hips. Chronic Low records the pres-
ence of chronic conditions that are not debilitating (asthma, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, etc).
Chronic High indicates the existence of debilitating chronic conditions (osteoporosis, cancer,
etc). Finally, Mental indicates Alzheimer and depression conditions. Since a flag is recorded
even if there is only one event in the year triggering one of the diagnoses we consider, this
implies that our measures are likely to capture any change in health status that could be
also associated with switches to high-coverage, 5-star plans. The means (and standard de-
viations) for these dummy variables are around 0.8 (0.4) for Chronic Low and 0.7 (0.5) for
the other three.
       In Figure 6, we show the marginal effects for the logit regressions reported in Table 5.
For each of the four health conditions, the figure shows the marginal effect estimated for four
different samples. The bars in dark blue refer to the first sample, which is the baseline full
sample of 2012 and 2013 switchers. All the four measures of adverse health conditions are
clearly associated with a decline in the probability of switching. Moreover, the magnitude
of the effect associated with Chronic High is about twice that of Chronic Low. The lower
propensity to switch during the year to a 5-star plan among enrollees in worse health is also
confirmed across the three subsamples represented with different colors in Figure 6.22 This
evidence is most obviously compatible with the greater difficulties that enrollees suffering
from severe chronic disease would face were they to change provider network. As argued
in Decarolis and Guglielmo (2017), insurers can enhance these difficulties by reducing the

  22
    These are: regular enrollees (light green), LIS receivers (light blue) and the 2012 switchers only (grey).
For the latter subsample, the model is estimated by replacing the concurrent HealthStatus measures with
their values in 2013. The idea of this specification is to check whether the enrollees switching in 2012 are
more likely to be those in worse health status the following year.

financial generosity of their plans. But even more crucial for chronically ill patients might be
the provider network. In this respect, the evidence in Shepard (2016), albeit in a different
health insurance context, clearly shows the impacts on these enrollees of insurers’ choice to
leave out of their network “star” hospitals preferred by these enrollees.
         Table 5 reports the logit estimates for different model specifications and sample restric-
tions. Model (1) includes only the HealthStatus measures, while the following three models
gradually expand the specification to include Demographics (model (2)), F inancials (model
(3)) and P rograms (model (4)). All models also include a constant and a dummy for 2013,
both not reported in the table. Models (5) and (6) estimate the same specification of model
(4) for two different subsamples: one excluding LIS enrollees (model (5)) and one including
only LIS enrollees (model (6)). Finally, model (7) uses exclusively 2012 switching data, but
replaces the concurrent HealthStatus measures with their values in 2013. Models (4)-(7) are
those producing the marginal effects shown in Figure 6.
         In addition to what has already been discussed concerning Figure 6, the estimates in
Table 5 show a few interesting results. In particular, we find negative coefficients on both
black race indicator and the two OOPC measures. The estimates are also indicative that
switchers are more likely to originate from within the MAPD program rather than from the

                                                              24

F emale, instead, runs contrary to what would be expected under advantageous selection.
Their magnitudes, however, are smaller if compared, for instance, to the effect of the Black
indicator variable and, in the case of F emale, the effect is not significant in model (6). The
relevance of the subsampling results in models (5) and (6) derives from the fact that LIS
enrollees have special rights to switch plan within the year. Although the data do not allow

us to separately identify the motive of the LIS request of plan switch, observing that the
estimates are nearly identical for the two subsamples reassures us that our results are not
driven by the mere presence of switches by LIS enrollees.



VI         Conclusions

The 5-star SEP reform that, beginning in 2012, allowed Medicare enrollees to switch at any
point in time to a 5-star rated plans is a rare example of a change in open enrollment rules.
It therefore represents a valuable natural experiment to learn about the effects that these
kinds of policies can produce and, hence, to what extent they can be used as a tool to guide
health insurance markets toward socially desirable outcomes. In the context of Medicare,
where as of 2017 more than 11 million beneficiaries were exposed to the effects of the 5-star
SEP, this reform appears to have accomplished its intended effects of promoting enrollment
into high-quality, 5-star plans without generating an adverse selection death spiral.
       The analysis is based on a clean identification strategy exploiting the geographical distri-
bution of plans with different star ratings in the years 2009-2013. Its focus on demand-side
questions complements the supply-side analysis of the 5-star SEP presented in Decarolis and
Guglielmo (2017). That paper showed a strategic response by the insurers who lowered both
the premiums and the benefit generosity of the 5-star plans, while our study illustrates how
enrollees responded to the combined changes in plan characteristics and the possibility to
switch within-year. We find that switching within-year does increase, but that this is not
associated with a worsening of selection. Indeed, enrollees in poor health are less likely to
switch and this explains the reduction in risk scores observed for the 5-star plans.
       These results suggest the relevance of two main avenues for future research. First, en-
rollees’ inertia in choosing a plan emphasises the need to better understand the drivers of
plan switching behavior and their interactions with the frequency and length of the open
enrollment periods. Second, effective risk adjustment systems need to take into account plan
switching behavior associated with the presence of special enrollment periods. This is a
factor that should be preeminent in any discussion of SEP reforms involving changes to the
set of “life qualifying events” that allow plan switches.23
       Finally, the external validity of our results will be greater for those markets that, like
  23
     This is also related to Ericson, Geissler and Lubin (2017) which acknowledges that partial-year enrollment
is common and analyzes the problems that this poses to risk adjustment due to missing diagnoses. It then
proposes a new adjustment for partial-year enrollment scaling up payments for partial-year enrollees’ observed
diagnoses.

Medicare, entail both consumers’ inertia and insurers’ ability to alter the product design.
For instance, it would be interesting to consider how our results could contribute to the
understanding of recent reforms of the ACA special enrollment periods. In fact, as discussed
in Dorn (2016), the SEP in the ACA were designed to allow people who, due to job loss or
other factors, needed to obtain Marketplace coverage outside of the standard open enroll-
ment period. After the carriers claimed widespread abuse of the SEP by ineligible people,
however, CMS tightened the requirements for SEP applicants by requesting to document
their eligibility. It would thus be interesting to quantify whether this reform affected both
premium and enrollment decisions in the ACA exchanges along the same lines that the 5-star
SEP affected Medicare.

1) Data
The dataset was assembled from data made publicly available by the Center for Medicare
and Medicaid Services (CMS). This is the same dataset as used in Decarolis and Guglielmo
(2017). In particular, data on monthly enrollment for the years 2009-2013 at plan level were
downloaded from:

           http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/
        Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/MCRAdvPartDEnrolData/index.html.

The Crosswalk Files available from the same web site were used to link plans through the
years. Premiums and plan financial characteristics are from the Premium Files:

            http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Prescription-Drug-Coverage/
                        PrescriptionDrugCovGenIn/index.html.

Plans’ formulary and pharmacy networks are from the FRF (Formulary Reference Files):

                                 FormularyGuidance.asp

Demographic characteristics for the geographic areas are the only ancillary data source and
were obtained from:

                         http://ahrf.hrsa.gov/download.htm.

Contract performance data determining the star ratings were obtained from:

An example for 2012 of the how the nearly 50 individual measures are grouped into 9 domains
and 2 components (managed care and prescription drugs) is presented in Table A.1. Evidence
on the lack of score manipulation at the threshold in the post-reform period is presented
through the McCrary tests reported in Figure A.1.

2) Matched Sample Results
The first set of additional results reported concerns the probit estimates used for the con-
struction of the matched DID estimates in the enrollment analysis. Table A.2 reports the
estimates for four model specifications (i.e., columns 1-2, 3-4, 5 and 6) where we gradually in-
crease the set of controls. All controls are county-level demographic characteristics collected
from the AHRF files of the Health Resources and Services Administration. The estimates
reported in column 2 and 4 differ from those in columns 1 and 3, respectively, for the sample
of counties included: due to missing data for some characteristics, for columns 2 and 4 we
use a smaller sample than that used for columns 1 and 3. The sample used for columns 2
and 4 is the same as that used for columns 5 and 6. The matched DID reported in the main
text are based on the estimates in column 6 of Table A.2. Although this table clearly shows
that estimates are fairly stable across models, to further assess the robustness of the DID in
the main text we report in Table A.3 matched DID estimates based on the outcomes of the
three other probit models (i.e. model 1, 3 and 5). Overall, the results are broadly in line
with what is reported in the main text.

3) Placebo Analysis
In Table A.6 we report the results of a placebo analysis. In particular, we repeat our analysis
as if the 5-star SEP were introduced in 2011 instead of 2012. To avoid potential spillovers
from the true SEP, we narrowed our exercise to the enrollment periods from 2009 to 2011.
For the within-year changes, Panel A shows that, in our first two specifications, the simulated
SEP has a positive and statistically significant effect on the within-year enrollment change,
but this effect vanishes once we control for time trends. Furthermore, we do not find a
statistically significant effect of the placebo SEP on the percentage change in enrollment.
Panel B reports the analogous estimates for the across-year estimates. These estimates
indicate that plan choices post the 5-star SEP are indeed different from those in the earlier
period: with the placebo simulating that the policy were implemented in 2011, we obtain
negative (albeit not always significant) estimates.

4) Across- and Within-Year Enrollment for PDP
The analysis of PDP demand effects presents different challenges from the MAPD case.
A major concern is that only 2 regions are treated. Even with consumer-level data, this
would limit the ability to conduct inference as the asymptotic conditions underlying the
DID estimator cannot be satisfied. This problem can be solved by exploiting the large
number of control group observations (32 regions) through the method of Conley and Taber
(2011) if one is willing to assume that any random shock that might have hit the two treated
regions simultaneously with the 5-star SEP reform belongs to the same distribution of shocks

                                               ii
affecting the regions in the control group. In this respect, a strength of the PDP market
relative to the MAPD one is that no payment reforms occurred simultaneously with the 5-
star SEP. Thus, while we follow an approach analogous to that used for MAPD and include
in the control group only plans with a rating no lower than 4, in principle it could be less
problematic for PDP to have a broader definition of the control group.
    Table A.5 reports the estimates of the enrollment analysis for Part D. Within-year enroll-
ment is the dependent variable in columns 1-4. In each case, the first two sets of estimates
regard the variable in levels, while the next two involve enrollment as a percentage calculated
as for the Part C case. Across-years enrollment is the dependent variable in the following 4
columns. The Part D estimates are broadly in line with the earlier Part C findings. There
is a positive and significant effect of the 5-star SEP on within-year enrollment change. The
magnitude is also similar to what found for Part C amounting to roughly 10 percent of the
enrollment base. The across-years enrollment of 5 star contracts declines, but in a way that
is not statistically significant.

Notes: The table reports the DID estimates of the effect of the 5-star SEP. The outcome variable is the
difference in the contract enrollment between December and January (of the same year) calculated either in
levels (first four columns) or in percentage (latter four columns). The four model specifications considered
for each dependent variable differ in the set of controls used, as reported in the block at the very end of the
table.

Notes: The table reports the DID estimates of the effect of the 5-star SEP. Analogous to those in the main
text, but using a placebo treatment group. The sample covers the year 2009-2011 with a simulated policy
introduced in 2011. The estimates in Panel A, correspond to those in Table 2, while those in Panel B
correspond to those in Table 3. Standard errors in parentheses clustered at county level *** p<0.01, **
p<0.05, * p<0.1.
