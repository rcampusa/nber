                                               ABSTRACT

         The paper considers ways of avoiding a liquidity trap and ways of getting out of one. Unless lower
short nominal interest rates are associated with significantly lower interest volatility, a lower average rate
of inflation, which will be associated with lower expected nominal interest rates, increases the odds that the
zero nominal interest rate floor will become a binding constraint. The empirical evidence on this issue is
mixed.
         Once in a liquidity trap, there are two means of escape. The first is to use expansionary fiscal
policy. The second is to lower the zero nominal interest rate floor. This second option involves paying
negative interest on government 'bearer bonds' -- coin and currency, that is 'taxing money', as advocated
by Gesell. This would also reduce the likelihood of ending up in a liquidity trap. Taxing currency amounts
to having periodic 'currency reforms', that is, compulsory conversions of 'old' currency into 'new' currency,
say by stamping currency. The terms of the conversion can be set to achieve any positive or negative
interest rate on currency. There are likely to be significant shoe leather costs associated with such schemes.
The policy question then becomes how much shoe leather it takes to fill an output gap?
         Finally the paper develops a simple analytical model showing how the economy can get into a
liquidity trap and how Gesell money is one way of avoiding it or escaping from it.

                              Non-technical summary
       The credible targeting of a low rate of inflation should result, on average, in low

nominal interest rates. The administratively determined zero nominal interest rate on

currency sets a floor under the nominal interest rate on non-monetary financial claims. An

important policy issue then is the following: how likely is it that the economy ends up, as a

result of shocks or endogenous fluctuations, in a situation where the zero short nominal

interest floor becomes a binding constraint, that is, how likely is the economy to end up in a

liquidity trap?

        If low average nominal interest rates also tend to be stable rates, the risk of ending up

in a liquidity trap need not be enhanced much by targeting a low rate of inflation. The

empirical evidence on the relationship between the level and volatility of short nominal rates

is, however, mixed. The cross-sectional evidence supports a strong positive correlation

between the average level of the short nominal interest rate and its (unconditional) variance.

 The time-series evidence for the UK is ambiguous. At very high (daily) frequencies, the

 correlation between the level of short sterling futures and a volatility index derived from short

 sterling futures options is negative. At weekly frequencies, the correlation is positive for most

 of the post-1975 period is positive, but the correlation is negative since 1993, the beginning

 of inflation targeting in the UK.

         Once an economy lands itself in a liquidity trap, there are just two policy options.

 The first is to wait for some positive shock to the excess demand for goods and services,

 brought about through expansionary fiscal measures or through exogenous shocks to private

  domestic demand or to world demand. The second option is to lower the zero nominal

  interest rate floor on currency by taxing currency. A negative interest rate on currency would

  also reduce the likelihood of an economy landing itself in a liquidity trap.
       The paper revisits a proposal by Gesell for implementing a negative nominal interest

rate on currency. Under this proposal, currency would cease to be current, and could be

subject to confiscation, unless a predetermined periodic payment is made by the bearer to the

issuer. Currency would have become 'stamp scrip'. Another perspective on Gesell money is

to view it as involving periodic monetary reform, in which the conversion terms between old

and new currency define the own interest rate on currency.

       The transactions and administrative costs associated with such periodic currency

reforms would be non-negligible. Such currency conversion costs could be reduced by

lengthening the interval between conversions, but they would remain significant. These

'shoe-leather costs' would have to be set against the risk of ending up in a liquidity trap, if a

very low rate of inflation is targeted without taxing currency, or against the cost of targeting a

higher rate of inflation. It may take a lot of shoe leather to fill an output gap or to rub out the

distortions associated with the inflation tax.

        We then develop analyse the behaviour of a small analytical macroeconomicmodel in

 which negative interest on currency is a policy option. In the Keynesian, sticky price version

 of the model, there are two kinds of equilibria, 'normal' equilibria and liquidity trap

 equilibria. If the inflation rate falls to a sufficiently low level, the economy may end up in the

 liquidity trap zone in which it will cycle permanently around the liquidity trap steady state.

 Imposing a negative interest rate on currency lowers the critical rate of inflation at which the

 economy enters the liquidity trap zone. Once caught in the liquidity trap zone, a reduction in

 the nominal interest rate on currency provides a means of escape.

         If there are indeed benighted countries threatened by, or even caught in, a liquidity

 trap, the policy makers there have one more option they might wish to consider on its merits:

  Gesell money.
(I) Introduction
       Liquidity trap talk is with us again. Liquidity traps may be with us. An economy is

said to be in a liquidity trap when the ability to use monetary policy to stimulate demand has

vanished because the nominal interest rate has reached an unbreachable floor. The textbook

treatment of liquidity traps, based on Hickss [1936] interpretation of Keynes [1936], involves

the assumption that the demand for money becomes infinitely sensitive to the opportunity

cost of holding money, the spread between the pecuniary yield on some non-monetary asset,

i, and the pecuniary own yield on money, M, at some low level (typically zero) of that

opportunity cost. With portfolio holders indifferent a regards the composition of their

financial wealth between money and non-money assets, changes in the supply of money

cannot affect the spread. Specifically, increases in the supply of money cannot push the

spread below the level at which the demand for money becomes infinitely elastic.

        The argument assumed that the pecuniary own rate of return on money was zero, an

 appropriate assumption for coin and currency, although not for the liabilities of private

 deposit-taking institutions that make up most of the broader monetary aggregates, which now

 typically have positive nominal returns.        With the own rate of return on currency

 administratively fixed at zero, a floor for the spread becomes a floor for the nominal yield on

 some non-monetary financial instrument, i, the short nominal interest rate. l

                                                              nominal interest rate is taken to be
         When, as is institutionally more relevant, the short

 the monetary instrument, rather than some monetary aggregate, the argument is not changed

 in any essential way. Since money is, by assumption, the asset with the highest non-


  'With the nominal rate on currency fixed at zero, the nominal interest rate on other financial
  claims can be negative if the cost of holding and storing currency exceeds that of holding and
  storing these other claims (see Porter [1999]). This is unlikely to be important quantitatively
  and for expositional simplicity it is ignored in what follows.
pecuniary rate of return, the equilibrium spread between the pecuniary return on non-

monetary assets and that on money, has to be non-negative. The authorities therefore cannot

drive the short nominal interest rate below the pecuniary own rate of return on money. This
                                                                Non-interest-bearing coin and
is zero if (some component of) money is non-interest-bearing.

currency therefore prevent the short nominal interest rate on non-monetary financial claims

from falling below zero. This produces liquidity trap at (or possibly above) a zero nominal

rate of interest.

          This liquidity trap used to be treated, in the mainstream accounts of the monetary

transmission mechanism, as a theoretical curiosum without practical relevance.2 The revival

 of interest in the liquidity trap is not surprising. First, Japan is in a protracted economic

 slump. Short nominal interest rates there are near zero. Zero is the absolute nominal interest

 rate floor in Japan because yen notes and coin bear a zero nominal interest rate. Monetary

 policy in Japan currently appears to have a very limited effect on aggregate demand. The

 conclusion that there is a liquidity trap at work is hard to resist (see e.g. Krugman

 [1998a,b,c,d; 1999], Ito 111998] and McKiimon and Ohno [1999]); for a view that liquidity

 traps are unlikely to pose a problem, see Meltzer [1999]).

           Second, inflation in Euroland is below one percent per annum. The official short rate

  now 3is 2.5 percent. Euroland economic activity is slowing down. This raises the question as

  to whether a margin of two hundred and fifty basis points provides enough insurance against

  a slump. Demand could weaken to such an extent that a cut in the short nominal rate of more

  than two hundred and fifty points would be required to boost aggregate demand sufficiently

       The monetary instrument is, almost invariably, a short nominal interest               rate.4


Aggregate demand is influenced primarily by real interest rates, short and long, that is, by

nominal interest rates corrected for (expected) changes in the purchasing power of money.

The transmission of monetary policy through other real asset prices, including the real

exchange rate, depends on the ability of the monetary authorities to influence real interest

rates. For the monetary authority to affect real demand, changes in nominal interest rates

have to be translated, at least temporarily, into changes in real interest rates. In a moderate or

low-inflation environment, inflation and inflation expectations tend to move only gradually

and sluggishly. This Keynesian feature of the economy gives monetary policy a temporary

handle on the real economy.

        If short nominal interest rates cannot fall any further, short real rates can only be

 pushed down if there is a rise in the expected rate of inflation. If the price stability gospel has

 been widely internalised by market participants, expected inflation is unlikely to rise to

 produce the required cut in real rates.

         Once an economy is in such a situation, it is not possible to get out of it using the

 conventional monetary policy instruments - changes in the short nominal interest rates.

 Inflation expectations are not a policy instrument. Why would inflation expectations rise

 when monetary policy cannot stimulate demand? It is a trap - an inefficient equilibrium.

 Conventional monetary policy advice then can only be preventive, not curative: do not get


  4The argument could be recast in terms of the monetary authority using some monetary
  aggregate as the instrument, with the short nominal interest rate on risk-free non-monetary
  financial claims treated as endogenous. Taking the short nominal rate as the instrument has
  two advantages. First, the exposition in simpler. Second, it is what central banks actually do.
  Changes in reserve requirements, open market operations etc. arebest viewed as ways of
  changing the interest rate. .In an open economy, the other institutionally relevant instrument
  of monetary policy is the nominal exchange rate. When capital mobility is limited, the short
  nominal interest rate and the nominal exchange rate both can be instruments of policy, at any
   rate in the short run.
into this situation.5 Make sure inflation expectations (and actual inflation) are targeted at a

level high enough to ensure that nominal interest rates will not hit the floor, even during

periods during which aggressively expansionary monetary policy is in order.

        Of course, in a liquidity trap, expansionary fiscal policy, or any other exogenous

shock to aggregate demand, is supposed to be at its most effective. There are, however,

conditions under which fiscal policy cannot be used to stimulate aggregate demand. Debt-

financed lump-sum tax cuts could fail to stimulate aggregate demand if there is Ricardian

equivalence or debt neutrality. Alternatively, the government's creditworthiness may be so

 impaired that it cannot borrow. Finally, there could be external, Maastricht Treaty or

 Stability and Growth Pact-like external constraints on a government's ability to use deficit

 financing.

        If Ricardian equivalence holds, a temporary increase in exhaustive public spending

 will, even with a balanced budget, and in virtually any model of the economy, boosts

 aggregate demand. For this fiscal policy channel also to be ineffective, exhaustive public

 spending must be a direct perfect substitute for exhaustive private spending, say because

 public consumption is a perfect substitute for private consumption in private utility functions,

  and public investment is a perfect substitute for private investment in private production

  functions. 6

          If expansionary fiscal policy can be used to work the economy out of a liquidity trap,
  the problem is clearly rather less pressing. In what follows, it is assumed that this option is

  not available.

  from here?" Answer: "I would not start from here".

(II) Can the zero nominal interest rate floor become binding in

the UK?
       Most estimates of the current level of the long real interest rate in the UK put it

somewhere between 2.0 and 3.0 percent per annum. Figures 1 and 2 show the recent

behaviour of medium-term and long-term real rates of interest on index-linked government

securities.7



                                          Figure 1 here



                                          Figure 2 here



         With an inflation target of 2.5 percent per annum (as in the UK), the long-run nominal

interest rate (ignoring term- and risk premia) would be between 4.5 and 5.5 percent per

 annum. In steady state, the short-term nominal interest rate would also be between 4.5 and

 5.5 percent per annum. We can regard this as the 'normal' level of the short nominal interest

 rate. If one believed that there were contingencies (such as a dramatic, spontaneous collapse

 of aggregate demand) under which a cut in short rates of more than 4.5 to 5.5 percent would

 be in order, the monetary authority would be at risk of hitting the zero interest floor.

          Historically, in the UK, there have been occasions when Bank Rate has swung by

 more than 4.5 or 5.5     percentage   points. On 15 November 1979, the Bank's Minimum

 Lending Rate hit 17.00 percent. On March 11, 1981, it stood at 12.00 percent. On October 6,

  1989, the Bank's Minimum Band 1 Dealing Rate stood at 14.88 percent. On 8 February
1994, it was down to 5.13 percent. Clearly, very large swings in Bank Rate, in excess of the

4.5 or 5.5 percent 'safety margin' associated with a 2.5 percent inflation target and a 2.0 to 3.0

percent long real interest rate, have occurred inthe past.

        The emphasis should, however, be on 'in the past'. These very large cuts in Bank Rate

invariably took place from a very high level of rates associated with prior macroeconomic

mismanagement, generally an inflationary surge that threatened to get out of control (or had

indeed done so) or the desperate defence of an overvalued exchange rate peg. Figure 3 shows

the behaviour of Bank Rate, the inflation rate and the sterling-US$ exchange rate for the UK

in the post-World War II period.


                                           Figure 3 here



         Neither situation applies today. Nor should it apply again if the political commitment

 to low and stable inflation and its institutional expression in an operationally independent

 central bank remain intact.

         The longer-term historical record can also be viewed as encouraging. The UK got

 through the period 1800-1914 without ever landing itself in a liquidity trap. As Figure 4

 shows, the average rate of inflation over this 115-year period was slightly negative and the

 variability of the inflation rate was high. Figure 5 shows that Bank Rate did not fall below 2

  per cent throughout 115 years preceding World-War I.

  Civil War related.
                                          Figure 5 here



       There is a marked positive association, over time and across countries, between the

level of the inflation rate and its variability (see Okun [1971, 1975], Taylor [1981], Ball and

Cecchetti [19901). If such a relationship were to be found also between the level of short

nominal rates and their variability or volatility, it would further reduce the likelihood of

ending up in a liquidity trap in an environment with sustained low inflation and therefore, on

average, with low nominal interest rates.

        As will become apparent, the available statistical evidence on the association between

the level and volatility of short-term nominal interest rates is mixed. It is indeed very

difficult to offer a convincing test of our prior belief, that it is hard to conceive of situations in

which the zero nominal interest rate floor would become a binding constraint on monetary

policy in the UK, with the current symmetric annual inflation target of 2.5 percent.

        In principle, one could try to test this hypothesis by estimating a dynamic stochastic
                                                                                             models.

 zero, given the starting values of the process. We do indeed make some attempts

 direction, but our efforts must be accompanied by a clear health warning.

         There is an obvious, and in our view virtually insurmountable, problem with any

  assessment, based on historical data, of the odds that the non-negativity constraint on short

  nominal rates will become binding. During the sample, markets undoubtedly were operating

  under the assumption that short nominal rates could neverfall below zero. In the UK over the
past 200 years, the annual Bank Rate series indeed never fell below 2 percent. With the

support of the empirical distribution of nominal short rates truncated from below at zero, the

historical interest rate record is unlikely to be informative about the odds on the economy

getting into a liquidity trap in the future, since this would require a structural break in the

interest rate process, about which the sample is uninformative. If we were to assume

(counterfactually, as can be seen from Figures 7 and 8) that the distribution of Bank Rate or

of the error term in the Bank Rate equation is normal, there will always be a positive

probability that Bank rate will go negative. If we assume instead that the distributions in

question are, say, lognormal, the probability of breaching the zero floor (even asymptotically)

is a-priori constrained to be zero. We try to circumvent this by calculating the asymptotic

confidence bands for Bank Rate reported below from the empirical distribution of the sample

residuals. Since the empirical distribution of the residuals obviously has finite support, this

procedure will, if anything, underestimate the likelihood of the economy ending up in a

 liquidity trap.

         Even ignoring the unavoidable small-sample problems, this procedure is vulnerable to

 the following criticism. What we are interested in estimating is the probability that the

 interest rate would have had to be negative (or below the possibly positive liquidity trap

 level) in order to avoid the economy getting into a liquidity trap equilibrium. If the economy

 had been in a liquidity trap in the sample, the data would reflect the liquidity trap

 configuration of the economy, including the response of real activity and inflation that

 supported the liquidity trap floor as an equilibrium. Information on the 'deep' structural

 parameters of the model (the invariant parameters governing money demand and its

  determinants) is necessary to recover the 'first passage' probabilities into the liquidity trap

  region of the economy.
       What do the data tell us about the statistical association between the level and

volatility of the short nominal interest rate? The very high-frequency association between

short nominal sterling rates and a measure of volatility derived from short sterling futures

over the period 1987-1999 is shown in Figure 6. The association between the level of short

sterling and its volatility is, if anything, weakly negative.



                                           Figure 6 here



        The slightly lower frequency time-series evidence on the association between the

level of short nominal interest rate and a statistical measure of its variability using weekly

data is also mixed. Table 1 shows the time series record for the UK for the period 1997-1999.



                                                Table 1 here



         For the whole period 1975-1999, volatility and level of the three month interbank rate

 are positively contemporaneously correlated, but for the post-inflation targeting period 1993-

 1999, the correlation is slightly negative. The statistical model that generated the conditional

 variance measure used in Table 1 can be found in Appendix 2. We also provide an estimate

 of the steady state (long-run) value of the three month interbank rate implied by the statistical

 model, together with 95% steady state confidence bands for three month interbank rate.

         We also investigated the statistical properties of Bank Rate at significantly lower

  frequencies, using a 200 year time series of annual observations. Our time series model

  (described in Appendix 2) implies a strong positive correlation (0.81) between the level of

  Base Rate and its contemporaneous conditional variance. Table 2 plots the level of Base Rate
and our estimates of its conditional variance. We also provide an estimate of the steady state

(long-run) value of Base rate implied by the statistical model, togetherwith 95% steady state

confidence bands for Base Rate.



                                             Table 2 here



        The confidence bands were calculated using the distribution of the estimated sample

residuals. Not surprisingly, the distribution of sample residuals is distinctly non-normal. The

 same holds for Base rate itself. Figure 7 shows the frequency distribution of Base Rate and

 Figures 8 and 9 those of the estimated interest rate residuals. The sample distribution of Bank

 Rate is significantly skewed to the right. Its empirical distribution is truncated from below at

 2.0 percent. The distribution of the sample residuals from the two main interest rate models

 is rather more symmetric.

         Krugman 1998d] has suggested that deflation (negative inflation) makes a liquidity

  trap more likely. This is indeed an implication ofjust about any model of liquidity traps,

  including the model we develop in Section IV of this paper. We therefore estimate a simple

  time series process for annual RPI inflation over the 200 year period, and for its conditional
variance. The results are reported in Table 3, together with its estimated steady state value

and steady state 95% confidence intervals. The statistical inflation model is described in

Appendix 2. Surprisingly, the contemporaneous correlation between inflation and its

conditional variance turns out to be negative.



                                              Table 3 here



        The steady state confidence intervals for the annual rate of RPI inflation show that

there is quite a large probability of deflation. Before one gets too worried about this, three

points should be kept in mind. First, the relationship between interest rates and expected

 inflation depends on the behaviour of the inflation risk premium. Second, the UK

 experienced negative trend inflation and short bouts of sharp deflation in the 19th century,

 without landing itself in a liquidity trap. Third, the monetary policy target in the UK is, since

 June 1997, a symmetric inflation target. Deviations of inflation below the 2.5 percent target

 are to be avoided as much as deviations above that target. The risk of sharp deflation is

 therefore diminished. The new monetary regime has been in operation for too short a period,

 however, for this to show up as a structural break in the inflation time series process.

         McKinnon and Ohno [1999] have argued that, at any rate in the Japanese case, a large

 expected appreciation of the currency could create a liquidity trap. We investigated the

  likelihood of a sharp appreciation of sterling by using almost 200 years of £I$ exchange rate

  data to estimate a simple stochastic process for the proportional rate of depreciation of the

  exchange rate and its conditional variance. The results are reported in Table 4, together with

  the expected long-run sterling depreciation rate and the 95% asymptotic confidence intervals.

  The statistical model underlying these calculations is described in Appendix 2. The
contemporaneous correlation between exchange rate depreciation and its conditional variance

is low but negative.

        It suggests that, based on this particular statistical model, there is quite a significant

probability of a sizeable appreciation of sterling. Again, the caveat about the dangers of

ignoring risk premia applies. It is surprising that our simple statistical model appears to

handle such episodes as the American Civil War, two World Wars and the Great Depression

of the Thirties quite well.

        Finally, Table 5 reports cross-sectional evidence on the relationship between the level

 of short nominal rates and their volatility based on a sample of .59 countries between 1989

 and 1998. The source of the data is IFS.9 The correlation between the two variables is very

 high at 0.89, suggesting that across countries high short-term nominal rates are accompanied

 by high unconditional variances.



                                                Table 5 here



         On balance, the data fail to offer convincing support either for or against the

  contention that a regime of low short nominal interest rates is likely to be a regime of stable

  short nominal interest rates.       This is therefore not unambiguously good news, nor

  unambiguously bad news for a policy maker targeting low inflation, although the current UK

  target would seem to provide quite handsome room for monetary manoeuvre. Two hundred


       would like to thank Nick Hanchard for preparing this Table.
years of UK monetary history also favour the contention that liquidity traps are unlikely to

become a policy concern.




(III) Options for avoiding a liquidity trap
       The lower the inflation target, and, if it is credible, the lower the underlying rate of

inflation, the narrower is the 'safe range' above the zero floor for the short nominal rate. A

credible target of zero inflation, would, with the long real rate at 2.0 to 3.0 percent, reduce the

safe range to 2.0 to 3.0 percent.

        Does this mean that targeting zero inflation would be a high-risk strategy? There

would be risks if, despite a credible commitment to zero inflation, the economy is likelyto be

hit by shocks that would make interest rate cuts of more than 200 or 300 basis points

 desirable. If fiscal policy cannot be used to escape from the liquidity trap and if the risk of

 ending up in a trap is considered unacceptable, two options remain.




 Raising the inflation target
        The first option is to accept the nominal interest rate floor as immutable, and to target

 a rate of inflation high enough to reduce to acceptable levels the risk of hitting the zero

 interest floor. This would have to be done before the country gets into a liquidity trap.

 Targeting a higher rate of inflation after you are caught in the trap would be like pushing

 toothpaste back into the tube. All one can do is hope and wait for fiscal policy, or some other

  shock to aggregate demand, to boost the economy out of the trap.



  Lowering the nominal interest rate floor: stamping money a Ia Gesell
       The only other option is to stick to the inflation target but to lower the floor on the

nominal interest rate. A floor below zero would reduce the likelihood that the floor would

ever become a binding constraint on policy. In addition, the option of further lowering the

floor, would provide a mechanism for escaping from a liquidity trap even after a country had

been caught in it.

       That nominal interest rate floor at zero is not a God-given immovable barrier. It is the

result of a policy choice -     the   decision by governments or central banks to set the

administered nominal interest rate on coin and currency at zero, rather than at some other

(negative) level. Coin and currency are government bearer bonds'°. A bearer bond is a debt


 ° Bearer securities are securities for which ownership is established by possession, without
 any need for registering title, Thus, a bearer bond is a bond with no owner information
 attached to it. The legal presumption is that the bearer is the owner. If the issuer of the bond
 is credit-worthy, they are almost as liquid and transferable as cash. Cash (coin and currency)
 is a special case of a zero interest (or zero-coupon) bearer bond issued by the state (generally
 through the central bank). Currency can be viewed as a zero coupon bearer consol or bearer
 perpetuity, since it can be interpreted as having aninfinite maturity.. (It is always amusing
 to ask a finance expert to price a zero coupon perpetuity in a world where positive coupon
 perpetuities co-exist). In Appendix 1, we argue that it may be more informative to view
  currency as a zero couponjinite maturity bearer bond, which is issued and redeemed at par,
  with redemption taking the form of the one-for-one exchange of old currency for new
  currency which is indistinguishable from the old currency.

 The vast majority of 'international bonds', historically called 'eurobonds' are bearer. Bearer
 bonds can take two main forms. First, the traditional 'definitive' style,where the bonds
 literally are individual pieces of security-printed paper in denominations of, say, $10,000,
 which individual holders bring in to paying agents so as to receive payment of interest and
 principals. Second, 'global' bonds, which are technically bearer instruments but consist of a
 single piece of paper representing the entire issue (and so worth hundreds of millions or even
 billions of dollars). In practice, the terms of the global bond say that only Euroclear (the
 settlement system based in Brussels) or Cedelbank (the settlement system based in
 Luxembourg) are entitled to the proceeds of the global bond, and that Euroclear and
  Cedelbank will in turn divide the proceeds up amongst the end-investors whose details are
  stored in their electronic records. Thus the global bond is not an instrument which in practice
  can be passed from one owner to another, even though it is technically 'bearer'. Effectively
  the bonds are dematerialised.

  Bearer bonds are legal and quite common in the UK. Whilethe bearer debenture went out of
  use, replaced by the non-negotiable debenture or debenture stock, transferable (in the same
security in paper form whose ownership is transferred by delivery rather than by written

notice and amendment to the register of ownership. We shall refer to all bonds that are not

bearer bonds as registered bonds. Bearer bonds are negotiable, just as e.g. money market

instruments such as Treasury Bills, bank certificates of deposit, and bills of exchange are

negotiable. A financial instrument is negotiable if it is transferable from one person to

another by being delivered with or without endorsement so that the title passes to the

transferee.1' Coin and currency therefore are bearer bonds. They are obligations of the

government, made payable not to a named individual or other legal entity, but to whoever

happens to present it for payment - the bearer. Coin and currency have three further

distinguishing properties: they are government bearer bonds with infinite maturities

 (perpetuities or consols)'2; their coupon payments (which define the own (or nominal) rate of




 way as common stocks) by entry in the company's register, a number of new negotiable
 investment securities have evolved. They include the modern bearer bond, the negotiable
 certificate of deposit, and the floating rate note. A limited number of guts have also been
 issued with a bearer option.

 Before July 1983, municipal securities in the U.S. were issued for the most part in certificate
 form with coupons attached. Some of these so-called old-style bearerbonds are still available
 in the marketplace. The issuer has no record of who owns these bonds. The owner clips the
 coupons and collects the interest from the issuer's paying agent. Transferring the bonds
 requires physical delivery and payment. Bearer bonds issued by municipal authorities were
 made illegal in the U.S. in 1982 (no doubt because they provided ideal investments for those
 who did not welcome close examination of their financial position). Bearer bonds with a
 negative interest rate are especially awkward to administer, because inducing the bearer to
  present the issuer with coupons obliging the bearer to make a payment to the issuer presents
  non-trivial enforcement problems. This creates the need for mechanisms such asthe
  compulsory conversion of old cash into new cash (on terms implying a negativenominal
  interest rate), backed by the credible threat of confiscation of the old cash, asdiscussed in the
  body of the paper.
  II
     Key elements of negotiability include the following: (1) transfer by physical delivery; (2)
  transfer is such as to confer upon its holder unchallengeable title and (3) a negotiable
  instrument benefits from a number of evidential and procedural advantagesin the event of a
  court action.

interest on coin and currency) are zero, and they are legal tender (they cannot be refused in

final settlement of any obligation).

       There are two reasons why interest is not paid on currency.
                                                                      13

less important one, has to do with the attractions of seigniorage (issuing non-interest-bearing

monetary liabilities) as a source of government revenue in a historical environment of

positive short nominal rates on non-monetary governmentdebt.'4

        The second, and more important, reason why no interest is paid on coin and currency,

are the practical, administrative difficulties of paying a negative interest rate on bearer bonds.

It can be done, but it cannot be done elegantly. Significant 'shoe leather' costs are involved.

                There is no practical or administrative barrier to paying negative nominal

 interest rates (market-determined or administered) on those private financial instruments or

 on government interest-bearing securities that are not bearer bonds but have registered

 owners.'5 The reason is that, for registered securities, whether issued by private or public

 agents, the identities of both the issuer and the holder (the debtor and the creditor) are easily

 established. This makes it easy to verify whether interest due has been paid and received, be

 it at a positive or at a negative rate. Thus the non-bearer bond part of the monetary base, that

 is, banks' balances with the central bank, could earn a negative nominal interest rate without

  any technical problems. For these balances, the debtor (the central bank) and the creditor (the

  are more severe technical problems with attaching coupons or stamps to coin than to currency
  notes.
  14140f course, issuing negative interest-bearing monetary liabilities would be even more
  attractive, from a seigniorage point of view.
  '5The only exception is that it would not be possible to have a consol or perpetuity with a
  negative nominal interest rate. Assume the constant nominal coupon payment of the consol is
  positive. If the infinite sequence of short nominal rates is negative, the value of the consol

  for the consol.
commercial bank) are easily identified.       Positive interest payments or negative interest

payments just involve simple book-keeping transactions, debit or credit, between known

parties.

           We will highlight the technical, administrative problem with paying negative interest

on bearer bonds (be they private or public) is by considering the problems of paying a

negative coupon on the bearer bond part of the central bank's monetary liabilities, coin and

currency. While the identity of the issuer (the debtor, that is the Central Bank) is easily

verified, the identity of the holder (the creditor) is not. There is no obligation to register title

to currency in order to establish ownership. Possession effectively provides complete title.

This creates problems for paying any non-zero interest rate, because it is difficult to verify

whether a particular note or coin has already been credited or debited with interest. With

 verifiability of interest payments, currency could be turned into an interest-bearing bearer

 bond, and the interest rate could be negative (or positive), if circumstances required this.

            The problem of verifying whether interest due on bearer bonds has been paid is

 present, in a milder form, even when the interest rate is positive. However, the problem of

 getting the (anonymous) owner of the currency to come forward to claim his positive coupon

 receipt from the government is much less acute than the problem of getting the (anonymous)

  owner to come forward to make a payment to the government. In both cases, however, each

  individual monetary claim has to be marked, or identified clearly, as being 'current', that is, as

  having all interest due paid or received. Without such clear marking, positive interest-bearing

  money could be presented repeatedly for interest payment. Historically, the problem of

  paying positive coupons on bearer bonds was solved by attaching coupons or stamps to the

  title certificate of the bearer bond. When claiming his periodic coupon payment, the
appropriate coupon was physically removed ('clipped') from the title certificate and retained

by the issuer. Clipping coupons used to be a popular pastime among investors.'6

       Without further amendment, the 'coupon clipping' or stamping route would not work

for bearer bonds with negative coupons. The enforcement problems involved in getting the

unregistered, anonymous holders of the negative coupon bearer bonds to come forward to pay

the issuer would be insurmountable. The only practical way around this problem, is to make

the bearer bond subject to an expiration date and a conversion procedure. In the case of

currency, this could be achieved by periodically attaching coupons or stamps to currency,

without which the currency would cease to be 'current'.

        For currency to cease to be 'current', it is not enough for the monetary authority to
                                                                                          cease to
 declare that after a certain date, tj, currency issued before another date to < tj shall

 be legal tender. Being legal tender certainly enhances the attractiveness of currency as a store

 of value, medium of exchange and means of payment, but these advantages need not be

 enough to induce holders of 'old' currency, which is about to lose its legal tender status, to

 come forward and exchange it, at a price, for 'new' currency which does have legal tender

 status. What serves as medium of exchange and means of payment is socially determined.

 Being legal tender is but one among many considerations that induce people to use certain

  classes of objects as means of payment and medium of exchange. For currency to cease to be

  current, it effectively has to be subject to confiscation if the appropriate coupon or stamp has

  not been attached. In other words, there have to be periodic 'monetary reforms'7.

          There is a long tradition on the crankier fringes of the economics profession of

  proposals for taxing money or taxing liquidity, which is another way of describing negative

interest-bearing currency. Many of these proposals were part of wider, and generally hare-

brained, schemes for curing the world's economic and social ills. The mechanics of taxing

currency are straightforward main-stream economics, however.

       The best-known proponent of taxing currency was probably Silvio Gesell (1862-

1930), a GermanlArgentineafl businessman and economic scribbler of suspect political

judgement, but admired by Keynes, who wrote of him "I believe that the future will learn

more from the spirit of Gesell than from that of Marx" (Keynes [1936, p. 355]). Gesell

wanted to stimulate the circulation of money by getting the state to issue money that, like

capital assets, depreciated in value.'8 If inflation could not be relied upon to do the job of

making holding money unattractive, an alternative was "Stamp Scrip" - dated bills that would

 lose a certain percentage of value each year unless new stamps were put on them. Stamp

 Scrip was actually issued briefly during the Great Depression of the Thirties in parts of the
                                                                                             The

    Gesell's motivation was not, as far as we can determine, the avoidance
 liquidity traps. His aim was to eliminate the interest component of costs and prices
 completely from the economic system, not just in the extreme circumstances of the liquidity
 trap, but as a permanent feature. Our reading of his works suggest that he was a bit vague
 about the distinction between real and nominal interest rates. While, by stamping currency,
 the nominal interest rate on non-monetary assets can indeed be brought down to zero (or to
  any other level), the endogeneity of the rate of inflation means that the ability of the monetary
  authorities to influence the long-run real interest rate is much more doubtful. The formal
  model analysed in Section IV of this paper has the property that the monetary authorities
  cannot influence the long-run real interest rate.
    In August 1935 the first social credit government was elected in the Canadian province of
  Alberta. While its ideology owed more to the writings of two other great economic cranks,
  Alfred Richard Orage [1917] and Major Clifford Hugh Douglas [1919] (and to the personal
  involvement of the latter as economic adviser to the provincial government), the Alberta
   Prosperity Certificates introduced in 1936 by Premier William Aberhart, were pure Gesell.
   Similar in appearance to a dollar bill, the certificates required a weekly endorsement of a 2c
refused to accept its own scrip in payment.2° Similar local currency experiments were tried in

Worgi, Austria during the 1930s.

       Thus, for negative interest on bearer bonds such as currency to be enforceable, the

bearer bond has to expire after a certain date. The desired (negative or positive) interest rate

on currency would be determined by the terms on which the old, expiring currency could be

exchanged with the central bank for new currency. The 'conversion' could be effected by

stamping the old currency, or by issuing completely new currency which was verifiably

distinct from the old currency.

        Taxing currency (or paying negative interest on currency) through expiration of old

 currency and conversion into new currency can be visualised as follows. After the expiration
                                                                             old currency without
 date, tj , the issuer (the central bank) or its agents can confiscate the
 compensation.2' Provided the forces of the law are strong enough, this could induce holders

 of the old currency to convert it, at a price, on or before the expiration date, rather than

 continue to use it in transactions or as a store of value after the expiration date and risk having

 it confiscated. At fixed intervals of length & (Gesell periods, say) whose duration could, for

 convenience, be set at a year (or several years, in order to reduce conversion costs), and on a

  specific day, (Gesell day), old currency would legally revert to the issuer (the central bank).

  After Gesell day, the old currency has no value (because of the credible threat of confiscation)



  stamp, amounting to a 104 percent annual capital levy (see Hutchinson and Burkitt [1997]
  and Mallory [1954]).
  201t also had failed to convince the Federal government in Ottawa to match its negative
  interest rates. Since Federal currency was at least as useful as a means of payment, this
  would require to scrip to trade at a discount with respect to the Federal currency and to
  appreciate vis-à-vis the federal currency at a rate that compensated for the interest differential
  between Federal and provincial currency.
   21Less drastic penalties might work also. For instance, old moneyfound in circulation after
   its 'expiry' date would be forcibly converted into new money at the rate offered on the
   conversion date, but subject to an additional penalty. The confiscation scenario makes the
   key point very clearly, however.
and will not be used in transactions or as a store of value. On Gesell day, 1 £ worth of new

currency would be issued in exchange       for et £s worth of old currency, where 1M would be
the policy-determined (instantaneous) nominal interest rate on currency.22 For simplicity, we

assume iMto be constant, although it could be time-varying. The nominal rate of interest on

currency would be administratively determined, that is, set by the central bank. To avoid

long queues at the central bank's conversion offices on Gesell days, earlier exchanges of old

for new money might be allowed at the rate of 1 £ worth of the new currency for

          Jti'ls

 is the time before the next Gesell day on which the old currency is exchanged for the new,

 and i is the instantaneous nominal interest rate on the government's non-monetary liabilities.

 For currency to remain rate-of-return-dominated as a store of value, it is necessary that

 1M    <j• Both rates could be negative, and may have to be, if liquidity traps are to be ruled
 out. Coin and currency would effectively become time-limited, finite maturity financial

 claims.

           New currency could, in principle, be used in transactions before midnight on the

  Gesell day before they are formally introduced. During this earlier Gesell period, the value of

  the old currency in terms of the co-existing new currency would decline steadily. The

  relative value of the old currency in terms of the new currency would change at an
                                                                                      and the
  instantaneous rate M , so as to ensure that, at the moment the old currency expires

  new currency comes in officially (at midnight on Gesell day), there is no discrete jump in the

   rate would be —IM.
value of old money in terms of new money, or of goods and services in terms of money.23 It

follows that, during the period of coexistence of old and new money, the rate of inflation of

the prices of goods and services would be higher in terms of old money than for in terms of

money, with the excess of the old money inflation rate over the new money inflation rate

equal to -M• If the coexistence of two currencies is thought to be confusing, one could try to

enforce a ban on the use of new currency in transactions before its Gesell day.

          Clearly there are costs associated with such a scheme, even if one can come up with a

slightly higher-tech (and tamper-proof) alternative to physically stamping currency. These

shoe leather costs have to be set against the benefits of removing the zero floor on the

nominal interest rate.

           There are costs (and benefits) other than shoe-leather costs associated with taxing

 currency. Taxing currency would be regressive, since only the relatively poor hold a

 significant fraction of their wealth in currency. Taxing currency would, however, have the

 nice feature of constituting a tax on the grey, black and outright criminal economies, which

 are heavily cash-based.

        The first-order conditions for an optimum imply that the solvency constraint will hold

 with equality. Also,

                                                                                              (10)

           II' <lM currency would dominate non-monetary financial assets ('bonds') as a

 store of value. Households would wish to take infinite long positions in money, financed by

 infinite short positions in non-monetary securities. The rate of return onthe portfolio would

 be infinite. This cannot be an equilibrium.

                =        currency and bonds are perfect substitutes as stores of value. Because of the

  direct utility of money, the equilibrium will be the Friedman equilibrium, characterised by

  satiation in money. With the logarithmic utility function, satiation occurs only when the

  stock of money is infinite (relative to the finite consumption level). Providedthe authorities
provide government money and absorb private bonds in the right (infinite) amounts, this can

be an equilibrium.

       There is a continuum of identical consumers whose aggregate measure is normalised

to 1. The individual relationships derived in this section therefore also characterise the

aggregate behaviour of the consumers.

Government

        The budget identity of the consolidated general government and centralbank is given

in (12). The level of real public consumption is denoted g 0.

                              If+3=—_iB+iM+p(g—r)                                    (12)

        Again, the initial nominal value of the government's financial liabilities is

 predetermined

 M(0) + B(0) = A(0)

        This budget identity can be rewritten as

                               aEra+g_r+(i—i)m                                       (13)

         The government solvency constraint is


                               lim e    _5(u)dua(v)   0                              (14)

         Equations (13) and (14) imply the intertemporal government budget constraint:


                                                                              a(t)

                                                                —
                                                                    g(v)]dv           (15)

         Government consumption spending is exogenous. To ensure that public consumption

  spending does not exceed total available resources, > 0, we therefore have to impose

  gzy
         With a representative consumer, this model will exhibit debt neutrality or Ricardian

  equivalence. Without loss of generality, we therefore assume that the government's solvency
constraint is always satisfied because lump-sum taxes are continuously adjusted to keep the

nominal stock of public debt (monetary and non-monetary) constant, A(t) = 0, t 0, that is,

                               —g+ia+(if —i)m
                                        A(O)                                    (16)

       Monetary policy is specified as an exogenous value for the nominal interest rate on

currency and either an exogenous value for the short nominal interest rate on non-monetary

financial claims or an exogenous value of the initial nominal money stock and a subsequent

exogenous growth rate of the nominal money stock. In either case, the short nominal bond

rate is required to be no lower than the short nominal rate on currency.

        Thus, monetary policy is characterised by

                                        1M =                                     (17)

         I will only consider in detail the case where the short nominal bond rate is the

  instrument. The case where the nominal money stock path is the instrument only involves

  trivial amendments to the earlier analysis.

  Equilibrium and the liquidity trap with full employment
       In the full-employment, flexible price version of the model, output always equals the

exogenously given level of capacity output,             Therefore

                                  c+g=y=y                                            (20)

       The equilibrium instantaneous real interest rate is given by


                                                                                      (21)
                                           cy cg
        For simplicity, let g =   0.   Let the exogenous growth rate of capacity output be denoted


 n(t) -. It follows that the equilibrium instantaneous real rate of interest simplifies to
       y
                                           r(t) = S + n(t)                            (22)

        The remaining equilibrium conditions can be summarised as follows

                                  i(t) = r(t) + ,r(t)                                 (23)


                                   lr(t)                                               (24)
                                           p(t)

                                   M(t) _________                                      (25)
                                   P(t) :(t)—zM)

                                                    i(t)iM                             (26)

         Note from (22) and (23), that

                                            i(t) = 8+n(t)+r(t)                         (27)

           When the short nominal bond rate is exogenous (equation (18)), the model exhibits

  price level indeterminacy. Since the behaviour of real money balances, the inflation rate and

  the nominal and real interest rates are not affected by this, and since the conditions under

  which a liquidity trap occurs or its consequences are not affected by the nominal

  indeterminacy, no further attention is paid to this issue.
        In the flexible price level version of the model, the equilibrium real interest rate and

real private consumption sequences are the same when the economy is in a liquidity trap as

when it isn't. The liquidity trap matters here only because is may stop the economy from

achieving an inflation target. Of course, in the model under consideration, the welfare

motivation for an inflation target is not obvious. Pareto-efficiency requires that the economy

be satiated with real money balances, that is, that i =M       All Pareto-efficient equilibria are
therefore liquidity trap equilibria.

        Whatever the motivation for the inflation target, it is clear that a liquidity trap may

prevent the authorities from achieving the target. Let r * be the target rate of inflation,

assumed constant.

        From (26) and (27), it follows that an inflation target cannot be achieved if

                                                                                      (28)

        Since 8>0, a non-negative inflation target can be achieved, even with the nominal

interest rate on currency at zero, unless the growth rate of capacity output were sufficiently

negative. This hardly seems a serious concern. Nevertheless, equation (28) makes it clear,

that an inflation target is always achievable, if the authorities set the nominal interest rate on

currency, M' at a sufficiently low (negative) value. Note that by setting =      i   = 8+ n +   r
the authorities can follow the Friedman rule for Pareto-efficiency (satiation in real money

balances) and achieve the inflation target at the same time.

        The analysis is not affected in any material way when the initial value and subsequent

growth rates of the nominal money stock are the monetary policy instrument and the short

nominal bond rate becomes endogenous. This is most easily seen when both the growth rate

of capacity output and the growth rate of the nominal money stock are constant at ff and

respectively.
       Under this monetary rule, the inflation rate is given by

                                                        if 8+pi
                           —lM(S+fl)                    if ö+Ji<LM

       It follows that an inflation target below 1M — (8 + n) cannot be achieved. It also

follows that by setting a sufficiently negative nominal interest rate on currency, any inflation

target can be achieved.

The liquidity trap in the Keynesian variant

       In the Keynesian variant, output is demand-determined, the price level and the rate of

inflation are assumed to be predetermined, and the rate of inflation adjusts to the gap between

actual and capacity output through the simplest kind of accelerationist Phillips curve.

                                      c+g=y                                         (29)

                                      fr=fl(y-)
                                                                                    (30)
                                          p8>0

        For simplicity, we assume capacity output to be exogenous and constant.

Monetary policy
        The monetary authorities are again assumed to peg the nominal interest rate on

currency exogenously

                                                =

        We assume in what follows that the other monetary instrument is the short nominal

 interest rate on bonds, rather than the level or the growth rate of the nominal money stock.

 There are two reasons for this. First, it simplifies the exposition. Second, it is how monetary

 policy is actually conducted.
       The monetary authorities are assumed to follow a simplified Taylor rule for the short

nominal interest rate on non-monetary financial claims, as long as this does not put the short

nominal bond rate below the interest rate on currency. A standard Taylor rule for the short

nominal bond rate which restricts the short nominal bond rate not to be below the short

nominal rate on currency, would be

                             i=1+yr+y if i+yr+i 1M
                                               if i+pr+y <IM
       For our purposes, all that matters is the responsiveness of the short bond rate to the

inflation rate. We therefore omit feedback from the level of real GDP (or from the output

gap) in what follows. The short nominal interest rate rule therefore simplifies to

                               i=:+7r if :+77rZM
                                                                                     (31)
                                  1M      if   l+721<ZM

       The Taylor rule is sometimes justified as a simple, ad-hoc rule consistent with

inflation targeting. If the target rate of inflation is constant at r * (and equal to the steady-

state rate of inflation), the intercept in the Taylor rule, I ,   can   be given the following

interpretation

                                       1=8+(1_y),r*                                  (32)

       This implies

                                                                                     (33a)

or

                                                                                     (33b)

        The behaviour of the economy can be summarised in two first-order differential

equations in the non-predetermined state variable c and the predetermined state variable r.

The equation governing the behaviour of private consumption growth switches, however,
when the floor on the short nominal interest rate becomes binding (when the economy is in a

liquidity trap).

                               r—fl(c+g—y)                                           (34)

        When the liquidity trap constraint is not binding (we shall refer to this as the 'normal'

case), saddlepoint stability for the dynamic system requires y > 1. A higher rate of inflation

leads, through the policy reaction function, to a larger increase in the short nominal bond rate

so as to raise the short real rate. As shown in Figure 10, the ê = 0 locus in the normal case

(denoted ( = 0) N)' is vertical in a phase diagram with r on the horizontal axis and c on the

        In the liquidity trap regime, the ê = 0 locus (denoted (è = O)L )         is vertical at

shall refer to the boundary of the normal and the liquidity trap locus as the LN locus in Figure

10. Taking again as our reference point the situation where M = 0 and noting that 8> 0 and

that y > 1, we need only assume that the target inflation rate r *        is   nonnegative, for the

switching value of r to lie between the two è = 0 loci. This is assumed in Figure 10 and

thereafter. The LN locus could either be to the left or to the right of the caxis.

        The steady state of the model is as follows. There are two steady states (the normal

one and the liquidity trap one) for the nominal bond rate and the rate of inflation. The normal

steady state values are given first.

        When y > 1, as we assume throughout, the equilibrium configuration in the

           We want to consider shocks for which the liquidity trap can be sprung, that is, shocks

for which the constraint j i becomes binding. In our model that has to be either a demand

shock or a supply shock that lowers current aggregate demand below current capacity output.

As regards demand shocks, the simplest candidate in our model is the unexpected

announcement, at time t = t0 of a future increase in public spending, g, starting at t1 > t0. For

simplicity, we will treat the expected future increase in public spending as permanent.

           An anticipated future increase in public spending is contractionary between the

announcement date (to) and the implementation date (tj) because forward-looking Ricardian

households realise that higher future public spending means a higher present discounted value
of future taxes. Human capital falls and with it private consumption. Because of the Taylor-

style interest rate reaction function, the profile of expected future short real rates is actually

lower with the public spending shock than without. Future after-tax endowments are

therefore discounted at a lower rate, but this is not enough to negate the negative effect on

aggregate demand.26. Essentially the same results obtain when we consider the unexpected

announcement of a lower future path of capacity output. This was the main shock considered

by Krugman [1998d]. Figure 11 represents the behaviour of the system following the public

spending shock.



                                             Figure 11 here




        Assume the system starts in steady state at the normal steady state equilibrium c,

with government spending expected to be constant. An unanticipated, immediate, permanent

increase in public spending will result in an immediate transition to the new steady state at

       In the new steady state, the rate of inflation, and all real and nominal interest rates are

the same as before. The level of private consumption has fallen by the same amount as the

level of public consumption has increased.

        When the increase in public consumption is not immediate, the transition is as

follows. Assume that at the announcement date, to, there is news of a future permanent

increase in public spending, starting at tj   > t. The increase in public spending, when it
occurs, is of the same magnitude as the immediate increase in public spending analysed


25 Anne Sibert provided the mathematical solution and graphical representation for the
behaviour of the system in the liquidity trap zone.
26 If instead of the logarithmic instantaneous utility function we had adopted the constant
elasticity of marginal utility function with an intertemporal substitution elasticity larger than
1, the negative effect on consumption would have been reinforced.
earlier. We shall refer to tj as the implementation date. For a 'moderate' postponement in

the implementation of the public spending increase (defined below), private consumption

drops immediately (on the announcement date to) to            ,   say.   The reason again is that a

higher sequence of future taxes is anticipated by the Ricardian consumers, immediately upon

the announcement of the future spending increase. Human capital falls and with it private

consumption, albeit by less that when the public spending increase was immediate. Between

the announcement date, to, and the implementation date, tj , consumption and inflation both

fall gradually as the system moves from         to       , where it arrives at tj when the public

spending increase in actually implemented. From tj on, the system moves along the

convergent saddlepath through the new steady state (f ), from            c   to the new steady state


at '
         The initial jump in the level of consumption at t is such as to place the system on that

divergent trajectory, drawn with reference to the initial steady state, that will put it on the

unique continuously convergent trajectory through the new steady state,             , at the moment

the public spending increase is actually implemented (at the implementation date tj). Note

that the rate of inflation is assumed to be predetermined in the Keynesian version of the

model.

         A moderate delay in the public spending increase in defined by the requirement that

the intersection of the disequilibrium trajectory drawn with reference to the initial steady

state, and the saddlepath through the new steady state, be at a level of inflation greater than or

equal than the one that triggers the liquidity trap. In Figure 11 this means that the

disequilibrium trajectory passing through         is the trajectory with the longest gap between

the announcement of the future spending increase and its implementation that is consistent
with the system not ending up in the liquidity trap region. This solution trajectory intersects

the convergent saddlepath through f at Q, which corresponds to an inflation rate equal

to       , which separates the normal region from the liquidity trap region.


       With any longer postponement of the public spending increase, the initial drop in

consumption would be to, say, c in Figure 11. From there the system would travel along

the divergent trajectory drawn with reference to        that would bring it to        on the LN

locus some time before tj. The system would then switch to the closed orbit, drawn with

reference to     that passes through Q . It would travel in clockwise fashion around this

orbit until tj. Assume that at tj it has arrived at c     . At tj , it would switch (without a
discontinuous jump in either c or ir) to the closed orbit drawn with reference to the new

liquidity trap steady state ( )    that passes   through c   . If this orbit (labelled aco) stays
entirely within the liquidity trap domain (that is, if this orbit does not cross the LN locus) the

system would continue to circumnavigate the new liquidity trap steady state on this closed

orbit. This is the case drawn in Figure 11. If the aw orbit leaves the liquidity trap domain

again, the behaviour of the system becomes very hard to pin down. It is possible that no

equilibrium exists in this case.

        In the Keynesian case also, it is clear how a reduction in the nominal interest rate on

currency, M' can help avoid a liquidity trap. A lower value of 1M shifts both the ( = 0)L

locus and the boundary separating the liquidity trap region from the normal region (the LL

locus) to the left. For any shock to demand or supply, it is always possible to find a value of

 1M low enough to stop the economy from entering the liquidity trap region.

        Furthermore, if the economy were to get caught in the liquidity trap region, an

unexpected permanent reduction in the nominal interest rate on currency could always land it
back in the normal region. Cutting the nominal rate on currency can therefore be cure as well

as prevention.27




(V) Conclusion

       The credible targeting of a low rate of inflation should result, on average, in low

nominal interest rates. The administratively determined zero nominal interest rate on

currency sets a floor under the nominal interest rate on non-monetary financial claims. An

important policy issue then is the following: how likely is it that the economy ends up, as a

result of shocks or endogenous fluctuations, in a situation where the zero short nominal

interest floor becomes a binding constraint, that is, how likely is the economy to end up in a

liquidity trap?

        If low average nominal interest rates also tend to be stable rates, the risk of ending up

in a liquidity trap need not be enhanced much by targeting a low rate of inflation. The

empirical evidence on the relationship between the level and volatility of short nominal rates

is, however, mixed. The cross-sectional evidence supports a strong positive correlation. The


27 A very similar, but technically more complicated, analysis can be conducted for the case
where the growth rate of the nominal money stock rather than the short nominal bond rate is
the monetary instrument. When the growth rate of nominal money is the exogenous

                    i
monetary instrument, the equations of motion of the economic system can be summarised as
follows: When j > , we have the following three-dimensional dynamic system.

time-series evidence for the UK is ambiguous, but if anything is consistent with a weak

negative correlation.

          Once an economy lands itself in a liquidity trap, there are just two policy options.

The first is to wait for some positive shock to the excess demand for goods and services,

brought about through expansionary fiscal measures or through exogenous shocks to private

domestic demand or to world demand. The second option is to lower the zero nominal

interest rate floor on currency by taxing currency. A negative interest rate on currency would

also reduce the likelihood of an economy landing itself in a liquidity trap.

          The paper revisits a proposal by Gesell for implementing a negative nominal interest

rate on currency. The transactions and administrative costs associated with what amounts to

periodic currency reforms would be non-negligible. Such currency conversion costs could be

reduced by lengthening the interval between conversions, but they would remain significant.

These 'shoe-leather costs' would have to be set against the risk of ending up in a liquidity trap,

if a very low rate of inflation is targeted without taxing currency, or against the cost of

targeting a higher rate of inflation.28 It may take a lot of shoe leather to fill an output gap or

to rub out the distortions of a higher inflation tax. If there are indeed benighted countries

threatened by, or even caught in, a liquidity trap, the policy makers there have one more

 option      they    might    wish    to   consider on        its   merits:    Gesell     money.


 which is the same as the liquidity trap-constrained dynamics when the short nominal bond
 rate was the policy instrument.

Appendix 1: Paying Negative Nominal Interest Rates; Some Further
Considerations.

          In this section, we ignore uncertainty and time is measured in discrete periods of unit

length.

     is the one-period nominal interest rate between periods t and t+1. At time t,        a   security

obliging the issuer to pay the holder (owner) 1 unit of money in period t+i, i = 1,...,N, will be

worth D7 units of period t money. In an efficient market it will be the case that

                                                      1
                                       D'=fl   €=1




          This pricing formula makes sense, for finite N, as long as     > —1, for all t: the price

of money tomorrow in terms of money today, D,N, or the N-period nominal discount factor,

cannot be negative. The sequence of interest rates can, however be negative. A negative one-

period interest rate simply means that 1 £ tomorrow is worth more than 1f today: the discount

factor exceeds 1. As N — cc, the infinite sequence of single-period nominal interest rates

cannot all be negative, lest the discount factor become unbounded. A consol or perpetuity

with a constant positive coupon would have an infinite price if the infinite sequence of period

rates were negative.

          Assume that a borrower issues, at time t, a security committing him to pay the lender

(the owner or holder of the security) Ct+] 0 units of money in periods t+i, i =       1       N. The

price of the security in period t, V" is


                                          VN   —D'C+1

           Assume   the purchase price is paid by the lender in period t. The problem for the

 lender now becomes to enforce payment of the coupons, C+1, by the borrower in each of the
N periods after the security is issued. Unless we can rely on borrower honesty, or unless the

lender and borrower are locked into an infinitely repeated lender-borrower relationship, a

necessary condition for performance by the borrower is that the lender knows the identity of

the borrower. The borrower need not know the identity of the lender, because the borrower

has already received all he wants out of the relationship: money up front. To enforce

performance on the contract by the borrower, once the present discounted value to the

borrower of the continuation of the relationship has become negative, the lender must be able

to identify the borrower to a third party enforcement agency (the courts).

        Conventional bearer bonds are therefore incentive-compatible. The anonymous

holder of the bearer bond knows the identity of the issuer and it is the issuer who owes money

to the holder of the bearer bond. It is of course key that there is a way to establish whether

coupon payments have in fact been made. With bearer bonds, negotiable instruments that can

change hands freely, the security must be marked unambiguously as 'current' in regard to all

payments due. Without such clear and unambiguous marking, the same bearer bond couldbe

presented again and again for payment by the same or by different anonymous holders.

 Clipping coupons off a bearer bond is a time-honoured technology for establishing whether

 payments due have indeed been made.

        I restrict the discussion to pure fiat currency, which does not have intrinsic value

 either as a consumption good or as a capital good. A useful way of viewing currency is as an

 IOU of the state that has a one-period maturity, pays no interest, but can be redeemed at par

 after one period. Each unit of the 'old' currency is returned to the issuer after one period in

 exchange for one unit of 'new' currency which is identical in all respects to the old currency.

 In particular, it is impossible to determine whether a given imit of currency is new or old.

 Note that this makes one-period currency redeemable at par for indistinguishable new
currency equivalent to a zero coupon bearer perpetuity or consol. The value of one unit of

                                                              1
currency as a store of value is therefore, in period t,
                                                          + it,t+l


        Currency,   of course, yields further utility services (as a means of payment and

medium of exchange). The value of the flow of non-pecuniary returns in period t (measured

in terms of currency) will be denoted v(M), where M denotes the nominal stock of

currency. The total, pecuniary and non-pecuniary value of an additional unit of currency

issued in period t is therefore

                                                      1
                                         v'(M)+ 1 +
                                                      1tt+1


        Interest-bearing currency involves replacing the assumption that one unit of currency

can be exchanged for 1 unit of identical currency after one period, with the assumption that

one unit of currency can be exchanged for l+Nf units of identical currency after one period.

The value of the interest-bearing currency is therefore


                                          v'(M1)+ 1 +


         Clearly, if M 0, money's bearer-bond status remains consistent with incentive-

compatible enforcement of the terms of the contract. The anonymous lender (the holder of

 the bearer bond) knows the identity of the borrower (the state through its agent, the central

 bank), who owes the lender money. The anonymous party can be relied upon to claim the

 positive interest due. The problem of marking currency when interest has been paid will of

 course be present, as with all bearer bonds. Coupons will have to be clipped off currency or

 currency will have to be stamped.

         When the interest rate on money is negative, the anonymous party is also the party

 who owes money to the known party. This presents a problem in that the anonymous bearer
may try to avoid paying interest due to the borrower simply by not turning up to have the

currency stamped or have non-detachable coupons attached to it. If private agents continue

among themselves to exchange (and accept in payment) old but unstamped money and new or

stamped money at par, the attempt to pay negative interest on money would be vitiated. The

issuer (the state) has to be able to force the bearer of its currency liabilities to come forward

to pay the 'tax on currency'. Tax enforcement when the tax authorities do not know the

identity of the tax payer is problematic. The only solution is, first, to make currency on

which interest has been paid clearly distinguishable from currency on which interest has not

been paid (by stamping or attaching coupons to it) and second, to penalise those holders of

currency who are in arrears. The simplest penalty would be partial or completeconfiscation

of currency on which interest payments are not current.

       Standard errors are estimated using Quasi Maximum Likelihood. The estimates of the

parameters are consistent even if the conditional normality assumption is violated. They can,

however, be inefficient.

       The coefficient 8, that determines the dependence of the conditional variance on the

lagged interest rate level is insignificant. Alternative models of the conditional variance that

include higher order powers or higher order lags of the lagged interest rate level, were also

estimated.29 The coefficients of the higher order powers or higher order lags of the interest

rate level were also insignificant. Therefore, the dependence of the conditional variance on

past interest rate levels is weak.

        However, the ex-post contemporaneous relationship between the interest rate level i

and the conditional variance o- is strong. In fact the two variables have a correlation of 0.66.

This is mainly because of the large information shocks in 1970's and 1980's when short

 interest rates were high. After the introduction of inflation targeting in UK (in late 92) the

        includes a version replacing the conditional variance equation in (A2.l) by
       =w+     flo
 and Sanders [19921.
                     + ye + 8i, a specification suggested by Chan, Karolyi, Longstaff
relationship between the interest rate level i1 and the conditional variance o is weaker. In

fact they are slightly negatively correlated, with a correlation coefficient of -0.26.

       The steady state forecast of the level of the 3-month interbank rate is 7.546. The 95%

confidence intervals are 4.02 and 14.41. The confidence intervals were constructed by

assuming that the standardised steady state forecast follows the in-sample distribution of the

standardised residuals which, of course, has finite support. In particular the assumed

skewness and kurtosis were 0.846 and 10.49 respectively.

        Using ln(1 + i1) rather than i as the specification of the interest rate variable in the

regressions did not result in significantly different results.



(2) UK base rate 1800-1998:

        Let i denote the UK base rate. The time series model estimated was an EGARCH

model of the form:

                          —
                            i-1 = a + bi_1 + e,,
                           =        +U+

                         E(eI'P,_1) =0, E(eIP1_1) =     o,                               (A2.2)

                         log(o) = +fllog(1)+a--'- +              0.€i
                                                         0.1_i


         The coefficients a and y capture the potentially asymmetric impact of last periods

 shocks on conditional variance.

         The time series model also includes AR(10) and MA(2) terms in the conditional

 mean equation to account for the autocorrelation of standardised residuals.

         Annual data for the UK base rate from 1800 to 1998 were used for estimation. The

 estimation results using maximum likelihood were:

       Standard errors are estimated using Quasi Maximum Likelihood. The estimates of the

parameters are asymptotically consistent even if the conditional normality assumption is

violated. They can be inefficient, however, in this case.

       The EGARCH model was chosen over alternative GARCH models, because its long

run unconditional variance was non-explosive30. The coefficient ' is significant3t, but the

effect is the opposite of the "leverage32" effect, that is, a negative shock has a negative impact

on the conditional variance.

The steady state forecast of the base rate is 4.88. The 95% confidence intervals are 1.02 and

10.1. The confidence intervals were constructed by assuming that the standardised steady

state forecast follows the in-sample distribution of the standardised residuals. In particular the

assumed skewness and kurtosis were 0.49 and 4.197 respectively.

       This time series model includes AR(5) and AR(8) terms in the conditional mean

equation to account for the autocorrelation of standardised residuals.                 It includes

GARCH(1,1) terms in the conditional variance equation to account for the autocorrelation of

squared standardised residuals.

       Annual data of the UK RN annual proportional changes from 1800 to 1998 were used

for the model estimation. The estimation results using maximum likelihood were:

        Standard errors are estimated using Quasi Maximum Likelihood. The estimates of the

 parameters are asymptotically consistent even if the conditional normality assumption is

 violated. They can be inefficient, however, in this case.


 32 The "leverage" effect is the negative correlation between current returns and future
 volatility, found mainly in stock returns data.
       Alternative models of the conditional variance that include inflation rate dependence,

were also estimated. The coefficient of the inflation rate dependence was insignificant.

       The steady state forecast of the inflation rate is 2.7%. The 95% confidence intervals

are -10.7% and 21%. The confidence intervals were constructed by assuming that the

standardised steady state forecast follows the in-sample distribution of the standardised

residuals.      In particular the assumed skewness and kurtosis were 0.434 and 5.286

respectively.

 account for the autocorrelation of standardised residuals. It includes GARCH(1 , 1) terms in

 the conditional variance equation to account for the autocorrelation of squared standardised

 capture the potential dependence of the conditional variance on the proportional rate of

       The coefficient 8, which measures the dependence of the conditional variance on the

squared proportional exchange rate change is highly significant. The steady state forecast of

the £/$ annual percentage change is -0.8%. The 95% confidence intervals are -10.6% and

4.2%. The confidence intervals were constructed by assuming that the standardised steady

state forecast follows the in-sample distribution of the standardised residuals. In particular
