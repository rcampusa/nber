                  Labor Supply and Aggregate Fluctuations


                                    ABSTRACT



     One view of aggregate fluctuations interprets changes in employment

as movements along a reasonably elastic labor supply schedule.         Observed

levels of employment represent equality of supply and demand.         An opposing

view interprets fluctuations as movements away from an inelastic labor

supply function.     The   p~per   examines the behavior of employment, wages,

and interest rates to determine if the market-clearing view can account

for joint movements of the key variables.         Specifically, it asks if the

labor supply function iI'lp1icit in the aggregate data is consistent with

microeconomicevidence about labor supply.          The verdict here is favorable.

IJowever, one of the implications of the market-clearing view, that the

labor supply function is insensitive to the money stock, is clearly

refuted.     Some modifications of the market-clearing model are discussed.

The weak theoretical grounding of non-market-clearing models is also

noted.     Neither model combines a convincing economic analysis and a full

explanation of the facts.

1.   Introduction

      Issues of labor supply are at the heart of macroeconomic explanations of

the large cyclical fluctuations of output observed in modern economies.

Plainly, people work harder in booms than in slumps.    Economists' explanations

of this phenomenon range from a pure market clearing supply-and-demand view at

Â·one extreme to a dismissal of almost any role of supply and of market clearing

at the other extreme.    Disagreement is intense because failure of labor markets

to clear may create a strong case favoring activist macroeconomic policy.

      This paper starts with a serious empirical examination of the view that the

labor market is always in balance--that every observed combination of employment

and compensation is a point of intersection of the relevant supply and demand

curves.   I will call this the "intertemporal substitution" model of fluctuations.

Ac~ording   to it, workers are willing to shift their hours of work from one year

to another in response to modest shifts in relative wages.     This model stands up

reasonably well on its own ground.     The elasticity of labor supply inferred from

the response of employment and relative wages to exogenous shifts in demand is

around one half.    Ibis figure is quite consistent with microeconomic evidence

about the response of individual workers to temporary increases in their own

wages; this evidence is available from longitudinal panel studies and from the

various negative income tax experiments.

      The paper goes on to point out a strong implication of the pure inter-

temporal substitution model, namely, the irrelevance of changes in the money

supply in the labor supply function.    A model where markets clear instantly

ought to obey full monetary neutrality.    The data refute this implication

absolutely unambiguously.    The money stock unambiguously shifts the labor

supply function.     The pure substitution model seems untenable in the light of

this evidence.     The paper then turns to explanations of the nonneutrality of

money in the short run.     The most carefully worked out line of thought proposes

that monetary shocks cause workers to make inappropriate intertemporal shifts in

labor supply because they lack complete information about the source of aggregate

shocks and are forced to respond in the same way to real and nominal disturbances.

The paper is skeptical about the relevance of these models in view of the exten-

sive, timely information that is available to modern economies about a wide

variety of economic aggregates.     The paper is equally skeptical about the ex-

planatory value of the line of thought based on contracts in the labor market--

if contracts are efficient, they should generate virtually the same level of

employment as a labor market that clears instantaneously.        If contracts are

inhibited by lack of information, then employment should behave in the way des-

cribed by the theory of markets with incomplete information, a theory which has

already .been found wanting.    Contract theory does not seem to make any indepen-

dent contribution to the explanation of the sensitivity of employment to movements

in the money supply.

     Finally, the paper turns to the view that, in the short run, labor supply

is largely irrelevant to the determination of aggregate employment.        According

to a view prevailing among the majority of practical economists and well sum-

 irized in a textbook IS-LM model with an empirical Phillips curve, employers

 "termine employment unilaterally by equating the marginal value product of

 abor to a predetermined nominal wage.        Short-run movements in labor demand push

workers above or below their microeconomic labor supply functions.        Only very

gradually, as wages adjust sluggishly, does the level of employment come to
                                          -3-



respect labor supply.       The evidence does not refute this view.   But supporters

of this line of thought have not so far been very successful in explaining why

large movements     ~way   from the labor supply function are consistent with basic

economic principles.



2.   The Pure Intertempora1 Substitution Hypothesis

        According to the intertempora1 substitution model of fluctuations, people

work harder in some years than in others because the market rewards them for

this pattern.      People are not tricked into extra work in a boom; they find the

work desirable because the return, in the relevant intertempora1 sense, is

unusually high.      Slumps are just periods when a lower level of effort is
economically efficient.

        Before expounding the intertempora1 substitution model itself, I think it may

be helpful to clear up some potential sources of confusion.        The history of the

model has been bound up with the hypothesis of rational expectations.         The dean

of the raLiona1 expectations school, Robert Lucas, was one of the authors of the
                                                        1
most famous exposition of the intertempora1 model.          That paper is probably even

more famous for introducing one of the first formalizations of the role of ex-

pectation errors in macroeconomics.       Much criticism of the intertempora1 sub-

stitution model has been directed at Lucas and Rappingis formulation of it, and

specifically at the large role it assigns to errors in perceiving the current real.
        2
wage.       Many economists have received the impression that intertempora1 substitution

takes place only because of workers' misunderstanding of movements in relative

prices in the intertempora1 substitution model.        However, in fact, the issues of

2For example, in Tobin (1972).
                                         -4-


substitution and expectation or perception errors can be completely divorced.

For now, I want to concentrate on substitution that is induced by genuine and

appropriate changes in relative prices.

        Another source of misunderstanding of the intertemporal substitution model

is the claim that it makes all movements in employment and unemployment volun-

tary.     A recurrent theme in the discussion of the model is the criticism that

it makes employment fall by raising quits, when in fact quits are low during a
            3
downturn.       This criticism has not been taken very seriously by the proponents

of the theory of intertemporal substitution.       An attempt is made in this paper

to reconcile the apparent unilateral determination of employment by employers

with the hypothesis that the consequent changes in employment represent inter-

temporal substitution of work at one time for work at another in line with

changes in relative wages.

        Probably the most serious misunderstanding of the substitution model is the
                                                                                      4
claim that it rests on movements of real wages that do not in fact take place.

This paper shows that the role of real wages in intertemporal substitution de-

pends on the source of the disturbance.        Fluctuations of real interest rates

are equally important--the most general version of the intertemporal substitution

model rests on variations in the relative prices of current labor against future

labor.     This point was clearly spelled out in Lucas and Rapping's original paper,

b~t   was not fully incorporated in their empirical results.      Recently Barro (1978)

has developed a more complete theoretical model of intertempora1 substitution in

general equilibrium.

       My purpose here is to set forth a simple empirical version of the inter-

temporal substitution model, to estimate its key parameter, and then to inquire

at length whether the story told by the model about aggregate fluctuations makes

sense in view of other evidence about intertemporal substitution.     In particular,

I will draw on recent microeconomic evidence on labor supply based on panel data

and the negative income tax experiments.

       Within a formal model, the common-sense view--that people work more when

there is more work to do--requires that aggregate supply be reasonably elastic

with respect to the relative wage and that aggregate demand be reasonably inelas-

tic.     Then a temporary exogenous burst of demand, say, from the government's

decision to pursue a costly war, brings about an increase in the current wage

compared to the discounted future wage, so people work harder and labor input

rises.     The evidence presented here suggests that an increase of one percent in

the relative price raises labor supply by about 0.6 percent.     The amount of

interte~poral    substitution of labor implied by these results is roughly consistent

with the f5.ndings of microeconomic research.

       Viewed on its own grounds, the intertemporal substitution model has to be

judged a success.     Its two central implications--that exogenous demand drives up

employment and drives up the current real wage compared to the discounted future

real wage--are clearly confirmed by the data.     The apparent elasticity of labor

supply is not implausibly high.     However, this evidence does not confirm the

model in any strong sense, or distinguish it from competing hypotheses.     As a

later section of the paper will demonstrate, the intertemporal substitution model

in its pure form seems quite unambiguously refuted by other data.

     (a)   Microeconomic theory of intertemporal labor supply

     It is useful to review the standard theory as developed in Lucas and Rapping

and in several other places.       Individuals have preferences over present and

future work and present and future consumption of goods.           They have endowments

of time available in the present and future, valued by wage rates that, for now,

will be considered known with certainty.           They may also hold some wealth.   Con-

sumption goods are available at known prices, and consumers may borrow or lend

at a given real interest rate to move resources from present to future or the

reverse.   Formally, with

there are goods demand and labor supply equations for year 1:

and a similar pair for year 2.       The substitution effects of changes in the relative

prices are as follows:

           Effect of higher real interest rates on present consumption:
             negative

           Effect of higher current real wage on present consumption:
             presumably positive
                                         -7-


            Effect of higher future real wage on present consumption:
              ambiguous

            Effect of higher real interest rate on present labor supply:
              presumably positive

            Effect of higher present real wage on present labor supply:
              positive

            Effect of higher future real wage on present labor supply:
              presumably negative


     The basic logic of the intertemporal substitution model holds that the

observed responses to cyclical movements in relative prices should be essentially

pure substitution effects, as cyclical variations have little effect on lifetime

well-being, which is the relevant concept of income.     Thus the central question

treated in this section is whether the set of changes in relative prices that

~~company   a boom or a recession are compatible with the increase or decrease in

labor supply that takes place.     Possible changes that might explain, say, the

rise in employment in a boom are:

     1.   The present real wage rises,

     2.   The future real wage falls,

     3.   The real interest rate   ris~s.


Of these, the second seems highly unlikely and has not received any attention.

Most discussion of cyclical labor supply has focused on the role of temporary

changes      in the real wage.   But the third suggestion, a rise in the real in-

terest rate, is clearly pointed out by Lucas and Rapping and deserves an

examination as well.

     The transplantation of the two-period analysis to the real world where people

work and consume for many years requires some additional comment.       Of course, the
                                         -8-



complete intertemporal model has the relative prices for all future years as

arguments of the demand and supply functions for this year.       Condensation to

the two-period version requires the hypothesis that all future years can be

combined into a Hicksian composite good.       If any departure of the real wage and

the real interest rate this year from their normal values is expected to be cor-

rected   ~y   next year and all succeeding years, then the composite good theorem

applies, and the demand and supply functions can be written just as functions

of the current real wage and real interest rates and real wealth.      More generally,

if the current values of the real wage and interest rate provide all the infor-

mation that is needed to predict the path by which they will return to normal

over the future, then it will still be true that the demand functions can be

written as functions of contemporaneous variables alone.       The latter explanation

of the role of the variables will be relied upon in the empirical work presented

here, as it turns out that movements in the variables persist for well over a year.

       Under a general specification of preferences, changes in real wages and in

real inteLest rates have distinct substitution effects and so should enter

separately in econometric work.      This observation led Lucas and Rapping to include

both variables in their regressions, though the interest rate was eventually

omitted from their final equations.      I am not aware of any successful attempts

~J   measure the independent contribution of interest rates in intertemporal labor

     pply; certainly microeconomic research has nothing to say on this point because

     ere is no usable cross-sectional variation in interest rates.    There is an ad-

'itional assumption about preferences whose implication is that the effects of

real wages and interest rates combine in a certain way:       The intertemporal

~tility    function is assumed to be separable in goods and work.    The marginal
                                         -9-



rate of substitution between present work and future consumption then depends

on the amount of work today    ~ut   not on the amount of consumption today) and

on the level of future consumption, which is independent of r and wI owing to

the assumption of no wealth effects of transitory fluctuations.      The return to

labor in the current period relative to the price of future consumption is

(1 + r)w .     Thus a composite substitution variable with the same form,
        l




indexes the effects of both variables in time series work under the assumptions

set forth earlier about the information content of current wages and interest

rates and the separability of preferences.      Reasonably general specifications

of preferences, such as the CES, obey separability.

     ~)      Econometric evidence on the joint movements of the relevant variables

     One potential empirical weakness of the intertemporal substitution model is

the higo elasticity of labor supply it seems to require:      Aggregate fluctuations

involve lJrge movements in employment and small movements in the substitution

variable.     If the ~hanges in employment are movements along a labor supply curve,

it must be quite elastic, or so the argument goes.      The first step in examining

this line of attack on the intertemporal substitution model is to find out how

elastic the labor supply curve implicit in the aggregate data actually is.         Now,

any rGodel has a right to some residuals, so it is not adequate just to look at

the plot of employment against the substitution variable.      Nothing less than a

full econometric untangling of the supply function from the demand function will

answer the question.     Of course, the elasticity of the supply function is not the

only issue.     If it turns out that the supply function is plausibly inelastic, but
                                           -10-



that almost all fluctuations in employment are attributed to unexplained shifts

of the supply curve rather than to movements along the curve, then the inter-

temporal substitution model has little that is interesting or new about it.

     Separation of demand curves from supply curves is a very well understood

econometric problem.        If the model hypothesizes random shifts of both curves,

then identification requires that there be some exogenous variable that has

predictable effects on one curve and not the other.        The obvious candidate in

aggregate supply and demand is government purchases of goods and services (I

will call this government expenditures for short, but it should be understood

to exclude transfers).       Periodically the government absorbs an abnormal fraction

of employment and output, mainly to pursue wars.        Provided these contributions to

demand are unrelated to the random shifts in the schedules (in other words, inter-

tp.mporal substitution is not a major factor in the determination of government

expenditure), then the relation between government expenditure on the one hand

and employment and the substitution variable on the other, provides information

about the slope of the supply curve.        From the econometric point of view, all

that is involved is the use of government or military expenditures as an instru-

mental variable in the estimation of the aggregate labor supply schedule.

However, the issue of how to measure the supply schedule is much more than just

a technical econometric one.       It may be helpful at this stage to sketch a

g20eral equilibrium analysis of the effects of military expenditures on the
                        5
e~onomy   as a whole.

     Consider an economy with one produced good, called output, and labor.

Suppose, for simplicity, that the capital stock is given, so that production

                                             -11-



takes place with labor alone, subject to diminishing returns.          Suppose further

that changes in military expenditures have negligible effects on consumers' wealth,

either because the changes are brief or because the government cuts the permanent

level of other expenditures to finance temporary military activities.          Suppose

finally that the current values of the real interest rate and the real wage pro-

vide complete information about the future paths of relative prices, as proposed

earlier.      Then it is reasonable to assume that the demand for output depends only

on the real interest rate (of course, it also depends on real wealth, but that

is taken as given).        The supply of output depends only on the price of

output relative to labor, namely the real wage, as in the standard theory of the

firm.     In the labor market, the demand for labor is just a re-writing of the

supply of output and also depends just on the real wage.          Finally, labor supply

i~   a function of the substitution variable, which depends on both the real interest

rate and the real wage.

        Fo~   a given real wage, w, and level of government expenditures, g, there is

a real interest rate, r, which clears the market for output.           The market-clearing

real interest      rat~   is an increasing function of the real wage (a higher real wage

depresses supply and leaves demand unchanged) and is an increasing function of

government demand for goods.         Similarly, for a given real interest rate and level

of direct government employment,        ~,   there is a real wage which clears the labor

market.       The market clearing real wage is a decreasing function of the real

interest rate (a higher real interest rate stimulates labor supply but leaves

labor demand unaffected) and is an increasing function of direct government em-

ployment.      All this leads to the following diagram describing general equilibrium:

Output and employment rise.   The real wage falls, but labor supply rises because

the rise in the real interest rate more than offsets the fall in the real wage;

the substitution variable rises.   When the government stimulates employment by

purchasing output, more than all of the intertemporal substitution effect operates

through the real interest rate.    The effect from the real wage is in the opposite

direction.

     An increase in direct government employment shifts the LL curve to the

right and leaves the QQ curve unaffected:

Again, both output and employment rise.         In this case, however, both real interest

rates and real wages contribute to the intertemporal substitution toward higher

current labor supply.

       Since the typical military buildup involves a combination of purchases of

output and direct employment, the model does not make an unambiguous prediction

about the relation between real wages and military expenditures.       It is unam-

biguous, however, that military expenditures will cause workers to substitute

toward higher current labor supply and that the inducement will be evident as

a higher value of the composite substitution variable.       This general equilibrium

analysis establishes the relevance of military expenditures as instrumental

variables in the estimation of the aggregate labor supply schedule.        It points

out the difference between the effects of purchases of output and of direct

employment.     Accordingly, both variables will be used as instruments.

       The value of military expenditures as econometric instruments depends on

the transitory nature of wars.      A permanent change in government expenditures

should simply displace an equal amount of private consumption, for the following

reasop:    Sooner or later an increase in the government's diversion of resources

must be financed with higher taxes.       Consumers should make permanent adjustments

in    consum~tion   levels in response to any information they receive about present

or future taxes.      A permanent increase in government expenditures should bring

about an immediate permanent decline in consumption of about the same magnitude.

A transitory increase in government expenditure--say, for a war--should bring

dDout a much smaller, but still permanent, decrease in consumption.        Consequently,

 Ie    overall response of employment or output to a measure of exogenous demand

 .ould be stronger for those measures with large transitory elements--the mili-

 3ry component, for example--than for measures that are close to random walks.

It is also important that the measure of exogenous demand not be one that simply

.~isplaces   private demand.   Government expenditures on standard consumption goods

distributed to the populace would not be a satisfactory variable for the purposes

of this study.        On the other hand, diversion of resources to an expensive war in

another part of the world is very close to the ideal for these purposes.

     The labor supply equation to be estimated within this framework is

                                    L
                                        t
                                            =a +   I3s
                                                         t
                                                             +   u
                                                                     t'
where L is total labor supply (including government employment), St is the
       t
substitution variable, approximated henceforth as r                               + log w ' and u is the
                                                                              t          t       t
random unexplained component of labor supply.                             Because the labor supply equation

has a central role in the general equilibrium of the economy, there is every

reason to think that u             feeds back into the determination of St' so they are
                               t
statistically correlated.            For this reason, a two-stage least squares estimator

will be used with military expenditures and military employment as instrumental

v8Liables.

     Estimation of the labor supply equation in this form is not directly feasible

because the real interest rate, one of the components of St' is not observed.

Instead,    t~e    real rate must be inferred from the nominal rate and the rate of

inflation.        Restating the substitution variable in nominal terms gives

                          N
             St       r     + log Pt - log Pt+d + log w - log Pt
                          t                            t

          N
where r     is the nominal interest rate and d is the number of time periods over
          t
which the interest rate applies.               Now actual behavior at time t responds not to

St' but to St + Et,where E is the error made in time t in forecasting the future
                          t
price, log Pt+d'           In terms of observed variables, the labor supply function is

Under the assumption that expectations about future prices made in period t

make use of information about military expenditures in period t, the expectation

error,    E       , is uncorrelated with military expenditures and they remain eligible
              t
as instrumental variables when St is measured from nominal quantities.

        In the results presented here, L                   is measured as employee-hours in the
                                                       t
total    u.s.      economy with an exponential trend removed.              The price in the sub-

stitution variable is measured by the GNP deflator, the wage by hourly compen-

sation in the private non-farm sector, and the nominal interest rate by the rate

on one-year commercial paper.                  The future price in St is thus four quarters ahead.

The instruments are military purchases of goods and services, again with trend

removed, and de trended total military employment.                     The latter is an annual variable

and is given its annual value in all four quarters of each year; this does not

affect its eligibility as an instrument.                      The other data are quarterly and span

1948 through 1978, third quarter.                    Employee-hours are measured in billions per

year     (a representative value is 142 billion in 1972, first quarter).                   The sub-

stitution variable is measured in percentage points (137 in 72:1).                      As a cor-

rection for serial correlation in the residuals from the labor supply equation,

all data, including the instruments, were transformed autoregressively with

p   =   0.86.

        The two-stage least squares estimate of the labor supply equation is

                          L
                              t
                                  =    7.0     +    .66 St             a = 1. 59
                                      ( 5.4)       (.28)

                         (standard errors are in parentheses)

According to the point estimate of the slope, an increase of one percentage point

in the substitution variable raises labor supply by 0.66 billion hours per year.
                                                -17-



The corresponding elasticity of the labor supply function with respect to, say,

the real wage, is 0.46 (computed as 100 x 0.66/142).              But the slope parameter

and elasticity are estimated with a certain amount of sampling error.              Elas-

ticities much above one are pretty clearly ruled out, but elasticities as low

as 0.3 are apparently compatible with the data.

        The two-stage least squares estimator is not invariant to normalization;

that is, different choices              about which jointly dependent variable is on the

left-hand side yield different estimates of the parameters.              Running the labor

supply equation in the opposite direction gives


              s
                  t
                      =   -10.5    + 1.51 L t                      o   2.40
                          (12.7)      (.65)


The reciprocal of 1.51 is 0.63, very close to the earlier estimate of the slope,

0.66.     The low estimate of the slope of the labor supply schedule is not just an

artifact of the normalization.

        To summarize, real military expenditures can reasonably be taken as one of

the major exogenous influences on the demand for output in the U.S. economy, and

hence on the derived demand for labor.              Statistical evidence shows that military

expenditures push the economy along a well-defined upward-sloping labor supply

schedule whose elasticity is around a half.              There have been sufficiently many

large movements in real military expenditures so that the sampling variation in

the estimates of the slope of the labor supply function is adequately small.

The next step is to decide if an elasticity of around a half is reasonable in

the light of other evidence about labor supply.

        (c)   Microeconomic evidence on intertemporal labor supply

        The elasticity of labor supply with respect to transitory variations in ef-

fective wages can be measured econometrically using data collected from individuals
                                                  -18-



over time in panel studies.               The variation found in micro data is less balanced

than that found in the aggregate data examined in the previous section:                   There

is little observable variation in interest               rates~   but a great deal in real wage

rates.     This part of the paper will look at evidence from surveys of individual

workers and from various negative income tax experiments.

        Thomas MaCurdy (1978) has recently completed a study of the evidence in the

Panel Study of Income Dynamics for adult men.                Everyone in his sample works at

least part of each         year~    so the relevant margin of substitution is the number

of hours of     work~     not the discrete decision about whether to work at all.             MaCurdy

assumes that workers' perceptions of lifetime well-being do not change from year

to year~ but rather can be treated as unobserved permanent individual character-

istics.     Then the observed response of hours to changes in wages is interpreted

a~   a pure substitution effect.             He estimates the elasticity directly by regres-

sing the log of hours of work on the log of the wage.                  The resulting elasticities

range    f~om   .09 to    .23~   depending on the details of the specification.         This re-

search teads to confirm the general view that adult males do not vary their hours

of work ina way Lhat is sensitive to wages.

        A similar study has been carried out by James Heckman and MaCurdy (1977)

for adult women.          They   find~    again in accord with earlier    research~   that women

are much more sensitive to changes in wages.               For women whose wages are beyond

the reservation point that draws them into the labor                market~   the estimated

elasticity of hours of work with respect to the wage is 6.6.

        So far as I      know~   there are no comparable studies of intertemporal labor

supply among      teenagers~       who are probably similar to adult women.

        As it   stands~    this body of evidence suggests an aggregate wage elasticity

of labor supply of around            2~   but virtually all of that comes from women and teenagers.
                                        -19-



Observed cyclical fluctuations in employment are disproportionately concentrated

among women and teenagers, but are noticeable among men as well.

      Another highly relevant body of evidence has been collected by the various

negative income tax experiments.     I cannot do justice to all of the findings of

the experiments, but will offer the following broad summary:     The typical ex-

periment offered a three-year period of increased income to its subjects, along

with a tax of about 50 percent on earnings.     The typical adult male subject

reduced his labor supply by three hours per week and the typical adult female

subject by about two hours per week.    However, only about half of the subjects

were actually influenced by the tax and transfer provisions of the experiment;

the rest had total incomes in excess of the critical point where payments reached

zero under the benefit formula.    Putting all this together gives a rough estimate

pf the wage elasticities of 0.26 for men and 0.66 for women.     This is somewhat

higher than MaCurdy's estimates for men and very much lower than Heckman and

MaCurdy's estimates for women.     Part of the difference may be attributable to

the ratheL different compositions of the two samples.     For aggregate labor sup-

ply, the evidence from the negative income tax experiments suggests an overall

wage elasticity of about 0.40.

      Except possibly for Heckman and MaCurdy's rather extreme estimate for adult

women, the microeconomic evidence on the labor supply response to temporary

movements of wages seems quite consistent with aggregate evidence.     The long-

standing criticism of the intertemporal substitution model accusing it of resting

on implausibly high elasticities of labor supply is not sustained by the evidence.

On   its own grounds, the model seems to work out quite well.

3.    The Irrelevance of Money in the Pure Intertemporal Substitution Model

       Money has no explicit role in a simple version of the intertemporal sub-

stitution model of labor supply.        Whatever influence money has on labor supply

ought to operate through the substitution variable.             There is no mechanism
                                                                                6
within the model by which the money stock can shift the supply curve.               Nothing

in the pure theory of intertemporal substitution suggests that labor supply is

the source of the apparent influence of the nominal money stock on real output

and employment.     Of course, several authors, including Lucas and Rapping at the

outset, have coupled the intertemporal substitution model t9 models of short-

run limitations in the diffusion of information.             In these hybrids, monetary

neutrality fails in the short run.        An unexpected monetary expansion can create

the impression of high real interest rates (or higher real wages) because of

limited information among employers and workers.             The effect can last only as

long as the lag in the arrival of information.             As Lucas (1975) has argued, the

transitory real effect of a monetary disturbance could set in motion a longer

response within the real economy.        For example, costs of adjusting the level of

output will make inventories fall in response to a monetary expansion, and then

gradually output will rise to restore the stock of inventories.

       As a simple test of the irrelevance of money, I re-estimated the equation

~f    the earlier equation with the addition of the log of the money supply (M
                                                                                        I

to monetary policy.    The t-statistic for the exclusion of money from this

equation is in excess of four. which is statistically overwhelming evidence

that the money stock shifts the labor supply function.      A neutral response

of labor supply to the money stock is not a plausible hypothesis with respect

to the postwar American economy.    This finding invites a closer look at theo-

ries of labor supply which attempt to explain the vulnerability of the real

economy to nominal shocks.



4.   Theories of Labor Supply under Limited Information and Uncertainty

      Robert Lucas (1972) presents a completely worked out theory of the non-

neutrality of money based upon an explicit intertemporal theory of labor supply.

Barro and Fischer (1976) give a similar but more general and less rigorous

d~velopment   of the same ideas.   In essence. this line of thought relies on the

strength of intertemporal substitution in labor supply. but suggests that workers

sometimes make adjustments that they would find inappropriate in general equili-

brium where they and all the other agents in the economy had better information

about the current slate of the economy.       In the simplest models. the economy is

subject to two kinds of shocks. one rea] and one nominal.       In general equilibrium

with full information. labor supply would respond only to the real shock.        The

nominal shock would simply change all prices and wages in equal proportion.       How-

ever. workers have access to only a single indicator of the current state of the

economy. say. the wage level (or. in Lucas' model. the local price level).        Then,

as Lucas and various other authors have shown, labor supply over-reacts to the

nominal disturbance and under-reacts to the real disturbance.

      One line of attack on this theory as applied to the contemporary U.S. economy

claims that the elasticity of labor supply is too small to explain the observed
                                        -22-



movements in employment.     To put it another way, workers never see, or think

they see, large enough movements in real wages for them to make sufficiently

large adjustments in hours of work, whether the adjustments are appropriate or

not.    It seems to me that this criticism is untenable in view of the evidence

presented earlier in this paper.     Real wages and interest rates do move enough

to accord with observed movements in employment, given microeconomic evidence

about labor supply.

       Another line of attack questions the relevance of the critical assumption

about limitations in information for labor supply in the modern U.S. economy.7

Within the general class of models pioneered by Lucas, monetary neutrality fails

only when workers do not observe enough different aggregate variables to figure

out the nature of the aggregate shock (Barro and Fischer (1976) give a particularly

rlear exposition of this point).     A large amount of information about prices,

wages, employment, unemployment, and other aggregate variables is available vir-

tually instantaneously and essentially for free.      It is hard to see how the hy-

potheses of the theory of monetary nonneutrality on account of limited information

can apply when such a wealth of information is available.      It is clear, for example,

that permitting the participants in Lucas' 1972 model to know the average price

level in the economy would restore complete monetary neutrality in the short run.

The criticism is not that workers actually do know what is happening in the U.S.

e2onomy, but rather to question the success of this type of model in capturing

t~e    important source of nonneutrality.   At this stage there seems good reason to

doubt the relevance of the existing models of limited information.



7Tobin (1972), for example.
                                        -23-



      A second body of thought has developed with objectives similar to those

of the theory of limited information.     Its point of departure is the observation

that many workers have formal contracts which predetermine wages and let employers

choose employment so as to maximize profit once they observe demand.     It is clear

that this kind of contract will generate monetary nonneutra1ity (Fischer (1977),

Gray (1976), and Phelps and Taylor (1977)).     It is much less clear why such

contracts would ever come into being in the first place.     Barro (1977) has pointed

out the inefficiency of contracts in which nominal shocks have real consequences.

Imposition of the hypothesis of efficiency (marginal product of labor equal to

marginal value of workers' time) within labor contracts has the simple implica-

tion that the level of employment in a contract economy is essentially the same

as in an economy with an open labor market.     Contract economies can have monetary

nnnneutrality, but for the same reasons discussed earlier in this section:       If

limitations on the availability of current information make it impossible to dis-

tinguish real from monetary shocks, then contracts that are contingent on whatever

information is available will be vulnerable to purely nominal shocks.     But this is

just a restatement of the conclusions of Lucas' theory of incomplete information.

Contract theory has not so far made any independent contribution to the explanation

of the large shifts in employment and output. in response to movements of the money

supply that are revealed in aggregate U.S. data.     Contract theory has contributed

a good deal to the understanding of a variety of phenomena in the labor market, most

notably temporary layoffs, but has not so far fulfilled its original promise of

explaining the cyclical behavior of employment.



5.   Wage Rigidity and the Denial of the Labor Supply Function

      Economists have not yet produced a theory of the transmission of monetary
                                      -24-


shocks to employment and output which is based on realistic hypotheses of the

optimal behavior of individuals.   The result is a dramatic split between those

who conclude that we know almost nothing about business cycles and what to do

about them (Barro (1979) and Lucas and Sargent (1978Â»    against the proponents

of the view that nominal wages are rigid and employment is frequently off the

labor supply functions of workers (Gordon (1976Â».     The debate is all the more

intense because wage rigidity leads directly to activist policy--if the labor

market won't clear by itself, it can be kept in balance by adroit manipulation

of the money supply.

     It is unnecessary to elaborate upon the point that wage rigidity and the

denial of labor supply are sufficient to explain the phenomena that concern this

paper.   The textbook IS-LM model together with any sensible empirical Phillips

cur.ve easily rationalizes all of the empirical findings reported here:    Exogenous

demand drives up output and interest rates because the LM curve slopes upward and

the IS curve shifts upward.   Money has a strong influence on real output and em-

ployment Lecause it shifts the LM curve horizontally.    The great majority of

practical economists will continue to use this.model to understand the operation

of the economy.   No econometric test has so far shown them to be wrong.

     What is troublesome about this second positiDn is the utter irrationality

it seems to attribute to employment arrangements.    It ronounts to nothing less

than a revocation of the law of supply and demand.    In the short run, preferences

about work and time away from work are- ignored in the determination of employment--

only the concerns of employers matter.   In a recession or a boom, workers are

pushed far off their labor supply functions.   Labor supply influences the economy

only in the rather long run established by the very flat empirical Phillips curve.
                                        -25-



The central problem is not the explanation of wage rigidity per se, but of the

unilateral determination of employment by employers who are free to maximize

profit subject to the given nominal wage.      The rational worker or group of wor-

kers who granted an employer the right to unilateral employment determination

would be careful to set up an agreement that respected its labor supply function

(Hall and Lilien (1980)).     Such an arrangement should not be vulnerable in any

serious way to nominal shocks.     Some further aspects 6f this issue are treated

in the next section.

     Arthur Okun (1975) has written one of the most thoughtful discussions of

wage and price rigidity.     It gives a convincing rationale for long-term relations

between buyers and sellers in a variety of markets.      In these markets, the al-

ternative of repetitive auctions or spot negotiation of the terms of sales or

employment would be more costly than long-term arrangements.      But Okun and the

authors who have argued in this vein are less convincing as to why the upshot

of these arrangements is to predetermine wages or prices and let the buyer de-

termine qaantity unilarerally.     I am aware of no important commercial contracts

with these proviBions.     Rather, the typical formal contract predetermines both

price and quantity.    Such contracts cannot explain the mystery of large fluctu-

ations of output in response to nominal influences.      In more informal arrangements

where prices are apparently stabilized (as, for example, in the copper market),

sellers are actively involved in determining quantity, and the arrangements

stabilize output as well as price.     In the labor market, long-term relations tend

to convert labor into a fixed factor, as suggested by Oi (1962).      Again, employ-

ment as much as wages is stabilized by this influence.      The theory of long-term

relations or implicit contracts has some important implications for interpreting
                                         -26-



aggregate data, but does not seem to provide a coherent explanation of the

hypothesis that the level of employment frequently departs from the labor supply

function because of the rigidity of wages.



6.    Unilateral Determination of Employment by Employers

       Though the simple hypothesis of unilateral employment determination by

employers subject to a rigid nominal wage has escaped successful rationalization,

it does seem to be a fact that employers have more to say in the short run about

employment than do workers.      Instead of consulting the relevant prices, wages,

and interest rates to decide how much time to spend in the labor market, workers

simply show up for their jobs every day and do whatever work is available.        When

business is strong, employers ask for and receive extra effort from their workers;

lu   some cases they pay for it through overtime hours and sometimes it is just part

of the job.      In times of slack, employers unilaterally depress hours of work

through temporary layoffs, reduced work weeks, and so on.      Even outside the

~lue-colla~     industrial sector where provisions for varying annual hours of work

are highly formalized, it is clear that employers expect more from workers in

times of brisk demand than in times of slack.      By and large, it is employers,

not workers, who actually make decisions about the volume of work.

        Under an employment contract, a worker may grant to the employer the right

      determine the level of employment, subject to limitations spelled out in the

     ntract.   Herbert Simon (1957) was one of the first to investigate such contracts.

     voluminous recent literature examines contracts where employers bear the risk

 ;Â£ temporary fluctuations in demand; under these contracts, efficiency generally

:..equires that employers vary the level of employment even though compensation is

     rtain or nearly certain (see Calvo and Phelps (1977Â».    Part of the original
                                        -27-



motivation for this line of research was the belief that contracts could provide

an explanation for wage rigidity--put most precisely, an explanation for the

apparent ability of purely nominal shocks to affect the level of employment and

output.     Though there is still a serious question whether this explanation is

successful, the idea of contracts where workers grant the power of employment

determination to employers is an important one and is not at all linked to wage-

rigidity theory.

        Within theories based on intertemporal substitution, employment contracts

could arise because employers have better information about the value of work at

different points in the business cycle than do workers.     Though markets with

sensitively varying wages and interest rates could induce the efficient pattern

of work, it is better from the point of view of managing information for employers

tP determine the pattern of work unilaterally.     When there is more work to do,

employers will ask their workers to work harder and longer, and the workers will

cooperate even though it costs them foregone time at home because their long-term

contract is attractive.     If employers act properly, they will   simulate the market

by equating the lnarginal product of labor to the marginal value of time.     Of course,

all the standard problems in the theory of labor contracts interfere with this

process--employers can cheat workers by asking them to work long hours too fre-

quently, workers can default by quitting, and so on.

        This line of thought may also help explain cyclical fluctuations in labor

productivity.     It is a notorious contradiction of the theory of production functions

that the same factors produce more output when demand is strong than when it is

weak.

        Unilateral determination of employment by employers and the consequent

"involuntary" nature of employment reductions do not by themselves tell us that
                                        -28-



only demand matters in determining employment.     One of the important contri-

butions of contract theory is to help understand how unilateral actions by

employers can respect the labor supply functions of workers.



7.   Unemployment

        Many critics of theories where employment is always on the labor supply

function find them at odds with the facts about unemployment.        If a recession

is just a period when people recognize that lower levels of work are appropriate,

why is it accompanied by a bulge in the number of people who are looking for work?

        Part of the answer comes immediately from what is known about temporary lay-

offs.     About a third of the increase in the unemployed during a recession have

not lost their jobs, but are on furlough as part of the process of diminished

total work effort.     A reduction in effort has three components:    less intensive

work each hour, short hours of work each week, and fewer weeks each year.        Those

on layof.f as part of the last component are counted as unemployed even though

they sti11 have jobs, a fact pointed out by Martin Feldstein (1975).       However,

the remaining two-thirds of the increase during a recession are truly jobless.

The great majority of them have lost jobs through permanent layoff; the rest of

the increase consists of people who have just entered the labor force and are

taking longer than usual to find work.     None of the increase in the unemployed

cJrnes from job-quitters.

        Labor contracts can explain the narrow issue of the active role of employers

and the passive role of workers in the process of reducing total labor supply,

it seems to me.     A contract that provides for unilateral action by employers in

terminating the employment relationship when the marginal value of workers' time

threatens to exceed the marginal product of labor makes good sense.       We are not
                                       -29-



surprised that a shift in the composition of demand away from one sector causes

employers in that sector to lay workers off, and the same principle ought to apply

in the aggregate.

     The harder issue is the explanation of the strong tendency for the population

to spend a larger fraction of its time looking for work in times of slack.      Why

does the duration of the typical spell of unemployment lengthen from six weeks

in normal times to eight weeks in a recession?     This question may have an answer

somewhere in the micro economic theory of job search--indeed, I have made one at-

tempt in this direction by looking at the widening of wage differentials that

occurs during a recession (Hall (1975)).      Still, the lack of a convincing, complete

account of the cyclical behavior of unemployment is a serious weakness of existing

theories which respect labor supply.



8.   Concluding Remarks

     We have made important bits of progress in understanding the effects of

economic fluctuations within the labor market, without really solving the central

problem.   The pure jntertemporal substitution theory establishes the principle

that employment can fluctuate even in an ideal economy--there is not necessarily

a "natural" level of employment.   An attempt to understand the movements of

employment in the postwar U.S. economy in terms of the pure model yields sensible

results.   However, very strong results contradicting monetary neutrality reveal

the inadequacy of the pure substitution model.     A consistent theory of monetary

nonneutrality has been advocated by Robert Lucas and others, but there are ques-

tions about the informational assumptions that underlie it.      The long-standing

theory of wage rigidity and determination of employment by demand alone is fully

capable of explaining observed movements of the economy.     But it amounts to a
                                     -30-



denial of labor supply in the short run.    No good rationalization for this gross

departure from standard economic postulates has yet been offered.

     In view of our lack of a complete account of fluctuations in the labor

market, it is no surprise that major disagreements persist within the profession.

The intellectual case for wage rigidity and the irrelevance of labor supply is

an uneasy one, but most practical economists are more persuaded by the evidence

of the disproportionate role of demand in short-run fluctuations than they are

by existing theories that respect the labor supply function.    They will continue

to believe in the efficacy, and perhaps in the desirability, of active counter-

cyclical policy until a much more convincing theory based on labor supply is

developed and tested.
