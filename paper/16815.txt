Pride Goes Before a Fall: Federal Reserve Policy and Asset Markets

                                              ABSTRACT

Considerable debate rages about whether Federal Reserve policy was too lax in the early part of the
2000s, thereby fueling the home-price bubble that was the proximate cause of the global financial
crisis. We present evidence that the view that modest alterations to monetary policy have vast consequences
is inconsistent with theory and not supported by evidence. We take a close look at the responses of
asset markets to changes in the short-term policy interest rate since the founding of the Fed in 1914.
Changes in the federal funds rate have no systematic effect on either long-term interest rates or housing
prices over nearly a century. Indeed, since the mid-1990s the policy rate had a negative relationship
with long-term interest rates. This is consistent with a global view of capital markets where massive
cross-border flows shape the availability of domestic credit and asset prices. The evidence casts doubts
on arguments that a moderately different monetary policy path might have mattered.

       The Federal Reserve’s conduct of monetary policy casts a spell over market participants,

commentators, and academics. The pages of financial newspapers parse subtle differences

among the comments of Fed officials and delve deeply into potentially multiple meanings of

official statements. Academic discussions argue that the path of the policy rate may (as in

Taylor, 2009) or may not (as in Bernanke, 2010, and Greenspan, 2010) have fueled a home-price

bubble in the United States.

       The view that modest alterations to monetary policy have vast consequences for national

economies would seem to be inconsistent with theory and evidence. Most modern economic

models (represented authoritatively by Woodford, 2005) offer limited scope for policy surprises.

The basic logic is that spending depends on decisions capitalized over the longer term, and small

perturbations in the level of the short-term interest rate do not matter much to those values. More

fundamentally, the prominence accorded to authorities controlling nominal magnitudes seems to

undervalue the resilience of market economies, which are supposed to be efficient in grinding

out appropriate relative prices so as to employ resources efficiently. In other words, if central

bankers are crucial to moderating the operations of capitalist economies, then capitalist

economies may have serious drawbacks.

       We will argue that this fascination with the Fed is also at odds with the evidence by

taking a close look at the responses of asset markets to changes in the short-term interest rate

since the founding of the Fed in 1914. In fact, there are apparent effects on either long-term

interest rates or housing prices. We will also show that the policy rate more recently had no

systematic relationship with long-term interest rates. A global view of capital markets casts

doubt on those arguing that a different policy path might have crucially mattered.




                                                 1
        The conclusion is similarly wary of outsized expectations of monetary policy makers and

explains why pride goes before a fall.

        Saying that modest changes in monetary policy would not matter much does not imply

that monetary policy makers are irrelevant. They can do great ill by losing the story line and

forgetting their role in providing a stable backdrop of price stability. Small mistakes also

cumulate. Easy monetary policy from 2002 to 2006, as well as a lack of sensitivity to the dangers

posed by the build-up of credit, contributed to the over-valuation of financial assets and the

subsequent crisis. Predictability in monetary policy encouraged short-termism in financial

markets. But were we able to walk back the path that the world took, changes to supervision and

regulation would most likely loom larger still in shaping economic outcomes in the 2000s.

The limits of monetary policy in theory

        Two properties of most macroeconomic models are especially relevant to the conduct of

monetary policy. First, spending and pricing decisions are assumed to be based on long-term

assessments of real income and real rates of return. Second, changes in monetary policy can

only change real interest rates temporarily. Ultimately, the forces of productivity and thrift

determine them, not changes in nominal magnitudes on the central bank balance sheet.1

Combining the two propositions implies that the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy, as long as

it stays within the narrow range of experience, would not be expected to have a significant or

long-lasting imprint on markets or activity.

        John Taylor (2009), among others, demurs in that view. In particular, the Federal

Reserve is held to have systematically run policy too loose from around 2002 to 2006, which

encouraged the housing boom and the related financial market excesses. However, the


1
 Obviously, this is a source of debate among economists. We follow the textbook presentation along the lines of
Woodford (2005). Akerlof and Shiller (2009) provide a stark counterpoint.

                                                        2
deviations from Taylor’s preferred policy were modest. Such sensitivity of outcomes to those

misses is hard to square with the propositions that the Fed can only keep the short real rate low

for a limited time and that it is long-term values that matter.

       An example can make the point clearer. Finance theory posits that a capital asset is

valued as the present value of expected future income. Such assets include homes, long-term

government and corporate debt instruments, and durable goods, but stock prices are the simplest

to model (as explained in Shiller, 1989). With equities, the income comes in the form of

dividends, and the discount factor is the real short-term interest rate plus a risk premium.

As shown in the memo items of Table 1, from 1914 to 2006, the real one-year risk free rate

(using the one-year Treasury rate less the year-ahead percent change in consumer prices as the

proxy) averaged about 1-1/4 percent, equities gave a return in excess of that of about 7-1/8

percent, and real dividends expanded 1-1/8 percent per annum. Calculating the present value

of equities at those historical averages is straightforward.

       The entries of Table 1 assess how those present values change if the real interest rate

were one percentage point higher than its long-term average. As the shaded area in the bottom

row attests, a permanent increase in real rates has a powerful effect on capitalized values,

ranging from hits of 13 percent (if the equity premium matched its average) to 78 percent (if the

equity premium were zero). It is results such as this that creates the perception that the Fed has a

powerful lever on the economy.

       But the prior from theory is that the Fed’s ability to raise real interest rates is fleeting, at

best. Hence, the upper rows of the table are more relevant. Those entries provide the effects on

present values if the real interest rate is kept higher by one percentage point for the time (in

years) given in the row stub. As is evident, tighter policy that succeeded in raising real rates for

as long as three years would knock from 1 to 3 percent from the capital value of assets. To view

this as a source of policy leverage that could materially and exclusively changed events of the

past few years is to assume implicitly that the economy is not well anchored by real phenomena.

The limits of monetary policy in practice

       If the Federal Reserve served a critical role in stabilizing the economy, then presumably

it should leave a systematic imprint in financial markets. The data from Shiller (1989 and 2005)

provides a helpful resource for testing this proposition, giving long time series on Treasury

yields, equity and house prices, and consumer prices. The green line in the upper panel of Figure

1 plots annual observations on the one-year Treasury rate over the existence of the Federal

Reserve, from 1914 to 2010, from the Shiller dataset.

       We coded these observations, with year-on-year increases of more than ¼ percentage

point representing a tightening, decreases of more than ¼ percentage point representing an

easing, and variations in the ½ percentage point range bracketing zero representing no change.

The bars in the lower part of Figure 1 show the results, with 1 and -1 corresponding,

respectively, tightening and easing of monetary policy. This simple rule accords surprisingly

                                                  5
well with narrative information of policy decisions. For instance, the dating from Federal

Reserve correspondence of the tightening cycle from 1988 to 1992 in Reinhart and Simin (1997)

matches the rule-based characterization. There are about an equal number of easing and

tightening episodes (20 of the former and 21 of the latter), which also about split up equally the

years of the Fed’s existence. In about one-fifth of the years, the policy stance did not differ

materially from the year before.2

         The five panels of Figure 2 show the cumulative frequency distributions over the

tightening and easing policy stances for nominal short- and long-term yields and the one-year

realized nominal returns on long-term Treasuries, the S&P 500 Composite equity index, and

home prices.3 As is evident and reassuring to the policy identification strategy, the tightening

regimes (the blue sold line) are associated with a higher short-term rate than the easing regimes

(the red dashed line). But there are no significant differences in the outcomes for long-term

Treasuries and home prices. Equity markets do produce outsized returns in tightening episodes.

We may be observing the policy reaction function of monetary policy restraint in a booming

share market, not a changed inducement to hold equities for different policy rates.

  An alternative identification scheme is to code unchanged years as a continuation of the prior stance. Nothing that
follows would change had we adopted that rule.
3
  Redoing the figure for real returns produces identical results.

       Asserting that monetary policy restraint would be associated with a notable constriction

of asset prices is evidently inconsistent with the Fed’s history. Of course, there are many

problems associated with categorizing outcomes. Keeping in mind the “post hoc, propter hoc”

argument made famous by Tobin (1970), the results are silent as to causation. Additionally, a

policy instrument guided optimally to offset the effects of random and exogenous shocks of the

goal variable will not be correlated with the goal variable. But the variables shown in Figure 2

are part of the transmission mechanism and intermediate to the goal of monetary policy. That is,

they are part of channels through which policy affects the goal and apparently almost all

systematically unrelated to the stance of policy.

The forgotten open economy

       The lack of association between the stance of policy and key financial market outcomes

is not an artifact of our near-century-long comparison. Consider the upper panel of Figure 3,

which plots monthly observations of the overnight federal funds rate, the ten-year Treasury yield,

and the rate on thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages from 1972, around the collapse of the Bretton

Woods exchange rate system, onward. For the first quarter-century of the sample, interest rates

moved closely together.

       The two lines in the bottom panel plot the simple correlation of the changes in the ten-

year Treasury yield and the mortgage rate with changes in the federal funds rate over a five-year

moving window. As is evident, these correlations were typically close to one-half. In the latter

parts of the 1990s, something happened and these correlations dropped off sharply. Indeed, for

the whole of the period when it is asserted that the Fed kept financial conditions too

accommodative, the policy rate and the most important market yield were negatively related

(also see Greenspan, 2010, for a related analysis).

            There are many potential explanations for this lack of association and the limited scope

for the Fed to have sharply altered the course of the past few years. The most plausible one to us

is that analysts often focus too intently on the domestic economy. Probably the most dramatic

set of events for emerging market economies in the late 1990s was the Asian financial crises of

1997 to 1998. The crises were cathartic for authorities in that region, who apparently as a result

put a very high premium on assuring a reliable export market by managing their U.S. dollar

exchange rates and building up foreign exchange reserves.



                                                                    9
        The result was a sharp pickup in reserve accumulation, shown for emerging market and

developing economies in Figure 4. The bars provide the dollar amounts of annual additions to

reserves, which peaked at $1-1/4 trillion in 2007. As shown by the line, authorities in these

economies were willing to direct the equivalent of around 4 to 7-1/2 percent of their nominal

incomes to reserve accumulation. Indeed, as the housing bubble inflated from 2002 to 2006,

these economies accumulated $2-1/4 trillion of reserves or an average of 4-1/2 percent of their

GDP. Statistics from the International Monetary Fund indicate that about two-thirds of those

purchases were directed to U.S. dollar obligation.4

        This willing funding by foreign official accounts altered the composition of finance and

kept the level of long-term interest rates in the United States low. First, as for the compositional

effect, foreign official entities loaded up on U.S. government securities, leaving private demands

unmet. Into this void, financial engineers constructed AAA-rated dollar exposure by using

housing collateral to create mortgage-backed securities and collateralized-mortgage obligations.

The top tiers of those payment flows were rated by the rating agencies as triple-AAA, meeting

the need, particularly, of foreign banks that were desirous of those securities’ special treatment

under the Basel II capital rules.

                                  This posed a problem for the investment banks that put in motion the process of financial

engineering. Underwriting these complicated securities to meet the demand of foreigners for

AAA-rated credit left them with bits and pieces of securities on the cutting-room floor. This

unwanted residue of their own underwritings represented highly leveraged bets on the U.S.

housing market that proved difficult to remove from their balance sheets.

                                  The second main consequence of these global savings was to keep U.S. long-term interest

rates lower than they would have been otherwise. Any analyst pointing to Federal Reserve

policy as augmenting the housing boom must first address how the Federal Reserve might have

had the leverage to do so. In the event, the simple correlation from 2002 to 2006 between its

policy instrument and the rate that matters for housing activity was negative and statistically

insignificant from zero. Perhaps this reduced-form coefficient represented a concatenation of

partials effects that in their deep structure allowed the Fed some leeway. But perhaps not, or

perhaps not in a manner than would have yielded predictable results.

Conclusion

           In an open economy, the central bank has less scope to influence the path of globally

traded financial assets. Thus, the lack of association between the stance of policy and the longer-

term rates that matter for spending—either broadly stated over the past century or narrowly

focused on the past decade—should not come as a surprise. This does not, however, absolve the

Fed from all responsibility.

           The free flow of international capital irons out yield differentials across world markets by

facilitating the exchange of financial obligations. Thus, signals from the market about domestic

imbalances are not in prices but rather in quantities. And there were signals. In particular, the

benign mortgage rate environment of the 2000s was associated with a marked scaling up of

household liabilities. As shown in Figure 5, the total liabilities of the U.S. household sector rose

about 25 percentage points of nominal income from 2002 to 2006, virtually all of which was

accounted for by mortgages.

           The leverage of households was rationalized at the time by the strong equity component

of balance sheets—the housing equity component. The more than 20 percentage point decline in

owners’ equity (the solid line) commencing in 2005 showed the fragility of those underpinnings.

As we demonstrated in Reinhart and Reinhart (2010), a distinct leverage cycle similar recurred in

the fifteen most severe financial crises of the past century.5




5   Geanakoplos (2010) makes a forceful argument for recognizing the importance of the leverage cycle.

                               The United States, by the way, was not alone. Figure 6 plots the annual pairs of the

growth of domestic credit and nominal GDP for 11 advanced economies from 2000 to 2009.

About three-quarters of the observations lie above the 45 degree line, implying sustained and

widespread reliance on leverage. This suggests another avenue that has been unexplored by

those criticizing Fed policy. Many other economies had systemic banking crises and fell into

recession. Some of them had their own currency and an independent monetary policy (Iceland

and the United Kingdom), and some did not have their own currency and a monetary policy

dictated by a foreign capital (Ireland and Spain). How could Fed decisions been so central to all

those shared dislocations? Moreover, none of the major economies that exhibit a “fear of

floating” as in the Calvo and Reinhart (2002) and have to keep their domestic monetary policies

aligned with the Fed had systemic banking crises. Why did the problems attendant to easy

monetary policy, asserted to be central to our imbalances, stop at our borders?




                                                                       13
                        The historical record does not provide a platform to support an outsized role for the

Federal Reserve in avoiding the financial crisis. But as financial market prices tend to overshoot,

so too do reputations. The fall in the Fed’s standing in the past few years owes importantly to a

correction of its build-up in the years before. In part, putting the Fed pride of place in explaining

the Great Moderation left its reputation vulnerable when the economy left its sweet spot. After

all, pride does go before a fall.
