What's Wrong with Pittsburgh? Delegated Investors and Liquidity Concentration

                                         ABSTRACT

What makes an asset institutional-quality? This paper proposes that one reason is the existing
concentration of delegated investors in a market through a liquidity channel. Consistent with this
intuition, it documents differences in investor composition across US cities and shows that
delegated investors concentrate investments in cities with higher turnover. It then calibrates a
search model showing how heterogeneity in liquidity preferences makes some markets more
liquid even when assets have identical cash flows. The calibration indicates that commercial real
estate commands an illiquidity premium of two percentage points annually relative to a perfectly
liquid asset with similar credit risk.

1       Introduction

As Table 1 shows, delegated investors don't find Pittsburgh attractive. While the share
of commercial real estate (CRE) purchases by delegated investors averages 24% across US
cities, it is a mere 14% in Pittsburgh. What makes Pittsburgh so much less attractive than
other cities? More generally, what makes some assets appropriate for delegated managers
and not others?
        This paper argues that one reason delegated managers focus on some assets is the
concentration of other institutions in that market. I start from the observation that some
types of investors trade frequently while others are more likely to be buy-and-hold investors.
The key intuition is that investors that value liquidity the most concentrate their investments
in the most liquid markets. In so doing, they give up an illiquidity premium. Thus, concern
for liquidity segments markets by investor type. The market segmentation in turn makes the
most liquid markets even more liquid because the main asset owners are those that trade
relatively more frequently. To the extent that delegated managers are more likely to have
higher illiquidity needs than direct investors, an asset's attractiveness to delegated mangers
depends on the existing concentration of delegated managers in an asset.
        This paper provides evidence on the relationship between investor composition and
trade frequency in CRE consistent with this explanation. I use a dataset on all commercial
property transactions in 39 cities over the 2001-2015 period that enables classification of
purchasers by type and, in particular, identification of delegated investors. In the CRE
market, investors managing their own money are more likely to play the role of buy-and-hold
investors than are delegated investors.1 Consistent with delegated investors having relatively
more need for liquidity, they have shorter holding periods than non-delegated investors (i.e.,
direct investors) on average. Controlling for property characteristics, year of purchase, and
the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) of the property, delegated investors on average hold
properties about one year less than direct investors. The difference is most pronounced for
private equity funds but is also statistically significant for investment managers and banks.

   I treat Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) separately from other delegated investors because REITs
must satisfy statutory minimum holding period requirements to be eligible for tax-exempt status.

Notes: 1) delshare is the share of commercial real estate transactions made by delegated investors. 2) In
columns (1)-(3) and (5), the shares are based on the identity of the buyer in the transaction; in column (4),
the share is based on the identity of the seller in the transaction. 3) Delegated investors are entities that
primarily manage money on behalf of others and include banks, pension funds, investment managers, and
private equity funds. 4) sharereit is the share of purchases made by Real Estate Investment Trusts
(REITs). 5) Shares are by $ volume not number of transactions. 6) Data for all cities except Pittsburgh
and San Antonio covers 2001-2015. Data for Pittsburgh and San Antonio covers 2002-2015 and 2007-2015,
respectively.



                                                     2
       Furthermore, a CRE purchase is more likely to be made by a delegated than a direct
investor in markets with higher turnover even after controlling for property-level character-
istics and the economic fundamentals of an MSA. A one standard deviation increase in the
trade frequency in an MSA increases the likelihood the purchaser is a delegated investor by
about 6%. Consistent with these transaction-level results, the share of delegated investors
among all investors is higher in markets with more trade frequency. Finally, dividend yields
are higher in markets with less trade frequency consistent with assets in such markets com-
manding illiquidity premia.
       The paper considers several competing explanations for delegated investors' choice
of cities. Most prominently, delegated investors have a preference for what are known as
`credit tenants'. That is, delegated investors want to own buildings where the tenants are
publicly listed firms such that they are effectively exposed to cash flow risk similar to that
of a corporate bond. To consider differences in the concentration of publicly listed firms
across cities, I use detailed establishment-level employment data to compute the share of
employment in a city of publicly listed firms. There is a relationship between the importance
of publicly listed firms and the share of purchases made by delegated investors at the MSA-
level. However, at the level of an individual transaction, there is no relationship between
the share of employment by publicly listed firms and whether the transaction is made by a
delegated investor. There is also strong MSA-level evidence that delegated investors prefer
cities with higher shares of college-educated workers. I also find that, within an MSA,
increases in trade frequency over time are associated with a higher delegated investor share.
       The paper then calibrates the directed search model of Vayanos and Wang (2007),
which features investors that are heterogeneous in the frequency with which they receive
valuation shocks, to the US CRE market. The model illustrates how market segmentation by
liquidity preference amplifies cross-market differences in liquidity. The model can replicate
the large differences in trade frequency across cities and modest difference in cap rates.
Quantitatively, the model generates an illiquidity premium for investing in US CRE of about
two percentage points per year.
       The findings illustrate that there is path dependence in what different types of in-

                                              3
vestors consider investible. Many delegated managers express a desire to increase their
allocations to alternative asset classes but then assert that such product does not exist. One
characteristic of the asset that makes it institutional quality is in fact the concentration of
other institutions in that market due to the implications for liquidity of investor composition.
As such, the findings in this paper suggest that it will be difficult for delegated investors to
rapidly change their allocations to alternatives including real estate. This difficulty in in-
creasing allocations to alternatives may lead to even further increases in the share of publicly
traded equities held by institutional investors.2
        The results also suggest that there may be path dependence in the development of
cities to the extent that delegated investors have preferences over property characteristics
other than liquidity. Delegated investors tend to purchase larger properties than direct
investors, for example, and, within an MSA, buy higher-quality properties. Initial differences
in a city's investor base may thus manifest in long-term differences in a city's urban design
and, thus, the types of households and firms in a city. Stein (1989) highlights the inefficiency
that may result from managers' short-termism. Recent work on publicly traded firms has
also shown that investors with shorter holding periods invest in firms less committed to social
and environmental responsibility (Starks et al. (2018)). It is thus plausible that the shorter
expected holding periods of delegated investors in a city may lead them to shy away from
long-term investments in a city's infrastructure and work force.
        While I focus on the model of Vayanos and Wang (2007), the intuition that liquidity
begets liquidity appears in other theories of OTC markets. For example, the models of
Admati and Pfleiderer (1988) and Pagano (1989) generate such a prediction and Biais and
Green (2007) discuss how endogenous liquidity has led to bonds usually trading OTC since
the mid-20th century.3 More recently, Chang (2018) presents a model where submarkets
with different trade frequencies arise endogenously as a result of heterogeneity in traders'
holding costs.
   2
     See Andonov and Rauh (2018) regarding pension funds' allocations to real estate and non-real estate
private equity. Koijen and Yogo (Forthcoming) show that the share of publicly traded equities held by
institutions rose from 35% in the 1980-1984 period to 68% in the 2015-2017 period.
   3
     Plante (2017) nevertheless shows that there would be significant welfare gains to moving corporate bond
trading to an exchange-traded platform.


                                                     4
       Finally, the paper adds to a body of work that explains facts about real estate markets
using search and matching models. While a number of papers have used search and matching
models to understand the housing market (see Han and Strange (2015) for a summary of
early literature), the only other papers that study the CRE market using a search and
matching model are Sagi (2017) and Badarinza et al. (2018). While Sagi (2017) explains
the returns on individual properties with a search model, the current paper aims to explain
heterogeneity across cities in CRE trade volumes and investor composition. Badarinza et al.
(2018) uses a search model to quantify how search frictions arising from differences in investor
nationality affect cross-border capital flows. Instead of studying the effects of heterogeneity
in nationality, I study the effects of heterogeneity in the frequency of valuation shocks.
       The next section of the paper describes the data in detail including differences in
the types of properties that delegated investors, direct investors, REITs, and small investors
purchase. Section 3 shows that, relative to direct investors, delegated investors have shorter
holding periods and purchase properties in higher turnover markets. Section 4 calibrates
the Vayanos and Wang (2007) model to the US CRE market to explain the aforementioned
facts. Section 5 concludes and discusses potential future research.



2     Data and Investor Type Classification

2.1    CRE Transactions Data

The data covers 2001-2015 for 39 US MSAs. 2001 is the first year for which Real Capital
Analytics (RCA) has transactions data. It includes all cities and years for which data on
transactions and the stock of CRE are available that can also be merged to Census data
using a standardized definition of an MSA. In some cases (e.g., South Florida), the data
provider's definition of a market cannot be matched to a standard MSA definition making it
difficult to merge the data with other data sources and I exclude such cities. RCA provided
data on every purchase transaction in these 39 cities in industrial, retail, and office property.
The sample of 115,734 observations covers more than 99% of CRE transactions in these cities



                                               5
over 2001-2015.4
        A key advantage of the RCA data relative to, for example, deeds records, is RCA's
ownership information. RCA standardizes buyer names and invests substantial resources in
identifying the true buyer behind a transaction with a legal identity that is perhaps only
an LLC that is not obviously linked to the actual owner. I classify purchases by buyers
who made less than five purchases over the entire sample period simply as SMALL due to
difficulties in accurately classifying such buyers. Buyers who make less than five purchases
account for approximate 53% of all transactions by number but only 26% of transactions by
dollar amount. Buyers with five or more transactions make a total of 54,600 transactions.
        The data RCA provided contained the variables BuyerCapGroup1 and SellerCapGroup1
that classified buyers and sellers into groups such as "Institutional", "Private", and "Pub-
lic". These variables assisted with the classification but were not sufficiently detailed for
this study since, for example, many private firms are delegated asset managers. I clas-
sify each buyer into one of the following nine types of investors: Banks (BANK), De-
veloper/Owner/Operators (DEVOWNOP), Investment Managers (INVM), Private Equity
Funds (PEFU), REITs (REIT), Pension Funds (PENS), Users (USER), Real Estate Operat-
ing Companies (REOC), and Other (OTH). I follow RCA in grouping Developer/Owner/Operators
into a single category, DEVOWNOP, as firms often undertake one or more of these functions
and it is difficult to clearly distinguish between the three categories.
        In the case of BANK, REIT, PENS, and REOC, the classification is fairly unambigu-
ous. The distinction between DEVOWNOP and INVM or PEFU is whether the entity is
managing its own funds or those of other parties. The reason for this distinction is that the
friction that gives delegated investors shorter holding periods is an agency friction between
investors and managers. There is some ambiguity in whether to classify an entity as INVM

     The sample RCA provided contained 116,307 observations which are all purchases of CRE in the 39
markets in industrial, retail, and office property over 2001-2015. This sample excludes entity-level purchases
(i.e., property company mergers, approximately 3000 observations) and observations in which the interest
conveyed was not 100% (approximately 4000 observations). 549 observations had missing data on the
number of square feet. Excluding these observations reduced the sample size to 115,758. Of the remaining
observations, 23 had a price per square foot of less than $1 suggesting the transactions were not arms-length
and one observation had a property size of just 8 square feet suggesting a data entry error. Deleting these
observations resulted in a dataset of 115,734 observations.

or PEFU but, as both are delegated investors, the distinction does not matter for most of
the analysis in this paper. I categorize entities that have multiple business lines and cannot
be clearly categorized as either a DEVOWNOP or INVM/PEFU as OTH.
        Figure 1 provides the shares of purchases made by each category of investors at the
national level aggregated across all years, i.e., when I aggregate the data set across all 39
cities in the sample. The shares shown are based on the dollar volume of transactions,
not the number of transactions. The single largest category is DEVOWNOP at 27% of all
purchases. PEFU and INVM combined account for an additional 21% while REITs purchase
15% of property. Users account for an additional 2% of transactions while banks purchased
4%. Pension funds' direct purchases constitute only 2% of purchases each with the Other
category accounting for less than 1%.5


Delegated Investors

I group investors into four categories: delegated investors, direct investors, REITs, and
small investors. I hypothesize that delegated investors have shorter holding periods than
direct investors because of agency frictions. Because principals cannot observe the effort
and skill level of managers, they require managers to dispose of the investments in a timely
fashion.6 The information asymmetry is especially acute in commercial real estate because of
the heterogeneity in properties and the infrequency with which properties trade. Delegated
investors may also have to dispose of a property before receiving all of their compensation
from the principal. Given large discrepancies between appraisal and transaction prices (see
Cannon and Cole (2011)), it's not feasible to compensate managers based on appraisal values.
I separate REITs from other delegated investors because REITs have long holding periods
by statute; see M¨
                 uhlhofer (2019) regarding REIT holding period constraints being binding. I
   5
     The share of CRE purchases by pension funds may seem small. The share shown only captures invest-
ments in which the pension fund is the owner of record such that it excludes many joint ventures as well as
any indirect CRE investment by pension funds. See Andonov et al. (2015) for additional discussion of the
CRE investments of pension funds.
   6
     Chakraborty and Ewens (2018) provide evidence from venture capital firms of agents delaying revealing
negative information. Such agency conflicts necessitate contracts that incentivize delegated managers to
dispose of investments in a timely fashion. Stein (1989) discusses several possible reasons delegated managers
may have greater liquidity needs than principals.

consider BANK, PEFU, INVM, and PENS as delegated investors. The remaining non-REIT
investor types I consider direct investors.


Property Characteristics

In addition to the buyer name, transaction price, and square footage, for most properties
RCA provided the year the property was built, and the property's national and local Q-
Scores. The RCA Q-Scores are proprietary measures of a property's relative quality varying
from 1 to 100. They are more detailed alternatives to descriptors such as "Class A" or "Class
C". The "scores incorporate not only physical attributes, but also market and locational
factors". Costello (2017) provides additional discussion of the RCA Q-Scores. I present
the relationship between investor composition and trade frequency both controlling and
not controlling for them. To better understand what types of investors are most likely to
undertake development, I create a variable called development that takes a value of 1 if the
property is less than 1 year old. Finally, office, industrial, and retail are indicator variables
for the property type.
       Table 2 summarizes the property-level variables. Figures 2, 3, 4, and 5 show the
distributions of property size (square footage), property age, and quality across the three
different investor types. Consistent with the summary statistics in Panels B and C of Table 2,
the biggest difference between the types of properties delegated and direct investors purchase
is in size. Properties purchased by delegated investors are about 75,000 square feet larger on
average than properties purchased by direct investors, a difference that is highly statistically
significant in a univariate t-test for the difference in means. Not surprisingly, small investors
overwhelmingly own physically small properties.
       Delegated investors also invest in slightly younger properties on average. On average,
properties purchased by delegated investors are about seven years younger and the difference
is highly statistically significant in a univariate t-test for the difference in means. A fatter
right tail primarily drives the difference in the mean property age between delegated and
direct investors. The difference between the medians is only three years while the difference
rises to 30 years at the 90th percentile. As Table 2 shows, there is no substantial difference

Potential Credit Tenants

A key potential driver of delegated investors' decisions regarding which cities to invest in
is the availability of credit tenants. Credit tenants are generally nationally known publicly
traded firms and delegated investors may have a preference for such tenants because they

can readily show measures of credit-worthiness to their investment boards. The argument is
similar to the `prudent-man' laws Del Guercio (1996) shows affect the choice of equity hold-
ings of institutional investors. I compute the assets of publicly traded firms headquartered in
an MSA in each year from Compustat. I take the natural log of these to get logf irmassets.
       However, the headquarters of a firm is not where all their economic activity takes
place; see Garc´
               ia and Norli (2012). I therefore also use establishment-level employment data
from Your-economy Time Series (YTS) to identify the share of employment in an MSA that is
from publicly traded firms. The underlying data for YTS is the Infogroup Historic Datafiles.
The data is an annual establishment-level time series database that follows companies at their
unique locations across the US. YTS focuses on establishments that are "in-business" in the
sense that it filters out firms that are created for tax purposes or merely holding companies.
Additional details on the YTS data, and how it compares with other establishment-level em-
ployment data, are available at http://bdrc.uwex.edu/downloads/YTSdatadescription.pdf
and http://bdrc.uwex.edu/insights/YTSreview.pdf.
       The YTS data provide linking codes that link establishments to the headquarters
firm. I identify publicly traded firms by whether they have a stock ticker symbol in the
YTS data. Averaging across 2001-2015, the YTS data reveal that about 72% of the average
publicly traded firm's employment is in the same Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA) as the
firm's headquarters. However, the share is much smaller for large firms such that weighting
by total firm employment rather than equally-weighting firms results in a much larger share
of employment outside of a firm's headquarters CBSA. Of all employment in publicly traded
firms, only about 17% is in the same CBSA as the firm's headquarters.
       To get a measure of the availability of credit tenants in an MSA, I aggregate all
the employment in establishments linked to publicly traded firms and divide it by the total
employment in the MSA. I denote this variable pubempshare. Table 3 ranks the cities in
the sample according to the share of employment by publicly traded firms.

Other MSA-Level Economic Fundamentals

I also use the YTS data to measure industry concentration in each city and the overall
level of competitiveness of firms. I measure the industry concentration in each city by
constructing the Herfendahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) using establishment-level employment
in 2-digit NAICS code industries. I term this variable emp HHI . I construct the overall
degree of competition between firms in a city by dividing the total employment in a city by
the number of establishments (estsperemp).
       The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) provides real GDP at the MSA-level from
2001 onwards from which I calculate GDP growth for 2002 onwards. I take the share of
the population with a four-year college degree or more education (college) from the 2005
American Community Survey (ACS). I take the population of the MSA from the 2010 US
Census.


Property Market Variables

RCA also provides data on capitalization (cap) rates. CRE investors use the term cap rate
to refer to the dividend yield of a property. I use these data to calibrate the model of Section
4. CBRE, a major CRE brokerage firm, provides the data on the stock of commercial real
estate by MSA. Information on the stock in Pittsburgh and San Antonio starts only in 2002
and 2007 such that the samples are shorter for these cities. CBRE also provides data on
occupancy rates and rent growth by property type and MSA.



3     Empirical Facts

3.1    Delegated Investors Have Shorter Holding Periods than Di-

       rect Investors

Table 4 provides univariate statistics on holding periods of delegated and direct investors.
For Table 4 only, I code transactions that have not sold by the end of the property as having
a holding period of 15; I recode this as 14 for the Tobit regressions in Table 5. The first panel

                                               17
shows all transactions and illustrates a modest difference in the overall holding periods. On
average, delegated investors hold their properties 0.6 years less. The small difference in the
full sample is largely because most properties have still not sold by the end of the sample.
However, the 25th percentile of the holding period for delegated investors is 6 years which
is two years less than the 25th percentile for direct investors. The second panel includes
only purchases made in 2001-2003, such that there is time for the investor to have sold the
property before the end of the sample. For the 2001-2003 transactions, the median holding
period for delegated investors in 6 years while it is 12 for direct investors.

                Table 4: Holding Periods of Direct and Delegated Investors

       Table 5 shows that delegated investors have shorter holding periods even after control-
ling for which city they invest in, the year of purchase, and various property characteristics.
I also control for the total dollar volume of transactions by the purchaser. The table presents
Tobit regressions of the holding period on whether the purchaser is a delegated investor. The
regression includes all transactions by delegated and direct investors; it excludes transactions
by REITs and SMALL investors.
       The first three columns of Table 5 present results for all years. In column 1, the
only controls are year fixed effects. The coefficient on delegated is -0.64 and statistically
significant at the 1% level. The specification in column 2 adds MSA fixed effects, a full set of
property-level controls, and controls for buyer size. The coefficient is -0.66, very close to the
specification without any controls, and is statistically significant at the 1% level. Column
3 disaggregates delegated into the delegated subcategories invm, pefu, bank, and pens. The
coefficient on pefu is highest at -1.09 while those on invm and bank are about -0.3. All

                                               18
three of these coefficients are statistically significant at the 5% level. The coefficient on pens
is, however, small and statistically insignificant suggesting that pension funds may be less
susceptible to liquidity shocks than other types of delegated managers.
       Column 4 presents the coefficient estimates from the regression when I include only
properties that are sold by the end of the sample. In this specification, I include only
purchases from 2001-2003. The coefficient on delegated falls slightly but remains statistically
significant at the 1% level. As such, the overall effect found in columns 1 - 3 is driven both
by direct investors being less likely to have sold a property by the end of the sample and by
them having held on longer to properties they bought at the beginning of the sample and
have since disposed of.
       The last four columns present results for purchases made in 2001-2003, 2004-2006,
2007-2009, and 2010-2015 separately. In all specifications, the coefficient on delegated is
negative and statistically significant at the 1% level.

3.2     Trade Frequency and Investor Composition

3.2.1    MSA-Level Relationships

Table 1 aggregates the data across years to show how investor type shares range across
MSAs. The table presents the average shares of purchases by delegated investors and REITs
in each MSA over the 2001-2015 period. Delegated investors comprised 39% of purchases in
the Boston metro area but only 10% of purchases in Detroit. Perhaps surprisingly, delegated
investors accounted for less than the median share in the NYC Metro area. While delegated
investors concentrate their purchases in coastal cities, Chicago and Dallas also have high
shares of purchases by delegated investors.
        The second and third columns of Table 1 show the shares of purchases by delegated
investors over the first half and second half of the sample. While the shares change somewhat
over time, there is substantial persistence. Table 6 illustrates this more formally. The table
presents the regression coefficients from a regression of the share in the second half of the
sample on the first half of the sample. The coefficient is 0.58. Perhaps even more striking,
the R2 of 53% shows that a city' historical investor composition explains more than half of
its recent composition.

        Figure 6 illustrates that there is a positive relationship between ownership by dele-
gated investors and trade frequency but does not control for any covariates. As the model
of the next section shows, the causality between investor composition and trade frequency
runs both ways rather than the positive relationship being solely because delegated investors

                                               21
choose markets with higher trade frequency. That is, trade frequency and investor compo-
sition are jointly determined such that a positive relationship between a market's delegated
investor share and trade frequency is an equilibrium outcome. Nevertheless, it is worth con-
sidering a few explanations for the empirical relationship between the share of purchases by
delegated investors and trade frequency other than the one this paper proposes. While an
exhaustive empirical analysis of the determinants of ownership of CRE is beyond the scope
of this paper, I consider several alternative explanations for the relationship in Figure 6.

Notes: 1) Delegated Investor shares for each MSA are averaged over 2001-2015. 2)
Turnover is annual.


       I first explore whether the bivariate relationship in Figure 6 persists at the MSA-
level after controlling for MSA-level characteristics. In addition to preferring credit tenants,


                                              22
delegated investors may concentrate their investments in cities that grow faster. I include
MSA-level GDP growth as well as controls for factors that the urban economics literature
empirically shows predict faster growth in a city over the long run. To the extent that
delegated investors are more sophisticated than direct investors, they may be able to such
long-term winners. Glaeser (2012) argues that the share of the population with a college
degree increases MSA-level growth.7 Glaeser et al. (1992) show empirically that cities with
more variety across industries and cities with more firm-level competition grow more rapidly.
I therefore include college, emp HHI , and estsperemp as control variables.
          The first column of Table 7 controls only for year fixed effects. The coefficient on the
share of property transacting in an MSA, tf , is 1.74 indicating that a one standard deviation
increase in trade frequency is associated with a 6-percentage point increase in the delegated
investor share. The second column controls for year fixed effects, city population, and eco-
nomic fundamentals. The coefficient on tf falls slightly to 1.52 but is still statistically at the
1% level. Instead of proxying for the availability of credit tenants using establishment-level
employment data, column 3 includes the total assets of publicly-traded firms headquartered
in the MSA (logf irmassets). Column 4 adds MSA-level GDP growth as a control which
reduces the sample size by one year since MSA-level GDP is not available until 2001. The
coefficient on GDP growth is negative but far from statistically significant. The coefficient
on tf remains similar to that in columns 1 - 3. The dependent variable in column 5 is the
share of sales by delegated investors instead of the share of purchases. The coefficient falls
to 0.91 but remains statistically significant at the 1% level.
          The economic fundamentals included in columns (1)-(5) control for some MSA-level
characteristics. However, there are many MSA characteristics that may matter to investors
that the regressions do not include. To control for omitted variables specific to a city, I
include MSA fixed effects in the final specification in Table 7. In this specification, I include
a binary variable that takes a value of one if the observation comes from the years 2001-2007
to control for heterogeneity over time. I do not control for year fixed effects since variation
from year-to-year in trade frequency is often idiosyncratic, especially for smaller cities, rather

                                                     23
than indicating persistent differences. Thus, in column 6 the relationship between delegated
investor share and trade frequency is identified off variation between the first and second
half of the sample within an MSA. The coefficient on trade frequency is of similar magnitude
to the benchmark specification in column 2 and remains statistically significant at the 1%
level.
         The results in Table 7 provide some support for the credit tenant hypothesis. The
coefficient on pubempshare is positive and statistically significant at the 10% level. The
magnitude is such that a one percentage point increase in the share of employment in publicly
traded firms increases the delegated investor share by about 0.35 percentage points. Thus,
a one standard deviation increase in pubempshare raises the share of delegated investors by
about 1.2 percentage points. In column 3, the coefficient on logf irmassets is also positive
and statistically significant. The coefficient on college is highly statistically significant in
all specifications indicating that delegated investors concentrate their investments in more
educated cities.


3.2.2    Transaction-Level Evidence that Delegated Investors Choose Higher Trade
         Frequency Cities

I next explore the relation between trade frequency and delegated investors using transactions-
level data. The advantage of this approach is that I can control for property-level charac-
teristics. I therefore run probit and OLS regressions where the dependent variable takes a
value of one if the transaction is made by a delegated investor and zero if the purchase is
that of a direct investor. In particular I estimate,


                        delegated " 0 ` tf measure ` X `                                    (1)


where tf measure is one of three measures of what an individual investor might expect the
trade frequency in a market to be.
         I first consider tf , which is the overall turnover in that year and MSA. Second,
I consider a property-type specific measure, tf avg bytype. The reason for considering a

property-type specific measure is that many investors specialize not just in particular types
of cities but also in particular property types. An investor that focuses on industrial property
likely does not care about the trade frequency of retail in a city. Because there are often
only a few or sometimes no transactions in a particular property type in any particular MSA
in a given year, I average this measure over all years in an MSA-property type. Finally, I
consider a measure of trade frequency that is predetermined, tf avg f irsthalf , and look only
at transactions from the second half of the sample.
       The control variables in X include MSA-level economic fundamentals, MSA-level
property market characteristics, individual property characteristics, quintiles for city size,
quintiles for property size, and quintiles for property age. I include property size controls
because delegated investors, who often need to deploy large amounts of capital and have
limited resources to carefully examine many properties, may focus their investments on
properties where they can deploy a large amount of capital in a single transaction.
       As is known from the bond market (see, for example, Edwards et al. (2007) and
Green et al. (2007)), higher quality assets usually trade more frequently. It is thus possible
that the relationship in Figure 6 merely reflects delegated owners preferring higher quality
assets and those assets also being more liquid. In all specifications, I include controls for
the general state of that MSA's property market using property type-specific measures of
rent growth and occupancy, rentgr bytype and occrate bytype and property age quintiles.
In some specifications, I also include the RCA property-quality controls.
       Table 8 presents the results from estimating equation (1) using a Probit model. The
first three columns present the results without the RCA property-quality measures. Each
column uses a different measure of the trade frequency an investor could expect in an MSA.
In all three specifications, the coefficient on the trade frequency measure is positive and of a
similar magnitude. It is statistically significant for tf and tf avg bytype.
       In Table 8, the coefficients on the MSA-level economic fundamentals are mostly in-
significant in contrast to the MSA-level results in Table 7. The coefficient on college is
usually positive and is statistically significant in columns 2 and 5 consistent with it having
a robust relationship with delegated investor share in Table 7. Rather than credit tenants

not mattering at the individual transaction level, the insignificance of pubempshare is likely
simply due to an MSA's credit tenant base being a weak measure of the share of an individ-
ual building occupied by credit tenants. Unfortunately, detailed tenant data is not readily
available for the universe of commercial properties in the United States.
        In the last three specifications, I include both the local and national property-quality
controls. The sample size shrinks as the property-quality measures are only available for a
subset of transactions. However, the coefficients on the trade frequency measures in columns
4 and 5 are similar to those in columns 1 and 2. The coefficient in column 6 is about twice
the size of the one in column 3. The coefficient on QScoreLocal is positive and statistically
significant at the 1% level indicating that delegated investors choose higher quality properties
within an MSA. They also prefer industrial and office properties relative to retail (the omitted
category).
        Table 9 presents the results from estimating equation (1) by OLS rather than Probit
to both test the robustness of the results and to facilitate interpretation of the coefficients.
The coefficients indicate that a one percentage point increase in trade frequency increases
the likelihood that the transaction is made by a delegated investor by about 0.6 percentage
points. The mean of delegated is 0.34 and, across the 578 MSA-years in the sample, the
standard deviation of trade frequency is 3.2 percentage points. Thus, we can conclude that
a one standard deviation increase in trade frequency in an MSA increases the likelihood that
a delegated investor purchases a property by about 6%. The statistical significance of the
coefficients on the trade frequency measures in Table 9 are very similar to those in Table 8.


3.2.3    Robustness

Market Power Delegated investors, who may be less likely to be local, may shy away from
markets where certain investors have market power due to their size relative to the market.
To the extent that buyer concentration is correlated with trade frequency in a market,
perhaps because delegated investors are more diversified across markets than direct investors,
buyer concentration belongs in X in estimating equation 1. To consider this possibility, I
construct the HHI index of buyers in each city. Table 10 presents the results when I include

this variable. The coefficient on the HHI index is negative but never statistically significant.
More importantly for the present paper, the coefficient on the trade frequency measures are
little changed from the benchmark specifications in Table 8.


Transfer Tax Rates Pittsburgh in particular has unusually high real estate transfer tax
rates. During the 2001-2015 sample period, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia had the highest
real estate transfer tax rates in the sample at 4.0%. In contrast, nine cities had no real
estate transfer taxes and 30 cities had a transfer tax rate of less than 1.0%. While a finding
that delegated investors do not like Pittsburgh because of the high transfer taxes is consis-
tent with them having a higher preference for liquidity, finding that this is the sole reason
investors avoid Pittsburgh is slightly different from the market segmentation story the model
of the next section proposes. Table 11 therefore presents the results of the probit regression
of delegated on the trade frequency measures and the transfer tax rate in that MSA. The co-
efficients on the trade frequency variables are quite similar to in the benchmark specification
while the coefficients on the transfer tax rates are far from statistically significant.8


Outlier Cities Figure 7 explores the robustness of the results to the MSAs included in
the sample. It shows the coefficient on tf avg bytype of the probit regression estimated in
column (2) of Table 8 dropping one MSA at a time. The figure illustrates that the results are
not heavily influenced by any single MSA. All of the coefficients are statistically significant
at the 5% level and are close to the point estimate of 0.017 from the regression with all
thirty-nine MSAs.

    The tax rates used in this analysis combine state-level and any municipal-level taxes and were obtained
by internet search. An appealing idea is to use the transfer tax rates as an instrument for trade frequency.
Unfortunately, the correlation between trade frequency and transfer tax rates is quite low, likely because
there is little variation in transfer tax rates across most cities.

3.3    Trade Frequency and Cap Rates

Figure 8 shows that, in general, cap rates are lower in MSAs in which trade is more frequent.
This is consistent with there being an illiquidity premium for CRE. However, cap rates do
not vary as much across MSAs as turnover does. The range of average cap rates across cities
is only two percentage points. In contrast, average annual turnover across MSAs ranges from
two to nine percent of the stock. While a full analysis of the differences in cap rates across
MSAs is beyond the scope of this paper, the finding that cap rates are higher in cities with
lower trade frequency is consistent with the model below.

4     Explaining the Facts

I explain the facts above by calibrating a version of Vayanos and Wang (2007) to the US CRE
Market. I model delegated investors in CRE as more likely to have liquidity shocks than
direct investors. For the model to have relevant empirical predictions, delegated investors
need only have a higher average concentration of investors with frequent liquidity shocks;
both delegated and direct investors can be individuals who frequently get valuation shocks
and thus have high liquidity needs.


4.1    Model

There are two assets, 1 and 2, traded in markets 1 and 2. Both assets pay a dividend of 1 per
period and are in supply S. The two markets are ex ante identical. Investors must commit
to searching in only one market at any given time. In the context of CRE, one may interpret
such a restriction as a high cost of acquiring information about a particular city's property
market that prevents an investor from searching simultaneously in all possible markets.
       Investors are risk-neutral and have a rate of time preference of r. Each period, there
is an inflow of new agents into the economy. Investors are born into the market without
the asset and enjoying a high valuation of the asset, i.e., their per period benefit is the full
dividend of 1. Their valuation of the asset can switch to a low valuation in which case their
per period benefit of owning the asset is 1 ´ x. In contrast to Duffie et al. (2005) and Duffie
et al. (2007), once an agent becomes a low valuation agent, it remains a low valuation agent
until it sells the property. Once it has sold the property, it exits the economy. Agents that
become low valuation agents without having bought a property also exit the economy.
       Agents differ in the likelihood that they will receive a valuation shock. Valuation
shocks arrive at Poisson rate . The density of investors that enter the economy is f pq,
which I take as the uniform distribution over the interval r, s.
       These assumptions in turn imply that the density of all high valuation agents in the




                                              35
economy (rather than that of new entrants to the economy) is

there is neither excess demand nor excess supply such that

        When a buyer (a newly born agent) meets a seller (an agent that had bought the
asset as a high valuation agent but who now only gets 1 ´ x from owning the asset), they
use bilateral bargaining to split the gains from trade. In particular, one party is randomly
selected to make a take-it-or-leave-it offer. The probability that the buyer is selected to
                     z
make the offer is   1`z
                        ,   z P p0, 8q.
        Buyers and sellers meet randomly within each market. Given total masses of buyers
and sellers in market i, µi      i                             i    i      i i
                          B and µS , the matching function M pµB , µS q " µB µS characterizes

the search technology. It features increasing returns to scale consistent with the intuition that
matching is easier in markets with large masses of both buyers and sellers. The parameter
 can be thought of as capturing the efficiency of the search technology.


4.2     Equilibrium

I focus on the clientele equilibrium in which high  agents choose to enter the high liquidity
market, which I take as market 1 without loss of generality.9 Let µi      i          i
                                                                   B pq, µO pq, and µS pq

denote the density of agents with valuation shock frequency  in market i who are looking
to buy the asset, who own the asset and remain high valuation, and who own the asset but
have become low valuation such that they are looking to sell the asset. The total masses of
   9
    Vayanos and Wang (2007) show that there also exists a continuum of symmetric equilibria in which the
measure of sellers is the same across both markets. In addition to being indeterminate, these equilibria are
inconsistent with the empirical facts in Section 3.

       By Lemma 1 of Vayanos and Wang (2007), there is a unique value of , ° , such that
all investors with   ° choose to enter market 1 and all investors with   ° go to market
2. Given this fact, to determine µ1
                                  B (for example), I use the fact that the inflow of buyers

                   1
into market 1 is   ´
                     d     for   ° and 0 for   ° while the outflow is µ1    i
                                                                       B pqµS d. This

gives an equation for µi                 i
                       B pq in terms of µS and the parameters. I similarly set the inflow into

owners equal to the outflow for a given  to solve for µi              i
                                                       O in terms of µS and the underlying

parameters. Finally, I impose that the mass of owners and sellers must equal total supply
in each market (i.e., µi    i
                       O ` µS " S ).

       The equilibrium of the model then requires the following three equations to be solved
for the three unknowns µ1    2       °
                        S , µS , and  :

       Trading volume in the model is determined entirely by the parameters , , and .
Trading volume does not depend on the discount from a liquidity shock, x. x matters only
for price determination.
       Transaction prices are heterogeneous in each market. While transaction prices have
closed form solutions, in the interests of space, I do not reproduce the expressions for them


                                              37
from Vayanos and Wang (2007). Section 4.3 presents the average cap rates in markets 1 and
2 as these are the analogues to the empirical MSA averages. See Vayanos and Wang (2007)
for additional details on the model solution.


4.3    Calibration

Given that the model has no role for heterogeneity in liquidity needs or technologies over
time, I collapse the data to the means for each of the 39 MSAs. I then split the sample of
cities into two sets of cities, high and low turnover. High turnover cities are the top half
of cities by turnover. Table 12 shows that the most liquid cities have turnover of 6.85%
while the least liquid cities have turnover of just 4.30%. The difference in turnover between
the two sets of cities is more than 45% of the mean level of turnover. By comparison, the
difference in the average cap rates across the two sets of cities is a mere 13 basis points or
less than 2% of the average cap rate.
       I fix z to 1 such that buyers and sellers have equal bargaining weight since the data
provides no guidance on the relative bargaining weights. I choose the other five parameters
of the model, r, , , , and x to match the data. I aim to match five moments in the data:
Turnover in high and low turnover markets, cap rates in high and low turnover markets, and
the average time to sell in the US across all cities. I target an average time on the market of
11 months consistent with CoStar (2018)'s estimates for 2007-2018, the only years for which
I could find a publicly available estimate of time-on-the-market for the CRE market.
       I set r at 5.45% which is considerably higher than the average yield on the 10-year
US Treasury over 2001-2015. The risk-free rate in the model must be higher to match the
data because, in the model, there is no credit risk. Given the other moments in the data,
the model fits the data relatively well by setting , , , and x to 0.035, 0.09, 2.6, and 0.40.
The midpoint of the range of  is such that each high valuation agent faces a 6.25% chance
of getting a liquidity shock in any given year and thus becoming a low valuation agent.
       For these parameter values, the value of  that separates the two sets of agents is
° " 0.056. As Vayanos and Wang (2007) point out, there are both more buyers and more

        The differences in cap rates between the high and low turnover markets is very small,
a mere 23 basis points. In practice, the cash flows of CRE may differ across cities, which
would generate additional heterogeneity in cap rates. The lack of credit risk in the model is
also why I calibrate the model with a higher risk-free rate than that in the data. The model
generates small relative illiquidity premia because of the heterogeneity in how investors value
liquidity. Although the illiquidity premium across markets is positive, those investors that
don't place a high value on liquidity choose the illiquid market and do not have to be paid
a lot to do so. In contrast, if investors were homogeneous in their liquidity preferences, the
illiquidity premium would have to be higher to get to an equilibrium in which there is no
excess supply of the asset in the less liquid market.
        Overall, however, the model implies that CRE sells at a 27-30% discount relative
to a perfectly liquid, risk-free asset or offers two percentage points compensation in yield
for its illiquidity inherent. While the model is highly stylized, this is the first estimate of
the illiquidity premium of CRE in the literature.11 In the housing market, Piazzesi et al.
(Forthcoming) report "frictional" price discounts of between 10-40% of the price of a prop-
erty.12 Consistent with real estate being much less liquid than financial securities, this is a
substantially higher illiquidity return premium than what the literature finds for funds that
hold financial securities. Aragon (2007) reports a 4-7% percent higher return on hedge funds
with lockup restrictions relative to unrestricted funds. Barth and Monin (2018) construct
a measure of illiquidity based on the average number of days it would take to liquidate a
portfolio. Using this measure and data from hedge funds' security holdings, they find an

liquidity in the residential market.
   11
      Fisher et al. (2003) adjust CRE returns for differences in the ability to quickly sell a property at different
points in the CRE cycle.
   12
      In part because they allow for heterogeneity in search over other dimensions of the property (e.g., number
of bathrooms), and because potential buyers do not sort solely along the liquidity of the segment as they do
here, Piazzesi et al. (Forthcoming) find much larger differences in illiquidity discounts across segments than
what I find in the CRE market.

5     Conclusions

This paper has shown that the composition of the investor base in CRE differs markedly
across cities. Delegated investors, who are more likely to have shorter holding periods,
are more prevalent in markets with higher turnover. The shorter average holding period
of delegated investors is not just due to their larger size. Rather, the greater need for
liquidity arises from the agency issues associated with managing outside money. From the
perspective of a delegated investor, the problem with Pittsburgh and similar cities is that
they lack liquidity. The low share of delegated investors in markets like Pittsburgh is itself
a reason that CRE in Pittsburgh trades infrequently. Finally, delegated investors prefer to
invest in larger assets, in cities where a larger fraction of the work force is employed by a
publicly traded firm, and in highly educated cities.
         A directed search model with heterogeneity in the frequency with which investors get
liquidity shocks can explain the relationship between trade frequency and investor composi-
tion. In the model, CRE markets are ex ante homogeneous and yet one market emerges as
having more liquidity and lower returns than the other. In practice, there are likely some ini-
tial differences across CRE markets that give one set of cities an edge in attracting investors
that have a greater need for liquidity. The model highlights that there is path dependency
in liquidity and thus the ability of a city to attract certain types of capital. There are likely
consequences of being unable to attract delegated investors, who prefer larger buildings,
for urban design and thus the ability to attract certain types of workers. I leave to future
research the question of the consequences for cities of being unable to attract delegated
investors due to path dependency in investor composition.
         The findings illustrate how path dependence arises in the definition of institutional-
quality assets. Part of what makes an asset institutional-quality is the existing concentration


                                               41
of institutions in its investor base. Given how investor preferences for liquidity and the
liquidity of a market reinforce one another, a market needs to have a critical mass of investors
with similar liquidity preferences for it to attract investors that will in turn generate higher
trade frequency.
       One limitation of the model is that it assumes that liquidity shocks are idiosyncratic.
In practice, shocks to liquidity may be correlated across investors. Furthermore, different
types of investors may have different correlations among their liquidity shocks. It seems
plausible, for example, that herding behavior among delegated investors increases the cor-
relation of their liquidity shocks. I leave the modeling and measurement of correlation in
liquidity shocks within markets and investor types to future work.
