                                         ABSTRACT


   Drivers have been running an “arms race” on American roads by buying increasingly heavy
vehicles such as SUVs, vans and light trucks. Families view large vehicles as providing better
protection to their own occupants if a crash occurs, but these vehicles pose an increased danger to
occupants of smaller vehicles and to pedestrians and bicyclists. This paper measures both the

beneficial internal effect and the negative external effect of heavier vehicles. The main result is that

when drivers replace cars with light trucks, 3,700 additional crashes per year involving fatalities of
smaller vehicle occupants, pedestrians and bicyclists occur, while only 1,400 crashes involving
fatalities of light truck occupants are avoided, i.e., the ratio of negative external effects to positive
internal effects is 2½ to 1. The paper argues that none of the existing traffic laws or institutions

forces drivers of heavy vehicles to take account of their negative external effects.

                  The Effect of SUV’s and Light Trucks on Traffic Safety1

    I.       Introduction

    Over the last decade, drivers have been running an “arms race” on American roads,
replacing cars with sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and light trucks and then replacing these
vehicles with even larger SUVs and even heavier trucks, including the tank-like
Hummer.2 An important reason for the popularity of large vehicles is that families view
them as providing better protection to their occupants if a crash occurs. But when
families drive larger vehicles, they pose an increased danger to occupants of smaller
vehicles and to pedestrians and bicyclists. In this paper, I measure both the beneficial
internal effect of heavier vehicles on their own occupants when crashes occur and the
negative external effect of heavier vehicles on occupants of lighter vehicles, pedestrians
and bicyclists.
    The effect of SUVs and light trucks on traffic safety is controversial. Several
researchers have argued that increases in average vehicle weight are associated with
reductions in fatalities, and vice versa. Based on this, they argue that government-
mandated increases in fuel economy standards in the 1970’s, which led automakers to
reduce vehicle weight, caused fatalities to rise. But studies by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration (1991) and (1997) have shown that damage to occupants of
cars in two vehicle crashes is higher when cars are involved in crashes with SUV’s or
light trucks than when they are involved in crashes with other cars. These divergent
points of view reflect confusion about two distinct effects of vehicle weight/size on

  Between 1980 and 1998, yearly production of light trucks (including SUV’s and vans) more than tripled,
from approximately 2 million to 7 million per year. The fraction of registered vehicles in the U.S. that
consists of trucks increased over the same period from 21% to 37%. (Note that part of the increase is due
to the fact that SUV’s and vans were re-classified from cars to trucks starting in 1985.) As of 1999, the
number of registered SUVs and light trucks was 19 million and 55 million, respectively, compared to 132




                                                                                                          2
traffic safety. First, if larger, heavier vehicles protect their occupants better in crashes,
then an increase in the weight of all vehicles would increase traffic safety. In other
words, passengers would be safer in a fleet composed entirely of light trucks or entirely
of SUV’s than in one composed entirely of cars. Second, vehicle fleets are never
homogeneous, particularly if pedestrians and bicyclists are considered to be ultra-light
vehicles. If a vehicle fleet is initially composed entirely of cars, but some cars are
replaced by SUVs or light trucks, then the probability of crashes involving different types
of vehicles rises. In these heterogeneous crashes, occupants of smaller vehicles are more
likely to be killed or injured than if the other vehicle were the same weight and occupants
of larger vehicles are less likely to be killed or injured than if the other vehicle were the
same weight. Overall, the effect on safety of an increase in average vehicle weight could
either be positive or negative, depending on which of these two effects is more important.
   As an example, suppose there are 1,000 vehicles in a town and each vehicle is either
heavy or light. Also suppose all vehicles have a 2% probability of being involved in a
crash each year and all crashes involve two vehicles, so there are 10 crashes per year.
The cost per crash is assumed to be $10 if two heavy vehicles are involved, $15 if two
light vehicles are involved, and $25 if one heavy and one light vehicle are involved.
If all vehicles are initially light, the total cost of accidents is $150. As some vehicles shift
from light to heavy, it rises to a maximum of $190 when the proportion of heavy to light
vehicles is 40/60. Then as the fraction of heavy vehicles continues to rise, total accident
costs gradually fall to $100 when all vehicles are heavy. Thus the marginal effect of an
increase in the proportion of heavy vehicles could be either an increase or a decrease in
the total cost of crashes.
    This study is the first to use micro data on traffic crashes to examine the effect of fleet
composition on the cost of crashes. It divides the cost of accidents into internal benefits
versus external costs. The internal benefits of larger vehicles are the greater safety they
provide to their own occupants in both two-vehicle and single-vehicle crashes. The
external costs of larger vehicles are their negative effects on the safety of occupants of
lighter vehicles, pedestrians, and bicyclists. The main result of the paper is that when


million registered cars. Data are taken from the Statistical Abstract of the U.S. (2000), tables 1027 and
1030, and Federal Highway Administration, Highway Statistics.


                                                                                                            3
drivers replace cars with light trucks, each crash involving fatalities of light truck
occupants that is prevented comes at a cost of 2 ½ additional crashes involving fatalities
of car occupants, pedestrians or bicyclists. Thus the beneficial internal effect of light
trucks is much smaller than their adverse external effect.
  Section II reviews the literature and sections III-V describe the data and specification,
and present the results. Section VI examines why liability rules and other legal
institutions fail to internalize the negative external effects of heavy vehicles.


    II.     Literature Review
   Meyer and Gomez-Ibanez (1981, p. 264) were the first to consider the effect of
vehicle heterogeneity on safety. They present a table showing the average probability of
vehicle occupants suffering serious injury if their vehicle is in any of five size classes and
has a crashes with another vehicle in any size class. Their data show that occupants of
the smallest vehicles are 58% more likely to be injured when they have a crash with
another vehicle in the largest rather than the smallest size class. Conversely occupants of
the largest vehicles are 61% less likely to be injured when they have a crash with a
vehicle in the smallest rather than the largest size class.
   More recently, Crandall and Graham (1989) used aggregate U.S. data for the 1970’s
and 1980’s to analyze the effect of Federal government standards requiring improved fuel
economy (CAFÉ standards). They argued that the CAFÉ standards were responsible for
2,200 – 3,900 additional deaths and 11,000 – 19,500 additional serious injuries over a
ten-year period, because automakers responded to the standards by reducing vehicle
weight. More recently, Keeler (1996) used county level data for 1980 and 1990 to
explain traffic fatalities. While the goal of his study was to examine whether regulatory
policies such as mandated safety devices and speed limits affect traffic safety, he also
included as control variables measures of the proportion of vehicles that were light and
heavy trucks. These variables were not statistically significant. Coate and VanderHoff
(2001) used state level data for several years in the 1990’s to examine whether the
increase in the proportion of U.S. vehicles that consist of SUV’s and light trucks in the
U.S. has reduced traffic fatalities. They argued that additional SUV’s and light trucks
reduced fatalities.



                                                                                              4
    Because the Crandall-Graham, Keeler, and Coate-VanderHoff studies all used
aggregate data over multiple year periods, they encounter the difficulty that changes in
mandated safety equipment and practices, such as seatbelts, anti-lock brakes, airbags,
strengthened door panels, and laws requiring use of seat belts, occurred over the same
period. These changes tend to reduce the number of fatal crashes,3 so that a study like
Coate and VanderHoff could be attributing the reduction in fatalities to the rise in the
number of SUV’s and light trucks when it is actually due to improvements in mandated
safety equipment or use of seatbelts. Using micro data on crashes rather than aggregate
data makes it possible to separate out these effects.


    III. Data
     The dataset is a sample of police-reported motor vehicle crashes produced by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration General Estimates System (available at
http://www-nass.nhtsa.dot.gov/nass/). The information includes the vehicle types of all
vehicles involved in a crash, the circumstances of the crash, and information concerning
injuries to occupants of all vehicles involved and to pedestrians or bicyclists. I examine
three types of crashes: those involving two vehicles, those involving a single vehicle, and
those involving a vehicle striking a pedestrian or cyclist.4 Vehicles are divided into five
categories: cars, SUV’s, small trucks (including pickup trucks and vans), large trucks,
and buses.5 Five separate datasets are analyzed. They consist of all two-vehicle crashes
involving one or two cars, all two-vehicle crashes involving one or two SUVs, all two-
vehicle crashes involving one or two light trucks, all crashes involving single vehicles,
and all crashes involving a vehicle and a pedestrian or bicyclist. All datasets cover the
period 1995-99.
    Using crash data has the advantage of providing detailed information on the
circumstances of each crash. But a drawback is that they do not allow the researcher to

  Although Peltzman (1975) argued that drivers compensate for safety increase due to seatbelts by driving
faster.
4
  Two other types of crashes are omitted: those involving more than two vehicles (7.9% of crashes) and
those involving motorcycles (1% of crashes). Estimates of the total number of crashes adjust for these
omitted types.
5
  The heavy truck category includes all “single unit straight trucks,” combination trucks, and medium or
heavy motorhomes. Van-based schoolbuses are classified as buses, but all other types of vans are classified
as light trucks, regardless of whether they are used for commercial or personal transportation purposes.


                                                                                                         5
take account of differences in the probability of particular types of vehicles being
involved in crashes. Unfortunately, there is little micro data available on whether
household involvement in crashes. See section V below for discussion of aggregate crash
probabilities by type of vehicle.




    IV. Specification and Results
    The basic specification is a set of logit regressions explaining whether occupants of
particular types of vehicles are killed or seriously injured when their vehicles are
involved in crashes with larger versus smaller vehicles. I discuss the specification and
results for each of the five datasets separately below.
    A. Injuries and fatalities in two vehicle crashes involving cars. The first dataset
consists of all two-vehicle crashes that involve at least one car. Define “vehicle one”
(V1) to be the car and “vehicle two” (V2) to be the other vehicle. If both vehicles are
cars, then one car is chosen randomly to be vehicle one.6 The dependent variables are a
dummy variable which equals one if one or more occupants of vehicle one were killed in
the crash and a dummy which equals one if one or more occupants of vehicle one were
seriously injured (but not killed) in the crash. There are about 136,000 two-vehicle
crashes involving cars.
    The most important independent variables are separate dummy variables for whether
vehicle two is an SUV, a light truck, a heavy truck, or a bus. The omitted category is
another car. The coefficients of these dummy variables measure the change in the
probability of vehicle one occupants suffering fatalities or serious injuries when vehicle
two is an SUV rather than another car, a light truck rather than another car, etc. The
hypothesis is that, conditional on a crash occurring, occupants of cars are more likely to
be injured or killed if the other vehicle involved in the crash is a heavier vehicle rather
than another car. All of the dummy variables are predicted to have positive signs.
    I also include a set of exogenous variables intended to control for circumstances of the
crash that affect whether fatalities or serious injuries occur. These include dummy


6
 Ideally, vehicle one would be the lightest of the two cars, but the dataset does not contain information on
vehicle weight.


                                                                                                           6
variables for whether the crash occurred in rain, snow, or fog (the omitted category is
clear weather), whether the crash occurred in darkness, whether the crash occurred in a
medium or large city (the omitted category is a small town or rural area), whether the
crash occurred on an interstate highway or a divided highway (the omitted category is a
two-way street), and whether the crash occurred on a weekday. I also include separate
dummy variables for whether the driver of vehicle one or vehicle two was driving more
than ten miles per hour above the speed limit, separate dummy variables for whether the
driver of vehicle one or vehicle two or both were driving negligently (this includes
driving when drunk or under the influence of drugs), separate variables for whether the
driver of vehicle one was under 21 or over 60 years of age and the same for the driver of
vehicle two, the number of occupants in vehicle one when the crash occurred and the
same for vehicle two, and whether the driver of vehicle one wore a seatbelt. Year
dummy variables are included to account for changes in mandated safety standards and
seatbelt use over the period of the sample (results for the latter are not shown). Weights
are used to make the sample representative of all accidents.7
    Summary statistics are shown in table 1, column 3. The results of logit regressions
explaining whether there were fatalities or serious injuries of occupants of vehicle one
when two-vehicle crashes occurred are shown in table 1, columns 1 and 2, respectively.
Standard errors are shown in parentheses. All of the dummy variables for heavier
vehicles than cars have the predicted positive signs and all are statistically significant,
except that the V2 = SUV dummy in the fatalities regression and the V2 = bus dummy in
the serious injuries regression are not significant. Among the other variables, occupants
of vehicle one are more likely to be killed or seriously injured in crashes that occur in
rural areas rather than cities, in crashes that occur on weekends rather than weekdays, in
crashes in which either vehicle’s speed was more than 10 miles per hour above the limit,
in crashes in which the driver of vehicle one was more than 60 years old, and when
vehicle one contained more occupants. Occupants of vehicle one are less likely to be
killed or seriously injured if the driver wore a seatbelt and more likely to be killed or

 The dataset does not include the state in which the accident occurred, so that state dummy variables
cannot be used. But the weights are designed to take care of the problem that different states’ reporting
systems include varying proportions of accidents of particular types.


                                                                                                            7
seriously injured if both drivers drove negligently. But, surprisingly, if one rather than
both drivers drove negligently, the sign pattern is mixed.
    Table 2, top panel, shows how the number of two-vehicle crashes per year involving
fatalities or serious injuries of car occupants would change if cars replaced each of the
various types of heavier vehicles.8 If cars replaced all SUV’s on the roads, there would
be 202 fewer crashes per year involving deaths of car occupants and 1,008 fewer crashes
per year involving serious injuries of car occupants. This is because cars would be less
likely to be involved in two-vehicle crashes with heavier vehicles and more likely to be
involved in crashes with other cars. If cars replaced all light trucks on the road, there
would be 1,445 fewer crashes per year involving deaths and 11,325 fewer crashes per
year involving serious injuries of car occupants. If cars replaced all heavy trucks on the
road, there would be 561 fewer crashes per year involving fatalities of car occupants and
3,384 fewer crashes per year involving serious injuries of car occupants. Overall if cars
replaced all heavier vehicles, there would be about 2,250 fewer crashes involving deaths
of car occupants and 15,000 fewer crashes involving serious injuries of car occupants
each year. These results suggest that the negative external effect of heavier vehicles on
cars is substantial.
    B. Injuries and fatalities in two vehicle crashes involving SUVs. The next dataset
consists of all two-vehicle crashes involving at least one SUV. Define “vehicle one” to
be the SUV and “vehicle two” to be the other vehicle. If both vehicles are SUVs, then
one SUV is randomly chosen to be vehicle one. The dependent variables are dummies
that equal one if one or more fatalities occurred in vehicle one and if one or more serious
injuries occurred in vehicle one. The key independent variables are dummy variables for
whether vehicle two is a car, a light truck, a heavy truck, or a bus (the omitted category is


8
  These calculations first transform the logit coefficients into average marginal effects using the weighted
average probability of fatalities when two-vehicle crashes involving cars occur. To convert the marginal
effect into a prediction of the change in the number of crashes involving fatalities if cars were substituted
for all SUVs on U.S. roads, the average marginal effect is multiplied by the total number of crashes per
year in the U.S. times the proportion of all crashes involving two vehicles times the proportion of two
vehicle crashes involving a car and an SUV. The average number of crashes per year during the period of
the data was 6,500,000 (taken from Traffic Safety Facts, available at www.nhtsa.dot.gov). The other
figures are calculated from the datasets and given in the Appendix. Calculations for other types of vehicles
and for crashes involving serious injuries use analogous procedures. Note that the calculations use the
estimated coefficients from table 2 even if they are not statistically significant, since the coefficients
represent the most likely value.


                                                                                                           8
another SUV). The predicted sign of the V2 = car variable is negative, since we predict
that occupants of SUVs are less likely to be killed or injured in two-vehicle crashes if the
other vehicle is a car rather than another SUV (i.e., a lighter vehicle). The predicted signs
of the V2 = light truck, V2 = heavy truck, and V2 = bus variables are positive, since we
predict that occupants of SUVs are more likely to be kllled or injured in crashes if the
other vehicle is heavier than an SUV. The control variables are the same as in the
previous regressions. There are about 15,300 two vehicle crashes involving SUVs.


    Summary statistics are shown in table 3, column 3. Table 3, columns 1 and 2 give the
results of the logit regressions. As predicted, the coefficients of the V2 = car variable are
negative in both regressions, while the coefficients of the V2 = light truck and V2 =
heavy truck variables are positive in both regressions. Thus SUV occupants are less
likely to be killed or seriously injured when their vehicles are involved in crashes with
cars and more likely to be killed or seriously injured when their vehicles are involved in
crashes with light or heavy trucks. However, only the heavy truck dummy variable in the
regression explaining serious injuries is statistically significant, because of the small
number of crashes involving fatalities or serious injuries.9 The results for other variables
are similar to those in the car dataset.
    Table 2, second panel, shows the predicted change in the number of two-vehicle
crashes involving fatalities and serious injuries of SUV occupants per year if other types
of vehicles were replaced by SUVs. If all cars were replaced by SUVs, there would be
349 additional crashes per year in which occupants of SUVs are killed and 927 additional
crashes in which occupants of SUVs are seriously injured. This is because SUV
occupants would no longer gain from having some crashes with lighter vehicles. If all
light or heavy trucks were replaced by SUVs, there would be 25 and 13 fewer crashes per
year, respectively, in which occupants of SUVs are killed and 347 and 184 fewer crashes
per year, respectively, in which occupants of SUV’s are seriously injured. Thus, while
trucks impose large negative externalities on occupants of cars, they impose only small
negative externalities on occupants of SUVs.


9
 There are only 16 fatal crashes and 235 crashes involving serious injuries in the SUV sample. The V2 =
bus variable in the regression explaining serious injuries has the wrong sign, but is not significant.


                                                                                                          9
   C. Injuries and fatalities in two vehicle crashes involving light trucks. The next
dataset consists of all two-vehicle crashes involving one or more light trucks. Define
“vehicle one” to be the light truck and “vehicle two” to be the other vehicle. If both
vehicles involved in the crash are light trucks, then one is randomly chosen to be vehicle
one. The dependent variables are dummies that equal one if one or more fatalities
occurred in vehicle one and if one or more serious injuries occurred in vehicle one. The
key independent variables are separate dummy variables for whether vehicle two is a car,
an SUV, a heavy truck, or a bus (the omitted category is another light truck). The
predicted signs of the V2 = car and V2 = SUV variables are negative, since occupants of
light trucks are less likely to be killed or injured in two-vehicle crashes if the other
vehicle involved in the crash is lighter than a light truck. The predicted signs of the V2 =
heavy truck and V2 = bus variables are positive, since occupants of light trucks are more
likely to be kllled or injured in crashes if the other vehicle is heavier than a light truck.
The control variables are the same as in the previous regressions. There are about
56,000 two-vehicle crashes involving light trucks.
   Summary statistics are shown in table 4, column 3. Table 4, columns 1 and 2, give
the results. In both regressions, the coefficients of the V2 = car and V2 = SUV dummy
variables are negative as predicted and the coefficients of the V2 = heavy truck and V2 =
bus dummy variables are positive as predicted. The V2 = car and V2 = heavy truck
variables are statistically significant in both regressions, but the V2 = SUV and V2 = bus
dummy variables are not.
    Table 2, third panel, shows the predicted change in the number of crashes involving
fatalities and serious injuries of light truck occupants if other types of vehicles were
replaced by light trucks. If light trucks replaced all cars on the road, there would be 864
additional crashes per year involving fatalities of light truck occupants and 8,000
additional crashes per year involving serious injuries of light truck occupants. This is
because light truck occupants would lose some of the protective effect of frequently
having crashes with lighter vehicles. If light trucks replaced all SUV’s on the road, there
would be little effect on occupants of light trucks. If light trucks replaced all heavy
trucks on the road, there would be 95 fewer crashes per year involving fatalities of light
truck occupants and 722 fewer crashes per year involving serious injuries of light truck



                                                                                                10
occupants. This is because light truck occupants would gain from having fewer crashes
with heavier vehicles.
   D. Injuries and fatalities in single vehicle crashes.   The next dataset consists of all
single vehicle crashes. These crashes are more heterogeneous than those in the previous
datasets, since crashes may involve vehicles striking trees, highway barriers or road
signs, leaving the road, and/or rolling over. The dependent variables are dummy
variables that equal one if one or more occupants of the vehicle involved in the crash
were killed or seriously injured. The key independent variables are separate dummy
variables for whether the vehicle is an SUV, a light truck, a heavy truck, or a bus (the
omitted category is a car). Because of the heterogeneity of single vehicle crashes, we do
not have a hypothesis concerning the predicted signs of these variables—i.e., heavier
vehicles may protect their occupants better or worse than light vehicles in crashes. The
control variables are similar to those in the previous regressions. There are about 12,000
single vehicle crashes in the dataset.
    Table 5, columns 1 and 2, give the results of logit regressions explaining fatalities
and serious injuries in single vehicle crashes and column 3 gives summary statistics.10
All four dummy variables for vehicle types have positive signs in the regression
explaining fatalities, but only SUV and bus variables are statistically significant. In the
serious injury regression, the light truck dummy variable has a negative sign and is
statistically significant, while the heavy truck dummy has a positive sign. Coefficients
could not be computed for the SUV and bus dummy variables. Thus in single vehicle
crashes, occupants of heavier vehicles are more likely to be killed than occupants of cars,
but may be better protected against serious injuries than occupants of cars.
   Table 2, fourth panel, shows the predicted change in the number of single vehicle
crashes involving fatalities or injuries if cars replaced heavier vehicles. If SUVs
replaced all cars on the road, there would be 27 fewer single vehicle crashes per year
involving fatalities. If light trucks replaced all cars, there would be 58 fewer single
vehicle crashes per year involving fatalities, but 485 additional single-vehicle crashes
involving serious injuries. If heavy trucks or buses replaced all cars on the road, the




                                                                                            11
effects on the number of single vehicle crashes involving fatalities and serious injuries
would be small.
     E. Injuries and fatalities in crashes involving pedestrians or cyclists. The final
dataset consists of crashes involving a vehicle and a pedestrian or cyclist. The dependent
variables are dummies for whether the pedestrian or cyclist was killed or seriously
injured in the crash. The key independent variables are separate dummy variables for
whether the vehicle was an SUV, a light truck, a heavy truck, or a bus. The omitted
category is a car. The hypothesis is that pedestrians and cyclists are more likely to be
killed or seriously injured when they are struck by heavier vehicles rather than cars. The
control variables are similar to those in the previous regressions. There were about
14,000 crashes involving pedestrians or cyclists.
     The results of the logit regressions are given in table 6, columns 1 and 2, and summary
statistics are given in column 3. All of the dummy variables for vehicle type have
positive signs in the regression explaining fatalities and the light truck and heavy truck
variables are statistically significant. In the regression explaining serious injuries, the
light truck and heavy truck variables both have the predicted positive signs and are
statistically significant, but the SUV and bus dummy variables are both negative and
insignificant. Among the control variables, fatalities and serious injuries are less likely to
occur in large cities, more likely to occur in the dark, more likely to occur on divided or
interstate highways, and more likely to occur if the driver of the vehicle was driving more
than 10 miles per hour above the speed limit. Pedestrians and cyclists are also more
likely to be killed or injured if they are more than 60 years old and less likely to be
injured or killed if they are less than 21 years old.11
     Table 2, bottom panel, gives the predicted changes in the number of crashes involving
fatalities and serious injuries of pedestrians or cyclists if cars replaced heavier vehicles.
If cars replaced all SUVs, then 594 fewer crashes involving deaths of pedestrians/cyclists
would occur each year, but 673 additional crashes involving serious injuries of
pedestrians/cyclists would occur. (Note that the latter figure is not significantly different

10
  Again the number of crashes involving fatalities and serious injuries is relatively small—only 10 and 77,
respectively. A dummy variable for crashes involving rollovers was tried, but no coefficient could be
computed because there were only six rollover crashes in the data.




                                                                                                        12
from zero.) If cars replaced all light trucks, then 2,225 fewer crashes involving deaths
and 4,633 fewer crashes involving serious injuries of pedestrians/cyclists would occur. If
cars replaced all heavy trucks, then 486 fewer crashes involving deaths and 777 fewer
crashes involving serious injuries of pedestrians/cyclists would occur. Thus if cars
replaced all SUVs and light trucks, at least 3,300 lives of pedestrian or cyclist would be
saved each year. Since the total number of pedestrian/cyclist fatalities in motor vehicle
crashes in the U.S. is about 6,000 per year, this implies that light trucks and SUVs are
responsible for more than half of all deaths of pedestrian/bicyclists.


     V. External versus Internal Effects of Large Vehicles
     Now turn to the external versus internal effects of large vehicles. Consider two
separate experiments—replacing all SUVs in the existing U.S. vehicle fleet with an equal
number of cars or replacing all light trucks with an equal number of cars. I focus on
SUVs and light trucks since virtually all SUVs and many light trucks are used for non-
business purposes and therefore could be replaced by cars with little loss of efficiency.
     Table 7 shows the results for fatalities. Each external and internal effect is shown in a
separate row and the results for replacing SUVs or light trucks with cars are shown in
separate columns. The first three rows are all external effects, of which the first is the
reduction in the number of two-vehicle crashes involving fatalities of car occupants when
all SUVs or all light trucks are replaced by cars. If all SUVs or all light trucks were
replaced by cars, there would be 202 and 1,445 fewer crashes per year involving
fatalities, respectively.12 The second row is the reduction in the number of two-vehicle
crashes involving fatalities of SUV occupants when all light trucks are replaced by cars—
this figure is 25 per year. (Note that this external effect does not apply when SUVs are
replaced by cars.) The final external effect, in the third row, is the reduction in the
number of crashes involving fatalities of pedestrians/bicyclists if all SUVs or all light
trucks were replaced by cars. These figures are 594 and 2,225, respectively. Combining
all three external effects, we find that the total number of fatal crashes per year involving

11
  The results remained virtually the same if a dummy variable for the victim being a cyclist versus a
pedestrian was included.




                                                                                                        13
lighter vehicles, pedestrians or bicyclists that would be avoided if cars replaced all SUVs
is 796 and the figure for light trucks is 3,695.
      Now turn to the internal effects of replacing SUVs or light trucks with cars. The
first internal effect is the reduction in the number of single vehicle crashes involving
fatalities that would occur each year if all SUVs or all light trucks were replaced by cars.
These figures are 27 and 58, respectively. The last internal effect is the increase in the
number of two-vehicle crashes involving fatalities of SUV and light truck occupants that
would occur if occupants of these vehicles instead used cars and therefore lost the
protective effect of their large vehicles.
     To calculate this effect for SUV occupants, we first use the results of the SUV logit
model reported in table 3, column 1, to predict the weighted average probability of
crashes involving fatalities of SUV occupants when they are in two-vehicle crashes with
the existing distribution of vehicle types.13 This figure is .00111. We then use the
results of the car logit model reported in table 1, column 1, to predict the weighted
average probability of crashes involving fatalities occurring when erstwhile SUV
occupants shift to driving cars. But instead of evaluating the car logit at the actual
distribution of vehicle types, we use the distribution of vehicle types that would occur if
all SUVs were replaced by cars, i.e., we set the V2 = SUV dummy variable to zero. The
resulting probability is .00156. This means when SUV occupants shift to cars, their
probability of fatalities conditional on a two-vehicle crash occurring rises by .00156 -
.00111 = .00044. Since the total number of crashes per year involving SUVs is
4,167,000, replacing all SUVs with cars raises the number of fatal crashes that erstwhile
SUV occupants experience each year by (.00044)(4,167,000) = 1,846. The analogous
calculation for replacing all light trucks with cars results in a prediction that erstwhile
light truck occupants will experience (.00130 - .000969)(4,542,000) = 1,493 additional
crashes involving fatalities per year. Combining the two internal effects, we find that if
cars replaced all SUVs, there would be 1,819 additional fatal crashes per year involving

12
   All of the figures in table 7 are taken from table 2, except for the last internal effect (see the discussion
below). The signs are reversed from those in table 2 because the conceptual experiment involves replacing
heavier vehicles with cars rather than the opposite.
13
   This figure is calculated by first predicting the probability of a crash involving fatalities occurring for
each observation in the SUV dataset and then taking a weighted average. This procedure is followed for
all of the models.


                                                                                                             14
erstwhile SUV occupants. The analogous figure for light trucks occupants is 1,435.
These figures are shown in table 7.
   Combining the external and internal effects shows that the overall picture is quite
different for SUVs versus light trucks. For light trucks, the positive external effect of
3,695 fatal crashes avoided when cars are substituted for light trucks is much greater than
the internal cost of 1,435 additional fatal crashes involving erstwhile light truck
occupants. This means that the ratio of external gain to internal harm is 2.6--for each
additional fatal crash involving erstwhile occupants of light trucks, 2.6 fatal crashes
involving occupants of smaller vehicles, bicyclists or pedestrians are avoided. In contrast
for SUVs, the positive external effect of 796 fatal crashes avoided when cars are
substituted for SUVs is smaller than the negative internal effect of 1,819 additional fatal
crashes involving erstwhile SUV occupants, so that the ratio of external gain to internal
harm is 0.44. Thus for each additional fatal crash involving erstwhile occupants of
SUVs, 0.44 fatal crashes involving occupants of cars, pedestrians or bicyclists are
avoided.
   Table 8 repeats the analysis for crashes involving severe injuries. The largest of the
external or internal effects is the increase in the number of crashes involving serious
injuries of erstwhile SUV or light truck occupants when they shift to driving cars. For
SUV occupants, the average probability that a crash involves serious injuries is .0158, but
it rises to .0252 when SUV occupants instead drive cars. This implies that the increase in
the number of crashes involving serious injuries is (.0252 - .0158)*4,167,000 = 39,482.
For light truck occupants, the average probability that a crash involves serious injuries is
.0173, compared to .0226 when light truck occupants instead drive cars, so that the
predicted increase in the number of crashes involving serious injuries is (.0226 -
.0173)*4,542,000 = 24,284. The resulting ratios of external to internal effects are .0008
for SUVs and .66 for light trucks. Thus while heavier vehicles impose external costs on
occupants of smaller vehicles, pedestrians and bicyclists in terms of additional crashes
involving serious injuries, these costs are lower than the number of serious injury crashes
avoided for their own occupants.
 Would these results change if differences in crash rates across types of vehicles were
incorporated into the analysis? Aggregate data suggests that SUVs and light trucks have



                                                                                            15
higher crash rates than cars: the figures are .034 per year for cars versus .04 for SUVs
and light trucks.14 However a problem with aggregate crash data is that they do not
address the question of whether and how crash rates would change if drivers shifted from
one vehicle type to another. It seems likely that basic driving behavior would remain the
same if drivers shifted from cars to SUVs or light trucks, i.e., safe drivers would continue
to drive safely and reckless drivers would continue to drive recklessly. But drivers in
general may tend to drive faster in SUVs or light trucks than in cars. This is because
SUVs and light trucks are higher above the ground than cars and drivers perceive a given
speed to be lower when they are seated higher off the ground. (At the extreme,
passengers in an airplane perceive their speed as near zero. See Rist, 2001.) These
considerations suggest that the external gains from replacing SUVs or light trucks with
cars may be even larger than those calculated here and the internal costs even smaller.

     VI.     The Failure of Liability Rules

     This paper shows that families’ decisions to drive heavy vehicles have large negative
external effects. This section considers whether any of the existing legal institutions—
including tort liability, traffic rules, and requirements that vehicle owners purchase
liability insurance--internalize these negative effects.
     Consider tort liability rules first. Tort liability makes injurers liable for victims’
damage under certain circumstances and therefore gives drivers an incentive to use care
to reduce the probability and severity of crashes (for background, see Shavell, 1987, and
White, 1998). In theory, liability for damage should fall more heavily on owners of
heavy than light vehicles and this should both cause drivers of heavy vehicles to use
additional care to avoid accidents and discourage them from driving heavy vehicles in the


14
  These figures are the number of police-reported crashes per year by type of vehicle divided by the
number of registered vehicles of that type, averaged over 1995-99 (the period of our crash dataset). The
number of crashes for each type of vehicle is calculated using figures from the crash dataset on the
breakdown of crashes by type of vehicle (see the figures given in the Appendix) times 6,500,000 crashes
per year, which is the average yearly number of police-reported motor vehicle crashes during 1995-99. The
resulting figures for the number of crashes per year involving cars, SUVs, and light trucks are 4,425,000,
580,000, and 2,092,000, respectively. The average number of registered vehicles is 130,000,000,
14,700,000, and 52,800,000, respectively. Registration data are taken from Federal Highway
Administration, Highway Statistics, available at www.fhwa.dot.gov. Data on total number of crashes by
year are taken from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Traffic Safety Facts, www-
nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov.


                                                                                                       16
first place. However in practice, tort liability creates only weak incentive effects. One
problem is that liability for damage in the traffic context is generally based on
negligence, so that drivers are only liable if their care level falls below a standard. It is
straightforward to show that if heavy vehicles cause higher damage than light vehicles at
any given level of care, then the negligence standard for drivers of heavy vehicles should
be set at a higher level than the standard for drivers of light vehicles; in other words,
drivers of heavy vehicles should be required to drive more safely in order to avoid
liability than drivers is light vehicles. A related problem is that negligence rules
encourage a higher-than-optimal level of driving activity, because drivers escape liability
for damage in crashes as long as their driving behavior is exceeds the negligence
standard. Drivers therefore have an incentive to shift from light to heavy vehicles
because they do not bear the cost of the additional crashes they cause, as long as their
driving meets the standard. Both of these problems could be solved by imposing a higher
negligence standard on drivers of heavy vehicles, such as by requiring them to drive at 10
miles per hour below the speed limit in order to avoid being found negligent, while
drivers of light vehicles would only have to drive at the speed limit to avoid being found
negligent. But the tort system in fact applies the same standard of care to drivers
regardless of vehicle type.
    Another problem with the tort liability system is that many states in the U.S. use no-
fault systems, rather than negligence rules, to determine liability in motor vehicle
crashes.15 In states with no-fault, the liability system does not penalize drivers of heavy
vehicles at all for causing more damage. In fact, drivers of light vehicles are at a
disadvantage under no-fault, since they suffer more damage in crashes and pay these
costs themselves.
    Now consider traffic rules, which impose monetary fines, required attendance at
traffic school, license suspension or other penalties on drivers who violate the rules.
Traffic rules suffer from the same shortcoming as liability rules, since they apply the
same standard of driving behavior and impose the same penalties on all drivers,
regardless of vehicle type. They therefore do not discourage use of heavy vehicles.




                                                                                                17
     Finally consider liability insurance. Most states require vehicle owners to purchase
liability insurance, so that the insurer rather than the driver pays compensation for
damage to victims in crashes when the insured driver is liable. Because many drivers are
judgment-proof, requiring that drivers purchase liability insurance increases the
probability that crash victims will actually be able to collect when they legally entitled to
do so. Also, insured drivers have an incentive to take care in driving even though their
insurance companies pay damages, because insurance companies charge higher
premiums when their expected liability is higher. These factors suggest that owners of
heavy vehicles should pay higher insurance premiums, both because they are more likely
to be involved in crashes and because their vehicles do more damage when crashes occur.
But again the reality is different. Because the negligence and no-fault liability systems
often allow drivers to escape liability for damage they cause, insurance of heavy vehicles
do not necessarily pay higher insurance premiums. Another factor that affects insurance
rates is that most states require drivers to purchase only a low level of liability coverage.
Five states do not require drivers to purchase liability insurance at all, one state requires
drivers to purchase only $10,000 of coverage, and the most common minimum coverage
requirement is only $25,000.16 Since damages in a crash involving a fatalities or serious
injuries can be far higher, this means that drivers rarely pay for all of the damage their
vehicles cause in serious crashes. Limited coverage requirements reduce insurance
companies’ incentive to set higher premiums for heavier vehicles, because the higher
damage that these vehicles cause often exceeds the coverage limit. Another problem is
that up to 30 percent of drivers in some states are uninsured. When drivers purchase
liability insurance, they typically buy additional coverage for their own injuries if they
are involved in a crash with an uninsured driver. The cost of uninsured drivers’ coverage




15
   As of 1995, fifteen states in the U.S. used some version of no-fault, although some of them use a mixture
of negligence and no-fault rules. See Liao and White (2002) for an analysis of no-fault liability rules in the
motor vehicle accident context.
16
   The states that do not require owners of vehicles to purchase liability insurance are NH, TN, SC, VA and
WI. The dollar figures are the required amount of insurance coverage for bodily injury to a single person
injured in a crash (higher limits apply to all of the victims of a single crash). These figures are taken from
www.insure.com/auto/minimum.html.


                                                                                                           18
is higher for drivers of light vehicles than heavy vehicles and it therefore raises the
relative cost of liability insurance for light vehicles.17
       These considerations suggest that the negative external effects of heavy vehicles
are not internalized by liability rules, traffic rules or liability insurance. Obvious reforms
would include requiring that vehicle owners in all states buy liability insurance and
enforcing the requirement, raising minimum required levels of liability coverage, and
replacing no-fault with fault-based liability systems for motor vehicle accidents. In
addition, more stringent driving rules and negligence standards could be imposed on
heavy vehicles—such as slower speed limits than those imposed on vehicles generally.




17
  According to a recent article by Consumer Reports magazine, insurance companies follow widely
differing practices concerning pricing of liability insurance by type of vehicle. State Farm charges the
same price for liability insurance regardless of vehicle type. In Missouri, GE Auto Insurance charges
owners of pickups and SUVs lower liability premiums than it charges owners of cars. The article notes that
GE Auto Insurance is in the process of extending this type of pricing to other states. Other insurance
companies charge owners of SUVs and pickups more for liability insurance. See “Car Insurance for Less,”
Consumer Reports, vol. 67:10, October 2002, pp. 19-24.
