                 Are Real Interest Rates Equal Across
               Countries? An Empirical Investigation of
                   International Parity Conditions


                               ABSTRACT


     The proposition that real rates are equal across countries is worth
studying because it is central to our understanding of open economy macro-
economics and because it is also an Important issue to policy makers. If it
is true, then domestic monetary authorities have no control over their real
rate relative to the world rate, limiting the impact of their stabilization
policies. In addition, as Feldstein has pointed Out, unless real rates can
differ across countries, policies directed at increasing domestic savings
cannot increase the rate of capital formation and hence productivity. The
equality of real rates is also worth investigating, because it is intimately
linked to and provides information on the basic parity conditions featured
so prominently in open economy macro models.

     This paper conducts empirical tests of the equality of real rates and
other parity conditions across countries using euro rate data over the
1967—Il to 1979—li sample period. The empirical evidence strongly rejects
the hypothesis of the equality of real euro rates across countries. The
joint hypotheses of uncovered interest parity and ex ante relative PPP, or
the unbiasedness of forward rate forecasts and ex ante relative PPP, are also
strongly rejected. Yet independent tests of uncovered interest parity, the
unbiasedness of forward rate forecasts and ex ante relative PPP yield few
rejections and high marginal significance levels. The evidence suggests that
it is worth studying open economy models which allow: 1) domestic real rates
to differ from world rates, 2) time varying risk premiums in the forward
market or 3) deviations from ex ante relative purchasing power parity.
The evidence also leaves open the possibility for policy makers to exert
some control over their domestic real rate relative to those in the rest
of the world. However, the evidence does not rule out that there is a
tendency for real rates across countries to equalize over time, and this
is an important topic for further research.

                              I. Introduction

     The relationship of real interest rates across countries is of central

importance to our understanding of open economy macroeconomics. In models

where there is costless international arbitrage In goods and financial assets,

real interest rates for comparable securities should be equal across countries.

This has been a feature of much of the early research in the monetary approach

to exchange rates: e.g. Frenkel (1976) and Bilson (1978). However, more recent

theoretical models in the exchange rate literature, such as Dornbusch (1976),

Frenkal. (1979) and Mussa (1982), depend on differing real rates between coun-

tries in the short—run.

     The proposition that real rates are equal across countries is worth study-

ing because it sheds light on these theoretical models and because it is also

an important issue to policy makers. If it is true, then domestic monetary

authorities have no control over their real rate relative to the world rate,

limiting the impact of their stabilization policies. In addition, as Feldstein

(1982) has pointed out, unless real rates can differ across countries, policies

directed at increasing domestic savings cannot increase the rate of capital

formation and hence productivity. We shall also see that the equality of real

rates is also worth investigating, because it is intimately linked to and pro-

vides information on the basic parity conditions featured so prominently in

open economy macro models.

     This paper conducts empirical tests of the equality of real rates across

countries using euro rate data over the 1967—Il to 1979—Il sample period. The

next section develops the methodology of the tests. It is then followed by a

discussion of the data and the empirical results. The final section summarizes

the empirical evidence and provides some concluding remarks.

                              II. The Methodology of the Tests



       Each country's real rate of interest for one period euro bonds is de-

fined from the Fisher (1930) equation


(1)                  rr +


      where

                = The nominal interest rate earned on a one period bond denominated

                     in that country's currency, at time t ——    i.e.   it is the nominal

                     return for holding the one—period bond from t—l to t,


              rr =   the   country's rate of inflation from t — 1 to t expected at

                     time t —   1,

         rr = the          one—period real rate of interest.1




tNote that this definition of a country's real rate matches up the euro secur-
 ity denominated in its currency with its inflation rate. Clearly, a domestic
 resident might be interested in the real rate obtained by purchasing a euro
 security denominated in a foreign currency. However, given that uncovered
 interest parity holds, in this case he will earn the same real return. As
 will become obvious in the next section, uncovered interest parity is intimately
 related to the equality of real rates across countries and thus it is only neces-
 sary to test the equality of real rates using the definition above.
                                                  —3—

Hence, the real interest rate,                   is   just the difference between the

nominal interest rate and the expected inflation rate:2 it is the real

return from holding the one—period euro bond from t—1 to t which is

pected at time t—1. Because the real rate is a return expected at the

beginning of the period, it is also frequently referred to as the cx ante

real rate. The more precise terminology is used to differentiate it from

the cx post real rate, namely, the actual real return from holding the one—

period euro bond from t—1 to t. It equals the nominal interest rate minus

the actual inflation rate from t—1 to t and can be written as


(2) eprr =                   rr   —
                                      (1r
                                            —
                                                ir)   =
                                                          rr   —



   where

    eprr = the one—period ex post real rate for the euro bond

               maturing at time t,

           =   the   actual inflation rate from t —                1   to t,

           =      — rre =   'the forecast error of inflation.

Note that for expositional convenience, the ex ante real rate is always re-

ferred to as the real rate throughout this paper, while the ex post real rate

always refers to the variable defined in equation (2).

     The critical assumption behind the methodology developed here is the

rationality of inflation expectations in the euro bond market, which yields

the condition




    returns, inflation and interest rates in the empirical work are contin-
uously compounded so that the usual additional second order term is not
necessary in the Fisher equation (1). Note that if holding period returns
are used in the empirical work here rather than continuously compounded
returns, there is almost no change in the results.

(3)             =
                    E(1rt141)
where
                    =   all   available information at time t—1,


which in turn implies

                                 =               = 0
(4)      E(ir
                        rIi)         E(cq1)
This assumption for financial markets is firmly grounded both theoretically

and empirically, and it is all that is required to derive the proposition

which is the basis of the empirical tests to follow. Consider the linear

least squares projection of the real rate on an information set              con-

tained in


(5)      P(rrlX1) =            Xi
Proposition 1: If the expectations of inflationare rational, then the linear

      least squares projection of the ex post real rate on            information

      set X1 available at time t—l equals the linear least squares pro-

      jection of the ex ante real rate on the same information set: i.e.


(6)      P(eprrIXi) =            P(rrIXti)
where P(... Xi) = the                 linear least squares projection operator on X1.

Proof:

      From the definition of the ex post real rate



(7)      P(eprrlX1) =            P(rrIX      -
                                                 P(clXi)
and by the law of iterated projections

(8)      P(cIX1) =            P(P(ctIti)Ix)
                                                   —5—


The rationality assumption in (4) implies that                                0 and hence

P(€tIXi) = 0.       Q.E.D.


        Using a superscript to denote a particular country's variables, the

null hypothesis of the equality of real rates across countries is

 (9)       rr = rr1              for all countries i and j.


and hence


(10)      P(rrX1) =               P(rrIXti).
Using Proposition 1, this null hypothesis implies

(11)      P(eprrlX1) =                 Xti1 = P(eprr     IX   =
                                                                  X18i.
This condition indicates that, when each country's ex post real rate is

projected against the same information set known at t —                   1, then

(12)         —   1o
for all i and j.

With m countries, even though there are m(rn—1) of the constraints, only

m—1 of them are independent. The test of the null hypothesis of real rate

equality for all countries Is obtained by jointly testing b = 0 in the

m — 1 ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions


(13)      eprr —     eprr          =
                                       X1 b3   +                            j =   2,...,in

where
                             1
          b = l3    —   13




          u =    c — c under the null hypothesis, which is the forecast
                 error of the inflation differential — which has the property

                 that E(uI+ti) = 0             and hence u will be serially uncorrelated
                                     —6—



    under the null.3

    One pitfall to beware is that these joint tests cannot be conducted

by estimating each country's OLS constrained and unconstrained regressions

separately, adding up their sum of squares, and then carrying out the usual

comparison to construct the F—test.4 This yields incorrect test statistics

because      the covariance of the OLS parameter estimates in different equations

is assumed to be zero. Instead the correct variance—covariance matrix of the

stacked OLS parameter estimates is




3Combining the null hypothesis of (9) with the definition of the ex post
 real rate in (2) yields the definition above and the rationality of infla-
 tion forecasts assumed in (4) then leads to the serial uncorrelatedness
 property. The parameters and their variance covariance matrices will be
 consistently estimated with OLS under the null so that test statistics
 will have the appropriate asymptotic distributions. However, if the null
 is false, then u could be serially correlated and then the power of the
 test might not be high. Thus, if there is a failure to reject the null,
 we would want to be sure that this is not the result of serial correlation
 in the u. There are three countries that display significant first order
 correlation in the equation (12) regressions using WPI data (Durbin—Watson
 of 1.03 to 1.36), but first order serial correlation is not present when the
 CPI data are used. In any case, strong rejections of the null hypothesis
 of the real rates arise for both and CPI and WPI regressions. In the
 regression tests of uncovered interest parity, the unbiasedness of the for—
 ward rate and the PPP condition, no evidence of first order serial correlation
 is found.


4This   statistic is identical to that produced by a seemingly unrelated regres-
 sion   package,because when all the explanatory variables are the same in
 each   equation GLS will generate the same parameter estimates as OLS on
 each   equation.

         =    the variance covariance matrix of the stacked u

    There are two final points that need to be made about this test procedure.

Given the rationality of expectations, the condition (11) has been shown to

be true for any set of variables X1 that is contained in the available in-

formation set                  Even if information relevant to the determination of

real rates in different countries is excluded from X1, the condition in (ii)

and test procedure described here is valid; that is a rejection of the null

hypothesis is indeed a rejection of the equality of real rates across coun-

tries. That the test procedure is valid even when relevant information

is ignored is a common feature of rational expectations tests. (See Abel

and Mishkin (1983)).
                                                —8—


        However, as condition (11) makes clear, in order to obtain tests

with some statistical power, the information set X1 must be chosen so

that it has significant explanatory power in ex post real rate regressions

for these countries. A companion piece to this paper, Mishkin (1982),

finds that one information set that does meet this criterion is a

fourth order polynomial in time, represented by a constant term and the

four variables TIME, TIME2, TIME3 and TIME4. The fourth order polynomial

in time should be thought of as a proxy for the smoothly moving (low fre-

quency) component of economic variables that are related to real rates.

For example, if the real rate projection for each country against all

available information is,


(16) P(rrc1) =            X1
and



(17)    P(xilTti) = Tt_i        0




where

             =   vector   of the economic variables at time t—1

        Tti = vector of the constant term and the four time variables.
then

                          =             0(j_1) + u +   —   C3     = 2,...m

                       rrt P(rr

                                             —9—




The null hypothesis of rr =
                                   rr   and hence   —   13'   = 0 implies that

0(13i — 131)   =   0.   Also u will be zero under the null and the remaining error

term will be orthogonal to Tt_i because of the rationality of inflation expecta-

tions.

         There are several advantages to Using the time variables in the test

procedure here. The first is that it can lead to tests of higher power. In

Mishkin (1982), four lags of inflation, the lagged money growth and the nominal

euro rate for each country are the economic explanatory variables in the

ex post real rate regressions for each country. In order to conduct the joint

test of real rate equality described here, all these variables for every country ——

that   is, thirty—six of them —— would need to be included in the equation (12)

regressions in addition to the constant term. Since there are only forty—nine

observations, this leaves us with few degrees of freedom per regression and

and the total number of constraints to be tested would be a very large number,

over 200. Obviously, we would expect this test to have very little statistical

power. The test with the time trend variables involves only five variables per

regression, and only a total of 30 constraints to be tested.5 Because Mishkin

(1982) finds significant explanatory power of the time variables ——              in   fact in

 the WPI case they are more significant than the economic variables listed above, ——




51n the tests with the economic variables, there would be only 12 degrees
of freedom per regression, 72 in total, with 222 constraints to be tested;
while for the tests with the time variables there will be 44 degrees of
freedom per regression, 264 in total, with 30 constraints to be tested.
                                   —10—



we would expect the time variables test to have greater statistical power.

A second advantage of the time variables is that they do not require know-

ledge of the relevant economic variables to conduct the test. Thus, they

may pick up effects of relevant economic variables that the econometrician

has inadvertently ignored.   In addition, they will only pick

up low frequency deviations from real rate equality. Since low frequency

deviations are potentially most important to investment and consumption

decisions, these are probably of greatest interest to economists.

                         III The Empirical Results


 THE DATA

     Obviously, there is no unique real interest rate. The magnitude of

 a real rate depends not only on the risk characteristics of the security

 being studied, but also on the price index used to calculate real returns.

 What is the appropriate price index depends on what economic decision is

 being analyzed. For example, if we are interested in the savings—consump-.

 tion decision, a price index based on a commodity bundle of consumption

 goods, such as the CPI, is appropriate. If, on the other hand, we are

 interested in decisions to trade among countries, then a price index with

 tradable goods a larger proportion of its commodity bundle, such as the

WPI, is more appropriate.

    This study analyzes real interest rates in the euro deposit market in

the 1967—IT to 1979—TI period for the following OECD countries: the United

States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, West Germany, the Netherlands,

and Switzerland. Quarterly data on three—month euro rates obtained from

the Harris Bank tape are used in this study.6

    Euro deposits denominated in different countries' currencies are of f—

shore securities issued by the same bank and therefore have similar de-

fault risk. Hence a comparison of real euro rates across countries will

not have to be adjusted for differing default risks or non—comparability



6
 Only seven of the ten countries' data available in the tape are used here
 because three of the countries——Italy, Belgium and Japan——either had a high
 proportion of the data missing or did not satisfy interest parity because
 of two—tiered exchange rates. In the few cases where Euro rate data were
 missing for the seven countries, the Euro rate was calculated from the
 interest parity condition. The rest of the data were checked by verifying
 that there were no large deviations from interest parity. Several obvious
 errors in the tape were found in this manner and were corrected.
                                    —12—


because of capital market controls. Quarterly data on three—month rates

have the advantage that the data are non—overlapping and timing problems

that would arise with monthly data are avoided.7 The dating convention

is as follows. The ex post real rate for a quarter is the actual real

return on a three—month bill held from the beginning to the end of that

quarter, continuously compounded. Both the CPI and WPI are used in the

empirical analysis to calculate inflation rates for the reasons discussed

above. Spot and forward exchange rate data were obtained from the Harris

Bank tape maintained at the University of Chicago, and the CPI and WPI data

were obtained from the International Financial Statistics (IFS) tape main-

tained by the International Monetary Fund.


THE RESULTS

    The tests conducted in Table 1 verify whether the coefficient esUmates

in the ex post real rate regressions are equalized in all seven OECD countries

jointly. Line 1.1 of Table 1 conducts a test for the equality of the mean

real rates by only including the constant term in the information set X1.

The equality of the mean real rates is rejected at the 1 percent level

when the CPI is used to calculate the ex post real rate, but not when the

WPI is used. However, when the time variables are added to the information

set in the tests of line 1.2, we now see very strong rejections of the equal-

ity of real rates in both the WPI and CPI results.

    Even though real rates are not equalized across countries, it is

possible that they have a different mean, but move similarly over time.

This proposition is tested in line 1.3, where the information set has the

same variables as in line 1.2. Here only the coefficients of the time

variables are tested for equality, while the mean real rates across coun-

tries are allowed to differ by not constraining the equality of the con-

stant terms. Here the rejections continue to be strong, indicating that

real rates in different countries do have dissimilar movements.8

    More information on why the equality of real rates is rejected in

Table 1 can be obtained from bilateral tests of the equality of real rates.

Table 2 reports the F—statistics for the bilateral tests that correspond

to the joint tests in Table 1. As discussed in Section II, although twenty—

one different bilateral tests are reported in each cell of the table, note

that only six of these can be independent. Table 2 tells the following

story. The hypothesis that real rates are equal in the United States, Canada

and the United Kingdom cannot be rejected. When France, Germany, the Nether-

lands and Switzerland are included in the bilateral comparisons, significant

rejections of the equality of real rates now occur, both with each other and




     is pointed out in Mishkin (1982), the French data and real rate esti-
 mates are somewhat peculiar. We might suspect then that France alone is
 the source of the rejections of real rate equality. To check out this
 suspicion, the equality of real rates was tested with France excluded
 and the rejections were still strong. The 1.2 test using CPI data was
 F(25,264) = 2.63 with a marginal significance level of 7.4 x iO, while for
 the     WPI, F(25,264) = 2.11 with a marginal significance level of .0021.

and with the first group of countries. One interesting coincidence found

in Mishkin (1982) that might help us find an explanation for this phenomenon

is that the countries which lead to rejections of the equality of real rates

are also the countries that display a stronger positive correlation between

nominal Interest rates and real rates and a weaker Fisher effect.

    A comparison between the bilateral test results in Table 2 and the

joint tests in Table 1 raises an important point. Restricting your attention

to a set of bilateral tests where the comparison is always between the United

States and other countries can lead to an incorrect interpretation of the results.

For example, in the 2.1 in Panel A and 2.2 tests in Panel B, there are nobi].ateral

rejections of the equality of real rates in the United States and those in other

countries. This might lead an investigator to conclude that we cannot reject

the equality of real rates across countries. However, the corresponding test

results in Table 1 Indicate that jointly we can strongly reject the equality

of the U.S. real rate with those from the other six countri.

    This illustrates the value of conducting multi—country tests jointly as

well as bilaterally. First, as noted in Mishkin(1982), joint tests are often more

powerful than single equation tests. Second, a different impression of the

results can occur depending on the set of bilateral combinations studied.

For example, a less favorable impression of the null hypothesis would be

obtained by looking at the bilateral combinations involving France in the

Panel A, 2.1 tests or those involving Germany in the Panel B, 2.2 tests.

This problem of course does not arise with the joint tests.

    Ths basic finding of this paper is that the equality of real rates across

countries can be significantly rejected statistically. But it is always im-

portant to ask not only whether a rejection is statistically significant,

but whether it is economically significant as well. This appears to be the
                                                —15—


case as seen in Figure 1 which plots, for the sample period used here,

the estimates of the real rate differentials from the U.S. of the six

other OECD countries; these have been obtained from Mishkin (1982). (Note

that real rate differentials for other pairs of countries are just the

distance between the differentials in Figure 1). Real rate differentials

are often very sizable, over ten percentage points or more.

       The rejections of the equality of real rates in Table 1 and 2 also

provide some useful information on some of the basic parity conditions iii

the international economics literature. Roll (1979) has noted that 1) inter-

est parity, 2) an ex—ante version of relative purchasing power parity (PPP),

and 3) the unbiasedness of the forward rate as a predictor of the spot ex-

change rate are linked to the proposition that real rates are equal across

countries. Denoting the log of the spot exchange rate and one—period ahead

forward rate for country j relative to country i given at time t —    1   as

Stl and t1 respectively, the interest parity condition (lP) is:


(19)
             t   —
                     t
                         =      f
                             t—1 t
                                      —
                                          t—1


The ex—ante version of relative PPP is:9


(20)       E(rr —        — (s        —
                                         i)Icti)       0

and the unbiasedness of forward rate forecasts


(21) —i =            E(SIti)
9This is a weaker condition than the usual relative PPP condition, because it
 will be satisfied even if the log of the real exchange rate follows a random walic.
 Thus, findings such as Frenkel's (1981b) rejecting PPP but finding that the
 deviations follow a random walk would be consistent with equation (20's.
 However, evidence discussed latter suggests that even ex ante relative PPP
 is violated.

Combining (19) and (21) we obtain the uncovered interest parity condition

(UIP), which is also known as the Fisher—open hypothesis: i.e.


(22) Ei _1 — (s             —   s           )
                                                =

Subtracting    (21) from (22) we have

which is the condition or the equality of real rates.

       As the above derivation shows, the rejection of the equality of real rates

found in Tables 1 and 2 can arise from the breakdown of any of the conditions

in (19)_(22).10 Frenkel and Levich (1975,1977) and McCormick (1979) have

shown that deviations from the interest parity are quite small in the euro

currency market. Indeed, since interest parity is a pure arbitrage condition

for euro rates, there is some suspicion that many of the deviations may be

the result of data problems.1' Thus, the tests that follow focus on the other

conditions.

       Table 3 conducts tests corresponding to those in 1.2 of Table 1 of uncov-

ered interest parity and ex—ante relative PPP, which together imply the

equality of real rates. The uncovered interest parity condition in (22)

implies that6'       0 in the following regressions:



10Note that if the deviation from one of those conditions is exactly offset
  by a deviation from one of the others, real rates could still be equal. But
  since this is extremely unlikely, it is reasonable to view a breakdown in one
  of these conditions as leading to a violation of real rate equality.

"For example, conversations with Harris Bank personnel indicates that the
  timing of the euro rate data on the Harris tape can differ by up to an hour
  from that of the forward premium. This would lead to spurious deviations
  from interest parity.

Line 3.1 of Table 3 tests jointly S = 0 in the six independent bilateral

regressions where                    includes the constant term and the four time variables.

Line 3.2 conducts the same test for ex—ante relative PPP of y... 0 in the

six independent bilateral regressions:

                   =   error term with the property E(wi) =           0 under the null.




Neither ex ante relative PPP nor uncovered interest parity (UIP) are

rejected at the 5 percent level in these tests. However, when these hy-

potheses are tested jointly in Line 3.3, they are rejected, and especially

strongly in the CPI results.

       At first glance the findings above are surprising. When the UIP and

PPP conditions are implicitly tested together, as in tests of the equality

of real rates in Table 1, or when tested jointly as in Table 3, they are

rejected. Yet when these conditions are tested independently, they are not

rejected. What explains this phenomenon?


12Under the null the   and the    error terms are as defined in equations
  (26) and (27). Rationality of expectations then clearly implies that
  E(nl,) =             E(wi)
                         = 0.

         The answer to this puzzle comes from investigating the error terms of

the regressions above. Taking expectations conditional on the available in-

formation set                     of (24) and (25) and subtracting them from their
                            t—1
respective equations, the error terms are seen to be:13

                         - [s - E(sli)

I.e., the error term in the UIP regression is minus the forecast error of
the spot rate, while the error term in the PPP regression is the forecast error

of   the inflation differential minus the forecast error of the spot rate.

Frenkel and Mussa (1980) have documented that the spot exchange rate is

highly volatile and is apparently quite hard to predict. On the other hand,

inflation rates are substantially less volatile. The forecast error of the

spot rate should then have a large variance which would be substantially

greater than the variance of the forecast error of the inflation differential.

This would imply that the variance of r and w would be large and thus indepen-

dent tests of (24) and (25) would have low power and would be unlikely to

reject even if the null hypothesis were untrue. On the other hand the con-

temporaneous correlation of n and w for the same bilateral combination should

be highly positive'4 and. thus when (24) and (25)' are tested jointly

properly allowing for the covariance of their error terms, the test should

have greater power and be more likely to reject if the null hypothesis were

untrue. The evidence is consistent with the above story: the correlation

of the contemporaneous ri and c for the same bilateral combination is always

greater than .9, and the UIP and PPP conditions are jointly rejected although

they are never rejected when tested independently.

    The ability to reject the equality of real rates in Table 1, but not un-

covered interest parity and ex—ante relative PPP individually, also is ex-

plained by the error terms in the regressions. Subtracting (25 )        from   (24)

we get the bilateral regressions that are used to test the equality of real

rates across countries, and its error term equals n —         Here the forecast

error of the spot rate cancels out and we are left with only the forecast

-error of the inflation differential. By the reasoning above this error term

has much smaller variance than the error term in either the UIP or PPP re-

gressions. Hence the test of the equality of real rates will be more powerful

than tests of uncovered interest parity and ex—ante PPP when conducted in-

dependently.

      i
the finding in Table 4 which conducts tests where s —                 replaces
i —       —
              (s — s1)      in (24). The test statistics in Table 4 are almost

identical to those in Table 3, never differing by more than 2 percent. This

illustrates that results from uncovered interest parity tests can be used to

make inferences about the unbiasedness of forward rate forecasts and the poten-

tial existence of risk premiums in the forward rate market. This is useful in-

formation because frequently data is available to test uncovered interest parity,

as in Cumby and Obstfeld (1981), but is not as readily available to test the

unbiasedness of the forward rate forecasts.

    Because of the potential non—normalities of error terms in the fixed ex-

change rate period ——       i.e.,   this is the Peso problem discussed by Krasker

(1980) ——     the   tests on the equality of real rates, the unbiasedness of forward

rate forecasts and ex—ante relative PPP for the flexible exchange rate period

from 1973—Ill to 1979—Il are reported in Table 5. The tests of uncovered

interest parity for this sample period are not reported on here because, as

expected, the tests statistics are very close to those for the unbiasedness

of forward rate forecasts. Note that X1 again includes the constant term

and the four time trend variables in these tests.




'5Note that when tests of interest parity are conducted the same way the tests
  of the uncovered interest parity are conducted in the text, a strong rejection
  occurs: F(30,264) = 5.12 with a marginal significance level of 6.47 x 10—14.
  However, the deviations from interest parity although they produce a statis-
  tically significant rejection, are quite small. In the seven countries, the
  mean deviation from interest parity (using quarterly rates) range from .02 to .06
  percent; and the standard deviations range from .05 percent to .. 18 percent.
  As the comparison of Table 3 and 4 indicate, although the rejection of
  interest parity is statistically significant, it is not economically signifi-
  cant. Of course, even the statistical rejections are probably spurious because
  of the data problems described in the previous footnote, and the fact that Harris
  Bank personnel indicate that they quote euro rates as if interest parity held
  perfectly.

    The general flavor of these results is similar to that found for the

larger sample period. Tests of the equality of real rates or joint tests

of ex—ante relative PPP and the unbiasedness of the forward rate forecasts

yield much stronger rejections than independent tests of ex—ante relative

PPP and the unbiasedness of forward rate forecasts. However, now we do see

rejections of the unbiasedness of the forward rate forecasts at the 5 per-

cent, although not at the 1 percent level, and a rejection of ex—ante re-

lative PPP for the CPI at the 5 percent level. The rejections of these hypo-

theses jointly is also stronger and is especially so using the WPI where the

marginal significance level is below io_20. The equality of real rates, as

expected from the above results, is also rejected quite strongly using both

the CPI and WPI.

                            IV. CONCLUSIONS


    The empirical evidence in this paper strongly rejects the hypothesis

of the equality of real euro rates across countries. The joint hypotheses of

uncovered interest parity and ex ante relative PPP, or the unbiasedness of

forward rate forecasts and ex—ante relative PPP, are also strongly rejected.

Yet independent tests of uncovered interest parity, the unbiasedness of

forward rate forecasts and ex ante relative PPP yield few rejections and

high marginal significance levels.

    As these findings consistent with other empirical results in the litera-

ture? The answer is yes. Roll (1979) also finds that he frequently cannot

reject the null hypothesis of ex—ante relative PPP, and, as argued here, this

is likely to be the result of the low power of the tests. If more powerful

statistical procedures are used to test this hypothesis, as in Cumby and

Obstfeld (1982), we do see significant rejections. Similarly, tests of the

unbiasedness of forward rate forecasts or of uncovered interest parity do not

frequently reject the null hypothesis when tests of low statistical power are

used as in Frenkel (1981b). However, more powerful statistical tests, such

as in Hansen and Hodrick (1980,1981) and Cumby and Obstfeld (1981, 1982),

do reject these null hypotheses. Hodrick (1980) conducts bilateral tests

of the equality of real rates in the United States versus other countries,

finds the evidence mixed, and concludes that the results are reasonably

supportive of the null hypothesis.16 The U.S. bilateral results here are



16Hodrick (1980) actually uses the interest parity condition to test this
  hypothesis using forward and spot rates rather than euro rates, but as
  shown above this would have no appreciable effect on the results.
                                   —23—


somewhat similar to Hodrick's, but as discussed above, focusing on these

U.S. bilateral comparisons alone can be misleading. More powerful joint

tests here strongly reject the equality of real rates and this is consis-

tent with Cumby and Obstfeld's (1982) tests which also strongly reject

this proposition.

   How should we interpret this evidence? It is important to state that

the rejection of the equality of real rates, uncovered interest parity,     -



the unbiasedness of forward rate forecasts or ex—ante relative PPP does not

imply the existence of irrationality or unexploited profit opportunities.

In a world with risk averse economic agents, risk premiums in the forward

exchange market can easily exist, differ across countries and undergo varia-

tion over time. Furthermore, transaction costs and non—substitutability of

different countries' goods can imply the violation of purchasing power parity

conditions even when there are no unexploited profit opportunities.'7 Finally,

problems with both the CPI and WPI price indices which are often subject to

government intervention, both explicitly through wage and price controls and

through more subtle manipulation of the construction of the indices themselves,

can lead to a less favorable view of purchasing power parity than is really

warranted.

    The evidence then suggests that it is worth studying open economy models

which allow: 1) domestic real rates to differ from world rates, 2) time

varying risk premiums in the forward market or 3) deviations from ex ante

relative purchasing power parity. The evidence also leaves open the



17That marginal tax rates on euro interest payments can differ across coun-
   tries might also be a factor in differing real rates.

possibility for policy makers to exert some control over their domestic

real rate relative to those in the rest of the world. However, the

evidence does not rule out that there is a tendency for real rates ac-

ross countries to equalize over time, and this is an important topic for

further research.
