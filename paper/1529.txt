                         Discrete Devaluation as a
                          Signal to Price Setters



                                 ABSTRACT



     The central hypothesis of this paper is that both the extent and

speed of adjustment of the real exchange rate is affected by the way

the central bank manages the nominal exchange rate. Specifically, a

large discrete adjustment of the nominal exchange rate is more likely

to result in fast adjustment of prices as opposed to a policy of

smooth and continuous crawling peg. In the context of a monopolistic

price adjustment framework, it is shown that a discrete and unexpected

devaluation of the exchange rate shortens implicit price contracts and

increases the rate of price adjustment in the nontraded goods sector,

because firms tend to strengthen their expectations about an overall

increase in costs and about an aggregate as opposed to a local shift in

the demand curve for the firm's output. A discrete change in the

exchangerate acts as an "information signal" that leads to fast overall
adjustment of nontraded goods prices. The hypothesis is tested and not
rejected   at the macro, sectoral and firm level using macro and micro

data on Greek prices prior to and after the January 1983 discrete

devaluation.

Introduction 1


       The origin of this paper can be traced back to early February 1983,

following a visit to a small shoe—repair shop in a suburb of Athens. The

owner of the shop angrily protested the decision of the firm which supplied

him shoe—oolish to issue a new price list which effectively raised the prices

of almost all of its main nroducts by a range of 20—34%. His anger was

focused not so much on the extent of the price change but on the fact that

contrary to expectations, the new price list was issued shortly after the

last list in 0ctober He maintained that this was a clear violation of

client—supplier relationshins since in the past the imnlicit price contract

set between them maintained prices unchanged for a period of 6 to 9 months.

The justification provided by the firm to this ilbreachof contract was the

"unprecedented"devaluatf on of the drachma during the preceding month. To

this the shoe—maker replied that the rice-surveillance department of the

Ministry of Coninerce should intervene since the firm used only domestically

produced inputs and thus used the Dretext of the devaluation to raise profits.

       On January 9, 1983 the drachma was devalued against the dollar by

 15.5% raising the price of the dollar from 71 to 84 drs/$. On a

monthly average basis, the devaluation of the drachma between December 1982

and January 1983 was 14.14% against the dollar and 14.77% in effective

terms. As can be seen in Diagrams 1 and 2, this was the largest discrete

change both n the Drchl$ rate (BIE) and the effective rate (EFE) since the

introduction of the crawling peg system in March 1975. It was at that time

that the drachma ceased to be pegged to the US dollar and that a currency

basket consisting of 12 currencies became the basis for the conduct of ex—

change-Orate policy. Thus over a ten-year period of managed float, the Janua-

ry 1983 devaluation of the drachma was one of the few incidents of discrete

and large adjustment of the exchange rate as opposed to daily smooth crawling.

        The objective of this paper is to investigate the effects of exchange-

rate management on price behavior and thus on the real exchange-rate in a

small semi-industrialized country like Greece.

           Traditionally the main policy objective behind a nominal devaluation

is to promote competitiveness in third markets and to improve the balance of

payments. Setting aside J—curve considerations, the balance—payments effects

following a nominal devaluation depend (a) on the extent by which the real

exchange rate is deoreciated, and (b) on the effects of the real exchange

rate adjustment on net exnort receints.

           Regarding the first factor there is already an extensive literature

on the subject that focuses on the potential adjustment of the relative

price of home to traded goods following a devaluation.2

           The    increase in the price of traded gOods relative to non—traded
goods as    a    result of a devaluation shifts demand towards the non-traded

goods sector giving rise to a current account surplus that increases

reserves and the money   suaply.   The degree of balance-of-nayments improve-

ment depends on elasticities, income and absorption effects, conditions

in asset markets and finally expectations. Eventually the price of non-

traded goods will rise to its steady state level. In the mean-time employ-

meat and output in the non—traded good sector will increase (Katseli, 1980).

        As has been shown elsewhere (Katseli, 1980) these results are sensi-

tive to the underlying assumptions regarding the structural characteristics

of the economy and more specifically to the degree of wage indexation and

the presence of imoorted intermediate goods. In both these cases the de-

mand shift is coupled with a cost shift making the effects on the real ex-

change rate, the output response and the balance—of-payments at best

ambiguous.

         In the absence of real—exchange rate adjustment, a devaluation

can work solely through a real balance effect. The increase in the price

of foreign exchange then reduces real balances. If the demand for money

is exogenously determined3, the excess demand for money is translated into

a reduction in absortion and a balance of payments surplus which is the

vehicle by which money balances are replenished (Katseli, 1983). In this

case as absortion is reduced, the improvement in the balance-of-payments

is achieved at the expense of outut and employment creation in the non-

traded good sector.

         Thus the aggregate output and employment response to a devaluation

critically depends on the responsiveness of the real-exchange rate

     substitutability of all goods and assets in a small open economy and
     oerfect flexibility of wages and prices.
to the nominal devaluation.        Given these r.dnsiderations,

it is important to look at the imnlications of exchange rate management for

real exchange rate develonments.

          The   central hypothesis of this oaøer is that both the extent and
speed of adjustment of the real-exchange rate is affected by the way the
Central   Bank manages the nominal exchange rate. Specifically, a large

discrete adjustment of the nominal exchance rate is more likely to result

in   fast adjustment of prices as opposed to a policy of smooth and continuous
crawling peg. To use R. Cooners terminology, whether exchange rate policy
occupies the "high"or "low—politics realm" does in fact matter for a countrys
competitiveness and the output and emnloyment effects in the adjustment pe-
riod.

           If domestic prices instantaneously adjust to their steady         State
level ,then the improvement in the balance of payment can come about only
through a natural or nolicy-induced squeeze in absorntion. In both cases,
the effects of the devaluation tend to be staqflationary at least in the

non—traded   good sector,

            The channel through which management of the nominal exchange rate
influences real-exchange rate develooments is the process of price adjust-
ment.   As it will   be shown in Section 2 of the paper, this     process has at

least two important features, namely the magnitude and frequency of price

changes. The existing finance literature on exchange rate policy has fo

cused largely on the first aspect only, that is on the responsiveness of

domestic prices to a nominal devaluation. The industrial organisatiori and

macroeconomic literature on the other hand has increasingly focused on

sluggishness. As Barro has noticed,
                                     —7-.


                     The firm's elastic demand curve must be discarded in
             disequilibrium if the firm is ever to change price. In
             this sense the response of nrices to disequilibrium is
             essentially a monopolistic phenomenon even if the indi-
             vidual units perform as perfect competitors in equili-
             brium. Therefore, it seems clear that a theory of mono-
             nolistic price adjustment is a prerequisite to a general
             theory of once adjustment. (Barro, 1972, p. 17).

          Mononolistic price adjustment implies joint determination of two pricing

features on the part of the firm: (a) length of the implicit or explicit uprice

contract" and (b) magnitude of adjustment at the end of the contract period.

As Gray has shown (1976), analogous modelling can be applied to the workings

of a labor market which is characterized by the existence of a strong union.

In that case it is the contract length and the indexing parameter that be-

come the imnortant contract characteristics.

           In merging these two trends in literature, this paper argues that

exchange rate management can affect both the length of the once-contract

between firms and clients as well as the magnitude of price adjustment.

This hypothesis can be tested directly only through the use of micro or

firm—level data since the path of price adjustment varies across firms.

Such data are in fact available for Greek firms. As will be shown in

Section   3 of the paper, prices set by Greek firms for specific products
exhibit properties of a step function. The contract length and the magni-
tude of   the price adjustment can be thus investigated in relation to ex-

change rate management.

             The econometric analysis of price behaviour by firms is complicat-

ed however, by the existence of special institutional factors under which

trading occurs. This is the case in most developing countries where there

is apt to be some institutional mechanism for price surveillance or direct

price   controis-.
         In the Greek case price controls have existed since the rnid30s.

After World War II, they covered only a small number of products and were

intended to curb excessive profits earned from the sale of goods in short

suoply. Over time, controls have been extended to cover numerous products

via snecification of once ceilings or of maximum allowable mark-ups over

costs. The tyne of control that is used varies across goods and business

onerations and can be arrnlied to the industry, the wholesaler or the re-

tailer, that is to any stage within the production and/or distribution system.

(Lalonde and Papandreou, 1984).




         The complexity of the system thus seriously hinders n extensive analysis of

price   behavior by firms unless one investigates thoroughly the underlying
institutional arrangements that affect each specific product and or enter-
prise. In the presence of differentiated nroduct controls, nrofit maximizina

behavior on the )art of firms imolies that pricing of non—controlled items

also departs from         expected pricing under free—market conditions. It

has    been noticed for exarnole that firms tend to once overall production
In such a way as to ensure large enough profits in somelines of production
and thus cover losses generated in the production of price-controlled products.

It follows that an increase in exnected or actual costs affects not only

thr?   nvrall rlce le"l but also    rpl.tiup orices betwcen coriodities.




          In view of these complexities, the central hypotheses of this paner

can be formulated as follows: in Section 2 it is argued that discrete

adjustment of the exchange rate tends to shorten the implicit price contract
                               -'1—



between sellers and buyers and to augment the rate of price adjustment.
This is so because firms tend to strengthen their expectations about an

overall increase in costs and about an aggregate shift in the demand curve

for the firms'outnut. A discrete change in the exchange rate thus acts as

an "information signal in the market that leads to relatively fast overall

price adjustment of traded and non-traded goods alike. Given the presence

of controls, one would tend to observe faster adjustment of orices for non-

controlled items even though sooner or later the regulatory agency itself

is apt to allow once increases in the controlled part of the market. The
 outout resnonse to these effects denends not only on the exnected increase

 in demand for the firm's outnut relative to costs but also on the ability

 of each firm to diversify nroduction across commodities that are exemot

 prom once controts.
       The econometric analysis provided in Section 3 should be interpreted

with caution. Given the existing institutional complexities, it has to be

conducted at the macro, sectoral and firm level. Even though the existing

evidence is not conclusive, the data do not seem to reject the central

hynotheses making this line of research both interesting and promising.

       In the international finance li.terature   exchanae

rate management has been analysed in the context of the ',enefits

and costs of alternative exchange rate regimes. As early as 1970, R. Cooner

and other authors argued for greater exchange rate flexibility on three

separate rrounds: (a) to orovide smoother adjustment to changing fundamentalS,

(b) to avoid speculative runs on the national currency and (c) to reestablish

the effectiveness of monetary policy (Cooper, 1973).
                                   10 -




         As concensus on the advisability of flexible exchange rates grew,

the focus of attention shifted to the manner in which the 'gliding parity"

should be managed. It was demonstrated for example that exchange

rate       adjustment could be unstable if the rate of change of the nominal

exchange rate followed the rate of change of foreign exchange reserves as

opoosed to developments in the current account or the basic balance (Kenen,

          Rodriguez, 1981). The so called 'shocktreatrnent", namely an unexpect

sudden devaluation or revaluation of the nominal exchange rate, was judged

inferior to the "gradualist solution" since it was considered highly unlikely

that   central authorities would riossess the necessary information to arrive
at an equilibrium real exchange rate through discrete action (Rodriguez, 198i)

          Desoite the advantages of continuous exchange rate adjustment to
correct underlying fundamental disequilibria, a number of countries during

the recent years chose to pursue a discrete -    adjustment policy. Sweden,
Snain and Greece are the most recent examples.

          Discrete adjustment 0f the nominal exchange rate has been usually

associated either with nolitical   transitions or interruptions in the normal
conduct of   exchange—rate policy. It is thus undertaIen at the beginnino of a

new qovernment1s term in office with a view towards slowing down the necessary

rate 0f devaluation in the following year and attributing the need for such

adjustment to past government policy. This was probably the pertinent scenario

in both Sweden and Snaln. Discrete adjustment is also initiated during
                        economic or
periods when for various/Institutional reasons, the real exchange rate becomes

overvalued giving.rlse to speculative runs on the currency. In both cases

the discrete adjustment of the nominal exchange rate is a response

to growing disequilibria In the economy.       Lastly, discrete adjustment is
                                — ii   —



used by r,olicy makers to influence exnectations about the future rate

of devaluation and thus the rate of inflation. It is often a signal for

a reversal in policy stance and is usually accompanied by other measures

in the fiscal or monetary domain. This is the most likely          explanation
in the Greek case. Such adjustment, if credible, could in fact have nega-

tive real effects on output and employment.

         As Calvo (1981) has shown, an unanticipated devaluation always

improves the balance of payments of a small and open economy, while below

a   certain critical deficit level, an increase in the rate of devaluation
could bring about a deterioration.         In the presence of non-traded goods,

these   results will continue to hold especially if     the   relative price of
traded to non—traded goods is altered. A devaluation of the real exchange
rate4 thus trenathensthe case for balance-of-payments improvement (Katseli,

19R3). If as a     response to an unanticipated devaluation, prices of non—
traded goods 'jump' to their steady—state value, then, even the transitory

improvement   in   the balance—of-payments could be questioned. This is espe-

cially true in develonino countries where the decrease in absorption might

be limited by inflationary expectations that lead to an increase in con-

sumotion and imports of durables or an accumulation of inventories.

Furthermore, inflationary expectations and a decrease in output might reduce

money demand offsetting the excess demand for money that is necessary for

balance—of-payments improvement. It could thus be argued that a devaluation

of the real exchange rate becomes           increasingly necessary for balance-

of-payments improvement when conditions for the smooth working of the real-

balance effect are weak.

4. Defined as the ratio of traded to non-traded oood's prices.
          Can the process of once adjustment differ deDerding on the way the

exchange rate is managed? The answer would be rositive if one analyses price—

behavior in price—setting markets as opposed to simDle auction markets. As

Gordon (1981) has noted the assumption of "pervasive heterooeneity" in types

and quality of products and in the location and timing of transactions is

crucial for such theory of price adjustment.            This anoroach thus

"undermines the new classical macroeconomic models sed on a
 one—good economy postulated by identical price—taking yeoman farmers",

 (Gordon, 1981) or Calvo'5 world of a one-family, one-good economy, where

 "the once level is the exchange rate (i.e. the         relative   price) of domestic

 currency in terms of some other given currency (Calvo, 1981).

          There is already a fairly substantive literature on the rnicro-eco—

 nomic foundations of price-adjustment. Apart from issues that are related

 to the existence of a "non-Walrasian"or 'conjectural" equilibrium,as early as

 the 1960s another set of contributions attributed partial price adjustment

 to adjustment costs and incomplete information. In that tradition one could

 cite the works by Aichian (1969),PhelPS and Winter (1970), Okun (1975) and

 more recently Blinder (1980) and others5.


           From that view point and in sharp contrast to the prototype firm

 of    traditional short-run market analysis nervasive heterogeneity and the

 cost of information makes each firm behave in the short and medium run as a

 monopolist. In that role it acts as a quantity taker and price maker.

 As    Okun has noticed, "even firms    with   minuscule market shares put price

 tags on    their corruiodities   in   the short run, they are never surprised
 by the once, and always subject to surprise about the quantities they
  sell"     (Okun, 1975, p.   360).

           Following this line of thought, Gordon (1981) has argued that the

  fundamental reason for gradual price adjustment is the "large local compo-

  nent of actual changes in demand and costs, tonether with the indenendence

  of those costs and demand changes" (Gordon, 1981, n. 522). Combining price-

setting   behavior by a typical monopolist with Lucas'analysis of exnectation

formation he has reached the following conclusions: (a) that price adjustment

will be complete if perceived marginal cost responds fully to an aggregate

shock but not otherwise ;    (b) that expected cost "mimics"expected aggregate
demand if   the   aggregate variance of a shock dominates the local variance and

(c) that only in the extreme case when the aggregate component of the variance

of both demand and cost shifts is very large relative to the local component,

as during wartime or a hyDerinfiation, price adjustment captures fully the

aggregate demand shift.

          In this view therefore heterooeneitv of nroducts make firms behave

as mononolists that nurchase their innuts and sell their outnut from/to

other firms. The extent to which a narticular shock that affects cost

and demand is nerceived as "local" or cilobal" critically affects nricina

decisions. The adjustment of once will be larcer if a shock in demand is

exoected to affect other firms as well and thus at the end ,ive rise to an

increase in the firm's innut costs.


          How can this framework be applied to exchange rate management? In the

case of a discrete      devaluation which is typically large, there is "an

announcement effect". A high—level official usually announces to all market

participants that effective immediately, prices of all traded goods will be

increased. Such announcement thus firms expectations even in the non-traded

good sector that demand for output and the cost for inputs will increase.

The increase in production cost is expected to take the form not only of an

increase in the cost of imDorted inputs but also in the cost of intermediate

or capital goods purchased from other domestic firms. In the absence of labour

contracts, labor costs are expected to rise concommitanly while in the

unionized sector, wages are expected to be adjusted at the end
                                       14 -




of   the contract period and/or contracts to be renegotiated. Discrete

adjustment of the exchange rate thus induces an expected increase in the over-

all cost of production,that is in both its local and aggregate components.

On the demand side, the larger the discrete devaluation, the greater the like-

lihood of an overall demand shift in the economy and thus the smaller the

perceived cost to the sDecific firm from raising its own price.


         A discrete adjustment of the exchanae rate thus strengthens expecta-

tions reearcinn inflttory nressures in the economy that ,ill nroduce both an

increase in demand and raraina1 costs.

         The trade—off between price and output adjustment depends on firm

specifics; However, the expected increase in marginal costs is more likely

to mirror the exnected increase in demand in the case of a discrete change

in the exchanQe rate as opposed to a crawling reg. Hence, in comparing these

two regimes one would expect price rather than output adjustment to be dorni-

nant in the former case.

          Discrete adjustment of the exchange rate induces not only an increase

in the average exnected cost of production but also in the variance of the

aggregate component as opnosed to the local component. As the local compo-

nent of actual changes in demand and costs becomes small, price adjustment

in   the specific firm    tends to anroximate the rate of devaluation.

          Usinci a simple cost-nush model that   is similar to that developed by
Gordon (1981), it is easy to show that the percentage change in price

(Pft) will be positively related to a     discrete change of the exchange rate

( is the ratio of the variance of the local comnonent of the cost shift to

the sum of the variance of the local and aggregate component.


           Apart from a known component (W) that captures information about

existing contracts, oast pricing behaviour and known institutionel factors,

expectations about non firm-specific costs E(Wt) are assumed to be positively

affected by the unexpected significant increase in the exchange rate. Thus,

where 8    is   an indexation parameter.


          Making all appropriate substitutions, it follows that,

                                                                            R —

           Given equation (4) it is easy to see that P.             is positively related
                                                               it

From (5) it follows that for any given unexpected change in the exchange

rate, P1 becomes larger as the aggregate component of the variance of costs

becomes larger in relation to the local component or W —0.                  This is pro-

bably the case when there is a switch in regimes from a smooth crawling peg,

to that of discrete exchange rate adjustment:             If this is so, then not only
                                                           Rt E(R4)

           Finally it should be noted that the increase in price will be even

larger if E(Wt)    is   made to represent the exnected aggregate change in income.

In that case, as in Gordon,equation (3)         could   be replaced by,
                                  R -   E(R)
(3')         E(W) = etwt +                     )+ (1-8)   a.

          The analysis so far limits itself to the magnitude of the price

resnonse to a discrete devaluation. One would exoect however, that

irv,ljcjt nrice contracts will       also      be rbitrarjly shortened or

renegotiated.

          In analysing labor-market contracts, Gray argues that the "optimal

contract length is inversely related to the variance of the industry-

specific shock" (Gray, 1978, n.1i). Firms are assumed to determine the

degree of indexation and the length of the labor contract by minimizing a

loss function (z) of the form,


(6)        z =
                 1/   (A.S
                             E   [tin Vt- in o)2J dt +       C   )




where 1 is the contract length and A is a relative price which converts
losses expressed as squared output deviations into losses expressed in the

units of the contracting cost.


          Intuitively the optimal contract length in Gray's analysis is     deter-
mined by a condition that at the marpin "balances the per neriod savings

on transactions costs that could be achieved by lengthening the contract

against the concomitant increased losses in the form of larger exnected

output and employment deviations". Thus while "increased uncertainty brings

about a shortening of contract length, Increased contracting costs leads

to a lengthenlnq of contracts"(Gray, 1978, o.7).

          In the case of the monopolist who determines both price and output,

it    is the cost of information that includes costs of prediction and of
establishing reliability and permanence that leads to Imolicitly long-term
contractual relationships. These considerations have to be weighed

against the profit losses that would be occured if undernricing occurs

for too long. A large discrete adjustment of the exchange rate both

reduces the cost of information as defined above and establishes, as we

have seen, firm expectations about the oersnective increase in costs.

Since   cost-oriented pricing with a mark-up offers the"most typical standard
of   fairness in buyer-seller relationships (Okun, 1975)   a discrete deva-
luation   allows sellers to pursue cost-oriented price increases. Thus a

discrete   devaluation as opposed to a crawling peg reduces the cost that
the firm bears in explaining to its customers the reason for the price
increase leading to a renegotiation of existing contracts.

         The length of the new contracts is probably indeterminate as firms

attempt to guess the intentions of the Central Bank. This is especially true

if the discrete adjustment is a break from past exchange rate management

oractices. If firms after some initial period believe that the policy marks

a switch In regimes from a crawling peg torwards a regime of discretly

adjustable exchanne rates and that the established rate is in fact tenable,

then implicit price contracts will be again renegotiated for corresponding

periods of time.

         Uncertainty as to the Central Bank's intentions calls on the other

hand for short—period lags. Finally the length of the renegotiated contracts

will probably be the same as before if after the discrete adjustment the

exchange rate continues to crawl. In all cases the contract length will also

be affected by expectations about economic fundamentals and the ability of

policy to correct existing disequllibria.

        In summary what can be said unambiguously is that a discrete

exchange rate adjustment will give rise to recontracting and, in the

absence of a clear signal on the part of the government as to its inten-

tions, an increased tendency for shorter-oeriod contracts. This conclu-

sion is similar to that of Aizenmann(1982) who in a different context

argues that sithe optimal frequency of wage re—contracting depends on measures

of aggregate volatility".

        The objective of this section s to investigate empirically whether

the resnons1vensofnon-tradd 1ood ririces to exchange rates was faster

in the neriod following the January, 1983 devaluation. For this reason

the analysis is conducted at the aqqregate,sectoral and nroduct level

usino monthly data for two distinct periods namely the whole r%eriod 1979.1 -

1983.12 (lono neriod) and the neriod 1979.1 - 1982.12 (short period).

         Table I nresents a summary of exchangerate statistics. The abbre-

viated notation for all variables is oiven in Table 2.   It can be readily

seen that both the standard deviation and the coefficient of variation of

the effective and bilateral exchange rate increased as we move from the

short to the lona period. This Is largely attributed to the January 1983

devaluation (Piaarams I and 2)WhiCh was the largest discrete adjustment

of   the exchanae rate since the beginning of the crawling-peg period.

       The nominal devaluation of the exchanne rate in January nroduced

a real exchane rate devaluation durino the first iuarter of the year of

the order o 7-12% denendino on the index used to calculate the real ef-

fective exchange rate (Table 3). By the second ciuarter of 1983 however,

the real effective exchanae rate returned rounhlv to its 1980 level as re-

lative nrices deteriorated thus dissinatinri some of the effects of the

nominal adjustment.



           Looking more closely at the time series properties of exchange

  rates prior and after the discrete adjustment of January 1983, Tables4

  and 5 DreSent the autoreoressivestructure of the relevant series for

  both oeriods. Each variable is regressed against nast values of itself

  goina back roughly to two quarters. As was exnected, the exchange rate

  series can be described as an AR1 or random walk process where the first

  lag coefficient is close to unity in both periods. This implies that

  only the constant ternhis significant in the autoregressive structure

  of first differences. The identification of the Greek exchange rate

  with an AR1 process is consistent with similar results obtained for

  most other Eurooean countries. In almost all cases, the current

  neriod's exchance rate nroves to be the best predictor of next period's

  rate (Katseli, 1982). As was to be exoected,the coefficient of the

  constant term increases in the long as onnosed to the short neriod when

  the change in exchange rates is shown to be more sluggish (Table 5).

           Contrary to the experience of most European countries, whole-

  sale prices also tend to exhibit nroperties of an AR1 process     (Tables

  6 and 7). In Katseli (1982) this finding also characterized price

adjustment     in Italy, both hicih-inflation countries in the neriod under

consideration. Only the rice index of exported products (PE) exhibits

higher order autoregressive properties probably as a result of conscious

pricing     policy. The coefficient of the first-month lag of non-traded qoods
 (LNT) is   typically smaller than that of traded goods but rises considerably
between the two periods under consideration. The same is true for all
price indices implying that the adjustment of prices is on the average

faster when 1983 is included in the sample period. This is also reflected

 in the fact that the coefficient of the constant term in Table 7 increases

 in all cases in the long as opposed to the short period. In the case of

 the NT index, the average monthly rate of change increases from 1.7 to

 1.9 orecent across periods imrlyinq an even larger rate of increase in

 1983 alone. In both DLPM and DLPE autoregressions,inclusion of 1983

 raises the coefficient of the constant terms and reduces the coefficients

 of the significant lagaed terms.

             These results seem to sunport the           hypothesis       that the adjustment

 of prices of both traded and non—traded goods is faster in 1983 as op—

 Dosed to orevious years. The relationship of this development to ex-

 change rate behaviour strengthens the evidence that the discrete de-

 valuation of 1983 produced an almost              instantaneous        reaction of prices

 of both traded and non-traded goods alike.

             When DLGI is reiressed against lagged values of itself and

 against current and laoqed values of the exchange rate (effective and

 bilateral),    the coefficient of the current exchange rate change term
 becomes    large and significant only In the period that includes 1983 (Table                  8).

The same holds true in the case of DLNT where the current effective

exchange rate change (DLEFE) seems to influence the current change of

non—traded good prices only in the long period. The results are more

mixed when the bilateral exchange rate i used instead        (Table 9.1).

What these results seem to indicate is that adjustment of nontraded

good prices and exchange rates become contemporaneous when 1983 is in-

cluded. This can be seen clearly in Diagrams 3 and 4 where the ex-

chancie rate and once adjustment in January 1983 is connietely

yIILflrurI ___J
           ieu.

          Two additional points concerning price adjustment of non-traded

goods are also worth noting. The evidence .resented in Diagrams 3 and 4

Is also confirmed by the relatively low explanatory oower of equations

1 and 2 in Table 9. Over the whole neriod, the exchange rate is only

partially responsible for the observed variation in non-traded-good prices

as other factors such as imoorted inflation, wage rate adjustment, mone-

tary   develooments and the position of the economy over the business cycle
become more important. It is    only in January 1983 that the devaluation
of   the currency becomes the dominant factor that explains most of the

variation in LNT. Lack of consistent monthly data prevent a disaggregated

analysis along these lines. Using quarterly data however it can be shown

that for the whole period 1979.11 -   1983.IV,   the home-currency price of

imported goods is the most important explanatory variable of DLNT. This

variable reflects changes both in foreign prices and exchange rates and thus

picks up the significant terms—oftrade shocks of the oeriod such as the

second oil-price increase. As one would expect the explanatory power of

the estimated equation is raised considerably (equation 5 in Table 9.11)

when this variable is included.

          Lack of sufficient disaggregation in the provision of data also

unables us to analyse effectively the relationship of pricing behavior

to expectations regarding exchange rate adjustment. According to the evidence n

sented in Table 9, a 10% devaluation of the effective exchange rate is

expected to raise the prices of non-traded goods by 1.4% during the same

month. The unexpected component of the price change between two con-

secutive months is picked up by the residual in the estimated

equation. The vector of estimated residuals from the estimated price

equation can thus be correlated or regressed against the current and

lagged value of residuals obtained from an exchange rate adjustment equa—

tl'an.       Such exercise permits an analysis of the resnonsiveness of prices

to exchange rate Thews       When monthly and quarterly data   were used however

the results were totally uninformative. The correlation coefficient of

residuals was positive but low (never exceeding .12). Similarly, the

coefficient of the current and lagged unexpected change in the exchange

rate never Droved to be significantly different from zero.

         These results nrobably reflect the structure of expectations reaardina

exchange rate developments. Since exchange rates are announced daily,

expectations are formed or revised in a daily basis as well. What would

have been interesting in that case is to proceed with the above analysis

using daily data. Unfortunately only anecdotal evidence of price adjust-

ment following the Janauary 9th devaluation exists precluding an eco-

nometric analysis of the second-order autoregressive system. Further-

more, since most of the price adjustment was completed within a few

days following the devaluation, the adjustment of prices can be ade-

quately explained by the expected component of the exchange rate change

when monthly data are used.

       The wholesale price index for non-traded goods is a weighted ave-

rage of sectoral indices. The food-industry sector exciudinci beverages

(K20) nocesses the largest weighting coefficient (18.1%).. In 1980 only

6.6% of the total consumption of processed food was imported, while 90%

of the total production originating in 51 local firms was directed towards

the home market. Furthermore, the ratio of imported intermediate and ca-

pital goods to total production costs was 19.2%, one of the lowest ratios

in all industrial sectors The food industry could then be classified

on all grounds as a non—traded good sector.

       Diagrams 5 and 6 present the monthly variation of the price index

(DLK 20) against that of the effective and bilateral exchange rate. It

is relatively easy to see that the change in the exchange rate almost

systematically precedes price adjustment by two-months. This is con-

firmed by the econometric evidence presented in Table 10 where DLK 20

is regressed against past values of itself and current and lagged values

of the exchange rate. In both time periods (1979.5 - 1982.12; 1979.5 -

1983.12) once adjustment annears relatively sluggish with the own first
and second—month lag generally significant and the second lag on the

drachma-dollar exchange rate significant in both time periods.

        There Is no clear evidence however that the responsiveness of

the price to an exchange rate change is significantly altered in the

long period even though the coefficient of the constant term and the

overall explanatory nower of the regression increases when 1983 is

included.

        The ambiguity in the results as one moves from the aggregate to

the sectoral data has to do with the composition of the indexand insti-

tutional factors affecting price behavior.

        The sectoral index itself is a weighted average of price of products

that minht or micht not be exemnt from rrice controls.

        The legal basis for price controls is provided in the HMarket_

Law Code" that essentially classifies products into three categories:

     a) essential and in short sunnly

     b) essential and not in short supply

     c) non-essential.


        The first category includes basic consumer goods for which in

most cases,a maximum price is set. For some goods in this category and for all

goods in the second category which are considered essential hut not key con-

sumer goods, the Ministry of Coninerce sets a.maximum allowable mark-up

over average unit costs. The third category includes goods which are

essentially exempt from controls (Lalonde and Papandreou, 1984).

        The behaviour of product prices and hence of the aggregate

sectoral index is thus affected by the Ministry's actions in adjust-

ing the price ceiling as a result of firm    pressure.   This is especial-

ly true in the food sector where a large number of products fall in

the first category.

        Diagram 7 exhibits as an examole the rate of change of flour

Drices over a ten-year oeriod. Since flour Is considered an essential

comodity a once ceiling Is set by the Ministry. Effective prices are

almost always set at the price ceiling. As can be seen in the diagram,

the price has been tynically adjusted once a year during the sumer months.

The 1983 price adjustment that occured in August was the largest one in

three years that is 18.7%. Firms producino flour have limited possibili-

ties to diversify their nroduction.7 Hence, the increase in perceived

costs implied by the devaluation gives rise to a fall in profits and a re-

duction in output or quality. As can be seen in Table 12 average production

of grain mill products during the first six months of 1983 decreased by 4.5%

relative to the corresnondina averaae in 1982.

       A different type of response is evidenced by firms which diversify

their production across control categories, such as dairy—roduct firms.

Theseusually produce milk, butter, cheese and yoqhurt, all items under

price controls, as well as ice—cream which is not subject to controls. While

firms still exercise pressure to adjust the price ceilinq, losses in

profits and output are mitigated by rapid price adjustment in the non-

controlled items. As can be seen in Table 11, while the prices of all

controlled dairy products increased between 12-14% within the first quar-

ter of 1983, ice—cream nrices were adjusted by almost 10% between December

1982 and January 1983 and by 33% between December 1982 and March 1983.

(Diagram 8). As there is no reason to exDect that relative costs for

ice—cream   production increased during that period due to any other
factor, it is reasonable to arque that the perceived increase in costs
due to the devaluation was met by twice overshooting in the non-control-
led items. Output of dairy products stayed roughly constant between the

two periods.

         Finally within the same sector, there exist firms which produce

commodities in categories (b) and (c) of the Market Code. Such firms for

example produce tomato juice, tomato oulp,canned fruits and fruit juices.

7. Flour mills usually oroduce flour and farina, which is also included
    in the first catenorv.

 In that case, price adjustment is distributed more evenly across goods.

 As can be seen in Tables 11 and 12 whereas the price of tomato juice and

 tomato pulp increased by 8.70% and 2.90% in March and February respective-

 ly, prices of canned fruits rose sharply in January and February and fell

 in March, that is when the prices of the controlled items were allowed to

 Increase. Production of canned fruits and vegetables rose by 30% in the

 first semester of 1983 relative to 1982 as firms were able to capture a

 larger share of the domestic market relative to imports.

                                                                        devaluation
          The analysis so far suggests that firms responded to the discrete!

in an expected fashion. If prices are not allowed to change due to insti-

tutional or other factors then the expected increase in costs implied by

the devaluation brings about a decrease in profits and a decrease in out-

put. The drop in output could be mitigated by the expected increase in

demand   depending on the cross elasticity of substitution across domestic
and imported final goods. In diversified firms, on the other hand, the
loss In profits is cushioned by selective increases in the price of parti-

cular items and output expansion for those anods for which demand increases.

          The analysis also confirms the hypothesis that,regardless of control-

classification.prjceadjustnt is generally sluggish so that.a monopolistic

price adjustment model is a suitable one for the pricing behaviour of firms.

'Price contracts" are evidenced in all product cases. Even though their

length depends on institutional factors, a cursory look at nriclnq behavinr

suggests that at least in the non—controlled sector contracts iave in fact

been shortened as aggregate exchange rate variability rose (Diagrams 8 and 9).

The evidence also suggests that recontracting occured almost instantly at

the non-controlled sector and organised pressure by firms to relax price.:
ceilings was successful within a few months especially in the category

(b) classification.

         Overall the arbitrary control in prices by central authorities

did not seem to mitigate in the medium-run the inflationary consequences

of the devaluation, in the presence of a large and discrete adjustment

of the exchange rate, the   price   level was adjusted earlier than expected

mitigating   the increase in demand for non-traded goods and thus exacerbat-
ing the stagflationary effects of the devaluation.
