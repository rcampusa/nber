                                           ABSTRACT

This paper documents four basic facts about investment goods and investment prices. First,

investment has a very significant nontradable component in the form of construction services.

Second, distributions services (wholesaling, retailing, and transportation) are much less important

for investment than for consumption. Third, the import content of investment is much larger than

that of consumption. Finally, in the aftermath of three large devaluations, the rate of exchange rate

pass-through is, perhaps not surprisingly, highest for imported equipment and lowest for

construction services.

    There is a large literature that studies the importance of tradable goods in
consumption and the comovement between consumer prices and exchange rates.
In contrast, there is a paucity of work on the characteristics of investment goods
and the comovement of their prices with exchange rates. This paper summarizes
four basic facts about investment goods and investment prices. First, nontrad-
able goods and services have a very significant weight in investment expenditure,
with construction services being the most important nontradable component. The
weight of nontradables is, nevertheless, lower in investment than in consumption
spending. Second, distribution services (wholesaling, retailing, and transporta-
tion) are much less important for investment goods than for consumer goods.
Third, the fraction of goods that is imported is much larger for investment than
for consumption. Finally, in the three large devaluation episodes for which we
obtained investment prices (Mexico (1994), Korea (1997), and Argentina (2001)),
construction prices respond by much less to movements in the exchange rate than
the prices of equipment respond.
    These facts have clear implications for theoretical work on open economy mod-
els. In particular, the standard assumption that investment goods are tradable is
clearly at odds with the data. Modeling investment as requiring local construction
services may be a better approach to generating plausible investment dynamics
in open economy models than the standard investment adjustment costs formula-
tion.1 The composition of investment is also important for models that emphasize
the role of collateral constraints.2 Finally, modeling the nontradable component of
investment is likely to be important in understanding the behavior of investment
in the aftermath of large devaluations.

The Importance of Construction Services in Investment Expenditure
Before discussing the role of nontradables in investment, it is useful to review
the basic facts about the composition of consumption. The direct weight of non-
tradable services in the typical consumer price index (CPI) basket is roughly 50
percent.3 The total weight is, however, closer to 75 percent, because the tradable
goods that enter the CPI basket are purchased in retail stores and thus embody an

production input, which can be interpreted as construction services, plays an important role.

important component of distribution services (retailing, wholesaling, and trans-
portation), which are clearly nontradable. According to the estimates in Burstein,
Neves, and Rebelo (2003), the distribution margin (the fraction of the retail price
that represents distribution services) is roughly 50 percent. This means that dis-
tribution services account for 25 percent of the CPI basket, bringing the total
weight of nontradable goods to 75 percent.4
    The evidence summarized in Table 1 shows that the nontradable component
of investment is also significant but not as large as that of consumption. Our
data set includes input-output tables for 19 countries. The tables for 15 of these
countries were compiled by the OECD. We supplemented the OECD data set
with input-output tables for Korea, Mexico, Chile, and Argentina. We used these
input-output tables to compute the fraction of final investment that is supplied
directly by the construction sector. Table 1 shows that this fraction ranges from
a low of 35 percent for Norway to a high of 67 percent in Brazil. For the average
of the 19 countries in our sample, 51 percent of investment is supplied by the
construction sector. This suggests that roughly half of investment spending is
comprised of nontradable goods and services.
    One caveat to this conclusion is that the construction sector is a heavy user
of materials, some of which are tradable. Table 1 shows that total intermediate
inputs represent on average 57 percent of the gross output of the construction
sector. This table also reports the fraction of tradable intermediate inputs in
construction gross output.5 For the average country in our sample, this fraction is
32 percent. We view this estimate as an upper bound, since many of the materials
classified as tradable are likely to have large transportation costs and hence a low
degree of tradability.
    We conclude that the fraction of nontradable goods in investment for the
average country in our sample ranges between 51 percent (if we assume that all of
construction’s intermediate inputs are nontradable) and 35 percent (if we assume
that 32 percent of the inputs are tradable).
    Figure 1 shows that there is a clear negative relation between the weight of
construction services in investment expenditures and the country’s level of devel-
   4
     Burstein, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2003) argue that, out of the remaining 25 percent of pure
tradables, a significant fraction is represented by local goods. These local goods are produced
for the domestic market and their prices tend to behave like those of nontradable goods.
   5
     The sectors classified as tradable were sectors 1 through 24 in the OECD input-output
tables.

opment, as measured by the per capita GDP in constant U.S. dollars constructed
by Heston, Summers, and Aten (2002). The correlation between the two variables
is -0.69. This evidence suggests that, as countries develop, there seems to be a
decline in the importance of construction in investment.6
    The input-output tables compiled by the OECD do not disaggregate invest-
ment into residential and non-residential investment. To study the importance
of nontradables in nonresidential investment, we use the U.S. input-output tables
for 1992 and 1997 prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.7 Table 2 shows
that, in 1997, construction services represented 24 percent of nonresidential in-
vestment, while total nontradable services represented 41 percent of nonresidential
investment.8

The Importance of Distribution Services for Investment Goods Table
1 provides estimates of the distribution margin associated with tradable invest-
ment goods based on our input-output data. The distribution margin is defined
as: (retail price-producers price)/(retail price).9 This margin reflects the cost of
providing distribution services (wholesaling, retailing, and transportation) as well
as any markups in the distribution sector. The distribution margin for tradable
investment goods ranges from 7 percent in Spain to 29 percent in Mexico. The
average distribution margin in our sample is 17 percent. This margin is signifi-
cant, but still much lower than the margins for consumption goods reported by
Burstein, Neves, and Rebelo (2003), which range from 35 percent in France to 60
percent in Argentina.

The Import Content of Investment Table 1 also includes information, ex-
tracted from Burstein, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2003), on both the direct and
the total import content of investment. The direct import content is the fraction
   6
     Time series data for the U.S. on the share of residential and structure investment in total
investment for the period 1978-2001, also show a significant downward trend.
   7
     The U.S. 1997 input-output tables published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the
OECD do not coincide. This accounts for the diﬀerent estimates of the U.S. ratio of construction
expenditures to total investment in Tables 1 and 2.
   8
     This computation was based on the assumption that all residential investment is produced
in the construction sector.
   9
     In practice, this margin was computed as the fraction of wholesale trade, retail trade, and
transportation in tradable investment. Recall that tradable investment represents roughly 50
percent of total investment, with the remainder representing construction services.


                                               4
of final imported goods in total investment exclusive of distribution services. The
total import content is the direct import content plus the value of imported in-
termediate inputs used to produce final investment goods as a fraction of total
investment expenditures. The average direct (total) import content of invest-
ment is 17 (30) percent. The average import content of consumption reported by
Burstein, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2003) is much lower: the direct (total) import
content is 10 (19) percent. The large import content of investment is consistent
with Eaton and Kortum’s (2001) finding that the traded component of capital
goods and equipment is higher than that of manufactured goods as a whole.

Investment Prices in the Aftermath of Three Large Devaluations
   Burstein, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2002) study the behavior of consumer prices
in the aftermath of nine large devaluations. They document that the pass-through
from exchange rates to prices is high for prices of tradable goods at the dock, mod-
erate for the retail price of tradable goods, and low for the price of non-tradable
services.
    Table 3 provides some evidence on the behavior of investment prices for three
large devaluation episodes for which we obtained data on investment prices: Mex-
ico (1994), Korea (1997), and Argentina (2001). These data suggest that invest-
ment price response patterns are similar to those of consumer prices: goods and
services with a higher nontradable component tend to respond less to exchange
rate movements. In all three countries, the price of equipment moves by more
than the price of construction services.
    In Korea, which is the only country for which we have domestic and imported
equipment prices, the pass-through from exchange rate to prices is higher for im-
ported equipment than for domestic equipment. One year after the Korean 1997
devaluation, the Won-U.S. Dollar exchange rate had depreciated by 41 percent.
Investment prices increased by only 4 percent but there is substantial heterogene-
ity within investment subcategories. Imported equipment prices increased by 42
percent, while domestic equipment prices increased by 8 percent. Construction
prices increased by only 1 percent.
    Mexico and Argentina disaggregate the price of construction into labor costs
and materials prices. In both cases, materials prices move by more than labor
costs. For example, one year after the Mexican devaluation, material prices in-
creased by 40 percent, while labor costs increased by 27 percent. The analogous
numbers for the Argentina devaluation are 55 percent and 10 percent.

                                         5
    We conclude that the pass-through from exchange rates to prices is much lower
for the nontradable component of investment than for the tradable component.
This means that modeling the nontradable component of investment is likely to
be important in understanding investment dynamics in the aftermath of large
devaluations.
