        This paper provides a formal model of endogenous         country formation and of choice of

defense spending in a world with international       conflict.   The model is consistent   with three

observations.   First, secessions and, more generally, break-up of countries should follow a reduction

in the likelihood of international conflict. Second, the number of regional conflicts between smaller

countries may increase as a result of the break-up of larger countries.   Third, the size of the peace

divided -- i.e., the reduction in the defense spending in a more peaceful world -- is limited by the

process of country break-up.

1. Introduction

        The end of the cold war has been accompanied                            by a sweeping          process   of

democratizatio~     creation of new countries and political separatism.                However, even though

the probability    of a confrontation        between the two blocs of the cold war era is greatly

diminished the number of localize~ regional conflicts has not decreased;                       several observers

have in fact argued that one should expect more regional conflicts after the end of the cold

war.

       This paper provides a model which is consistent with both these observations.                         First,

it implies an increase in the number of countries as a consequence                        of a reduction in the

probability of international conflict.        Second, it argues that a reduction in the probability of

conflict among a few large countries, by increasing the number of smaller countries, may

increase the number of conflicts between the more numerous, smaller independent political

units. A related observation concerns the extent of the “peace dividend,” i.e., the reduction

in military   spending following the end of the cold war.                      Our model suggests that the

worldwide “peace dividend” may be smaller than one might expect. The reason is that the

per capita costs of defense may increase in smaller countries that have to deal with more

numerous potential regional conflicts.

       This paper joins two strands of the analytical                   literature.     One is the economic

literature on the size of countries, as in the work by Friedman (1977), Casella and Feinstein

(1990) and Wei (1992).’         Specifically, we build upon Alesina and Spolaore (1995), where




       ‘For recent surveys, see Alesina, Perotti and Spolaore (1995) and Bolton, Roland andSpolaore(1995).
                                                                                                                           2

we model the equilibrium number of countries as emerging from a trade o~ the benefits of

economies        of scale in the production              of non-rival       public goods against the costs of

heterogeneity in the population, h the present paper an additional benefit of size arises from

the consideration of potential international conflicts and the cost of defense.                        The second line

of research is the literature on conflict resolution and arms races recently surveyed by

Sandier and Hartley (1995).                Classic references are Schelling (1960), Boulding (1962),

Olson and Zeckhauser (1966) and Ttilock (1974).                      In particular, in our formalization             of the

technology of conflict resolution, we follow Hirshleifer (1989, 1995).2

          This paper is organized            as follows,        Section 2 describes the model.                 Section 3

illustrates    the ‘domestic’ equilibrium on the choice of defense and non defense spending.

Section 4 characterizes a symmetric equilibrium in which the number and size of countries

is endogenously          determined.        Section 5 discusses issues of stability, and specifically,

unilateral secessions.         The last section concludes.




2. The Model

         The world is modeled as a segment of length normalized to 1.3 The world population

has mass 1 and is uniformly distributed on the segment [0, 1]. A coun~                              is defined by two

borders and anon-rival public goo~ which we label the ‘government’.                              Each individual can



         ‘See also Tulloek (1980) and Gtidel      (1994).

          3We wuld model the world as a circle, but this modeling choice, even though it would produce qualitatively similar
results would introduce mecessary   applications,
                                                                                                   3

only use one public good, i.e., 1 government,         and individual utility is decreasing in the

distance from the government of the country to which the individual belongs.         The distance

of individual i from his government is denoted ii.         We assume that this distance captures

both a geographical and a preference dimension.         That is, being “far” from the government

implies being distant both in geographical location and preferences; in other words, if two

individtis   live fm from each other, they ae also distant in preferences.   Hence, the location

of a government captures both a position on an ideological dimension and on a geographical

line. As discussed in more detail in Alesina and Spolaore (1995), this assumption ensures

that countries are geographically    connected.     An alternative assumption would be to retain

only the preference interpretation   of distance and then impose costs on non geographically

connected countries. For the purpose of this paper the “preference” interpretation    of distance

is not necessary, although it makes the model richer.

        Individual utility is given by:


                                     Ui=zi-ti-gli                                            (1)



where Zi is the total income available to individual i , ti are his taxes, li is the distance of

individual i fi-om his govemmen$ and g is a positive parameter.        Thus, individual utility is

linear in private consumption     (zi - ti ) and linear in the distance from the public good.

The utility deriving from the public good is highest for li = O.
                                                                                                                          4

         The cost of a government              is K, irrespectively        of the size of the country.               This

specification captures in the simplest possible way the benefit of “size” of a country.4                               In

facg with a fixed cost of government the average per capita cost of financing is decreasing

with the size of the country.

         In reality, the benefits of country size derive from several fixed costs, including

creating and maintaining a monetary system, a bureaucracy,                     a tax collection system. Also,

in a world of less than perfect free trade, the size of markets is affected by the size of

political jurisdictions,     In the extieme case of complete autarky the two coincide: the market

size is the size of the country.        Thus, in any model with increasing returns in the size of the

market economy, and some barriers to international trade, income is increasing in the size

of the country.5         Also, even though this argument is not explicitly accounted for in the

model, a large country can provide insurance to its regions, needed because of regional

idiosyncratic shocks.b Thus, in equilibrium the size of countries emerges from a trade-off,

Large countries can take advantage of the benefits of size, but are less homogeneous                              since

a larger popdation has more diverse preferences. As the size of a country increases, the cost

per capita of government            decreases, but the average distance from the government,                         i.e.,

heterogeneity      increases.




           4Amore general specification would be to impox K = a + ~s wheres is the size of the country. As long as a >0
our results would be qualitatively unchangd.

         5S= Alesina and Spolaore (1 995) and Spolaore(1995b)     for more discussion on this point,

                                                                                                5

       We now consider the role of international conflict and defense spending.     Individual

resources Zi are divided into two components:


                                         zi=y+ei                                          (2)



y is individual income (equal for everybody), which is “safe” from the consequences          of

conflict; ei is the expected amount of resources available to individual i afier a @ossible)

international conflict is resolved.

       Conflict is modeled as follows.    Individuals are randomly matched pairwise.    When

a pair (i, j) meets, the two individuals generate a pool of resources equal to 2 e which has

to be divided. There are two possible states: conflict (c) and no conflict (n c). In a state

of n c resources are distributed (peacefully) and equally:


                                         ei=ej=e                                          (3)



       We assume that:

       Al:     If two individuals who belong to the same country meet, they are always in a

state of no conpict,

If two individuals, i andj, who do not belong to the same country meet, they can either be

in conflict or in no conflict, in which case (3) applies.    Conflict occurs with probability

p (i, j) . The following assumption generates a role for defense spending:
                                                                                                       6

         A2:     IfconJict   occurs, the share of individual i depends on the defense spending

of his count~,    relative to defense spending of the count~ of individual j:



                                                                                                 (4)




where di ( d~) is the defense spending in the country of individual i ~) and $’>           0 .

         The rationale behind these assumptions should be clear.            Al rules out domestic

conflict.    In fact we could assume an additional cost for a country for internal “law and

ordef’ and conflict resolution (courts, legal system etc.). If this cost were increasing in the

size of the country, it would provide an additional argument for the costs of size, in addition

to the “average distance” argument emphasized above. If these costs were linear, our results

would be completely unaffected, If these costs were decreasing in the size of countries (i. e.,

economies of scale in law and order) they would provide an additional benefit for size.

         The second assumption borrows from the literature on conflict resolution,          and in

partictiar horn Tullock (1980), Hirshleifer (1989, 1995) and Gtilnkel         (1994).   The idea is

that the benefits for the individuals of a certain coun~      in case of international conflict are

increasing in the military strength of the country relative to the opponent.     We are assuming

that spending on defense translates into military strength.         Thus we are abstracting from

Merent      ‘productivities’ of defense spending in different countries.   “Conflict” in our model

should be interpreted quite generally as a war (cold or hot), military “muscle flexing” or
                                                                                                                                                    7

            me second one represents a drastic simplification                                  since it implies that all individuals

 have the same probability of being matched.                                       Hence, it implies that tie probability of a

 match is independent of the distance between the pair, and independent of the coun~                                                                of

 notations and computations,                      but should not change the qualitative nature of our results.

3. Voting on Government and Defense

       Individuals vote by majority n.de on the location (type) of govement     and on the size

of defense. We make the following two assumptions:

A5     Voting on the location of government and the size of defewe occur after the country

       borders hme been established,

       This is a natural assumption since it implies that policy decisions on the type of

govement       and the amount of defense spending can be taken only after a country is created.

A6    In each country, trees are the same for everyone.
                                                                                                                9

            Two observations emerge immediately from the structure of the model:

            i)        For given borders, every citizen has the same preferences               on the optimal

                      amount of defense; and

            ii)       The govement      is located in the middle of the country,

The first observation derives from the fact, embodied in (7), that every individual has the

sme probability of meeting a foreigner and individual payoffs all depend identically on the

country’s aggregate level of defense. This result would not hold if, for instance, individuals

close to the borders had a higher change of engaging in conflicts with foreigners.                     In the

latter case, border individuals would prefer a higher spending on defense.

            The second result derives from a straightforward                application of the median voter

theorem           over the choice of location       of the govement,            noting that this choice, by

assumption,           does not influence individuals’      taxes, nor their desired amount of defense.

Assumption A6 implies that taxes cannot be a function of the (unique) parameter which

varies across individuds: the distance from the government. This assumption can be justified

in two ways. First, to the extent that individual location captures a preference dimension,

unobservability          of preferences would imply that taxes linked to preferences            are generally

unfeasible.g          Second, Alesina and Spolaore (1995) derive this assumption as a result of a

realistic         voting process on the distribution       of the tax burden.          With the same tax for

eve~one, individuals close to the government are better off than those far from it. If taxes




        eWe do not explore here a comection with the literature on revelation mechanisms,
                                                                                                  10

were decided by majority vote, those individuals who are fw from the govement                 would

favor tax compensation     schemes in their favor.    Such schemes might also enforce larger

countries, by keeping border individuals “in”, with tax advantages.        Alesina and Spolaore

(1995) consider linear taxation schemes, where the tax rate is a linear tiction      of the distance

from the govermnent.     They show that, under some weak assumptions,             if voting on taxes

occurs after country borders are decided (exactly as assumption A5 requires), then the voting

equilibrium   implies the same tax for everyone and the government located in the middle.

The intuition is that for given borders, fifty percent of the voters (those with a distance from

the government    above average) wodd like to maximize compensations.                The other half

would want to minimize       them.    The tie is broken if one assumes even infinitesimal

implementation costs of these tiansfer schemes. In summary, under realistic assumptions on

the order of voting, a majority would favor equal taxes.       Thus, A6 could be derived as a

result rather than imposed as an assumption.      Since our focus here is not on compensation

schemes, we simply impose A6 from the start.

       With taxes equal for every citizen the budget constraint for country h of size s~

implies:


                                               K+dh
                                        th =                                                    (9)
                                                 ‘h



The f~st order condition which determines the desired amount of defense by each individual

of country h is obtained using (l), (7), and (9) as follows:
                                                                                                         11


                                                          d:
                          -_ 1                                        2e=0
                                  +Px          ~j                                                    (lo)
                             ‘h         h’=h        (dh   + d;)’


Equation (10) shows that the marginal costs of an extra unit of defense spending (equal to
 1
      7 from (9)) have to equal the marginal benefits, in terms of a higher ‘prize’ in case of
 ‘h
conflicts, which is the second term in (10) obtained from (7).




4. The Equilibrium Number of Countries

        We now characterize       an equilibrium number of countries.               In the next section we

discuss its stability, including the possibility of unilateral secessions.           The first requirement

which we impose on an equilibrium configuration of borders is the following:

Requirement      1: No individual (or group of individuals)                  can be forced to belong to an

existing country if he prefers to belong to a different one.

        This feature of equilibrium       is a benchmark,            in which countries    cannot impose

restrictions   on individuals who want to join or exit. Remember that individuals are not

physically mobile. Thus “joining a country” means moving the border of that country.                  This

requirement    implies a condition of indifference at the border: the individual at the border

must be indifferent   on the choice of which coun~                  to belong to. The following result is

immediate:

        Proposition 1.

        Countries of equal size, with the government located in the middle and with the same

amount of defense spending, satisfi Requirement                1.
                                                                                                       12

         The proof is immediate, remembering that everyone pays the same tax.             Proposition

1 does not imply that the only type of equilibria which satisfies Requirement          1 has countries

of equal size.     We return on this point in section 5 in the context of our discussion of

stibility.   Note, however, that given our assumption of uniform distribution of individuals,

equilibria with equally-sized countries are the natural candidates.       In turn, if all the countries

have equal size, the natural candidates for an equilibrium is the symmetric one, with each

country spending the same amount on defense. Using ( 10), the symmetric equilibria              with    N


 countries of equal size s       (so that N = ~)         implies that each country spends d“            in
                                              s
defense:


                                    ~.=s(l–s)pe
                                                                                                 (11)
                                                    2


         Several observations     are in order.     First, the equilibrium    amount of defense is

increasing in the probability of conflict. Not surprisingly, it is also increasing in the amount

of the payoff from conflict e. Second, defense spending is zero when there is only one

country in the world, since, by deftition,        there is no conflict.   Third, defense pro capita,

which is:


                                     d“
                                     —=      (1 -s)pe
                                                                                                 (12)
                                      s              2


is decreasing with coun~        size. Larger countries have, in equilibrium, a lower per capita

defense bill.    Fourth, since defense is, from the point of view of global efficiency, pure
                                                                                                                  13

waste, individual utility would be maximized if p = O and d * = O. In fact, if p > 0

and d~ = d * for every country using (7) one can verifi that ei = e for every i, exactly

as in the case of p = O. When p > 0, however, the “price” of the payoff e is the per capita

cost of defense given in ( 12). Obviously, we have a suboptimd Nash equilibrium on defense

spending.

        Empirically,       the relationship         between       country     size and defense per capita is

influenced by two critical factors which our model does not capture: the existence of military

alliances,   and the fact that smaller members of an alliance can free ride on the defense

capabilities of the larger member(s).9 Both considerations are very important, and we do not

mean to downplay them. However, we see our model as a stepping stone upon which to

build these additional realistic features.

        We now consider border redrawing by majority rule. We allow the existing countries

to eliminate a country or create a new country if the border change is approved by majority

rule in each of the countries whose borders are affected by the change. We restrict voting

only on proposals of border redrawing which satis& Requirement                           1.

R~uirewnt        2. Given a cotilguration           of countries that satisfies Requirement           1, in at least

one country a majority should oppose any proposal to redraw borders so that a new country

is created or eliminated.        Only proposals that satis~ Requirement                  1 are admissible.




        ~or a survey of the literature on this point, see Sandier and Hartley (1 995).
                                                                                                    14

        In other words, this requirement implies that in an equilibrium at least one country

would veto any border rearrangement.                  Thus, we are trying to capture situations like

referenda on the choice of joining politico-economic            unions (like the European Union), or

post-war       international   conferences    to settle border disputes, or, more generally, border

remangements        which are the result of some form of international agreement, rather than the

result of unilateral secessions, which we study in the next section.

        Corollary:         The equilibrium number of countries is decreasing with the probability

of conflict.     The size of countries is increasing with the pro babili~ of conflict.

        This is one of the critical results of the paper: it implies that a sharp decrease in the

probability of conflict would result in the break-up of countries.           Two forces underlie this
                                                                                              15

inverse relationship between   p     and fi. First, if p increases, an individual would like to

belong to a larger country in order to reduce the probability        of “being matched” with

foreigners.   Second, since defense spending increases in p          and defense per capita is

decreasing in larger countries, the benefits of size increase.   If we view the end of the cold

ww as a large drop inp, the model predicts that the creation of new countries should go hand

in hand with the end of the cold war.

        One codd expect that a large fall in the probability of conflict p (The “end of the cold

war,” should bring about a more peaceful world and a “peace dividend”, namely a reduction

in the per capita cost of defense.    However, the emergence of several local conflicts cast

doubt on the fist implicatio~ and the “peace dividend” has been slow in materializing.      Our

model is consistent with both these rather sad observations.

       Let’s begin with the amount of world coflict.     Define the mass of observable conflict

M. We have that:


                                   M@)    =p (1 -F(p))                                    (14)



where F(p)    is the equilibrium size of countries Thus, from Proposition 2:



                                                                                          (15)

        The intuition of Proposition 3 is that a reduction in p has two effects. For a given

size of countries, it reduces the mass of international conflict.   This direct effect is larger the

smaller is s, namely the larger the “mass” of international “matches”, relative to domestic

“matches”.     The second, and indirect effect, is that a reduction in p reduces the size of

countries, thus it increases the mass of international interactions that can, potentially, lead

to conflict. As equation ( 16) shows, for F small the direct effect dominates, for ~ large it

does not. Therefore, stig      from a world with a few large countries a reduction in p which

leads to the formation of many new countries may actually increase the mass of observed

conflicts.
                                                                                                      17

       A similar intuition underlies the effect of a reduction of p on defense spending per

capita. From (12) it follows that:


                          a(d”ls)          _ (1 -s)       e _ pe      ds
                                                                                                  (18)
                             ap            -         2         2      dp




       The fust term is the direct positive effect of a change in p on defense per capita: a

lower p leads to lower defense.       The second term, with the opposite sign, is the indirect

effect due to the consequences    of a change in p            on the size of countries.   Equation (18)

leads to the following:

       Proposition 4.

       A reduction in p determines a reduction of defense per capita if and on~ #


                                                   g-pe
                                    f(p)       <                                               (19)
                                                   g - pef2




       Thus, a reduction of p     may actually lead to an increase in defense spending per

capita because countries become smaller,             More generally, even when (19) holds, so that

lower p means lower defense, the model emphasizes                     a channel (through the size of

                                             d“

5. Stability

         In this section we consider the issue of stability of the equilibrium both to small

perturbations and to unilateral secessions.            We begin with small perturbations              in which one

border is moved slightly, so that a small mass e of population changes country.

         Requirement 3 ( E-Stability):           A configuration of countries is stible if afier a small e

perturbation of the border between two countries, the original equilibrium is re-established.

         Consider a cotilguration            of N countries of equal size. We know that this con-

figuration      of borders satisfies Requirement           1. But is it stable?        Suppose, without loss of

generality, that starting from the equilibrium with N countries of size s = ~ , country 1
                                                                            N
is reduced to size        s ~ =S–        E    and country 2 to size          s; =s+C.              Would the

original equilibrium be restored?            Namely, would the mass of individual c want to return

to country 1? When the size of two countries changes the following adjustments occur:

         i)        the type (location) of government in country 1 and 2:

         ii)      the defense spending of countries 1 and 2; and

         iii)     the defense spending of all the other (N - 2) countries.10

Intuitively, the third adjustment is “second order,” particularly for N large. In fact, looking

at the first order condition (equation (10)) one immediately                        verifies that the (N - 2)

countries not tiected       by the border perturbation change their choice only marginally because



         ‘Note that the location-type of government in these (N - 2) countries does not change, because their borders do
not change.
                                                                                                  19

the size of the other two countries have been reshuffled.        We can obtain analytical results

under the sirnpli~ing    assumption that the third type of adjustment is zero, namely the

(N - 2) countries not tiected         by the border change maintain their defense spending fixed.

In this case we can show the following:




Proposition 5.

       Consider a configuration of N equally sized countries.        If all the (N - 2) countries

not @fected by the border change maintain their level of defense >xed, the smallest size of

countries which is stable, ;, is a function of p,      ; @) such that:


                               i(o)       <    f(p)     p>o
                                                                                           (20)

                                 ap        -


       Proofi See Appendix.

       Thus, the minimum stable size is (weakly) increasing              p.   If p is high, small

countries   are not stable in the sense that if a perturbation    makes one country larger, the

citiens of the neighboring smaller countries would want to join the bigger country, because

defense is too expensive in the smaller country,        Thus, the implication of Proposition 5 is

that, even leaving aside Requirement           2, the minimum stable size of countries (weakly)
                                                                                                                       20

increases in p: with a higher probability of conflict, the minimum stable size of countries

is lager, 11

        We can now extend our analysis of Requirement 2 to the case where we explicitly

take into account the issue of c- stability. Namely we modi~ Requirement                             2 as follows:

        Requirement 2‘: Given a cotilguration                  of countries that satisfies Requirement               3, in

at least one country a majority should oppose any proposal to redraw borders so that a new

country is created or eliminated.             Only proposals which satisfi Requirement                  1 and 3 are

admissible.

        Numerical simulations described in Appendix show the following:

Results.

a)      The maximum number of equally-sized                       countries that satisfies Requirement               3 is

decreasing in p;

b)      The number of equally-sized countries N that satisfies Requirement                          2’ is the integer
                 I                                                                                           I

        For large values of
                                    4 g ~Kp e , we can ignore the integer condition and approximate

the number of countries that satisfies Requirement 2’ by I                        =      g ~Kpe . This number,
                                                                                      r
therefore,       not only approximates          the equilibrium         number        of countries that satisfies




        “Of course, it is possible that small increases in p leave the equilibrium size unchanged
                                                                                                 21

Requirements 1 and 2, but also the stable number of countries that satisfies Requirements         3

and 2’,

          We now turn to the issue of stability to unilateral secessions.   A unilateral secession

occurs when a (connected) set of individuals belonging to an existing country unilaterally

forms a new country,

Definition:      A country of size s is secession free, ~fno group of citizens would want to

unilaterally break away andform a new count~.

          First of all, note that if a secession occurs, three adjustments have to occur:

          i) the location of govement    and defense spending of the new country;

          ii) the location of government and the defense spending of the country which has been

            split, and

          iii) the defense spending of all the other countries not affected by the secession.

          While for the case of the e- stability the third adjustment was “second order,” this is

not the case for (potentially large) unilateral secessions.      Thus, we cannot derive results

analogous to Proposition 5.

       Note that the individuals with the highest incentives to break away are those located

far away from the government near the borders of the original country,           In fact, for given

country size, and given size of a secession, those who gain the most are those who were far

from the original government and are much closer to the government of the new country.

Clearly, the possibility of secessions impose an upper limit on country size. If a country is

too large, a fraction of its citizens at the border would break away because they are so far
                                                                                             22

from the government that they are willing to bear the costs of a higher defense bill and total

tax per capita, and lower total defense in a conflictual world.

          The fist question which we ask is whether the configuration of R countries of equal

size~.y      1
             is secession free. Numerical simulations described in the Appendix show the
          N
following results:

Result.     The size ~ is secession free.

          The simtiations imply a search over a grid of values for possible secession sizes. We

then check whether or not all the individuals in the proposed break away region are better

off after the secession.    A country is secession free if we cannot fmd a size for a possible

secession in which all the individuals who are breaking away are better off. Note that this

procedure implies (rather realistically) that nobody can be forced to unilaterally break away

from an existing country against his will.

          A second interesting question is the following.   Leaving aside Requirement   2, what

is the relationship between p and the minimum size which is secession free?      By numerical

simulations, described in Appendix we obtain the following:

Result:     The maximum size that is secession free is increasing in p.

          In other words, when the probability of a conflict increases, larger countries that

would not have been secession-free for a smaller p become secession free. Conversely, a

sharp drop in p would induce certain regions to secede, which would not have seceded with

a higher p. Therefore, even leaving aside the equilibrium number of countries ~ obtained
                                                                                                  23

applying     Requirement     2, this result on secessions establishes that one should observe a

break-up of countries when, for whatever reason, the probability of conflict decreases.

         This observation is quite important because it underlies the generality of the direct

relationship    between country size and probability of international       conflict.   In fact, this

relationship emerges simply as a result of the secession-free requirement, regardless of any

other requirement which (like Requirement 2) identifies a specific equilibrium number of

countries.




6. Conclusions

         This paper provides a model consistent with three obsemations.     First, secessions and,

more generally,        break-up   of countries    should go hand in hand with a reduction          of

international   conflict,   Second, the number of conflicts among small countries may go up,

as a result of the break-up of previous larger political units,      Third, the size of the ‘peace

dividend’ is influenced by the process of country break-up which follows the reduction in

the likelihood of international conflict.

         While these implications of the model appear quite consistent with recent events, we

should     emphasize     several limitations     of our approach.   First and foremost,    we have

completely ignored the role of alliances and the related problem of free riding in defense

spending by smaller members.          To some extent, one can reinterpret the ‘country’ of our

model as a group of allied countries, and view our model of country formation as a model

of alliance formation, However, the analogy can be pushed only to a point, because critical
                                                                                                 24

issues of bargaining (and fi-ee riding) amongst allied countries cannot be addressed.      Second,

our model of conflict is somewhat rudimentary,          since we assumed that the probability of

conflict amongst citizens of different countries is the same around the world. It could be

interesting     to consider extensions in which the probability of conflict between groups of

individuals may depend on their geographical and/or preference          distance, and/or on other

political,     economic and social characteristics.    Third, we almost exclusively     focused on

symmetric equilibria.        Fourth, the equilibrium concepts we have used to determine the

endogenous        configuration   of countries   are based on “self determination”      and voting

mechanisms. Although these concepts may be appropriate to study a completely democratic

worl~ they are fa from realistic, especially in situations of international conflict.    However,

the general principles behind our results are likely to be robust with respect to different

specifications of the process of country formation.       For instance, Spolaore (1995a) derives

similar restits for the case of a world in which governments are modeled as rent-maximizing

Leviathans.       Fifth, our assumption concerning the identity between the geographic          and

preference dimension excludes the consideration of ethnic minorities.        In the context of our

model, in fact an ethnic minority could be viewed as a group of individuals with preferences

very different from those of individuals on their right and left geographically.     In reality, the

existence      of ethnic minorities   is a critical determinant   of both country formation     and

secessions and of regional conflicts,        More generally, focusing on continuous,       uniform

distinctions     of individual characteristics   allows us to study some important and robust

relationships     between conflict, defense and country size with the minimum amount of
                                                                                            25

notational and analytical complexity. However, additional insights can probably be obtained

by extending and modifiing       the basic framework in order to allow for asymmetries     and

discontinuities.   These extensions are lefi for fiture research.

        Despite all these caveats, the contribution of this paper consists in building if not a

bridge at least a wire between the literature on country formation and the literature on

international conflict and defense spending.

          In words, for a small perturbation of the border between two countries, total defense

is larger in the larger country, but defense per capita, thus taxes per capita are higher in the

smaller country.       We are now ready to prove the Proposition.

          Define F(0)     as the minimum stable size, for p = O. From the results of Alesina

and Spolaore (1995) we know that for p = O, F(O) = l/~, where                            N is the largest integer

                   g     Firs$wewantto            prove that f@)          > ~(0) foranyp        >0.     Ifp    = O

the condition for stability can be written as follows:


                                  s-&             K
                           g(y)-—                       <g(?       ~)+L                                  (A.24)
                                             s–c                             s+&




Suppose      now that      F(p)     < f(0)        ,      For some         p >0     , choose      s‘    such that

f~)    < s’ < ~ (0) . Consider the c perturbation when s = s’ , Since s’ < F(O)                                   if

p = O the individual at the new border prefa the bigger coun@. Since s ‘> F(p) forp >0

the border individual prefers the smaller country,                  This is a contradiction,     since if p > 0

defense pro capi~ thus taxes per capita, are higher in the smaller country and total defense,

thus the expected revenue from conflict, are lower in the smaller coun~.                              Thus if the

individual at the border between counties                  of size s‘ + c and s‘ - c prefers the bigger

country     for p = O        he cannot            prefer     the   smaller     country    for p >0.           Thus,

~(p)   z F(O) forp         > 0.         Consider       now p‘ > p.            A similar argument       based on

contradiction    establishes that        f (p’)       > s (p); thus it follows that the fmction         f(p)      is

weakly increasing in p,       Q.E.D.

         Consider N countries of equal sizes = lN.      Suppose that a small perturbation takes

place      al the border   between country   1 and coun~        2,     so    that   S/ = s - E   md

s: =s+       c. The other N-2 counties remain of size s. All countries adjust their defense

spending tier the perturbation.    New defense spending in country 1 (2) will be denoted by

d{ (d;).     Defense spending in the remaining N-2 countries is denoted by d’. Then, d{ , d;

       For any given vector of parameters @e, g, ~ and for any given configuration                of N

that would be chosen, respectively,         in country 1, country 2, and in the remaining N-2

muntries when the border between coun~ 1 and coun~ 2 is perturbate~ so that a fraction e = Is

of the population    of country 1 joins country 2, where 1 is a number much smaller than 1.

These values can be obtained by solving the system (A-25 )-(A-27) numerically.                 Table 1

shows the values of ~~, ~~, and d~, for p e = 500.

       By using the above defense values, we can then calculate the utility U[ (u;) of the

individual at the border between country 1 and coun~           2 if she belongs to country 1 (country

The values of u{ and u; are reported in Tables 1 and 2 for different values of g and K. If

U( > u; , the individual at the border would like to join the smaller country.                 In this case,

the original cotilguration     would be stable. By contrast, if u: < u;, the individual at the

border would like to join the larger country, henceforth ampli~ing               the perturbation.     In the

latter case, the original cotilguration           is not stable (i.e., it does not satisfi Requirement    3).

Tables 1 and 2 indicate with “1” whether U( > u;, (stability)                 and with “O” the opposite

case     (instability),      for      different        values       of   g,    when      pe    = 500 and

K = 0.5 (Table       1) and K = 4 (Table 2) .

       For any given value of the vector ( pe, g, K), we can then find the maximum N that

satisfies Requirement 3, i.e., that is stable (note that if N is stable, so is N-1). Let Nc denote

the maximum number of equally-sized                 countries that satisfies Requirement      3, i.e., that is

stable (or, more specifically,       c-stable).

       Table 3 shows the values of NE for different values of the parameters                                      @e, g, ~.

       1)    N’ is decreasing in pe. This result is illustrated in Figures 1-4 for selected


values of g and K.


       2)        N’ is always c-stable;              N“ is e-stable           for values of pe larger than the


critical value p= defined by the following equation: 14



                                                                                                                     (A.30)



Hence, if N“ is e-stable,          the number N which satisfies Requirement                        2’ is equal to N“.

Otherwise, it is equal to N’, which is always stable.




Secession-Free     Equilibria

       Consider N countries of equal sizes.                 Consider a secession of size z taking place in

country 1. Then, we have a new coun~                      of size z spending dZ in defense.                      The rest of

country 1, being now of size s-z, spending dJ_Z in defense, and the remaining N- 1 countries,

This individual would be in favor of (against) a unilateral secession of size z as long as u.

is smaller (larger) than            us , and be indifferent           in the case u~ = us.            For a given

configuration       of N countries          of size s = IN,             we can calculate           the values       of

u. and us associated         with different possible          secessions     of size z = 1s, where k takes

different values between Oand 0,5. Similar calctiations, mutatis mutatiis,                      can be performed

for values of A larger than 0.5.               If u.     is smaller than u~for some values of A, that

configuration will not be secession free. On the other hand, if for every A u~ z us, we can

say thats = l/N is secession-free.

          Table 4 shows the values of defense per capita and of u~and u~for g = 800,                        K = 0.5,

and pe = 50. The k’s take values between .05 and .516 In this example, s = 1/2 ands = 1/3

(N= 2 andN = 3) are not secession tiee. Up to 25% of the citizens of each country of size

s would be happier if they could form a smaller country on their own. Secessions of size

1/40, 1/20, 15/200, 1/10 and 1/8 would all be approved unanimously by the relevant subset

of citizens. s = 1/4 (N= 4) is not secession-free either, because up to 20°/0 of the citizens of

each country of size s would like to form a smaller country.                      N = 5 is not secession free

because     secessions of size z = s/10 = 1/50 and z = .15s = 3/100 would be unanimously

prefen-ed by the relevant fi-actions of the population.              By contrast, values of N larger than 5

are secession free.




           ‘GFor tils specific example, no secession would ever occur for ~ > 0.5. This turns out to be true in all our
calculations for N >2, In some cases, when N = 2, a majority of the original population may want to secede and form a
smaller nation,

       In general, ifN is secession-free, so is N+l,   For each value of the parameters (g, K,

pe), we can calctiate the minimum N that is secession-free. In Tables 5 and 6, the minimum

N that is secession fi-ee is denoted by N*, and is calculated for different values of the

parameters.   In particular, we fmd that:
