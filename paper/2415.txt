            The Importance of Gifts and Inheritances Among the Affluent




                                     ABSTRACT




       Using data trom the 1964 Survey of the Economic Behavior of the
  Affluent, we estimate directly the fraction of household assets which come
   from inheritances and the fraction from gifts. These data are well suited
   for this calculation because the survey is heavily weighted toward
  households with high incomes, and because the respondents were directly
  asked about the sources of their wealth. We estimate that 15—20Z of
  household wealth came from inheritances and 5—IOZ from gifts. Even in
  households with very high incomes, very tew people say that a large
  fraction of their assets wre inherited or were given to them. According to
  the responses in this survey, it is not creditable that as much as 507. of
  household assets came from gitts and inheritances. Using data from the
  1983 Survey of Consumer Finances with high income supplement, we roughly
  confirm the 1964 results, although the 1983 data are much less complete
  than the 1964 data.

1. Introduction.

    Although the Life Cycle Hypothesis of Consumption (LCH) has for many years

been the standard model for theoretical and empirical analysis of consumption

behavior, recently a number of empirical studies have cast doubt on its

empirical accuracy. In cross—section data, wealth is often found to increase

with age even at advanced ages (Mirer (1979), Menchik and David (1983), Kurz

(1984)). These results are taken to mean that even the very elderly continue

to save, which is not consistent with the LCH under uncertainty about the date

of death. We quote from Danziger        (1982): "the elderly not only do not

dissave to finance their consumption during retirement, they spend less on

consumption goods and services (save significantly more) than the nonelderly

at all levels of income. Moreover, the oldest of the elderly save the most at

given levels of income."

    White (1978, 1984), and Darby (1979), among others, have simulated the

paths of consumption and earnings of representative consumers. They find

that under plausible assumptions about the form of the utility function the

difference between the two paths, which is life cycle savings, can only ac-

count for a fraction of the wealth held by households.

    In a widely cited paper, Kotlikoff and Summers (1981) estimated, using

historical data, the consumption and earnings paths of the 1974 population.

From these paths they calculated a number of estimates of life cycle savings,

which depended on various assumptions about interest rates and intragenera—

tional transfers. Their best guess is that only 20% of the assets held by the

household sector came from life cycle saving.
                                                                    2



   These and other empirical results have generated interest in a model in

which utility is derived both from consumption and from bequests; that is,

consumers have a bequest motive for saving (Menchik and David (1983), and

Modigliani (1986)). This would explain the cross—section results: it seems

plausible that if the bequest motive is strong enough, even the very elderly

will continue to save. It would explain the simulations and the Kotlikoff and

Summers findings: if only 20% of the wealth held by households comes from

life cycle saving, the other 80% must have come from bequests.

    The extent of a bequest motive has important implications for theoretical

and empirical work and for economic policy. We give several examples of the

latter. Increases in Social Security benefits will have substantially dif-

ferent effects on capital formation according to the strength of a bequest mo-

tive: with a strong bequest motive the elderly will tend to save the in-

crease; otherwise they will consume it. The response of consumers to bond

versus tax financing will depend on the bequest motive. The demand for

government—sponsored indexed annuities will vary with the strength of a be-

quest motive.

    When the date of death is uncertain people will leave bequests under the

LCH even if they have no bequest motive. To understand the strength of a be-

quest motive one needs to study savings decisions in a model that allows for

both uncertainty and a desire to leave bequests. One could, then, separate

intended from unintended bequests. Our goal in this paper is more modest. We

aim to present data that will suggest the strength of the bequest motive. The

first and most important result is an estimate of fraction of assets from in—
                                                                     3



tergenerational transfers. Our estimate can be compared with that of Kot—

likoff and Summers. The comparison is important because their result has been

widely, if somewhat mistakenly, interpreted to be strong evidence against the

LCH. Our method of estimation is very different from theirs. They estimated

intergeneration transfers as the difference between household assets and life

cycle savings; we directly estimate the fraction of assets from gifts and be-

quests.' While a finding that a large fraction of household assets comes from

bequests does not prove that people have a bequest motive, it certainly sug

gests that at least part of bequests are intended and that one ought to study

models that emphasize intergenerational transfers. A finding that only a

small fraction of assets come from intergenerational transfers would cast

doubt on the Kotlikoff and Summers result; furthermore, it would be consistent

with the LCH when the date of death is uncertain.

    Our second result documents motives for saving as reported by individuals.

While it may not be possible to develop a formal test for a bequest motive

from these kinds of data, they do suggest how individuals view their own rea-

Sons for saving. One would imagine that if individuals have a strong bequest

motive they would report a desire to leave a bequest as a reason for Saving.

    Our main source of data is the 1964 survey The Economic Behavior of the

Affluent (Barlow,        1966).   Respondents were asked the fraction of their

assets from inheritances and gifts. We also use the 1983 Survey of Consumer

Finances with the high income supplement, which, while not as detailed as the

1964 data, does have some information on intergenerational transfers.

   Using the 1964 data, we estimate that 15—20% of household wealth came from

inheritances and about 5—10% from gifts. Even in households with very high
                                                                   4


incomes very few people say that a large fraction of their assets were in-

herited or given to them. It is not creditable that anything approaching 80%

of the wealth held by the people in the sample could be the result of inter-

generational transfers.

2.   Results from 1964 Survey on the Economic Behavior of the Affluent.

     The survey was conducted in the Spring of 1964 by the Michigan Survey Re-

search Center. The probability of selection into the sample was roughly pro-

portional to 1961 income. Completed interviews were eventually obtained for

957 high income households (income over $10,000) and 94 low income households.

In the population about 90% of households are low income households. Sampling

weights allow one to estimate population averages. Extensive questions were

asked on varibles such as the source of assets, attitudes towards risk,

philanthrophy, extent of portfolio management, economic reactions to taxes,

and work patterns. In this paper we are most interested in the questions on

size of portfolio, sources of wealth, objectives of saving, and extent of be-

quests.

     In Table 1, we present information about the distribution of portfolio

size by income class and the population weights of each income class. Port-

folios include holdings of fixed—yield assets (savings accounts, corporate

bonds, preferred stock, savings bonds, government bonds, notes and bills,

mortgages and land contracts), common   stocks   and mutual fund shares, and in—

terests in real est.te and unincorporated businesses (including farms but ex-

cluding owner occupied housing). The major wealth components that are missing

are housing, consumer durables, claims to pension and retirement funds, and

(possibly) consumer debt. Because the underlying questions from which the

portfolio size was calculated only gave intervals for the various assets, the

portfolio classification has overlapping intervals, Some examples will show
                                                                       6




the difficulty of finding total assets. Someone who has less than $10,000 in

each of the three asset categories (but has positive holdings in each

category) will have less than $30,000 in total assets. Someone who has

$10,000 to $100,000 in one asset category but none in the others cannot be

said to have less than $30,000; yet he cannot be said to have more than

$30,000. That is, his assets are in the range $10,000 to $100,000. Someone

who has from $10,000 to $100,000 in each of the three asset categories will

have from $30,000 to $300,000 in total assets. Someone who has more than

$100,000 in one of the assets categories and less than $100,000 in the others

will have more than $100,000 in total assets. Altogether there are 42 pos-

sible combinations. To make a usable asset variable the SRC calculated an in-

dicator of total assets that takes values in the intervals shown in Table 1.

    As would be expected, the fraction of households with large asset holdings

in an income class rises with income class. Among those in the highest income

classes the fraction having large wealth holdings is substantial: in the

highest income class 60% had more than $500,000 in assets. In the lowest in-

come class, which represents about 90% of all households, 67% of the

households had portfolios of less than $30,000. Even in the next income

class, which goes up to the 97th income percentile, only about 65% of the

income class had portfolios greater than $30,000. The table confirms in a

qualitative way a highly skewed wealth distribution. However, because there

is not a good way to assign mean values to the two largest portfolio inter-

vals, the calculation of a wealth distribution can be, at best, only approx-

imate.
                                                                     7




     In Table 2 we give information about the fraction of total assets received

as gifts. Unlike the asset variable, this fraction apparently refers to total

assets. Although gifts become increasingly important as income rises, even

in the highest income class only 6% of the respondents said gifts accounted

for more than 50% of their assets. The more usual situation is found in the

first income classes, which accounts for about 90% of the households: 88%

of the households in that income class either had less than $1,000 in assets

or received no gifts. We note that the fraction of missing values rises

with income class: apparently the very well—to—do are less willing to be in-

terviewed. This, of course, has the potential to bias estimates of population

averages. In this case, however, even if the missing values are assigned the

highest fraction, the fraction of households with more than 50% of assets in

gifts is still small. The general impression from this table is that for al-

most everyone, the amount of wealth transferred through gifts is unimportant.

    Table 3 has information about the importance of inheritances. The data

are responses to the question: "Now, speaking about the inheritance, about

what fraction of your total assets today does it account for?" In general in-

heritances appear to be more important than gifts. For example, the un—

weighted fraction having 15% or more in inheritances was 17% compared with 8%

for gifts. Even in the lowest income class 15% of households have received

some inheritance. However, it is still the case that most people even in

the high income classes received no inheritances. The magnitude of most in-

heritances apparently is not large. For example in the highest income class,

which represents less than 0.05% of all households, the percent of households
                                                                        8




having more than 50% in inheritances is just 8%. Even assigning all the miss-

ing values to the highest category raises the percentage to just 15%.

    Although, of course, one cannot directly aggregate gifts and inheritances

from the data in Tables 2 and 3, it seems inconceivable that anything ap-

proaching 50% of wealth could have come to households through gifts

and bequests. The general impression is that the total fraction must be con-

siderable less than 50%.

    In Tables 4 and 5 we give data on the fraction of assets from gifts and

inheritances, but cross—classified by asset level. Even in the highest asset

category, gifts are not an important source of wealth: only 2% said they had

received more than 75% of the wealth from gifts. The frequency of missing

values rises with asset level, but assigning the missing values to the highest

gift category certainly does not change the general impression that gifts can-

not explain a substantial fraction of assets.

    Although inheritances are more important than gifts, they still do not

seem to be the source of a great deal of wealth. In the highest asset class

42% said they had received no inheritances; just 16% said inheritances ac-

counted for more than 50% of assets. Again it is difficult to see in these

data that gifts and inheritances could account for even half of assets.

    To estimate the fraction of assets from gifts and inheritances we would

like to take, in each income class, a weighted average of the fraction of as-

sets in gifts, where the weights would be total assets. This would be average

wealth received from gifts in the income class. Then, using the income class

weights we could calculate average gifts in the population. In a similar way
                                                                     9




we could calculate average assets in each income class and average assets in

the population. The two numbers would provide an estimate of the fraction of

assets received as gifts. Our data, however, do not allow such a precise cal-

culation: for the fraction in gifts we have only a range; for the asset level

we have, in some cases, a range and in others an open—ended interval. Our

method is to assign the midpoint of the reported gift range, and a point in

the reported asset interval. Assigning the midpoint of the gift interval

surely overstates the average gift fraction in the interval because the dis-

tribution of gift fractions is highly skewed toward zero. The point we assign

for assets is certainly arbitrary, and surely misstates the assets of any in-

dividual, especially those in the open—ended asset categories. However, a

large fraction of the individuals in the open—ended asset categories are in

the income classes that have very small weight, so the error in the population

fractions is probably small.2

    The questions on the fractions of assets in gifts and inheritances have

an ambiguity: it is not clear whether a respondent reports the value of his

gifts, at the time he received them, as a fraction of his assets today, or the

value to which his gifts have grown as a fraction of his assets.3 Because we

do not have a convincing way to decide between them, we present estimates

based on both interpretations. For the first interpretation, we calculate,

using an average Baa corporate interest rate over the post—war period, the

present value of the gift from information on the reported date of the gift.

In Table 6 this is called the average present value of the gift. For the sec-

ond interpretation we take the fraction as reported in the data. In Table 6
                                                                      10



this is called the simple average of the gift. There is a substantial dif-

ference between the two averages, roughly a factor of two because many people

reported they received the gifts before 1949. For these people we used 25

years, which, at our interest rate of 4.3%, increases the value of the gifts

by a factor of almost 3. The estimates of gifts mostly increase with income

class, reaching rather substantial values in the higher classes. The weighted

averages show that the top 10% of the income distribution has about 63% of

gifts as measured by the present value. No one in the highest income class

(five observations) reported any gifts.

    Estimated inheritances are reported in Table 7. They are substantially

larger than gifts. They increase sharply with income class. The difference

between the present value and the simple estimates is about two. The receipt

of inheritances is even more skewed than the receipt of girts: the top 10% of

the income distribution received about 82% in both present value and simple

value of the total inheritances. The third income group accounts for the

largest fraction of inheritances.

   We estimate total assets per household to be $27.3 thousand. Thus our

estimates of the fractions of assets from gifts and inheritances is



                               Present Value      Simple

                Gifts               7.7%           4.0%
                Inheritances       19.9%          11.1%

                Total              27.6%          15.1%
                                                                     11




It is not clear which of these numbers to compare to the 80% figure of Kot—

likoff and Summers. Although Kotlikoff and Summers refer to their estimate as

the magnitude of intergenerational transfers, it is probably closer to an

estimate of the magnitude of bequests. This is because, in their method,

gifts do not appear as intergenerational transfers as long as the giver is

alive: if the giver is alive, his accumulation of life cycle savings are,

in principle, recorded in the data, and the gift is recorded in the assets

of the household sector. Therefore, the gift is part of life cycle savings,

not part of intergenerational transfers. After the giver's death, his life

cycle accumulation is no longer recorded and the gift is no longer explained

as life cycle savings. Were Kotlikoff and Summers able to account for this,

their 80% figure would be even higher.

    Our two estimates of bequests, while quite different from each other,

are far below the 80% estimate of Kotlikoff and Summers. Even our estimates

of total intergenerational transfers are very much less. Although one could

argue about the precise weights applied to the fractions from gifts and in-

heritances, and, in particular, the values assigned to the open—ended asset

categories, it is inconceivable that any reasonable weights could raise the

transfer fraction to anything approaching 80%. This, of course, can be seen

almost directly from the earlier tables. However, we did do some sensitivity

analysis of our assignment of asset values. For example when we assigned 15,

150 and 250 (thousands) rather than 10, 50 and 200 to asset categories 2, 3

and 4, the average asset holdings increased substantially, but the percent of
                                                                       12



assets   from gifts and inheritances decreased to 22.2% in the present value
averages and 12.0% in the simple averages.

    There is no particular reason to choose between the present value

estimates and the simple estimates because both show the fraction of wealth

from intergenerational transfers is moderate. We tend to favor the simple

estimates for reasons to be discussed later.

    In Table 8 we show our estimates of the assets in each income class and

the percent of assets from gifts and inheritances. Average assets are,

$27,300, the sum of weighted assets. The upper 10% of the income distribution

had, according to these estimates, about 40% of assets; the upper 1% had about

15% of assets. The percent of wealth in gifts and inheritances is substantial

in the high income classes, so that if wealth were more concentrated among the

high income groups, the average percent would, of course, rise. Again, it is

hard to see that the average percent could approach the 80% of Kotlikoff and

Summers.

    We now present some other indicators of the importance of gifts and be-

quests. We take them to be supportive of the results we have already

given.

    In a separate question respondents were asked if they had ever received

any money or property as a gift or inheritances from parents or others. 9%

said they had received gifts, 31% inheritances, and 7% said both.4 These are

weighted averages over the top 10% of the income distribution. They are quite

consistent with the distributions in Table 2 and 3. They show that even among

the affluent, intergenerational transfers are by no means universal.
                                                                     13




    The respondents were asked about the source of most of their assets.

In Table 9 we give two distributions of the answers to this question. The

weighted distribution is over the top 10% of incomes; the unweighted distribu-

tion is over the entire sample ignoring the sampling weights. In the un—

weighted distribution, 6% say gifts or inheritances. In Table 2 about 3% of

the high income group (income over $10,000) say that gifts were more than half

of wealth; in Table 3 about 9% say that inheritances accounted for more than

half of wealth. Thus the fraction having "most" of their assets from gifts

and inheritances in Table 9 is smaller than the fraction implied by Tables 2

and 3. The fraction in Table 9 saying gifts or inheritances, or gifts or in-

heritances and appreciation is about 11%, which is very close to the fraction

implied by Tables 2 and 3. This lends mild support to the view that the frac-

tions in Tables 2 and 3 include appreciation from the gift or inheritance, and

that, therefore, the calculations of transfers which use simple sums rather

than present values are more accurate. The general impression from Table 9 is

that over the households in the top 10% of the income distribution, the great

majority of their assets resulted from savings out of income and appreciation.

    The results already given concern the fraction of assets from gifts and

inheritances. We now give some information on what individuals say their mo-

tives for saving are. In Table 10 the column labelled "primary" gives the

respondents primary reason for saving, and similarly for the second and third

columns. These distributions are not weighted according to the probability of

sample selection so they are dominated by the answers of very high income

families. The last column gives, over the top 10% of the income distribution,
                                                                    14



a weighted average of the fraction of households that mentioned one of the

reasons. We see that retirement is given most often as a reason for saving.

The interpretation of the fraction of households saving for bequests is am-

biguous in the context of intergenerational transfers because at least part of

the saving is to provide for the wife at the husband's death. Even so, only

23% of the respondents mentioned such a saving motive. Again, the general im-

pression from this table is that saving for bequests is not an important mo-

tive.

    The respondents were asked if they had given any large gifts "within the

last couple of years." Over the high—income households 8% had given to indi-

viduals, 7% to churches or charitable organizations, and 4% to both.5 The

types of individuals given to were children 7%, other 2%, and children and

other 1%, The fraction giving to grandchildren rounded to 0%. The reasons

for the gifts were taxes, 4%, beneficiary needed, 2%, and other 5%. Since the

time period is not well—specified, the interpretation is ambiguous. It does

appear that most giving is very conventional, to children and organizations.

In these data, as in other data, there is little evidence that the family pro-

vides an annuity for the elderly should they live past their life expectancy.

    Our impression from these data is that while a substantial number of

people receive gifts and inheritances, the amounts received are not large

even among the very well—to—do. Our best estimate of the fraction of

household wealth due to intergenerational transfers is about 20%. For most

families, inheritances are more important than gifts even though over this

period there were, for wealthy individuals, substantial tax advantages for jj—

tervivos   giving.

3. Results from the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances.

    The 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances of 3,824 households was supplemented

by 438 high—income households.6 Although extensive questions were asked about

income and assets, details on the sources of assets and attitudes toward

saving are considerably fewer than in the 1964 data. In particular, the data

cannot be used to estimate the fraction of wealth that came from intergenera-

tional transfers. We can, however, make a rough comparison with some of our

results from the 1964 data, and with the Kotlikoff and Summers results.

    In Table 11, we give the response of households to the following question:

"Overall did most of your (family's) savings come for your regular income, or

did they come originally from gifts and inheritances, or other sources?" Even

at high income levels the great fraction households said that most of their

savings came from earnings (including pensions and Social Security). For ex-

ample, of the households in the top 10% of the earnings distribution only

about 6% said most of their assets came from gifts and inheritances. Even if

one adds in another 3% for "earnings and other," which includes gifts and in-

heritances, the fraction of the high income households having most of their

assets from intergeneration transfers is only 9%. The impression certainly is

that saving from earnings is by far the most important way to accumulate as-

sets.

    The survey asked people their reasons for saving. The question did not

ask people to choose among given categories; rather it was open—ended. The

primary reasons given by the respondents are given in Tables 12 and the
                                                                      17



secondary reasons in Table 13. Apparently the specific reason "bequests" was

not given by the respondents as it is not listed as a separate category.

    Saving for emergency ("rainy days," for "security") was mentioned by the

greatest fraction of households at all income levels. In the top 10% of the

income distribution about 40% mentioned retirement either as a primary reason

or secondary reason. Responses that could be interpreted to mean saving for

bequests might be saving "for the children," and "get ahead, for the future,"

and, possibly, "make investments." But even the sum of these categories does

not add to a large fraction of households. For example, in the $50,000 to

$200,000 income group, which is approximately the top 10% of the income dis-

tribution, about 12% mentioned "for the children" or "get ahead, for the fu-

ture" as either a primary or secondary reason for saving. Adding "make in-

vestments" would include about 21% of families. Thus, even a very broad in-

terpretation of the meaning of the questions finds a modest fraction of

families that save for bequests.

    In Table 14 we report the percent of households that expect a large gift

or inheritance. Overall, the percent is small, about 13%; in the top 10% of

the income distribution the percent is larger, about 21%, but still far below

what one would expect were gifts and inheritances an important part of the

source of most households' assets.
                                                                      18




4. Conclusions.

    In the 1964 data even in the top 10% of the income distribution, very

few households said more than half of their assets were from gifts or in-

heritances: about 3% from gifts and 9% from inheritances or about 12% from

intergenerational transfers (Tables 2 and 3). Although the 1983 data are much

less precise, this result was roughly confirmed: in the upper 10% of the in-

come distribution at most 9% of the households said most of their assets came

from intergenerational transfers (Table 11). If anything the general impres-

sion from comparing Tables 9 and 11 is that saving from earnings has become

more important.

    In both surveys the reasons for saving seem mostly to be for emergencies,

for retirement, and for education. Rather than specifying consumption models

in which a bequest motive is important, as called for by Kotlikoff and Sum—

niers, these data suggest that if one wants to modify the LCH the modification

should include a precautionary motive for saving.

1. Following Kotlikoff and Summers, we do not include in intergenerational
    transfer amounts spent on consumption and education of the children when
    they are young.

2. We assigned the following values for the gift and inheritance intervals
    which are given in Tables 2—5: 0, .025, .1, .2, .375, .625, .8. For
    the portfolios, which are given in Tables 1, 4 and 5, we assigned the
    following values (in thousands) .5, 10, 50, 200, 1,500.

3. The question about gifts was: "Speaking of the gifts, about what fraction
    of your total assets do they account for?" The question about inherit-
    ances was: "Now speaking about the inheritance, about what fraction of
    your total assets today does it account for?"
