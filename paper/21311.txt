                                           ABSTRACT

Using data from the state and national Youth Risk Behavior Surveys for the period 1991-2005, Carpenter
and Cook (2008) found a strong, negative relationship between cigarette taxes and youth smoking.
We revisit this relationship using four additional waves of YRBS data (2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013).
Our results suggest that youths have become much less responsive to cigarette taxes since 2005. In
fact, we find little evidence of a negative relationship between cigarette taxes and youth smoking
when we restrict our attention to the period 2007-2013.

1. Introduction

         Within the past decade, 31 states have increased their excise tax on cigarettes. Moreover,

several of these tax increases have been substantial. For instance, Massachusetts increased its

per-pack tax by $1.00 in 2008 and Minnesota increased its per-pack tax by $1.60 in 2013.

         Although often motivated by budgetary shortfalls (Ellis 2008; Dewan 2009), increasing

the tax on cigarettes has, according to many experts, the added benefit of discouraging youth

smoking (Chaloupka et al. 2011). The strongest evidence to date that cigarette taxes are, in fact,

negatively related to youth smoking comes from Carpenter and Cook (2008). Using data from

the state and national Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (YRBS) for the period 1991-2005, Carpenter

and Cook (hereafter C&C) found that a one-dollar increase in the per-pack cigarette tax was

associated with a 3-6 percentage point reduction in smoking participation among high school

students and a 2-4 percentage point reduction in frequent smoking (defined as having smoked on

20 of the past 30 days).1

         The current study revisits the relationship between cigarette taxes and youth smoking

using the same data sources as used by C&C, the state and national YRBS. Since 2005, the last

year of data available to C&C, four additional waves of YRBS data have been collected (2007,

2009, 2011, and 2013). With these extra data, we update the C&C estimates of the relationship

between cigarette taxes and youth smoking, test to see if this relationship has changed since

2005, and explore the sensitivity of the C&C estimates and our own updated estimates to

various, frequently employed changes in specification.




1
 The national YRBS data used by C&C covered the period 1991-2005; the state YRBS data covered the period
1993-2005. Using local YRBS data for the period 1993-2005, C&C also presented estimates of the effect of
cigarette taxes on ln(Yc/1-Yc), where Y was defined as the proportion of respondents in city c who smoked in the past
30 days. C&C did not translate these estimates into marginal effects.

                                                          1
        We highlight three basic results. First, there is a clear negative relationship between

cigarette taxes and youth smoking for the period 1991-2013, albeit substantially smaller in

magnitude than that found by C&C. Second, despite the fact that many states have increased

their per-pack tax since 2005, the relationship between cigarette taxes and youth smoking

appears to have become weaker over time; in fact, when we restrict our attention to the four

additional waves of data (2007, 2009, 2011, 2013), there is little evidence that cigarette taxes

discourage youth smoking. Third, we find that controlling for state-specific trends eliminates the

relationship between cigarette taxes and youth smoking regardless of the period examined. We

argue that, by controlling for state-specific trends, we run the risk of discarding informative

variation in taxes, but cannot rule out the possibility that the state-specific trends capture

unobservable changes in, for instance, preferences that are correlated with both the cigarette tax

and youth smoking.

        We conclude by noting that youth smoking participation fell precipitously from the late

1990s to the mid-2000s. In 1997, more than one-third of high school students were smokers; by

2005, only 23 percent of high school students reported having smoked a cigarette within the last

30 days.2 We speculate that anti-smoking efforts undertaken prior to 2005—including

substantial cigarette tax increases passed by many states in the late 1990s and early 2000s—may

have discouraged all but the most price-insensitive youth from experimenting with tobacco.

Another possibility is that an increasing reliance on social sources and online vendors (Fix et al.

2006; Hansen et al. 2013) has helped insulate teenagers from anti-smoking policies.




2
 These figures are based on weighted national YRBS data. Respondents to the YRBS were asked, “During the past
30 days, on how many days did you smoke cigarettes?” In 1997, 36.4 percent of respondents answered that they had
smoked cigarettes on at least one day during the last month. By 2005, only 23.0 percent of respondents reported
having smoked in the past month.


                                                       2
2. Background
           The relationship between cigarette taxes and youth smoking has received a fair amount of

attention from researchers. Despite this fact, a consensus view has not been reached. For

instance, a recent review by Bader, Boisclair and Ferrence (2011) concluded that cigarette taxes

discouraged teenagers and young adults from smoking (p. 4123); in contrast, Guindon (2013, p.

13), who reviewed basically the same literature, concluded “existing studies do not provide

strong evidence that tobacco prices or taxes affect smoking onset”.

           Although this is a crowded literature, the C&C study arguably stands out in terms of

quality. While many of the studies published prior to 2008 relied on cross-sectional data, C&C

relied on within-state variation in cigarette taxes. As noted by DeCicca, Kenkel and Mathios

(2002, pp. 148-149) and others, the cross-sectional relationship between cigarette taxes and

youth smoking is likely biased due to difficult-to-measure factors such as antismoking sentiment

at the state level.

           Moreover, C&C were able to exploit substantial within-state changes in the cigarette tax.

During the period 1991-2005, 48 states increased how much they taxed cigarettes; 40 of these 49

states increased their per-pack tax by more than $0.25 (in 2005 dollars), and 27 increased their

per-pack tax by more than $0.50.3 In comparison, 47 states increased their per-pack tax during

the period 1970-1990, but only two increased it by more than $0.50 (in 2005 dollars).

           Finally, C&C were the first researchers in this literature to use state YRBS data. The

state YRBS data are school-based and contain many of the same questions as the national YRBS.



3
    For these state counts and all subsequent counts, the District of Columbia is counted as a state

                                                             3
They are coordinated by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and are typically administered

by state health departments to high school students every other year. As noted by C&C, one of

the advantages to using these data is that they are representative at the state level.



3. Data and methods

         Our analysis draws on state and national YRBS data at the individual level for the period

1991-2013. Appendix Tables 1 and 2 report observations by state and year. A total of 45 states

conducted at least two surveys during this period, gave the CDC permission to distribute their data,

or were willing to provide their data directly to us. On average, we have access to data from 21 state

YRBS surveys per year during the period 1991-2005, and 40 state YRBS surveys per year during the

period 2007-2013.4

         Although intended to be nationally representative, not all 50 states contributed data to any

given wave of the national YRBS. In fact, between 1991 and 2013, only 5 states contributed data to

the national YRBS every year (California, Georgia, Michigan, New York, and Texas). On average,

27 states contributed national YRBS data in any given year during the period 1991-2005. During the

period 2007-2013, an average of 26 states contributed national YRBS data in any given year.5

         Following C&C, we use the data described above to estimate a standard logit model in

which an indicator of smoking (or frequent smoking), S, is equal to 1 if an unobserved variable,


4
  When we restrict our analysis to states that conducted (and made available) state YRBS surveys at least three times
during the period 1991-2005 and at least three times during the period 2007-2013, our results are similar to those
reported below.

5
  A total of 48 states contributed data to the national YRBS during the period 1991-2013. Each of these states
increased its nominal tax on cigarettes at least once during this period. As noted above, 45 states contributed data to
the state YRBS analysis. Again, each of these states increased its nominal cigarette tax at least once. During the
period 2007-2013, 31 states increased their tax on cigarettes; the average per-pack increase was $0.46 (in 2005
dollars). In comparison, during the period 1991-2005, 49 states increased their nominal excise tax on cigarettes and
the average per-pack increase was $0.28 (in 2005 dollars). When we restrict our analysis to states that contributed
data to the national YRBS at least three times during the period 1991-2005 and at least three times during the period
2007-2013, our results are qualitatively unchanged from those reported below.


                                                           4
S*, is positive. Although S* is unobserved, it is related to a set of observable variables by the

equation:
                  ∗
         (1)     𝑆𝑖𝑠𝑡 = α0 + α1Taxst + Xistβ + vs + zt + εist,

where i indexes respondents, s indexes states, t indexes years, and the distribution of εi is logistic.

State fixed effects are represented by vs and year fixed effects are represented by zt. The

independent variable of interest is Tax, equal to the per-pack excise tax on cigarettes in 2005

dollars. The vector X includes measures of race, sex, age and grade. In addition, we control for

the state unemployment rate and 6 clean indoor air law indicators.6



4. Results

         Table 1 presents estimates of equation (1) based on the state YRBS data. Marginal

effects, δPr(S = 1)/δTax, are reported and standard errors are corrected for clustering at the state

level.

         In the first column of Table 1, we restrict our attention to state YRBS surveys conducted

during the period 1991-2005. A one-dollar tax increase is associated with a 2.6 percentage point

decrease in smoking participation and a 1.9 percentage point decrease in frequent smoking.

The semi-elasticities based on these estimates are -9.7 and -14.8, respectively.7

  Information on clean indoor air laws is available from the ImpacTeen program sponsored by the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation at http://www.impacteen.org/tobaccodata.htm. The indicators are for whether the state
restricted smoking in private sector buildings, government buildings, restaurants, shopping areas, public schools and
private schools. Appendix Table 3 reports descriptive statistics.
7
 In other words, a one-dollar increase in the cigarette tax is associated with a 9.7 percent decrease in smoking
participation and a 14.8 percent decrease in frequent smoking. Using aggregate state YRBS data for the period
1993-2005, C&C found that a one-dollar increase in the cigarette tax was associated with a 2.7 percentage point
decrease in smoking participation and a 2.4 percentage point decrease in frequent smoking. The corresponding
semi-elasticites were -9.2 and -17.8 (Carpenter and Cook 2008, p. 294).


                                                          5
         In the second column of Table 1, we include the additional four waves of state YRBS

data and our estimates of α1 shrink considerably. Specifically, for the period 1991-2013, a one-

dollar tax increase is associated with a 1.0 percentage point decrease in smoking participation

and a 0.7 percentage point decrease in frequent smoking. The semi-elasticities are -4.8 and -7.6,

roughly half the magnitude of the semi-elasticities obtained for the period 1991-2005.8

         In the third column of Table 1, we restrict our attention to the four additional waves of

YRBS data (2007, 2009, 2011, 2013). The estimated relationship between taxes and youth

smoking is actually positive during the period 2007-2013: a one-dollar increase in the tax is

associated with a (statistically insignificant) 0.7 percentage point increase in smoking

participation and a (statistically insignificant) 0.2 percentage point increase in frequent smoking.

We can formally reject the hypothesis that α1 was stable across the two periods (1991-2005 vs.

2007-2013) for both smoking participation and frequent smoking.

         Table 2 presents estimates of equation (1) based on the weighted national YRBS data. In

column (1) of Table 2, we focus on data collected between 1991 and 2005, the period examined

by C&C. We find that a one-dollar tax increase is associated with a 4.6 percentage point

decrease in smoking participation and a 2.6 percentage point decrease in frequent smoking.9 The

semi-elasticities based on these estimates are -15.5 and -19.1, respectively. When the four

additional waves of data are included in the analysis, a one-dollar tax increase is associated with


8
 In Appendix Tables 4-6, we report estimates of equation (1) for 1991-2005, 1991-2007, 1991-2009, 1991-20011,
and 1991-2013. With only a few exceptions, the relationship between taxes and smoking shrinks as additional
waves of data are included.

9
  Using national YRBS data for the period 1991-2005, C&C found that a one-dollar increase in the cigarette tax was
associated with a 5.9 percentage point decrease in smoking participation and a 4.1 percentage point decrease in
frequent smoking. The C&C results were based on weighted national data, which we use in Table 2. In Appendix
Table 7, we report estimates of equation (1) based on unweighted national data. For the period 1991-2005, a one-
dollar increase in the cigarette tax is associated with a 3.8 percentage point decrease in smoking participation and a
(statistically insignificant) 1.9 percentage point decrease in frequent smoking.


                                                          6
a 2.8 percentage point decrease in smoking participation and a 1.6 percentage point decrease in

frequent smoking; the corresponding semi-elasticities are -10.9 and -14.1. If we restrict our

attention to the period 2007-2013, a one-dollar tax increase is associated with a (statistically

insignificant) 1.1 percentage point decrease in smoking participation and a (statistically

insignificant) 0.6 percentage point decrease in frequent smoking. We cannot, however, formally

reject the hypothesis that α1 was stable across the two periods.

       Finally, in Table 3 we combine the national and state YRBS data in an effort to exploit as

much identifying variation as possible. For the period 1991-2005, a one-dollar tax increase is

associated with a 3.0 percentage point decrease in smoking participation and a 1.9 percentage

point decrease in frequent smoking. When the additional waves of data are included, these

estimates fall by more than 50 percent, as do the corresponding semi-elasticities. When we focus

just on the period 2007-2013, the relationship between taxes and youth smoking is again

positive: a one-dollar tax increase is associated with a (statistically insignificant) 0.7 percentage

point increase in smoking participation and a (statistically insignificant) 0.2 percentage point

increase in frequent smoking. We can reject the hypothesis that the relationship between

smoking and taxes was stable across the two periods.



5. Adding state-specific trends

       Equation (1) can be modified to include state-specific linear trends, which are intended to

capture the effects of omitted factors at the state level that evolved at a constant rate such as anti-




                                                   7
smoking sentiment. It should be noted, however, that by including state-specific trends, we run

the risk of discarding potentially valid (i.e., exogenous) variation.10

         In general, including state-specific linear trends produces much smaller estimates of the

relationship between cigarette taxes and youth smoking (Table 4). For instance, if we restrict our

attention to the period 1991-2005 and include state-specific linear trends, a one-dollar tax

increase is associated with a (statistically insignificant) 0.7 percentage point decrease in smoking

participation. With the four additional waves of data, a one-dollar tax increase is associated with

a (statistically insignificant) 0.3 increase in smoking participation percentage points. Including

state-specific quadratic trends produces a similar pattern of results (Appendix Tables 8). When

we include U.S. Census Region-year interactions, our estimates of α1 are smaller than those

reported in Table 3, but still significant and negative for the period 1991-2013.



6. Discussion

         Using state and national YRBS data for the period 1991-2005, Carpenter and Cook

(2008) found a strong negative relationship between cigarette taxes and youth smoking. Since

2005, 31 states have increased their cigarette tax and many of these tax increases have been

substantial. In this comment, we revisit the relationship between cigarette taxes and youth

smoking using four additional waves of YRBS data (2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013).

         Our results suggest that the relationship between cigarette taxes and youth smoking has

weakened over time. When we combine state and national YRBS data and restrict our attention

to the period 1991-2005, a one-dollar tax increase is associated with a 3.0 percentage point


10
   This point has been made in the context of examining the relationship between minimum wages and employment
(Neumark et al. 2014). A regression of cigarette taxes on a set of state and year fixed effects and the controls shown
in Appendix Table 3 produced an R-squared of 0.83. When we included state-specific linear time trends on the
right-hand side of this regression, the R-squared increased to 0.93.

                                                          8
decrease in smoking participation and a 1.9 percentage point decrease in frequent smoking.

When the additional waves of data are included, these estimates fall by more than 50 percent, as

do the corresponding semi-elasticities.

       Why might youth have become less responsive to cigarette taxes since 2005? In 1997,

more than one-third of high school students in the United States reported having smoked at least

one cigarette in the past month. By 2005, the youth smoking participation rate had fallen by

approximately 10 percentage points. It is possible that anti-smoking efforts undertaken prior to

2005—including substantial cigarette tax increases passed by many states in the late 1990s and

early 2000s—discouraged all but the most price-insensitive youth from experimenting with

tobacco. It is also possible that an increasing reliance on social sources and online vendors (Fix

et al. 2006; Hansen et al. 2013) has helped insulate teenagers from anti-smoking policies.
