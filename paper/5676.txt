                                             ABSTRACT


        The Balassa-Samuelson       model, which explains real exchange rate movements in terms of

sectoral productivities, rests on two components.   First, for a class of technologies including Cobb-

Douglas, the model implies that the relative price of nontraded goods in each country should reflect

the relative productivity    of labor in the traded and nontraded goods sectors.     Second, the model

assumes that purchasing power parity holds for traded goods in the long-run.       We test each of these

implications using data from a panel of OECD countries.      Our results suggest that the first of these

two fits the data quite well.       In the long run, relative prices generally reflect relative labor
productivities.   The evidence on purchasing power parity in traded goods is considerably           less

favorable. When we look at US dollar exchange rates, PPP does not appear to hold for traded goods,

even in the long run. On the other hand, when we look at DM exchange rates purchasing power

parity appears to be a somewhat better characterization    of traded goods prices.

           Changes in real exchange rates-delined   as the relative price of national outputs-have

been so persistent that they question the very notion of purchasing power parity (PPP).       Even the

evidence suggesting that deviations from PPP are temporary points to a half life of four to tie

years. 1

           Explanations of persistent real exchange rate changes have ofien followed the lead of

Balassa ( 1964) and Samuelson ( 1964), who divide national output into traded goods and

nontraded goods and explain real exchange rates in terms of sectoral productivity,       The ‘~alassa-

Samuelson” h~othesis       divides real exchange rate movements into NO components.        Competitive

behavior implies that the relative price ofnontraded    goods depends on the ratio of the marginal

costs in the two sectors, and we will show that for a wide class of production technologies the

ratio of marginal costs is proportional to the ratio of average labor products in the NO sectors.

So, the fist component of the h~othesis      is the assumption that the relative price of tradeables is

proportional to the ratio of average labor products.    The second component is the as-tion          of

PPP for traded goods.

           The two components combine to produce a simple model of real exchange rate

movements.      ~ for example, the ratio of traded goods productivity to nontraded goods

productivity is growiug faster at home than abroad, then the relative price of nontraded goods

must be grotig      tister at home than abroad, and the price of home national output must be rising

relative to the price of foreign national output (since by assumption the prices of traded goods

equalize). In other words, if traded good productivity relative to nontraded good productivity is




        ‘ Frankel and Rose ( 1996) and Lothian ( 1994) report half lives of this magnitude using
aggregate price levels as do Wei and Parsley ( 1994) using sectoral prices.

                                                    1
growing faster at home than abroad, then the home country shodd experience a real appreciation.

        How well does the Balassa-Samuelson          model explain real exchange rate movements?      In

figure 1 we plot four bilateral real exchange rates along with the ratio of labor productivity in the

traded and nontraded goods sectors for each country. The Balassa-Samuelson            h~othesis   clearly

fails to explain the short run movements in real exchange rates, and figure 1 suggests that there

may also be problems in explaining the long run movements, especially where the U, S. dollar is

concerned.   Relative traded goods productivity has risen much faster in the United States than in

Germany, especially since the mid- 1970s. This shodd have led to a real appreciation of the dollar

(a fill in the real exchange rate as plotted in figure 1); instead, the dollar has depreciated.   And the

negli@ble ~erence     between U. S, and Japanese productivity trends has little hope of explaining

the real depreciation of the dollar against the yen. The Balassa-Samuelson       hypothesis does seem

to fare better with the DM. Since the mid- 1970s, relative traded goods producttity        has been

growing more rapidly in both Italy and Japan than it has in Germany, and both the lira and the yen

have appreciated in real terms against the DM.

        Figure 1 pornts to some problems with the Balassa-Samuelson         hypothesis, but it does not

reveal the source of the problems.    Nor does it explain why there might be a problem with the

dollar real exchange rates. Either component of the hypothesis can be challenged, and the special

problem with the dolls-if     one exists-could    reside in either place.

        In this paper we examine the two components of the Balassa-Samuelson           hypothesis using

a panel of 13 OECD countries.     We do not require that either part of the hypothesis holds in the

short run. In fact, both theory and a substantial body of erupirical evidence suggest that short run

deviations from both can be substantial.    hstea~     we focus our tests on the long-run or trend


                                                      2
behavior of the series.

        Our work ~ers      from the work of others in three important ways:z we use the average

product of labor to measure producttity      instead of Solow residuals, or total tictor product~

(TFP)~ we employ recently developed time series techniques that aflow us to use panel data; and

fially we develop Monte Carlo experiments to explain certain small sample biases that remain.

Each of these innovations may need some elaboration.

        We use the average product of labor instead of TFP for four reasons: ( 1) The almost

exclusive focus on ~      in the recent literature reflects (at least in part) an interest in assessrng the

relative importance of supply shocks (as proxied by TFP) and demand shocks (as proxied by

government expenditures, etc. ) in explaining real exchange rate movements.          Interpreting

movements in Solow residuals as exogenous supply shocks is problematic in and of itse~4 and m

any event we think that this is a case of putting the cart before the horse. We do not need to take

a stand on the relative importance of supply and demand shocks to test the first corrrponent of the

Balassa-Samuelson    hypothesis; we will show that in using average labor product~            we are

iurplicit~ allowing both supply and demand shocks to affect real exchange rates. We think that a




        2 Asea and Corden ( 1994) and Froot and Rogoff ( 1995) provide surveys of the literature.

        3 Although Marwon ( 1987) and others have used average labor productivity, most of the
recent literature has focused on total factor productfity computed from a Cobb-Douglass
production fimction. See, in particular, Chinn (1995), Chinn and Johnston ( 1996), De Gregorio,
Giovannini and Krueger ( 1993), De Gregorio, Giovannini and WOM( 1993), and Froot ad Rogoff
(1991).

         4Evans ( 1992), for exqle,     shows that measured Solow residuals are Granger caused by
money, intere~ rates, and governmmt spending and finds that one fourth to one half of their
variation is attributable to variations m aggregate demand, Summers ( 1986) and Mankiw ( 1989)
present earlier skeptical views on the erogeneity of total factor productivity.

test of the basic Balassa-Samuelson   assumption of marginal   cost    pricrng should precede any

attempt to assess the relative importance of supply and demand shocks. (2) We don’t need data

on sectoral capital stocks, which are likely to be less reliable than data on sectoral employment

and value added. (3) Our development of the fist component of the Balassa-Samuelson

hypothesis holds for a broader class of technologies than the Cobb-Douglas production fiction,

which is used to compute Solow residuals. (4) Our specification allows a sharper test of the fist

component of the Balassa- Samuelson hypothesis; m partictir,          we do not need to re& on outside

estimates of labor’s share in production.

        Two tiortunate     facts have combined to plague the time series literature on real exchange

rates: we typically only have 20 to 30 years of data on any pair of countries, and unit root tests

have notoriously low power in small samples to distinguish between series that are nonstationary

and series that are stationa~   but have him   persistent dynamics. Recent~ developed techniques

aflow us to deal with nonstationary   data in heterogeneous panels,5 and in fact combining the data

from 13 countries yields substantial benefits. We are able to confirm the existence of a long run

(or cointegratkg)   relationship between the relative price of nontradeables and the ratio of average

labor products, and we are able to estimate its parameters with a surprising degree of precision.

        The precision is so great that we are seeminfi   able to reject the fist component of

Balassa-Samuelson    model. This leads us to perform some Monte Carlo experiments to show that

the remaining small sample bias is capable of explatig    our apparent rejection of the model. We


        5 Chinn and Johnston ( 1996) use one of the tests that we use for dealing with
nonstationary panels. The focus of their work is, however, quite different. They use the Balassa-
Samuelson model as a broad motivation for .spec@g a number of forecasting equations for the
trend in the real exchange rate. In contrast we test the two component hypotheses that makeup
the Balassa-Samuelson model

                                                   4
wiU argue that this My    establishes the first component of the Balassa-Samuelson     hypothesis.

       We will argue instead that the problems with the Balassa-Samuelson       hypothesis lie in the

failure of PPP to explain traded goods prices, especially for the U, S, doflar. Once again, using

panel data we are able to establish that the appropriate long run (or cointegrating) relationship

exists, but our estimates of its parameters are much less precise, and none of the parameter

estimates are close to the values implied by PPP. And, as figure 1 would seem to suggest, we tid

that the fadwe of PPP to hold for traded goods maybe largely a U.S. dollar phenomenon.         When

we use the DM as numeraire, the retits    are much more favorable.

        The plan of the paper is as foflows. h section 2 we describe our notation and set out the

two components of the Balassa- Samuelson hypothesis.      We review the econometric methods we

use in section 3, we present our empirical results in section 4. h section 5 we offer some

concluding remarks.




2, The Analvtic al Framework

        We begin with the link between the relative price ofnontraded     goods and the relative

productivities in the traded and nontraded goods sectors. The analytical framework we use is

quite general; it codd be embedded in a wide class of models. In each country, capital and labor

are employed m the production of traded goods, T, and non-traded goods, N. Competition

implies that labor is paid the value of its marginal product, and labor mobility implies that the

nominal wage rate, W, is equal m the two sectors.

                                                                  q                                  (1)

Equation (1) states the familiar condition that the relative price of nontraded goods, which we

denote as q, is equal to the slope of the production possibility curve.

          To measure the marginal products in equation (1), we assume that the marginal product of

labor is proportional to the average product of labor in each sector.

With Cobb Douglas technologies, q and ~ are the labor shares in value added in the traded and

nontraded goods sectors. But equation (2) will hold under assumptions that are much less

restrictive than Cobb Douglas.     Average and marginal products will be propofiional if the

production functions can be expressed as,


                            T = F(KT)(LT)Q,            N = G(KN)(LN)~                              (3)



where F(. ) and G(. ) are arbitrary tictions    that may, for example, depend on inputs other than the

firms’ choices of labor and capital as in the endogenous growth literature.G Moreover, if labor and

capital are both mobile across sectors, then (2) holds in equilibrium even for some technologies

that cannot be represented in the form of (3); it is, for example, straightforward to check that CES

production fi.ulctions with constant returns to scale satis~ (3) in equilibrium if both factors are

mobile.

goods, q, is proportional   to the ratio of the average products of labor, tin, in the two sectors:



                                                                                                       (4)




        Adding subscripts to denote country i at date t and taking natural logarithms of both sides

of equation (4), we get



                                                                                                       (5)




Although the model described above does not distinguish short-run and long-run fluctuations, in

our empirical tests we interpret equation (5) as a restriction on the long-run trends in the relative

price ofnon-traded    goods and relative labor productivity in the two sectors. Thus, in Section 4

we test whether In(q) and ln(x/n) are cointe~ated       and whether the cointe~ating   slope is one.

        We now turn the second part of the Balassa-Samuelson         mode~ the assumption that traded

goods prices are characterized by purchasing power parity. Let Ei, be the nominal exchange rate

of currency i relative to currency 1, the numeraire currency at time t.7 If EL,is expressed in units

of the numeraire currency per unit of currency ~ purchasing power parity implies that

Eit,. Pi; = P:.   If we detie   the PPP exchange rate for country i at date t as


                                                    PT1,t
                                              rit = —                                                  (6)
                                                    Pi:




        7We use two numeraire currencies, the U. S. dollar and the DM, m our tests.

                                                    7
purchasing power parity implies that the nominal exchange rate is equal to the PPP exchange rate.

The interesting question is whether purchasing power parity holds in the long run for traded

goods. As is we~ Imown, it fails dramatically in the short run. We therefore test whether h(EL,)

is cointegrated with ln(r,,), and whether the cointegrating slope is unity.




3, A Brief Review of the Econometric Methods

        Because the tess that we consider focus on the long-run or trend behavior of the relative

prices, relative productivities   and nominal and PPP exchange rates, we begin by examining the

long-run or trend behavior of each of the series and then test the restrictions that the hypotheses
                                                                                            .
imply on that long-run behavior.     In all of the tests that we implement, we allow the short-run

dynamics to be relatively unconstrained and focus only on the long-run behavior of the data.

        Before proceeding, we ask whether each of the series is better characterized by stationary

deviations from a deterministic trend or by stochastic trends, or possibly by both a deterministic

and stochastic trend. We therefore consider a univariate autoregression for each series,


                                                           5
                          Azit = Oi + (~i-l)Zi,_l       + ~yij   Azi,_j   +Vi,
                                                          j=l




and carry out three tests. The fist is an augmented Dickey FWer (1979) t-test of the hypothesis

that pi= 1. We allow the data to determine the number of lags, &, using the general-to-specific

procedures suggested by Hall ( 1994) and Ng and Perron ( 1995). The other two tests, proposed

by Phillips and Perron ( 1988), set ~ = O when estimating p and ad@st the test statistics using ~

autocovariances of the residual to account for autoconelation.       We also carry out the three tests


                                                    8
adding a trend to (7).

         ~   Pesaran and Shin ( 1995) propose te~ing the null hypothesis that Pi m 1 for i =1,..,,N

by computing the average t-ratio,    ~~ = N-l Z~.l (fii - 1)/&~. They show that the statistic,


                                                       iN-~
                                     %.T ‘ 0                                                         (8)
                                                              b~
                                                  [1     r



is distributed asymptotically as a standard normal. The mean and variance of the average t-ratio,

a~ and b~ depend only on T and ~ (the average of the ~ ) and are tabulated by @ Pesaran, and

Shin.s
                                                                                                 ,

         If the data contain stochastic trends, the Balassa-Samuelson     model implies that pairs of

series must share the same stochastic trend, that is they must be cointe~ated.      We test for

cointegration using both standard, residual-based tests for each country and the panel tests

proposed by Pedroni ( 1995). These tests examine the residual from the regression, yi~= Ui+ pi ~,

+ 6~t.9 We then use the estimated residuals, ~i(>in the autoregression,




        8 The asymptotic distribution is obtained by letting N-oD, T+=, and N/T-~ and assuming
that the data are generated independently across i. They suggest taking out common time effects
by using time dummies or (equivalently) computrng the test statistics using deviations from cross
section means to account for correlation across cross section units. Separate values for the
constants are tabulated for t-ratios computed from regression with and without a trend. Our cross
sections Mer in the number of obsemations that we have available so we use all of the available
data to compute the t-ratios for each cross section.

         9 In one set of tests y,, is the log relative price ofnontraded goods and A, is the log of the
relative average products of labor. In the second set of tests, y~~is the nominal exchange rate of

is asymptotically normal and presents critical values of the distribution for several combinations of

N and T. 11 The second test extends the semiparametric t-test. Pedroni ( 1995) shows that,




                            Zi =                                                                     (11)

is asymptotically normal and presents critical values for the distribution for several combinations

of N and T. The third tern, which extends the ADF test of cointegration, is similar to Z; but uses

the cross moments computed from (9).

       The Balassa-Samuelson       model not only implies that ptis   of variables should be

cointegrated, it implies that the slopes, pi, in the corntegrating relationships should have the

common value of 1.0. We tes this hypothesis in two ways. First, we impose pi = 1.0 and test for

unitroots   in the difference y~t- It using the same set of tests (the PhiJlips-Pemon and ADF tests

for each cross section along tith the Im-Pesaran-Shin tests for the panel) that we use to test for

unit roots in the individual series, Next, we compute the PhiUips-Hansen fidly motied          OLS


         11~s statistic is a slight modification of Pedroni’s that allows for a tierent number of
time series observations in each cross section. Pedroni’s panel tests, like the ~ Pesaran, Shin
tests, require cross sectional independence fier remotig common time effects. We account for
cross section correlation by using common time dummies to remove shocks common to all cross
sections for each year.

estimates of ~ and the corresponding       standard error and test the null hypothesis that pi = 1.0.

Pedroni ( 1996) proposes two tests of the hypothesis that the (common) cointe~ating             slope for

heterogeneous panels, ~, is equal to some value, PO,that we also use to test the null that the pi are

jointly equal to 1.0.

          Again, before describing the tests, we defie some notation.           The model is,

4.E~irical     Re.sultS

        Before examining either of the hypotheses of interest, we begin by examining the trend

behavior of each of these series. Table 1 contains the reds        of tests of the hypothesis that the

relative prices ofnontraded      goods in the countries in our panel contarn a unit root. There is little

evidence agtist     the null h~othesis     of a unit root. When we look at each country individually,

the nd hypothesis is rejected for Germany with one of the three tests and for Denmark with two

of the three tests. The panel test yields no evidence against the nkthe         mean t-ratio is negative,

but its expected value is negative and larger m absolute value. And once we include time the

average t-ratio is essentially equal to its expected value.


                                                         13
        Because the data may contain deterministic as well as stochastic trends, we also carry out

the unit root tests including a time trend. The panel tests of a unit root again yield no evidence

against the null. We also carry out an F-test of the nti that pi = 1 and the trend coefficient is zero

for each count~    and find evidence of a deterministic trend for Denmark and possibly for Canada.

Interestingly, once a time trend is included in the regression for Denmark the evidence against a

unit root disappears.    On the other hand, when a time trend is included m the regression for

Canada, we reject the null of a unit root.

        Table 2 contains the unit root tests for relative productivities.   Again, we tid little

evidence against the n~ hypothesis of a unit root. Regardless of whether we include common

time dummies, the panel tests do not come close to rejecting a unit root at conventional

significance levels. Among the individual regressions, only for Japan do we reject a unit root and

this is no longer the case once we include a deterministic trend in the regressions.    The country-

by-count~    F-tests point to evidence of deterministic trends in the regressions for Japan, Great

Britain, and Austria.   And when we inchde a deterministic trend, we can reject a unit root in the

regressions for Great Britain and Austria.

        The evidence points overwhelmingly to unit roots m both relative productivities       and the

relative price of nontraded goods. We therefore proceed with our tests looking at cointegrating

relationships,   But because the unit root assumption might be questionable for Canada, Great

Brita@ and Austria, we will carry out all jornt tests of this fist part of the Balassa-Samuelson

hypothesis both inckding and excluding these three countries.

        Tables 3 and 4 contain the redts     of the unit root tests for nominal exchange rates and the

PPP exchange rates, respectively.    There is no evidence againm the null of a unit root for either of


                                                    14
the series, both when we consider each country individually and when we use the panel to carry

our joint tests. In addition, in no instance do we fid evidence of determini~ic trends at the 5

percent level and in only one instance for each series do we find evidence at the 10 percent level,

We therefore proceed assuming that both the nominal exchange rate and the PPP exchange rate

for all countries in our panel contain a stochastic trend but no deterministic trend. Now that the

preliminary testing is completed, we turn to the hypotheses of interest,

4.1 Relative Prices and Relat ive productivities

        We be~     with the h~othesis    that, in the long run, the relative price ofnontraded     goods

reflects relative productivities in the traded and nontraded goods sectors. Table 5 contains the

redts   of tests of the null hypothesis that the relative prices and the relative productivities   are not

cointegrated.   The tests using data from an individual country yield mixed evidence. me

augmented Dickey-Fuller tests reject the null hypothesis of no cointegration for 7 of the 13

countries at the 10 percent leve~ and 6 of these 7 test statistics are also significant at the 5 percent

level. The other NO tests provide less evidence against the n~.        The results of the panel tests

provide strong evidence that relative prices and relative producttities     are, in fact, cointegrated.

We reject the nd    of no cointegration at the 5 percent level with all three tests, but when common

time dummies are inckded only the t-tests yield rejections.

        Because there is some evidence that deterministic trends might be in the data for some of

the countries, we also carry out the panel corntegration tests rncluding a time trend in the

cointegrating regression.   The evidence from these tests is not as strong, but, because only some

of the series may have deterministic trends and because the critical values with deterministic

trends are higher than those without deterministic trends, the tests are probably overly


                                                    15
consewative.    The evidence is weake~ when we include common time dummies. When we

exclude the 3 countries (Canada, Great Britain, and Austria) for which the data may not fit the

stochastic assumptions that the test rely on, we reject at the   5%   level for one of the three tests.

        We conclude from table 5 that the relative prices of nontraded goods and the relative

productivities in the traded and nontraded goods sectors are cointegrated as the Balassa-

Samuelson model predicts.       In tables 6 and 7 we turn to the stronger predictions of the Balassa-

Samuelson model that the slope in the cointegrating relationship is 1.0. In table 6 we test this

implication of the model by testing the nd hypothesis that there is a unit root in the ~erence

between the (log) relative price and the (log) relative productivities,    Once again the evidence is

mixed when we look at the tests carried out on the data for each country individually.          We reject

the null hypothesis of a unit root in the difference at the 5 percent level for 5 of the 13 countries

and at the 10 percent level for one additional country. Once again, however, the gain in power

from using joint tests in a panel is clear. We reject the n~ hypothesis of a unit root at the 5

percent level for all three groups of countries that we consider. The evidence horn the tests

without a time trend is clearly consistent with the hWothesis that the slope of the cointegrating

relationship is 1.0, or, alternatively, that the relative price of nontraded goods is proportional to

the relative productivities   in the traded and nontraded goods sectors.

        Inckding a time trend again weakens the evidence against the nd hypothesis of a unit

root. When time common dummies are included, we reject the nd hypothesis of a unit root in

the difference ordy when we consider all countries together.      There are several interpretations for

this haling.   It maybe that the tests are overly consemative because ordy some of the series may

have deterministic trends.    It maybe that relative prices and relative productivities   are


                                                    16
proportional in the long run for ordy some of the countries.     Or it may be that the added power

from using the fi.dl sample is responsible for the rejection when the fi.dl set of coutries   is used.

         The evidence in table 6 is generally consistent with the long run proportionality    of relative

prices and relative productivities.   An altemat~e means of testing whether the slope of the

cointegrating relationship is equal to 1,0 is to estimate the slope directly and do a t-test on the

estimated slope. We report the redts      of these tests in table 7. With three exceptions, Canada,

Denmark, and Sweden, the slope coefficients are generally close to 1,0. The average My

motied     OLS slope estimate is roughly 0.8, and excluding the three countries with the slope

around 0.5, the average is nearly 0.9. The slopes are fairly precisely estimated, however, and we

can reject the null hypothesis that the slope is 1.0 at the 5 percent level for 9 of the 13 countries.

The panel tests cob       these results. When we include common time dummies we obtain at-

ratio for the null that ~ = 1.0 of around -8.0 when we use all of the countries in the sample or

when we exckde the three countries for which the series are most likely to violate the

assumptions about the stochastic trends,

         The results of the formal tests are reflected in figure 2 where we plot the (log of the)

relative price of nontraded goods and the (log of the) relative labor produtiivities    in traded and

nontraded goods for four countries, Germany, Japan, It sly, and the United States. The two series

are normalized so that 1970 = O for each country, The ~erences          between the two series

generally appear to be transitory although the data for the United States and Italy exhibit a

tendency common to many of the countries we examine for the relative productivities to grow by

more than the relative price. This tendency is reflected in the slope estimates, which are generally

less than one.

         Tables 6 and 7 contain contradictory results. The redts     in table 6 are consistat   tith a

slope of 1.0 while the retit   from table 7 are not, One possible explanation for the difference is

the small sample properties of the my modi6ed OLS estimators.          Phillips and Hansen ( 1990) fid

that the FMOLS estimates can exhibit considerable small sample bias when e and ~ (born (12))

are persistent and when they are highly correlated.     In order to explore whether small sample

problems might be responsible for the ~erences        between the results in tables 6 and 7, we

conduct a series of Monte Carlo experiments.     First we ve@ that the FMOLS estimates perform

well even in samples of 25 observations when ~ and ~ are independent and identically distributed.

Then we choose three countries: one (the United States) with a slope estimate of around 0.9, one

(Belgium) with a slope estimate of around 0.8, and one (Denmark) with a slope estimate around

0.6. For each of the countries we estimate a VAR for q=(~, ()’ and use the parameters and error

covanance matrix to generate 15,000 samples of 25 observations in which the true value of ~ is

set to 1.0. We also examine the small sample properties of the pooled tests statistics from the

corresponding   1,000 samples of 15 countries and 25 observations.

         In all three cases we fmd that the FMOLS estimate of the slope is biased and that using the

asymptotic distribution wodd lead to rejecting the null hypothesis of ~= 1.0 too frequently.      The

mean FMOLS estimates of ~ are: 0.90 when we use the U.S. parameters, 0.77 when we use the

Belgian parameters, and 0.86 when we use the Danish parameters.         Thus for two of the three we

find that our point estimate from table 7 is roughly equal to the mean vake estimated from the

Monte Carlos in which the true value of ~ is unity. The point estimate in table 7 computed from

the Danish data (O.54) is below the average for the third and is significantly different from 1.0 at


                                                   18
the 5 percent level even using the empirical distribution from the Monte Carlo experiments.

            The tendency for the FMOLS estimates to reject the nd        of ~ = 1.0 too frequently and the

downward bias in the estimate of ~ is also reflected in the panel test statistics. As is the case with

the individual country tests, the panel tests (especidy       the group mean test) reject too frequently.

When the U, S. parameters are used to generate the data and all countries are used, the 95 percent

critical value from the Monte Carlos is below the value reported m table 7 for all countries.           The

critical values computed from the Monte Carlos using the other two sets of parameters all exceed

the test statistics reported in table 7.

            The Monte Carlo evidence suggest that one wotid tend to Iind slope estimates below 1,0

(relative productivity changes outstripping relative price changes) even if the true slope was, in

fact, 1.0. Thus the test statistics reported in table 7 should probably not be taken as evidence

against the nti h~othesis         that ~ is one. 12

            Figure 2, the redts    in tables 5, 6 and 7, and the Monte Carlo experiments taken together

lend support to the first part of the Balassa-Samuelson        hypothesis.     The relative prices of

nontraded goods and the relative productivities in the traded and nontraded goods sectors appear

to be cointegrated and the slope of the corntegrating relationship is close to 1.0 as the hypothesis

predicts.     Thus relative prices and relative productivities appear to be proportional in the long run

nominal exchange rate and the PPP exchange rate are not cointegrated,             The tests earned out on

the data from each individual country yield little evidence against the nu~ of no cointegration.

The ADF tests reject the null at the 5 percent level for only two countries, Great Britain and

Finland. We fmd no rejections tith either of the other NO tests. The benefit of pooling the data

in the panel tests is, once again, clearly apparent.        The panel tests provide evidence that the

nominal and PPP exchange rates are cointegrated.             When we include common time dummies, au

three test rejects the nd   of no cointegration at the 5 percent level.

        The redts    in table 8 suggest that nominal exchange rates and PPP exchange rates are

probably cointegrated when the U.S. dollar is the numeraire currency. If purchasing power parity

holds for traded goods, they shodd be cointegrated with a cointegrating slope of 1.0. Next we

test this stronger restriction of purchasing power parity and report the results in tables 9 and 10.

If purchasing power parity holds in the long run for traded goods, the ~erence            between the

nominal exchange rate and the PPP exchange rate should be stationary.             In table 9 we report the

results of tests of the nti hypothesis that there is a tit       root in the difference. The tests using the

data from each country individually provide no evidence against the nd hypothesis of a unit root.

The panel test points to a rejection of the null h~othesis         when common time dummies are used. 13

Otherwise the panel test yield no evidence against the nd.          Athough nominal exchange rates and

PPP exchange rates are cointegrated, the ~erence             between them appears to be nonstationary.


          13This rejection might appear surprising given the tiihue to reject the null of no
cointegration on the nominal and PPP exchange rates with the other tests. The reason for this
rejection becomes clearer in the next section when we change numeraire currencies. Because
changing the numeraire amounts to adding the same log exchange rate to each cross-sectional
unit, it ti have no impact on tests computed usrng deviations from cross-section means, at least
for large N. As can be seen by comparing the resldts in tables 8 and 12, with N= 12, a change of
nmeraire retits in ody minimal changes to the test statistics. See O’Connell ( 1996).

Contrary to the predictions of purchasing power parity in traded goods, the slope of the

cointegrating relationship appears not to be 1.0.

        In table 10 we present estimates of the slopes of the cointegrating relationships along with

tests of the hypothesis that the slope is 1.0. Consistent with the results in table 9, we find that we

reject the null hypothesis that the slope is 1.0 for 10 of the 12 countries and the panel test strongly

reject the null hypothesis that the slopes are jointly equal to one.   We also found a large number

of rejections of the null when we looked at the cointegrating slopes for relative prices and relative

productivities, but the reason for the large number of rejections is quite ~erent    here. There the

rejections arise because the slope estimates, which are fairly close to 1,0, are precisely estimated.

In contrast, here the point estimates are all far from 1.0 and we reject the nfl despite fairly large

standard errors. The wide range of point estimates that we report in table 10 is roughly consistent

with previous work that has looked at purchasing power parity. In their survey, Froot and Rogoff

(1995) repoti that it is common in the literature to find slopes that vary widely across countries

and are frequently far from the value of 1.0 that is implied by purchasing power parity.

4.4 Pure hasinz Power Paritv in Traded Goods :DMast        he Numeraire Currency

        Do the results on purchasing power parity in traded goods depend on the choice of the

U, S. dollar as the numeraire currency?14 In order to shed some light on this question,    we now

reconsider our tests using the DM as the numeraire currency. In table 11 we present the redts           of


         ‘4Two pieces of existing evidence suggest that it might. Papell ( 1995) tests the null
hypothesis of a unit root in real exchange rates computed with consumer prices and fids stronger
rejections when the DM is used as the reference currency than when the dollar is used as the
reference currency. Similarly, Jorion and Sweeney (1994) find stronger evidence that real
exchange rates are mean reverting when the DM is used as the numeraire. On the other hand,
Wei and Parsley ( 1995) use prices in 12 tradable sectors and fmd that rates of convergence to
purchasing power parity are similar when the DM and the U, S. dollar are used as the numeraire.

                                                    21
tests of the nti hypothesis that nominal exchange rates and PPP exchange rates are not

cointegrated.’s   The tests carried out on individual country data reject the null hypothesis only for

the three Scandinavian countries.     The results of the joint tests are somewhat stiar       to those

found using the U.S. dollar as the numeraire.      The added power derived from using a panel is

again apparent and the nd     of no cointegration is strongly rejected.

        The results in table 11 suggest that nominal and PPP exchange rates relative to the DM

(like those relative to the dollar) are cointegrated,     Next we turn to tests of the prediction that the

cointegrating slope coefficient is one. Again, the fist test inrposes the null hypothesis that the

slope is 1.0 and examines whether the ~erence           between nominal and PPP exchange rates is

stationary.   We present the results of these unit root tests in Table 12 and find fairly strong

evidence against the nti hypothesis of a unit root in the difference, We reject the null hypothesis

with at least two of the three tests for five of the twelve countries taken individually and with one

of the tests for a sixth country.   The joint tests yield rejections at the 95°/0 level or greater.

        Next we estimate the cointegrating slope and report the results in table 13. These resuks

provide an interesting contrast to those obtained using the U. S. dollar as the numeraire currency,

Although we reject the null hypothesis that the slope is 1.0 for tie of the twelve currencies, the

point estimates are fairly close to 1.0, and are much closer to 1.0 than are those obtained with a




         15We also test for unit roots in nominal exchange rates and PPP exchange rates (both
relative to the DM) but do not report the results. We find no evidence against the null of a unit
root in nominal exchange rates and only for Belgium do we fid strong evidence against the null
of a unit root in PPP exchange rates. We also reject the m.dl of a unit root in the PPP exchange
rates for Sweden and Austria using one of the three tests. Finafly, we do not tid deterministic
trends in either the nominal or PPP exchange rates.

dollar numeraire. ‘b Even for the cmencies   for which we reject the null hypothesis of a unit slope,

the point estimates are closer to one than are any of the slopes we obtain using the dollar as the

numeraire,

       The results we report in tables 11-13    lend somewhat favorable support for the h~othetis

of purchasing power parity in traded goods when the DM is the numeraire currency. Nominal

exchange rates and PPP exchange rates appear to be cointegrated and, although we can fiequentb

reject that the two are proportional in the long run, our estimates suggest that they are nearly

proportional for the currencies we consider. Interestin@y, the evidence does not indicate that

purchasing power parity in traded goods is any more likely to hold for European currencies than

for non-European   currencies relative to the DM.

       h figure 3 we plot the (logs of the) nominal and PPP exchange rates for the DM and yen

relative to the U, S. dollar and the lira and yen relative to the DM. Agarn, each series is

normalized so that 1970 = O. Large and long-lasting deviations from PPP m traded goods are

evident for both exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. As is consistent with the formal tests,

these deviations are smaller and less persistent when we examine the two exchange rates relative

to the DM.




5. Concluti~   Remarks

       How well does the Balassa-Samuelson       model explain the behavior of real exchange rates?


         16me one notable exception is the Belgian franc regression where we obtain a negative
point estimate and a large standard error. Recall that we rejected the m.dl hypothesis of a unit
root in the Belgian franc - DM PPP exchange rate but not for the nominal exchange rate. The
two therefore cannot be cointegrated so that the estimate is not particularly bothersome. The
slope for the U.S. dollar - DM exchange rate is, of course, identical to that reported in table 10.

                                                    23
The evidence from a panel of 13 OECD countries supports the h~othesis            that the relative price

ofnontraded   goods reflects the relative labor productivities in the traded and nontraded goods

sectors. The results suggest that the relative prices of nontraded goods and the relative

productivities in the traded and nontraded goods sectors are corntegrated and that the slope of the

cointegrating relationship is generally close to 1.0. For some comtries, groti         m relative

productivities appears to outstrip growth in relative prices (or equivalently the slope is less than

1.0), but Monte Carlo evidence suggests that this tierence     is within the range of sampling

variation in a sample like ours. Thus relative prices and relative produtities       appear to be

proportional in the long run.

        But the Balassa-Samuelson    model also assumes that traded goods prices are characterized

by purchasing power parity. As is consistent with the evidence presented in Engel ( 1995), we find

large and long-wed   deviations from PPP in traded goods when we look at U.S. dollar exchange

rates. Although nominal exchange rates and PPP exchange rates appear to be cointegrated we

fid that the slopes of the cointegrating regressions differ vary widely and ~er        substantially from

one. But when we examine DM exchange rates the evidence is considerably more favorable to

purchasing power parity in traded goods. Nominal and PPP exchange rates appear to be

cointegrated and the slopes of the cointegrating regressions are much closer to one than is the

case with U.S. dollar exchange rates. This evidence suggests that Engel’s results may well be

sensitive to the choice of numeraire currency. hterestin~,      apart from the U.S. dollar - DM

exchange rates, purchasing power parity does not appear to be a better characterization           of DM

exchange rates rebtive to European currencies than relative to non-European         currencies.

Appendix:      THE DATA

           Nominal exchange rates are from International Financial Statistics.   Sectoral price and

productivity data for Belgi~       Canada, Denmark, Great Britain, Firdand, France, Germany, Italy,

Japan, Sweden, and the US come from the OECD National Accounts.              Price and productivity

data for Austria and Spain come from national statistics. (Francisco de Castro of the Bank of

Spain coflected and documented the data, ) These sources provide annual sectoral data on

nominal value added, real value added and number of employees.          The traded sector is made up of

the “manufacturing” sector and the “agricdture, hunting forestry and fishing” sector. The non-

traded sector is made up of the “wholesale and retail trade, restaurants and hotels” sector, the

“trmsport, storage and commtication”         sector, the “finance, insurance, real estate and business

setices”     sector, the “community social and personal services” sector, and the “non-market

services” sector; the “non-market services” sector is made up of the “producers of government

services” subsector and the “other producers” subsector.

           Data consistency is always an issue, We are aware of the foflowing anomahes in the

OECD data: (1) The German market services emplo~mt              figures do not include the “real estate

and business services” sector; value added figures do. (2) The Italian, British and Belgian value

added and emplo~ent        figures do not include “real estate and busrness services” sector. (3)

BritiA value added and employmmt figures consist of the “producers of government setices”

sector; they do not rnclude the “other producers” sector.
