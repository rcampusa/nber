                                         ABSTRACT

We compare redistribution through trade restrictions vs. domestic lump-sum transfers. When
preferences are non-homothetic, even domestic lump-sum transfers affect relative prices. Thus,
contrary to the conventional wisdom, domestic lump-sum transfers are not necessarily superior to
distortionary trade policy. We develop this argument in the context of food export bans imposed
by many developing countries in the late 2000s.

1        Introduction

Should restrictive trade policy be used as a means of redistribution within a country? Conven-
tional wisdom in trade policy analysis offers an unequivocal “no” answer. The reason is that
trade policy distorts prices and thus generates misallocation of resources. According to this line
of reasoning purely domestic redistribution policies, ideally in the form of lump-sum transfers,
are superior to trade restrictions as they generate fewer or no distortions, either domestically or
internationally.
        This paper shows that the presence of non-homothetic preferences importantly qualifies or
even erases the superiority of domestic redistribution over trade restrictions. This is because under
non-homothetic preferences, even lump-sum transfers between individuals/groups with different
income elasticities of consumption have an impact on prices, making them more similar to the
distortionary trade restrictions.
        We develop this argument the context of food export bans that were imposed by a number
of developing countries during the last commodity price boom. Sharma (2011) estimates that
33 countries imposed some forms of export restrictions on grains and other food commodities
between 2007 and 2011. These policies met strong resistance from the international community.
Then World Bank president Robert Zoellick urged countries “to remove export bans and restric-
tions. These controls encourage hoarding, drive up prices, and hurt the poorest people around
the world who are struggling to feed themselves.”1 A few years later, then U.S. Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton issued a similar call: “[s]ome policies that countries enacted with the hope of mit-
igating the crisis, such as export bans on rice, only made matters worse. (...) And that sounder
approach includes (...) abstaining from export bans no matter how attractive they may appear to
be, using export quotas and taxes sparingly if at all (...).”2
        At first glance this setting should be a textbook application of the conventional wisdom. The
trade policy implemented by these countries was an export quota, widely considered the least
efficient type of trade restriction. While the redistributionary objective of these export bans was
widely recognized in the global policymaking circles, these countries were advised to achieve that
objective by means of domestic policies. Our analysis will consider the best kind of domestic
policy, namely a lump-sum transfer.
        In our model, there are N countries, two commodities, Food and Garments, and two types of

individuals, rich and poor. Preferences are Stone-Geary in Food and Garments, with a minimum
Food consumption requirement. We analyze the case in which the poor consume only Food, and
compare the effects of 2 policies in an individual country. The first is a binding Food export quota,
corresponding to the Food export bans implemented in many developing countries. The second
is a lump-sum redistribution policy from the rich to the poor. When preferences are homothetic,
it is immediate that a lump-sum transfer achieves the government’s redistributionary objective
without distorting the world market for Food. Thus, the first-best outcome obtains.
   However, under non-homothetic preferences, even lump-sum redistribution affects prices. Be-
cause the poor have a higher propensity to consume Food than the rich – indeed, in the case we
analyze all of their extra income goes to Food consumption – a transfer of one dollar of income
from the rich to the poor increases demand for Food, and therefore the Food price. Thus this
purely domestic lump-sum transfer has, at least qualitatively, a similar effect on the price of Food
as the export quota. In the limit, as non-homotheticity becomes extreme – that is, the income
elasticity of Food consumption of the rich goes to zero while the poor continue consuming only
Food – the domestic lump-sum redistribution policy converges to the export ban in its effect on
the global Food price.
   Our paper makes contact with two literatures. The first is the older debate on how trade policy
compares to other policy instruments (Haberler 1950, Hagen 1958, Bhagwati and Ramaswami
1963, Corden 1974). The main thrust of this literature is that trade restrictions are not normally
the most efficient way to achieve a given policy objective. We show that this conclusion must
be qualified if preferences are non-homothetic. Epifani and Gancia (2009) show that countries
have an incentive to increase the size of government as doing so improves the country’s terms of
trade. Because government expenditure is mainly on non-tradeables, increasing it pulls labor out
of the tradeable sector, reducing export supply and thus raising the prices of the country’s exports.
Ours is a qualitatively different mechanism, as it does not rely on non-tradeability of government-
provided goods, or indeed on the existence of the government expenditure on goods or services.
The policy we consider is a pure lump-sum transfer.
   The second is the line of research on trade policy in the presence of preference non-homotheticity.
While a number of recent influential papers model non-homothetic preferences and the impact of
trade opening on agents at the different points on the income distribution (Fajgelbaum, Grossman
and Helpman 2011, Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal 2016), there is comparatively less theoretical or
empirical work on trade policy in particular. Porto (2006) and and Faber (2014) analyze the dis-


                                                 3
tributional impact of individual trade agreements. Gresser (2002) documents that in the United
States, tariffs are strongly anti-poor. None of these papers compare tariff reductions to alternative
policies to benefit the poor. Most closely related to ours is the paper by Glazer and Ranjan (2007),
who develop a theoretical framework in which an import tariff lowers the poor’s marginal utility
of income and makes redistribution to them less efficient, a different interaction between trade
policy and redistribution than the one we consider here. The rest of the paper is organized as
follows. Section 2 presents the model and derives the main results. Section 3 concludes.



2       Baseline model

2.1       Preliminaries

Consider an endowment economy with two goods – Food and Garments – and N equal-sized
countries that trade with one another. Country c has an endowment profile (Φc , Γc ) of Food and
Garments, respectively. Each country is populated with two types of agents: the rich and the
poor, who are assumed to be in equal number. The poor have endowment (λc Φ, λc Γ) while the
rich own the remaining ((1 − λc ) Φ, (1 − λc ) Γ). Agents have non-homothetic preferences and we
assume they are of the Stone-Geary form:


                                          uc (f, g) = (f − φc )αc g 1−αc ,


where f and g are respectively the amounts of Food and Garments consumed by an individual in
country c and φc is the minimum level of Food consumption to be met before households diversify
and consume other goods.3
        Stone-Geary preferences imply that agents with income below a given threshold will spend it
all on Food, while agents with income above will also consume Garments. Trading of Garments
and Food takes place on a spot market. Denote by pc and qc the prices of Food and Garments in
country c. Trade is free of physical impediments but may be restricted by policy. Without loss of
generality, we henceforth consider policies in country c = 1, and restrict the analysis to the case in
which only this country implements a policy.
        The two available policies are a lump-sum redistribution scheme and an export quota. Denote
by τ1 a lump-sum transfer from the rich to the poor in country c = 1. Without loss of generality,
    3
    From an empirical perspective, the higher propensity of the poor to consume food is referred to as Engel’s law and
has ample empirical support; see e.g. Houthakker (1957).

assume that transfers are made in units of Food. The stated objective of trade insulation practices
is to protect domestic net Food consumers from high international Food prices. The second policy
we thus consider is a Food export quota Ẋ1 in country 1.
                                                                                                         i={rich,poor}

                                                                                                         c=1,...N

and relative prices {pc , qc }c=1,...N such that (i) agents maximize their utility, and (ii) markets clear.


2.2     Laissez-faire equilibrium

As there are no trade costs, the laissez-faire equilibrium prices for Food and Garments are the same
for every country and denoted by (p̄, q̄). The poor dedicate their entire endowment (λc Φc , λc Γc )
to Food consumption, while rich spend a fraction αc of their adjusted income on Food. Denoting
µc = λc + αc (1 − λc ), we can write aggregate Food consumption in country c as

                                                              q̄
                                   F̄c = µc Φc + (1 − αc )φc + µc Γc .
                                                              p̄

Global market clearing conditions pin down equilibrium prices. Without policy interventions, the
equilibrium price is:
                                        1   P
                                 q̄     N   c [(1   − µc ) Φc − (1 − αc )φc ]
                                    =                1 P                      .                          (1)
                                 p̄                  N     c µc Γc

Prices are the usual preference-weighted ratio of aggregate endowments adjusted for the Stone-
Geary parameters.
      Since we restrict the analysis to policies aimed at protecting the poor (and resulting in an
                                                      q̄
increase in Food consumption by the poor),            p̄   will be the upper-bound for international prices,
                                                    q̄ min
while one lower-bound, which we denote              p̄min
                                                             , corresponds to the case where country c = 1
consumes food only (α1 = 1), i.e.

                              q̄ min
                                            P
                                       0+       c>1 [(1− µc ) Φc − (1 − αc )φc ]
                                 min
                                     =                    P                      .                       (2)
                              p̄                     Γ1 + c µc Γc

      To ensure that throughout the analysis, the property that the poor in every country only con-
sume Food, while the rich diversify their consumption, it is sufficient to ensure that for every
c,
                                                                           q̄ min
                                                                                  
                            q̄
                     λc Φc + Γc ≤ φc            and          (1 − λc ) Φc + min Γc       ≥ φc .

To that end, we make the following assumption, which we will henceforth refer to as the Stone-

Note that prices are functions of λc , so we need to verify that the set of parameters λc that satisfy
(4) is not empty. To see this, note that the first argument in the bracket is positive, and (3) implies
that the second also is for every value of λc .

2.3     Trade insulation

Now consider a binding export quota Ẋ1 < X̄1 , where X̄1 is the laissez-faire level of exports from
country 1. In the trade insulation equilibrium, prices in country 1 will now differ from prices in
                                                                                   n                      o

   Conversely, the function θ̇1 (.) is decreasing: the domestic price of Food increases as more Food
is being exported. We summarize these results in Proposition 1 below; the proof is in the appendix.



                                                           7
Proposition 1: Trade insulation equilibrium                       Suppose that assumption A1 holds. There exists
an export quota Ẋ1m < X̄1 , such that for any quota Ẋ1 > Ẋ1m , the equilibrium prices of the
economy are characterized by (9) and (11).
      The implication of Proposition 1 is that by imposing an export quota on Food, country 1 im-
proves its terms of trade, negatively affecting its average trading partner. By lowering the domes-
tic price of Food, an export quota Ẋ1 benefits the poor in country c = 1. However, it is accom-
panied by increased international prices as reflected in (9). This effect is behind the significant
amount of opposition to export bans outside of the countries imposing them. We next demon-
strate that in the presence of non-homothetic demand, even purely domestic lump-sum transfers
have a similar effect.


2.4     Redistribution

Since domestic lump-sum transfers do not impede international exchange, in the equilibrium with
only domestic redistribution the prices are equalized in all countries. We denote the equilibrium
                         p̂(τ1 )
world price ratio by     q̂(τ1 ) ,   indexing it explicitly by the amount of redistribution. Equilibrium
consumption of Food in country c = 1 is given by

                                                                        q̂(τ1 )
                      F̂1 (τ1 ) = µ1 Φ1 + (1 − α1 )φ1 +                         µ1 Γ1 + (1 − α1 ) τ1 .
                                                                        p̂(τ1 )

Redistributing resources from the rich to the poor induces income to be transferred from agents
with a low propensity to consume Food towards agents with a high propensity to do so. Aggregate
Food consumption in country c = 1 hence increases.
      In other countries, consumption remains equal to

                                                                               q̂(τ1 )
                                     F̂n (τ1 ) = µn Φn + (1 − αn )φn +                 µn Γ n .
                                                                               p̂(τ1 )

Equalizing aggregate consumption and aggregate endowment yields
                                       "                                                    #

which is increasing with τ ; we can rewrite (13) as

                                        p̂(τ1 )   p̄

      We summarize the results in the Proposition below, the proof is in the appendix:


Proposition 2: Domestic redistribution equilibrium When the Stone-Geary conditions hold,
there exists a positive τ1m , such that any redistribution τ1 ∈ (0, τ1m ) from the rich to the poor in
country c = 1 leads to an equilibrium relative price characterized by (15). 

      A redistributive domestic policy has international price implications when preferences are
non-homothetic. In equilibrium domestic redistribution τ1 leads to higher Food prices as the size
of the transfer from the rich to the poor increases. Thus, this policy also improves country 1’s
terms of trade as long as it is a net exporter of Food.


2.5     Trade insulation as redistribution

To compare the effect of lump-sum transfers and export quotas on the world relative price of Food,
let’s consider a redistribution policy τ1 and choose a level of export quota Ẋ1 that keeps the poor in
country c at an identical welfare level. Export quota Ẋ1 will henceforth be said to be the pro-poor-
equivalent of the social protection policy τ1 : the values Ẋ1 and τ1 are characterized by equal welfare
levels of the poor. Thus, choosing τ1 low enough so that the characterization of the equilibrium in
Proposition 2 holds implies that its pro-poor-equivalent export quota Ẋ1 is also sufficiently large
for the equilibrium to be properly characterized by Proposition 1. Thus, Ḟ1 (Ẋ1 ) = F̂1 (τ1 ) implies

                                                                           !
                    τ1         λ1                θ̈(Ẋ1 ) + θ̇1 (Ẋ1 )            q̄
                         1 − γ1 (1 − α1 ) =                            Ẋ1       + θ̇1 (Ẋ1 )Γ1 ,   (16)
                    λ1         µ1                    1 − θ̈(Ẋ1 )                 p̄

where θ̇1 (.) and θ̈(.) are defined by (12) and (8), respectively. Both left-hand and right-hand sides
of equation (16) are strictly increasing in their respective arguments, which implies a one-to-one
correspondence between τ and Ẋ.
      Next we want to compare the price implications of using export quotas in lieu of redistribution
in order to assess the inefficiencies of export restrictions. Let’s consider τ a redistribution parame-
ter in country c = 1 and X its pro-poor-equivalent export quota. The world Food price difference




                                                    9

    We can thus linearize (16) and establish the following proposition:


Proposition 3: Distortions from trade insulation       For large N and for any redistribution τ1 < τ1m
adopted in country c = 1, its pro-poor-equivalent export restriction Ẋ1 will generate increased
Food prices such that
                           q̂(τ1 ) q̈(Ẋ1 )   1      α1 τ1    1
                                  −         ≈      1 P       ≡ ∆(τ1 ).                            (18)
                           p̂(τ1 ) p̈(Ẋ1 )   N λ1 N c µc Γc  N


    Export quotas distort prices, which induces the rich in country c = 1 to over-consume Food.
Export quotas could thus be viewed as a poorly targeted social transfer program that leads to
negative terms-of-trade effects for the rest of the world. To further inform the comparison between
lump-sum redistribution and export quotas, we next show that export-quota-related distortions
vanish as preference for Food among the rich goes to zero.


Proposition 4: Trade insulation as redistribution        Consider a sequence of economies indexed
by n ≥ 1, where {α1n } characterizes consumer preferences in country c = 1. Denote by {∆n (τ )}
the associated price distortions induced by an export quota pro-poor equivalent to redistribution
τ . If limn→∞ α1n = 0, then for every τ , limn→∞ ∆n (τ ) = 0. 

    As n increases, consumption patterns in country c = 1 become fully polarized: the poor con-
sume Food only and the rich consume Garments only (except for the minimum required φc ), so
that an export quota becomes akin to a lump-sum transfer from the rich to the poor. The substi-
tution effect no longer operates: when α goes to zero, domestic demand for Food becomes price
inelastic. There is no longer any distortion because the rich do not increase their consumption of
Food when domestic prices drop. Put another way, the distortion created by an export quota is
lower when the commodity being targeted for export quotas is an inferior good, the demand for
which has higher income elasticity.
    For the rest of the world, we have just shown that redistribution is always preferred to the ex-
port ban by country 1, as it worsens its terms of trade by less. For country 1 which of these policies
is preferred is ambiguous, as it trades off the greater terms of trade improvement under the export

                                                  10
ban against the deadweight loss of a distorting policy. We can show that a small country (N → ∞)
will always prefer redistribution, as the terms-of-trade effect is zero in that case. But when the
country is not small, the comparison between an export quota and redistribution is ambiguous.
A fuller evaluation of this tradeoff should also acknowledge that both policies likely involve sub-
stantial additional frictions, such as rent-seeking to capture export quota rents (Krueger 1974), as
well as inefficiencies and leakages that plague domestic redistribution schemes (see e.g. Murgai,
Ravallion and van de Walle 2013).



3   Conclusion

When preferences are non-homothetic, even lump-sum redistribution will affect equilibrium prices.
We explore the trade consequences of this phenomenon, in the context of food export bans intro-
duced by developing countries during the last commodity price boom. Export bans indeed raise
the world price of food and improve the export-banning countries’ terms of trade. What has been
underappreciated is that in this context, even purely domestic redistribution policies might have
a qualitatively similar effect. The terms-of-trade improvement under domestic lump-sum redis-
tribution is in the limit as large as under export quotas.

A     Appendix: Proofs of Propositions

A.1    Proof of Proposition 1

We have left to find the conditions such that in every country, the poor do not consume any Gar-
ments, while the rich consume both. First, note that aggregate income in country c = 1 is given by
h                                               i
  ṗ(Ẋ1 )(Φ1 − Ẋ1 ) + p̈(Ẋ1 )Ẋ1 + q̇(Ẋ1 )Γ1 .




                                                   12
                                         h                 i
                                             p̈(Ẋ1 )
   Since p̈(Ẋ1 ) > ṗ(Ẋ1 ), Φ1 +           ṗ(Ẋ1 )
                                                        − 1 Ẋ1 > Φ1 so that, by virtue of Stone-Geary condition (3),
the income of the rich in country 1 exceeds φ1 , for any export quota Ẋ1 . They thus consume both
goods.
   For the poor in country c = 1, consumption of Food only would imply
                                    "                                              #
                                                      p̈(Ẋ1 )       q̇(Ẋ1 )
                               λ1       (Φ1 − Ẋ1 ) +          Ẋ1 +          Γ1         < φ1 ,
                                                      ṗ(Ẋ1 )       ṗ(Ẋ1 )

which can be rewritten as
                         "                                          !                      !     #
                                 q̄                     p̈(Ẋ1 )             q̇(Ẋ1 ) q̄
                    λ1       Φ1 + Γ1 +                           − 1 Ẋ1 +           −         Γ1 < φ1 .          (19)
                                 p̄                     ṗ(Ẋ1 )             ṗ(Ẋ1 ) p̄

                                                                        h            i
As Ẋ1 goes to X̄1 , the left-hand side of equation (19) converges to λ1 Φ1 + p̄q̄ Γ1 < φ1 by virtue of
Stone-Geary condition (4). By continuity, there exists Ẋ1m < X̄1 such that the poor consume Food
only under trade insulation regime Ẋ1 > Ẋ1m .


A.2   Proof of Proposition 2

As for the case of Proposition 1, we have left to show that in country c = 1, the poor only consume
Food, while consumption of both Food and Garments is taking place for the rich. The Stone-Geary
conditions imply that this is indeed the case in countries c > 1.
   For consumers in country c = 1, the conditions for the poor to consume Food only and the rich
to consume both are

                             q̂(τ1 )                                                   q̂(τ1 )
               λ1 [Φ1 +              Γ1 ] + τ1 ≤ φ1            and    (1 − λ1 )[Φ1 +           Γ1 ] − τ1 ≥ φ1 ,
                             p̂(τ1 )                                                   p̂(τ1 )

which is equivalent to
                                                                            
                                     q̂(τ1 )                     q̂(τ1 )
               τ1 < min φ1 − λ1 Φ1 +         Γ1 ; (1 − λ1 ) Φ1 +         Γ 1 − φ1 .                               (20)
                                     p̂(τ1 )                     p̂(τ1 )

Note that Stone-Geary condition (4) implies
                                                                    
                                           q̂(τ1 )                  q̄
                             φ1 − λ 1 Φ1 +         Γ1 > φ1 − λ1 Φ1 + Γ1 > 0
                                           p̂(τ1 )                  p̄




                                                                     13
and
                                                                      q̄ min
                                                                                   
                                q̂(τ1 )
                 (1 − λ1 ) Φ1 +         Γ1       − φ1 > (1 − λ1 ) Φ1 + min Γ1             − φ1 > 0.
                                p̂(τ1 )                               p̄

Thus, there exists τ1m > 0 such that (20) holds for every τ1 < τ1m .


A.3   Proof of Proposition 3

Considering equation (17), the first-order term in 1/N can be obtained by taking the limit:

                                                                       1
                                   "             #
                                q̂(τ1 ) q̈(Ẋ1 )                     1−γ1 (X̄1   − Ẋ1 ) − (1 − α1 )τ1
               ∆(τ1 ) = lim N ·        −           = lim                         1 P                     (21)
                       N →∞     p̂(τ1 ) p̈(Ẋ1 )    N →∞
                                                                                 N    c µc Γc


   First, note that we have:

   • from equation (7): limN →∞ γ1 = 0

   • from expression (8): limN →∞ θ̈(Ẋ1 ) = 0

   • from expression (12):

                                                      X̄1 − Ẋ1                   1 X̄1 − Ẋ1
                    lim θ̇1 (Ẋ1 ) =                                            =     q̄
                   N →∞                (1 − µ1 )Φ1 − (1 − α1 )φ1 − X̄1 + µ1 Ẋ1   µ 1 p̄ Γ1 + Ẋ1



which allows us to substitute using (16) to determine the limit:

                       h                      i µ              
                                                                      α1
                                                   1
                   lim X̄1 − Ẋ1 − (1 − α1 )τ1 =     − (1 − α1 ) τ1 =    τ1 .                            (22)
                  N →∞                           λ1                   λ1

Substituting in equation (21) leads to expression (17). 

and limn→∞ α1n = 0, we have by continuity
