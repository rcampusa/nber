Is Hospital Competition Socially Wasteful?

NBER Working Paper No. 7266
July 1999

                                          ABSTRACT

       We study the consequences of hospital competition for Medicare beneficiaries’ heart attack
care from 1985 to 1994. We examine how relatively exogenous determinants of hospital choice such
as travel distances influence the competitiveness of hospital markets, and how hospital competition
interacts with the influence of managed care organizations to affect the key determinants of social
welfare – expenditures on treatment and patient health outcomes. In the 1980s, the welfare effects
of competition were ambiguous; but in the 1990s, competition unambiguously improves social
welfare. Increasing HMO enrollment over the sample period partially explains the dramatic change
in the impact of hospital competition.

                                            Introduction

       The welfare implications of competition in health care, particularly competition among

hospitals, have been the subject of considerable theoretical and empirical debate. On one side has

been work that finds that competition reduces costs, improves quality, and increases efficiency of

production in markets for hospital services (e.g., Pauly [1988]; Melnick et al. [1992]; Dranove et

al. [1993]; Vistnes [1995]; and Town and Vistnes [1997]). On the other side has been research

that argues that differences between hospital markets and stylized markets of simple economic

models lead competition to reduce social welfare. Health insurance, which dampens patients’

sensitivity to cost and price differences among hospitals, is the most important source of these

differences: insensitivity to price may lead hospitals to engage in a “medical arms race” and

compete through the provision of medically unnecessary services [Feldstein 1971; Held and Pauly

1983; Robinson and Luft 1985]. Other work focuses on informational imperfections in hospital

markets, which may cause increases in the number of providers to lead to higher costs (e.g.,

Satterthwaite [1979], Frech [1996]), and on the monopolistically-competitive nature of hospital

markets, which may cause competition to lead to excess capacity and therefore higher costs (e.g.,

Joskow [1980], Fisher et al. [1999]) and potentially to increased adverse patient health outcomes

[Shortell and Hughes 1988, Volpp and Waldfogel 1998].

       These opposing views have been manifested in two distinct policy perspectives. If

competition among hospitals improves social welfare, then strict limits on the extent to which

hospitals coordinate their activities may lead to greater efficiency in health care production. But if

competition among hospitals is socially wasteful, then lenient antitrust treatment of coordination

and mergers may be optimal.


                                                  1
       Despite the theoretical and policy implications of evidence on the welfare consequences of

competition in health care, virtually no previous research has identified these effects on both

health care costs and patient health outcomes; and without information on both costs and

outcomes, conclusions about patient welfare are necessarily speculative. In addition, previous

research has used measures of market competitiveness that may result in biased assessments of the

impact of competition. In this paper, we develop models of the effects of hospital competition on

costs and health outcomes for all nonrural elderly Medicare recipients hospitalized for a treatment

of a new heart attack (AMI) in 1985-1994. We identify the effects of hospital market

competition with a relatively exogenous source of variation -- travel distances between patients

and hospitals -- that depends neither on unobserved characteristics of patients nor on unobserved

determinants of hospital quality. Based on this identifying assumption, we construct geographic

hospital markets that have variable size, and continuous rather than discrete boundaries. We also

explore how managed care mediates the effects of hospital competition on medical treatment

decisions, costs, and outcomes. Finally, because we observe information on hospital markets and

HMOs over a long time horizon, we estimate the impact of area competitiveness holding constant

other time-varying market characteristics and fixed effects for zip code areas. Thus, we control

for all time-invariant heterogeneity across small geographic areas, hospitals, and patient

populations.

       Section I of the paper discusses the theoretical ambiguity of the impact of competition

among providers on efficiency in hospital markets. Section II reviews the previous empirical

literature on this topic. Although this literature has helped to shape understanding of markets for

medical care, Section II describes its three key limitations: it does not assess directly both the


                                                   2
financial implications and the patient health consequences of competition; it uses measures of

hospital competition that depend on unobserved hospital and patient heterogeneity, leading to

biased estimates of the impact of competition; and it has failed to control for a comprehensive set

of other hospital and area characteristics that may be correlated with competition, or that may

mediate its effects. Section III presents our econometric models of the exogenous determinants

of hospital choice and thus of differences in competition across small areas, and our models of the

effects of changes in competition on medical treatment decisions, health care costs, and health

outcomes. Section IV discusses our three data sources. Section V presents our empirical results,

and discusses potential implications of our findings for antitrust policy. Section VI concludes.



         I. Theoretical Models of the Impact of Hospital Competition on Social Welfare

       Basic microeconomic theory suggests that competition leads to efficient outcomes.

Markets for health care in general, and markets for hospital services in particular, deviate

substantially from the stylized conditions required by the basic theory, in which multiple buyers

and multiple sellers of a product or service are price takers with full information, and bear the full

costs of their actions at the margin. Not surprisingly, economic models of hospital competition

suggest that it may either improve or reduce social welfare.

       Most of the models of how hospital competition may reduce social welfare focus on

distorted price signals and a more general absence of price competition. Insurance and tax

incentives may make consumers relatively insensitive to price, for example, so that hospitals in

more competitive markets engage in a medical arms race (MAR) and supply socially excessive




                                                  3
levels of medical care [Salkever 1978; Robinson and Luft 1985].1 Further, hospitals were

historically reimbursed on a “cost-plus” basis, so that they too did not bear the marginal costs of

intensive treatment decisions. In addition, “quality competition” may be socially excessive

because of price regulation in the health care industry (see, e.g., Joskow [1983], and McClellan

[1994a] for a discussion).2 If the additional intensity of medical care resulting from competition is

excessive, in terms of improvements in patient health outcomes whose value is less than the social

costs of production, then competition among hospitals would be socially wasteful.

       However, even in MAR-type models, competition may improve welfare. Indeed, if

regulated prices are set appropriately and hospital markets are competitive, McClellan [1994a]

shows that a first-best outcome can be achieved even with full insurance. Moreover, many of the

MAR models are now viewed as theoretically outdated, because of improved price competition

among managed-care health plans. If plans have more capacity to negotiate and influence hospital

practices than do patients, and consumers pay for the marginal differences in premiums across

plans [Enthoven and Singer 1997], then the growth of managed care may have induced hospitals


       1
         The original MAR hypothesis was formulated around the idea that hospitals compete for
patients through competition for their physicians, by providing a wide range of equipment and
service capabilities. Greater availability of equipment may induces physicians to admit their
patients to a hospital for several reasons. If physicians are uncertain about the necessity of
various intensive treatments at the time the admission decision is made, then additional service
capabilities may allow them to provide higher-quality care. Also, to the extent that high-tech
equipment is a complement to compensated physician effort, additional equipment may allow
physicians to bill for more services; to the extent that equipment is a substitute for uncompensated
physician effort, additional equipment allows physician to work less for the same level of
compensation.
       2
         Models of the airline industry (e.g., Douglas and Miller [1974], Panzar [1975],
Schmalensee [1977]), for example, showed that regulated pricing induced airlines to engage in
nonprice competition, leading airline markets with greater numbers of competitors to have higher
service levels.

                                                  4
to compete on the basis of price (e.g., Town and Vistnes [1997]) and have lead to more cost-

effective use of medical technology (e.g, Pauly [1988]). Such price competition is likely to be

greatest in areas where managed-care health plans are most widespread.

       Other aspects of hospital markets besides the effects of insurance and managed care on

price and quality competition also make it difficult to draw definitive theoretical conclusions about

the consequences of competition. Informational imperfections in hospital markets may cause

competition to reduce social welfare (e.g., Satterthwaite [1979], Frech [1996]). In addition, if

hospital markets are monopolistically competitive and not perfectly competitive, greater

competition may lead to less efficient levels of care (e.g., Frech [1996]). Although conventional

wisdom is that monopolistic competition in hospital markets yields too many providers and excess

capacity (with no hospital large enough to exhaust returns to scale), in fact monopolistic

competition can lead to either socially excessive or inadequate capacity [Tirole 1988, Sec. 7.2].

Finally, a substantial fraction of hospitals are nonprofit institutions, which may have different

objectives and behave differently than their for-profit counterparts (e.g., Hansmann [1980]; Kopit

and McCann [1988]; Lynk [1995]). Models of competition based on for-profit objectives may

not accurately characterize the welfare implications of interactions in hospital markets.



                                  II. Previous Empirical Literature

       A vast empirical literature has examined the consequences of competition in markets for

hospital services (see Gaynor and Haas-Wilson [1997] and Dranove and White [1994] for

comprehensive reviews). In summary, research based on data from prior to the mid-1980s finds

that competition among hospitals leads to increases in excess capacity, costs, and prices [Joskow


                                                  5
1980; Robinson and Luft 1985, 1987; Noether 1988; Robinson 1988; Robinson et al. 1988;

Hughes and Luft 1991]; and research based on more recent data generally finds that competition

among hospitals leads to reductions in excess capacity, costs, and prices [Zwanziger and Melnick

1988; Wooley 1989; Dranove, Shanley, and Simon 1992; Melnick et al. 1992; Dranove, Shanley,

and White 1993; Gruber 1994], with some important exceptions [Robinson and Luft 1988;

Mannheim et al. 1994].

        The empirical literature has three well-known limitations. First and foremost, virtually

none of the literature assesses directly the impact of competition either on resource use or on

patient health outcomes; without significant additional assumptions, it is not possible to draw any

conclusions about social welfare (see Hoxby [1994] for discussion of this point in the context of

competition among public schools). Most research does not measure the impact of competition

on the total resources used to treat a given occurrence of illness -- that is, the financial social costs

or benefits of competition. Some work uses “list” charges rather than transaction prices (e.g.,

Noether [1988]), although fewer and fewer patients pay undiscounted prices [Dranove, Shanley,

and White 1993]. Even those studies that use transaction prices (e.g., Melnick et al. [1992]) or

transaction-price/cost margins (e.g., Dranove, Shanley, and White [1993]) analyze the prices for a

fixed basket of services, despite the fact that the welfare losses from the absence of hospital

competition are likely to be due to the provision of additional services of minimal medical benefit,

rather than to increases in prices for a given basket of services. Other studies measure the effects

of competition on the profitability of for-profit hospitals [Wooley 1989], on accounting costs per

case-mix adjusted admission [Robinson and Luft 1985, 1987, 1988; Zwanziger and Melnick 1988;

Mannheim et al. 1994], on employment of specialized personnel [Robinson 1988], on lengths of


                                                   6
stay [Robinson et al. 1988], and on patterns of provision of specific hospital services [Hughes and

Luft 1991; Dranove, Shanley, and Simon 1992]. We identified two previous economic studies

that sought to assess the consequences of competition for patient health outcomes [Shortell and

Hughes 1988, Volpp and Waldfogel 1998]. Shortell and Hughes [1988] does not examine the

impact of competition on treatment decisions; and both studies investigate the effect of

competition on in-hospital mortality only. This is an incomplete measure of health: if longer

hospital stays improve patient health but provide more time for deaths to occur, better outcomes

might be associated with higher in-hospital mortality. No studies have examined comprehensive

or longer-term health effects.

       The second well-known problem in the empirical literature is that the commonly-used

measures of market competitiveness may result in biased estimates of the impact of competition

on prices, costs, and outcomes. For example, the “variable radius” method specifies each

hospital’s relevant geographic market as a circular area around the hospital with radius equal to

the minimum necessary to include a fixed percentage of that hospital’s patients, often 60 or 75

percent [Elzinga and Hogarty 1978; Garnick et al. 1987]. Hospitals inside the circular area are

considered to be relevant competitors; hospitals outside the area are considered to be irrelevant.

Based on its universe of relevant competitors, each hospital receives an index of competitiveness

like the Hirschman-Herfindahl index (HHI), equal to the sum of squared shares of beds or number

of patient discharges. For purposes of assessing the effect of competition on individual patients,

each patient is assumed to be subject to the competitiveness of the relevant market of her hospital

of admission.

       Every stage in the process of constructing conventional measures can lead to bias in the


                                                 7
estimated effects of competition. First, the specification of geographic market size as a function

of actual patient choices leads to market sizes and measures of competitiveness that are increasing

in unobservable (to the researcher) hospital quality, if patients are willing to travel further for

higher-quality care (e.g., Luft et al. [1990]). In this case, estimates of the effect of market

competitiveness on costs or outcomes are a combination of the true effect and of the effects of

unobservable hospital quality (e.g., Werden [1989]). Second, the discrete nature of market

boundaries assume that hospitals are either completely in or completely out of any relevant

geographic market. This leads to measurement error in geographic markets, which in turn biases

the estimated effect of competition toward zero. Third, the measures of output conventionally

used to construct indices of competitiveness like the HHI – such as hospital bed capacities and

actual patient flows – may themselves be outcomes of the competitive process. Fourth, assigning

hospital market competitiveness to patients based on which hospital they actually attended –

rather than their area of residence – can induce a correlation between competitiveness and

unobservable determinants of patients’ costs and outcomes, because a patient’s hospital of

admission may depend on unobserved determinants of patients’ health status.

        The third problem is that most previous work has failed to control for a comprehensive set

of other hospital and area characteristics that may be correlated with competition, or that may

mediate its effects. These additional factors include hospital bed capacity and the influence of

managed care. Substantial research, starting with Roemer [1961], has suggested that high levels

of bed capacity per patient lead to longer lengths of stay and higher costs; more recent research

indicates that hospitals which treat relatively few cases of any particular type may deliver lower-

quality care. On the other hand, high levels of capacity per patient may reduce the travel distance


                                                   8
and time necessary to obtain treatment, which may lead to improved health outcomes.

       Similarly, recent studies have generally shown that higher levels and growth of managed

care are associated with lower growth in medical expenditures (e.g., Baker [1999]). However,

few studies have examined the consequences of managed care growth for health outcomes,

leaving important unresolved questions about the impact of managed care on patient welfare.

Moreover, the studies provide little insights about how managed care achieves its effects. Can it

substitute for hospital competition in limiting medical spending, or does competition among

hospitals enhance its effects? And do the consequences of managed care for health outcomes

differ in areas with more or less competition among providers? Surprisingly, even though

negotiations with providers are the principal mechanism through which managed care is thought

to influence medical practices, essentially no studies have examined how managed care interacts

with provider competition.

       Thus, although the previous literature has provided a range of insights about variation in

hospital competition and the relation of competitiveness to measures of hospitals’ behavior, it has

not provided direct empirical evidence on how competition affects social welfare. Furthermore,

because the literature has analyzed measures of market size and competitiveness that are not

based on exogenous determinants of the demand for hospital services, and because these measures

may be correlated with other determinants of costs and outcomes like hospital capacity, the

resulting estimates of the effects of competition may be biased. Finally, very few studies have

assessed the effects of competition in recent health care environments, in which managed care

figures prominently.




                                                 9
                                             III. Models

       As we describe in more detail in the next section, we analyze patient-level data on the

intensity of treatment, all-cause mortality, and cardiac complications rates for all nonrural elderly

Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with cardiac illness over the 1985-1994 period. To avoid the

problems of prior studies in obtaining accurate estimates of the effects of market competitiveness

on hospital performance, we use a three-stage method. The core idea of our method is to model

hospital choice based on exogenous factors, and to use the results as a basis for constructing our

competition indices. This approach avoids the major empirical obstacles in previous studies of

competition described in Section II, and our data permit a thorough evaluation of the

consequences of competition for treatment decisions, expenditures, and health outcomes.

       First, we specify and estimate patient-level hospital choice models as a function of

exogenous determinants of the hospital admission decision. We do not constrain hospital

geographic markets based on a priori assumptions. We allow each individual’s potentially-

relevant geographic hospital market for cardiac-care services to include all nonfederal, general

medical /surgical hospital within 35 miles of the patient’s residence with at least five admissions

for AMI, and any large, nonfederal, general medical/surgical teaching hospital within 100 miles of

the patient’s residence with at least five AMI admissions. (We explain the reason for these a

priori constraints on potentially-relevant geographic markets below; because markets for cardiac

care are generally much smaller than the constraints, they are not restrictive.) We model the

extent to which hospitals of various types at various distances from each patient’s residence affect

each patient’s hospital choice, and we also allow each patient’s demographic characteristics to

affect her likelihood of choosing hospitals of one type over another. The results of these models


                                                  10
of hospital demand provide predicted probabilities of admission for every patient to every hospital

in his or her potentially-relevant geographic market. We then estimate the predicted number of

patients admitted to each hospital in the U.S., based only on observable, exogenous

characteristics of patients and hospitals.

        Second, we calculate measures of hospital market competitiveness that are a function of

these predicted patient flows (rather than actual patient flows or capacity), and assign them to

patients based on their probabalistic hospital of admission (rather than their actual hospital of

admission). Thus, the measure of hospital market structure that we assign to each patient is

uncorrelated with unobserved heterogeneity across individual patients, individual hospitals, and

geographic hospital markets.

        Third, we use these unbiased indices of competitiveness to estimate the impact of hospital

competition on treatment intensity and health outcomes. Because managed care organizations are

likely to be an important mechanism through which competition affects hospital markets, we

investigate the extent to which the rate of HMO enrollment in an area interacts with hospital

market competitiveness. We now describe each stage of our estimation process in more detail.

                              III.1. Modeling patients’ hospital choice

        Consider an individual i with cardiac illness at time t=1, . . ., T who chooses among the J

hospitals in her area (J may vary across individuals; in the subsequent choice model, the time

subscript is suppressed for notational economy). The jth hospital (j = 1,. . ., J) has H binary

characteristics describing its size, ownership status, and teaching status, denoted by Zj1,. . ., ZjH.

Our model hypothesizes that individual i’s hospital choice depends on her utility from that choice,

and that her utility from choosing hospital j depends on her characteristics, the characteristics of j,


                                                   11
and the distance of i to j relative to the distance of i to the nearest hospital jN … j that is either a

good substitute or a poor substitute for j in some dimension.3 We hypothesize that the utility

from choosing one particular hospital over another depends on the relative distance between i’s

residence and each hospital because travel cost, as measured by distance, is an important

determinant of the hospital choice decision for individuals with acute illness.4 As we discuss

below, we seek to avoid the most restrictive assumptions typically associated with modeling of a

choice decision. Most importantly, our model does not assume that the choice decision between

any two hospitals is independent of so-called irrelevant alternatives. The relative utility for i of

choosing hospital j versus hospital j* depends not only on the characteristics of j and j*, but also

on the characteristics of other hospitals jN that may be good or poor substitutes for j and j*.

        Because hospital j is characterized by H binary characteristics Zj1,. . ., ZjH, we parameterize

the utility of i from choosing j as a function of 2*H relative distances: H relative distances that

depend on the location of hospitals that are good substitutes for j (same-type relative distances),

and H relative distances that depend on the location of hospitals that are poor substitutes for j

(different-type relative distances). First, i’s utility from choosing j depends on H same-type

relative distances, Dij1+, . . ., DijH+, where Dijh+ is the distance from i’s residence to hospital j minus

the distance from i’s residence to the nearest hospital jN with ZjNh = Zjh. Dijh+ enters i’s utility

because the availability at low travel cost of good substitutes for j in one or more dimensions

(e.g., Dijh+ >> 0) may reduce i’s utility from choosing j. Second, i’s utility from choosing j


        3
         We calculate travel distances from patients to hospitals as the distance from the center of
the patient’s five-digit zip code to the center of the hospital’s five-digit zip code.
        4
         Particularly for acute illnesses such as heart disease, distances from patient residence to
different types of hospitals are a strong predictor of hospital of admission [McClellan 1994b].

                                                    12
depends on H different-type relative distances, Dij1-, . . ., DijH-, where Dijh- is the distance from i’s

residence to hospital j minus the distance from i’s residence to the nearest hospital jN with ZjNh …

Zjh. Dijh- enters i’s utility because the availability at low travel cost of poor substitutes for j in one

or more dimensions may also affect i’s utility from choosing j.

        We model i’s indirect expected utility from choosing j, Yij*, as the sum of a function V of

the 2H relative distances and hospital characteristics Zj1,. . ., ZjH; a function W of i’s demographic

characteristics Xi and hospital characteristics Zj1,. . ., ZjH; and a factor åij that depends on

unobservable characteristics of individuals and hospitals, such as individuals’ choice of physician

(because the admission decision is made jointly with patients and physicians) and health status:

                    *           1+          H+     1−          H−       1         H
                 Yij = V(D ij , . . . , D ij , D ij , .. . , D ij ; Z j , .. . , Z j ) +
                                            1           H
                                W(X i ; Z j , . .. , Z j ) + ∈ ij


        We specify V as a nonparametric function of relative distances and hospital characteristics

to avoid assuming a particular functional relationship between travel costs, hospital

characteristics, and individuals’ hospital choice problem. In particular, we divide each differential

distance Dijh+ and Dijh- into four categories, with category boundaries at the 10th, 25th, and 50th

percentile of the distribution of the respective differential distance.     This implies four indicator

differential distance variables (DD1ijh+, . . ., DD4ijh+) = DDijh+ for each Dijh+, and four indicator

differential distance variables (DD1ijh-, . . ., DD4ijh-) = DDijh- for each Dijh-. Also, we allow the

impact on utility of Dijh+ and Dijh- to vary, depending on whether Zjh = 0 or Zjh = 1. For example,

same-type relative distance would be a more important determinant of the utility derived from

choosing one nonteaching hospital over another versus than of the utility derived from choosing

one teaching hospital over another, if nonteaching hospitals were on average closer substitutes for

one another than were teaching hospitals. Thus, for every i-j pair, V(.) can be written as a

function of relative distances, hospital characteristics, and 4*H vectors of parameters [(è 11, è 21,

          Under the assumption that the individual chooses that hospital that maximizes her

expected utility, and that åij is independently and identically distributed with a type I extreme value

distribution, McFadden [1973] shows that the probability of individual i choosing hospital j is

equal to


                                                                                ( Vij + Wij )

We solve for è and ë by maximizing the log-likelihood function




          5
        Because i’s individual characteristics can only affect her probability of choosing one type
of hospital relative to another, the impact of characteristics Xi necessarily varies by hospital type.

                                                                  14

We estimate this model separately for different years and for different regions of the country (e.g.,

allow è and ë and the relative-distance category boundaries to vary), to account for differences in

the effects of distances and other hospital and patient characteristics across regions and over

time.6

                      III.2. Calculating measures of hospital market structure

         With estimates of è and ë from the choice models, we calculate predicted probabilities of

admission for every patient to every hospital in his or her potentially-relevant geographic market

ð^ij. Summing over patients, these ð^ij translate into a predicted number of patients admitted to each

hospital in the U.S., based only on observable, exogenous characteristics of patients and

hospitals. For every zip code of patient residence k=1, . . ., K, the predicted probabilities

translate into a predicted share of patients from zip k going to hospital j, denoted by á^jk:

high densities of hospitals.

       For comparability with the previous literature, our measures of competitiveness are in the

form of predicted HHIs.7 If hospitals face separate demand functions for each zip code in their

service areas -- that is, are able to differentiate among patients based on their zip code of

residence – then the predicted HHI for patients in zip k is

                                                          J
                                        HHI k = ∑ α$ jk .

                                                         j= 1



HHIkpat differs from the measures used in the previous literature in several ways. First, it uses

expected patient shares based on exogenous determinants of patient flows, rather than potentially

endogenous measures such as bed capacity or actual patient flows. Second, it assigns patients to

hospital markets based on an exogenous variable (zip code of residence), rather than an

endogenous one (actual hospital of admission). Third, it defines geographic markets to include all

potentially-competitive hospitals, but only to the extent that they would be expected to serve a

geographic area, rather than defining geographic markets to include arbitrarily all hospitals located

within a fixed distance or within the minimum distance necessary to account for a fixed share of

admissions.



       7
         The key properties of competition indices like HHIs are that they decrease in the number
of competitors and increase in inequality in size among competitors. As noted in more detail
below, we use HHIs in only a categorical way; provided that an index has these properties, our
results are likely to be robust to the specific form of the index.

                                                    16
        However, this measure assumes that hospitals differentiate among patients based on the

competitiveness of their particular residential area. More realistically, hospital decisions would

depend on the total demand for hospital services from all nearby areas. The competitiveness of a

hospital’s market is a function of the weighted average of the competitiveness of all the patient

residence areas that it serves. If â kj represents the share of hospital j’s predicted demand coming

from zip code k (this is a hospital-level share, not a zip-level share like á jk), then the HHI for

hospital j can be written:

        If we were to follow the approach of the previous literature, we would assign to patients

such a measure of the competition faced by the hospital according to each patient’s actual hospital

of admission. However, as Section II observed, this will lead to biased estimates of the impact of

market structure on patient welfare, if unobserved determinants of hospital choice are correlated

with patient health status. For this reason, the competitiveness index that we use in analysis,

HHIkpat*, assigns HHIjhosp to patients based on the vector of average expected probabilities of

hospital choice in the patient’s zip of residence:

                                                                                     J

                                                                                    j= 1
                                                                                                 hosp

In words, this index is the weighted average of the competition indices for hospitals expected to


                                                               17
treat patients in a given geographic area of residence, weighted by the hospital’s expected share of

area patients. Thus, variation in HHIkpat* over time and across areas comes from three sources:

changes over time across areas in hospital markets (e.g., openings, closures, and mergers of

hospitals), changes over time in the response of individuals’ hospital choice decision to differential

distances (which affects competition differently across areas), and changes over time in the

distribution across areas of the population of AMI patients.

        Other important market factors – including the distance to the nearest hospital of any type

(which could affect treatment intensity and outcomes if patients who must travel a long distance

to the hospital do not get prompt emergency care), bed capacity, the characteristics of hospitals in

different residential markets (size, ownership status, and teaching status), and area managed care

enrollment rates – may also affect hospital decisions and be correlated with or mediate hospital

competition. In all models that include HHIkpat*, we include controls for the distance to the

nearest hospital, zip-code level hospital bed capacity per probabilistic AMI patient, and the zip-

code density of hospital characteristics. The latter two of these are constructed analogously to

HHIkpat*. To calculate our measure of bed capacity CAPkpat*, for example, we begin with a

measure of capacity, CAPkpat, that assumes that hospitals face separate demand functions for each

zip code in their service areas:


                                       pat      J              Bj
                                   CAPk      = ∑ α$ jk ⋅               ,
                                               j=1
                                                             ∑ π$ ij

where Bj represents the number of beds in hospital j. Then, we calculate the bed capacity per

probabilistic patient faced by each hospital, CAPjhosp, as a â kj-weighted average of CAPkpat. The


                                                     18
measure of capacity that we use in estimation, CAPkpat*, assigns CAPjhosp to patients based on the

vector of averaged expected probabilities of hospital choice in the patient’s zip of residence:

We describe the construction of area managed-care enrollment rates in section IV below.

              III.3. Modeling the impact of hospital competition on patient welfare

       We assess the impact of hospital competition on hospital expenditures and health

outcomes, using longitudinal data on cohorts of elderly Medicare beneficiaries with heart disease

in 1985, 1988, 1991, and 1994. We use zip-code fixed effects to control for all time-invariant

heterogeneity across small geographic areas, hospitals, and patient populations; our estimates of

the effect of competition are identified using changes in hospital markets. We investigate the

extent to which managed-care enrollment in an area interacts with hospital market

competitiveness to affect treatment intensity and patient health outcomes, and we jointly analyze

the effects of competition, hospital bed capacity, and other characteristics. In addition, we include

separate time-fixed-effects for individuals from differently-sized geographic areas (i.e., smaller and

larger metropolitan areas), and include controls for time-varying characteristics of geographic


                                                             19
areas (such as the travel distance between individuals’ residence and their closest hospital), to

address the possibility that our estimated effects of competition are due to still other omitted

factors that were correlated with health care costs, health outcomes, and hospital markets. We

describe these variables in more detail in the next section.

        In zip code k during year t = 1,. . ., T, observational units in our analysis of the welfare

consequences of competition consist of individuals i=1,. . ., Nkt who are hospitalized with new

occurrences of particular illnesses such as a heart attack. Each patient has observable

characteristics Uikt: four age indicator variables (70-74 years, 75-79 years, 80-89 years, and 90-99

years; omitted group is 65-69 years), gender, and black/nonblack race; plus a full set of interaction

effects between age, gender, and race; and interactions between year and each of the age, gender,

and race indicators. The individual receives treatment of aggregate intensity Rikt, where R is total

hospital expenditures in the year after the health event. The patient has a health outcome Oikt,

possibly affected by the intensity of treatment received, where a higher value denotes a more

adverse outcome (O is binary in all of our outcome models).

        Our basic models are of the form

                                         pat *                                  pat *

                                                                                                                (1)

where ä k is a zip-code fixed-effect; ó t is a time fixed-effect; Mk is a six-dimensional vector of

indicator variables denoting the size of individual i’s MSA; I(.) is an indicator function; OMCkt is a

vector of other market characteristics in zip code k at time t, including CAPktpat*, controls for the

area densities of hospitals of different sizes, ownership statuses, and teaching statuses

(hosp_char_1ktpat*, . . ., hosp_char_Hktpat*), and the travel distance to the hospital nearest to zip

code k; and î ikt is a mean-zero independently-distributed error term with E(î ikt |. . .) = 0. Based

on findings from the previous empirical literature, we allow ç and ø to vary in the 1980s and

1990s.

         We estimate three variants of (1). First, for purposes of comparison with previous work,

we estimate (1) substituting for HHIktpat* conventionally-calculated HHIs (as a function of shares

of actual patient flows, based on a 75-percent-actual-patient-flow variable-radius geographic

market, matched to patients based on their hospital of admission), and substituting for OMCkt the

characteristics of hospital of admission Zj1,. . ., ZjH. Second, in order to investigate how the

responsiveness of behavior to competition varies across differently-competitive markets, we

estimate a nonparametric model as well as a simple linear model of the effect of HHIktpat* on Rikt

and Oikt. The nonparametric model includes three indicator variables that divide HHIktpat* into

quartiles (omitted category is the lowest quartile), with quartile cutoffs in all years based on the

1985-94 pooled distribution of HHIktpat* at the zip code level. Third, we allow ç and ø to vary in

areas with above-median versus below-median managed care enrollment, because theoretical

work suggests that insurance market characteristics may alter the impact of hospital competition.

         In equation (1), changes in the estimated effect of competition ç between the 1980s and

1990s may be due to two factors: changes over time in the response of the level of expenditures

or outcomes to changes in competition, or changes over time in the growth rate of expenditures

or outcomes in areas with high versus low levels of competition. We investigate the importance

of the first effect with three period-by-period “difference-in-difference” models (1985-88, 1988-

91, 1991-94) of the effect of changes in competition:


                                                   21
                                                    pat *       pat *
ln( R ikt ) = δ k + σ t M k + U ikt φ + IQ ( HHI kt − HHI kt −1 ) γ + OMC kt ψ + ξ ikt . (2)

In this equation, IQ(.) is a function that returns a three-element vector of indicator variables

describing the extent of interquartile changes in competition in zip code k from t-1 to t. Thus,

estimates of ã from equation (2) represent the change in resource use or health outcomes for

patients in residential areas experiencing interquartile changes in competition, relative to patients

in areas without interquartile changes, holding constant patient background, other market

characteristics, and zip-code fixed effects. Specifically, the elements of the vector returned by

IQ(.) are as follows: into_topkt = 1 in period t if zip code k moved from the second to the first

quartile of HHIktpat* between t-1 and t, = -1 in period t if zip code k moved from the first to the

second quartile between t-1 and t, and = 0 for other changes, no change, and for all observations

from period t-1; out_of_btmkt = 1 in period t if k moved from the fourth to the third quartile

between t-1 and t, = -1 in period t if k moved from the third to the fourth quartile, and 0

otherwise; and qtl_3_to_2 =1 in period t if k moved from the third to the second quartile between

t-1 and t, = -1 in period t if k moved from the second to the third quartile, and 0 otherwise. This

specification imposes the constraint that changes in competitiveness of opposing direction but

between the same quartiles have effects of equal magnitude but opposite sign.



                                              IV. Data

       We use data from three principal sources. First, we use comprehensive longitudinal

Medicare claims data for the vast majority of elderly nonrural beneficiaries who were admitted to

a hospital with a new primary diagnosis of AMI in 1985, 1988, 1991, and 1994. The sample is


                                                  22
analogous to that used in Kessler and McClellan [1996, 1998]. Patients with admissions for the

same illness in the prior year were excluded. We focus on hospital choice for the initial

hospitalization. Decisions by a hospital to transfer a patient, and the extent to which they provide

followup care and readmissions (or refer patients to other hospitals that provide these services

well), are important aspects of quality of care. In addition, many treatments administered within

hours of admission for heart disease have important implications for patient outcomes.

       Measures of total one-year hospital expenditures were obtained by adding up all inpatient

reimbursements (including copayments and deductibles not paid by Medicare) from insurance

claims for all hospitalizations in the year following each patient’s initial admission for AMI.8


       8
          Because Medicare’s diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system for hospitals appears
to compensate hospitals on a fixed-price basis per admission for treatment, and Medicare does not
bargain with individual hospitals, competition might appear to be irrelevant to Medicare patients’
hospital expenditures. However, competition may affect Medicare patients both through “direct”
and “spillover” effects.
         Competition may have direct effects on Medicare patients because the intensity of
treatment of all health problems may vary enormously, and because the DRG system actually
contains important elements of cost sharing (e.g., McClellan [1994a, 1997]). For example, many
DRGs are related to intensive treatments such as cardiac catheterization and bypass surgery,
rather than to diagnoses such as heart attack. Thus, for most health problems, hospitals that
provide more intensive treatment and incur higher costs can receive considerable additional
payments. To the extent that Medicare provides hospitals with low-powered, cost-plus
incentives, it may support MAR-type quality competition and thereby create social losses due to
the provision of excessive care.
         Even if reimbursement rules and other factors limit the direct impact of competition on
publicly-insured patients in programs like Medicare, competition for privately-insured patients
may have important spillover effects. To the extent that competition improves the efficiency of
treatment of privately-insured patients and physicians do not develop distinctive practice patterns
for the private and public patients they treat, Medicare patients will also benefit [Baker 1999].
For example, a hospital’s decision not to adopt a low-value technology benefits all patients, even
if that choice primarily resulted from pressure by private managed-care insurers. Similarly,
increased provision of information by providers for private purchasers may have external benefits
for all patients. Conversely, spillovers might harm Medicare patients. For example, to the extent
that hospitals do develop separate practice patterns for Medicare and privately-insured patients,
hospitals may have a greater incentive to provide intensive treatments for Medicare beneficiaries,

                                                  23
Measures of the occurrence of cardiac complications were obtained by abstracting data on the

principal diagnosis for all subsequent admissions (not counting transfers and readmissions within

30 days of the index admission) in the year following the patient’s initial admission. Cardiac

complications included rehospitalizations within one year of the initial event with a primary

diagnosis (principal cause of hospitalization) of either subsequent AMI or heart failure (HF).

Treatment of AMI patients is intended to prevent subsequent AMIs if possible, and the

occurrence of HF requiring hospitalization is evidence that the damage to the patient’s heart from

ischemic disease has serious functional consequences. Data on patient demographic

characteristics were obtained from the Health Care Financing Administration’s HISKEW

enrollment files, with death dates based on death reports validated by the Social Security

Administration.

       Our second principal data source is comprehensive information on U.S. hospital

characteristics collected by the American Hospital Association (AHA). The response rate of

hospitals to the AHA survey is greater than 90 percent, with response rates above 95 percent for

large hospitals (>300 beds). Because our analysis involves nonrural Medicare beneficiaries with

AMI, we examine only nonrural, nonfederal hospitals that ever reported providing general medical

or surgical services (for example, we exclude psychiatric and rehabilitation hospitals from

analysis). To assess hospital size and for purposes of computation of bed capacity per

probabilistic patient, we use total general medical/surgical beds, including intensive care, cardiac

care, and emergency beds. We divide hospitals into three broad size categories (small (<100



to recover the fixed costs of equipment that private insurers will not defray.


                                                 24
beds), medium (100-300 beds), and large (>300 beds)) and two ownership categories (public and

private). We classify hospitals as teaching hospitals if they report at least 20 full-time residents.

Finally, we match patient data with information on annual HMO enrollment rates by state from

InterStudy Publications, a division of Decision Resources, Inc. Enrollment rates were calculated

by dividing the number of enrollees (exclusive of Medicare enrollees) by the nonelderly

population. In order to investigate the extent to which the rate of HMO enrollment in an area

interacts with hospital market structure, we separate states into those with above- and below-

median HMO enrollment rates in each of our study years. The classification of states is shown in

Appendix Table I.

       Table I outlines the exclusion restrictions we imposed, and their consequences for our

samples. First, we exclude hospitals (and the patients admitted to them) because of missing

Medicare ID information and missing data for hospitals. Although around 6 percent of hospitals

have such missing data, less than 2 percent of patients are affected. Second, we exclude hospitals

that admit fewer than 5 AMI patients per year, and also exclude patients who went to hospitals

that admit fewer than 5 AMI patients per year. Hospitals that admit fewer than 5 AMI patients

per year are unlikely to be relevant competitors, and patients choosing such low-volume hospitals

are unlikely to be representative of AMI patients generally. Again, Table I shows that the number

of hospitals excluded on these grounds is small, and the number of patients excluded is especially

small. Third, we exclude AMI patients who were actually admitted to a hospital that was more

than 35 miles from their residence, or if they were admitted to a large, teaching hospital, more

than 100 miles from their residence. Because AMI is an acute illness, very few AMI patients

travel for initial treatment to a hospital outside of our 35/100 mile radius. Those patients whose


                                                  25
index admission is outside of this 35/100 mile radius are likely to be traveling, and so their

hospital choice decision is likely to differ from the choice decision of patients who become ill

while at home. In any event, the share of patients we exclude on this basis is small as well, at

under 5 percent. In addition, Table I documents the shrinking number of hospitals in the U.S.

        Table II describes the elderly population and the hospitals treating them for the years

1985-1994. Table II demonstrates some of the well-known trends in the treatment, expenditures,

and outcomes of elderly heart disease patients. The first row of the Table shows how

dramatically real Medicare inpatient expenditures have grown over the 1985-1994 period -- by

34.5 percent. Because reimbursement given treatment choice for Medicare patients did not

increase over this period [McClellan 1997], these expenditure trends are attributable to increases

in intensity of treatment. The more rapid growth since 1991 was largely attributable to increasing

use of nonacute inpatient services, reflecting general trends in Medicare expenditures.

Concomitant with this increase in average intensity, average one-year mortality for AMI has

declined by 7.3 percentage points (18.1 percent). However, trends in cardiac complications have

been mixed: AMI survivors have a slightly higher risk of subsequent HF. The demographics of

our patient and hospital populations also reflect broad trends. The share of elderly living in the

largest MSAs is falling. Among hospitals, the share of large and public hospitals is falling, and the

share of teaching hospitals is rising.

        Table III shows how hospital markets have changed over the 1980s and 1990s. Travel

distances between patients and hospitals rose dramatically, particularly at the bottom of the

distribution, likely due to the contraction in the number of hospitals and the migration of elderly to

areas with lower densities of hospitals. The median distance to a patient’s closest hospital rose by


                                                  26
42 percent, from 1.74 miles to 2.47 miles; the mean and 95th percentile distance rose somewhat

less. Although patients often are not initially admitted to their closest hospital, the median

distance to a patient’s initial hospital of admission rose as well, by 18.7 percent, from 3.47 to 4.12

miles. These same forces led to a decrease in hospital bed capacity and market competitiveness.

Our index HHIpat* rose by 13.2 percent between 1985 and 1994, as compared to an increase of 9.3

percent in the conventional 75-percent variable-radius HHI. By either measure, the trend over

time in hospital market competitiveness has had major effects on the markets serving a substantial

fraction of elderly AMI patients. The measures of competition are strongly positively correlated

in both levels and changes. And according to Appendix Table II, approximately a quarter of

patients experienced an interquartile change in market competitiveness in any two adjacent sample

years, with approximately a third of patients experiencing a change between 1985 and 1994.



                                             V. Results

                                    V.1. Effects of Competition

       Table IV begins our analysis of the impact of competition on expenditures and patient

health outcomes, and how this has changed over time, with estimates of ç from equation (1),

controlling for zip-code fixed effects, patient demographics, and allowing for differential time

trends in differently-sized MSAs. The left panel of Table IV presents results using HHIpat*,

controlling for area market characteristics OMCkt; for comparison purposes, the right panel of the

table presents results using conventional 75-percent variable-radius HHIs, controlling for the

characteristics of hospital of admission. Our dataset includes essentially all elderly patients

hospitalized with the heart diseases of interest for the years of our study, so that our results


                                                  27
describe the actual average changes in expenditures associated with changes in competition. We

report standard errors for inferences about average differences that might arise in potential

populations (e.g., elderly patients with these health problems in other years).

       Before 1991, treatment of AMI patients in the least-competitive areas (very high HHIpat*)

was less costly than treatment of patients in the most-competitive areas. Patients from less

competitive areas also experienced higher rates of mortality and some cardiac complications than

did patients from the most competitive areas, although these effects were statistically significant at

conventional levels only for mortality outcomes for patients in the third quartile of the HHIpat*

distribution. Thus, the welfare implications of hospital competition in the 1980s were ambiguous:

competition increased expenditures, but may have led to better outcomes. Whether competition

increased welfare depends on an assessment of whether the additional health associated with

competition was worth the higher associated cost of care.

       As of 1991, however, competition among hospitals was unambiguously welfare-

improving. Treatment of AMI patients in the least competitive areas became significantly more

costly than treatment of AMI in competitive areas. The magnitude of the expenditure effect of

moving between the first and fourth quartiles of HHIpat*, 8.04 percent, was substantial.

Furthermore, differences in patient health outcomes between differently-competitive areas grew

substantially. Compared to patients in the most competitive areas, patients from the least

competitive areas experienced 1.46 percentage points higher mortality from AMI, which was

statistically significant. Expressed as a share of 1994 average AMI mortality, competition had the




                                                 28
potential to improve AMI mortality by 4.4 percent.9 In addition, patients from the least

competitive markets also experienced statistically significantly higher rates of readmission for

AMI (and not significantly lower rates of HF), suggesting that the additional survivors were not in

especially marginal health.

       Table IV also shows that patients from areas with greater bed capacity experience both

more costly treatment for their AMI and have higher mortality rates, though they have generally

lower rates of cardiac complications. The intensity-increasing effects of hospital capacity were

much more pronounced before 1991, while the adverse mortality effects of capacity were

relatively constant throughout the sample period. For example, after 1990, a one-standard-

deviation increase in bed capacity per probabilistic AMI patient (approximately equal to a unit

increase) led to approximately a 0.4 percentage point, statistically significant increase in mortality.

Expressed as a share of 1994 average AMI mortality, this translates into approximately a 1.3

percent increase. These effects are robust to the exclusion of controls for market

competitiveness.

       The post-1990 welfare benefits of competition are nonlinear in the extent of competition.

For competitiveness changes between the second and third quartiles of the HHIpat* distribution,

the response of expenditures to a unit change in competitiveness is much smaller than the

response for changes into or out of the top or bottom quartiles.10 The benefits of competition are


       9
         As Appendix Table III indicates, these and the subsequent expenditure and mortality
results are replicated in linear models of the effect of the HHI measures as well.
       10
         Patient-weighted mean values of HHIpat* for the four quartiles are .635, .431, .308, and
.177. Thus, for changes in competitiveness between the second and third quartiles, the response
of expenditures to a unit change in competitiveness is 9.594 (= [4.43 - 3.25] / [.431 - .308]),
versus 24.809 for changes into or out of the bottom quartile (= 3.25 / [.308 - .177]) and 17.696

                                                  29
more similar at the top and bottom ends of the distribution. The social benefits in cost savings

and improved mortality that would result from moving a geographic area from the least-

competitive quartile to the second or third quartile are not statistically distinguishable from the

social benefits that would result from moving an area from the second or third to the most-

competitive quartile.

       The right panel of Table IV confirms that conventionally-calculated estimates lead to

different inferences about the impact of competition on social welfare than do estimates based on

our HHIpat* index. Both before and after 1990, estimates based on conventional 75-percent

patient-flow HHI measures suggest that hospital competition leads to more costly treatment,

although also to lower mortality and complications rates. The fact that conventional estimates of

the effect of competition on resource use are positive and greater than our estimates throughout

the sample period is consistent with the biases discussed in Section II: bias due to assigning

hospital market competitiveness to patients based on hospital of admission (hospitals facing more

competition produce higher-quality care and so draw unobservably high-cost patients) and bias

due to the specification of geographic markets as a function of actual patient choices and

unobservable hospital quality (hospitals that are high-cost and high-quality for whatever reason

draw patients from a broader area and so appear to be more competitive).

       Changes in the estimated effect of competition ç between the 1980s and 1990s may be due

to changes over time in the response of the level of expenditures or outcomes to changes in

competition, or due to changes over time in the growth rate of expenditures or outcomes in areas

with high versus low levels of competition. Table V presents estimates of ã from equation (2), the


(= [8.04 - 4.43] / [.635 - .431]) for changes into or out of the top quartile.

                                                  30
effect of period-by-period changes in competition on changes in the level of expenditures and

health outcomes. The fact that the magnitude and the time path of ã from outcomes models are

similar to those of ç suggests that the change over time in the effect of competition on health

outcomes is largely due to changes in the response of the level of outcomes to changes in

competition. On the other hand, the fact that estimates of ã from expenditure models are

relatively stable over time and smaller in magnitude than the estimates of ç suggests that the

change over time in the effect of competition on resource use is more affected by changes over

time in the growth rate of expenditures in areas with high versus low levels of competition.

                   V.2. Impact of Managed Care on the Effects of Competition

       Tables VI and VII investigate the extent to which managed care organizations substitute

for or mediate the effects of hospital competition.11 Table VI presents estimates of equation (1),

controlling for HMO enrollment rates by state and year, but allowing the impact of hospital

competition to vary only for patients from above- and below-median enrollment state/year cells,

and not over time. Consistent with previous studies of managed care spillover effects (e.g., Baker

[1999]), the first column of the first row of Table VI shows that the cost of treating Medicare

patients varies inversely with the HMO enrollment rate in the area. In addition, Table VI presents

the new finding that this reduction in intensity attributable to managed care penetration appears to

have no measurable adverse health consequences for elderly heart patients. This result suggests

that HMO spillovers not only reduce resource use for Medicare beneficiaries not enrolled in

managed care plans, but that the spillover effects occur with no statistically significant or



       11
       Residents of the District of Columbia are excluded from the analyses of the impact of
managed care because of concerns about the validity of measured HMO enrollment rates for DC.

                                                  31
economically important impact on health outcomes.

       Table VI suggests that the rise of managed care over the sample period partially explains

the changing relationship between hospital competition, treatment intensity, and patient health

outcomes. For patients from states with low HMO enrollment rates as of their date of admission,

competition increased expenditures and generally led to (statistically insignificantly) better

outcomes. But for patients from states with high HMO enrollment rates as of their date of

admission, competition was unambigously welfare improving: competition led to lower levels of

resource use and lower rates of mortality and subsequent complications.

       Table VII further explores the hypothesis that managed care serves as a catalyst through

which hospital competition improves welfare, by presenting estimates that allow the interaction

between HMO enrollment in an area and hospital market competitiveness to change over time.

The top panel of Table VII presents estimates of the impact of area HMO enrollment and

interactions of HMO enrollment with area competitiveness for patients admitted to the hospital in

1985 and 1988; the bottom panel of Table VII presents estimates of the impact of area HMO

enrollment and HMO enrollment/competitiveness interactions for patients admitted to the hospital

in 1991 and 1994. Table VII confirms that managed care and hospital competition are

complements in the process of producing cardiac care services. Both before and after 1990,

hospital competition leads to greater decreases in resource use and rates of adverse health

outcomes in areas with high versus low HMO enrollment (although differences across managed

care environments in the effect of competition on mortality are not statistically significant).

However, although HMOs have socially beneficial spillover effects throughout the sample period,

the incremental social benefits attributable to hospital-competition/HMO-spillover interactions


                                                  32
have become less dramatic over time. Before 1990, competition in low-enrollment areas was

socially wasteful -- competition led to higher levels of resource use without significant effects on

health outcomes -- while competition in high-enrollment areas had more ambiguous or positive

effects, at least for patients in the most competitive areas versus those from areas in the third

quartile of the HHI distribution. But after 1990, competition was welfare improving in all areas --

competition led to significant decreases in resource use without significant increases (and in some

cases significant decreases) in the rates of adverse health outcomes. This finding may reflect the

diffusion of cost-control measures implemented by more-developed HMOs in high-enrollment

areas in the 1980s to relatively low -HMO-enrollment areas by the 1990s. (Indeed, by the 1990s,

most low-enrollment areas had HMO enrollment rates that exceeded those of high-enrollment

areas in the 1980s.)

                  V.3. Evaluating the Welfare Implications of Hospital Mergers

       Table VIII illustrates how our methods can be used to assess prospectively the impact of

specific hospital mergers, using as examples two mergers challenged by the FTC in 1994 that

were not completed [Leibenluft et al. 1997]. Moving between adjacent columns in the table

answers the hypothetical question: based on patients’ preferences for hospitals (and therefore the

matrix of probabilistic patient flows) in 1994, would the proposed mergers lead to substantial

changes in hospital competition in surrounding areas? Specifically, would HHIpat* change

substantially for patients residing in the ten zip codes nearest to each merging hospital? This

analysis is necessarily incomplete, in that it does not account completely for other potential

benefits of the mergers, such as their impact on nonelderly patients and those with other illnesses.

We leave such issues to future work. However, it does show how the results presented above can


                                                  33
be used on a case-specific basis to evaluate the welfare consequences of mergers (see Kessler and

McClellan [1999] for a more detailed discussion).

       The top panel of the Table assesses the impact of the proposed merger between Mercy

and Port Huron Hospitals, the only two general acute-care hospitals in Port Huron, Michigan

(FTC vs. Local Health System, Inc., C-3618 (consent order), 61 Fed. Reg. 31,119 (June 19,

According to Table VIII, this merger would have altered the structure of hospital markets in the

surrounding area in a way that reduced social welfare. Patients from every one of the surrounding

ten zip codes would have experienced an increase in HHIpat* from the second to the least-

competitive quartile. For Medicare patients with AMI, estimates from model (1) predict that this

increase in concentration would have translated into both higher expenditures and increased rates

of adverse health outcomes.

       The bottom panel of the table assesses the impact of the proposed merger between Cape

Coral and Lee Memorial Hospitals in Lee County, Florida (FTC vs. Hospital Board of Directors

of Lee County, FTC Docket No. 9265; 1994-1 Trade Cas. 70,593 (M.D. Fla.); aff’d 38 F.3d

1184 (11th Cir. 1994). According to our results, the welfare implications of this merger are less

clear. Although the merger would have increased the concentration in each of the ten zip codes

nearest to either hospital, that increase in concentration from the third to the second quartile of

the HHI distribution would not have statistically or economically significant welfare implications

for elderly AMI patients.

       Our analysis examines the welfare implications in one service market only, the market for

heart disease care in the elderly. This result does not preclude the possibility that this merger


                                                  34
would have adversely affected competition and reduced social welfare in other markets.

However, heart disease treatment is the largest single component of hospital production, and

given the size of the elderly population, it seems unlikely that effects of competition on heart

disease care would differ substantially for nonelderly patients. Competition may also have

somewhat different effects for chronic illnesses. All of these issues can be addressed in future

work, using the techniques that we have developed and applied here.



                                           VI. Conclusion

        Assessing the welfare consequences of competition in health care is a particularly difficult

case of an important general problem in industrial organization. The features of markets for

hospital services depart substantially from the conditions of perfectly-competitive markets, so that

theory plausibly suggests that competition may either increase or reduce social welfare.

Consequently, empirical assessment of the welfare implications of competition in hospital markets

is crucial for testing the validity of alternative theories about the effects of competition in health

care. Empirical evidence is also necessary to guide hospital antitrust policy. If competition

among hospitals improves social welfare, then strictly regulating coordinated activity may offer

social benefits. But if competition among hospitals is socially wasteful, then lenient antitrust

treatment of coordination and mergers may be optimal.

        In spite of this importance, virtually no previous research has determined the effects of

competition on both health care costs and patient health outcomes. Important reasons for this

omission are the difficulty of developing suitable data on spending and quality -- a particularly

challenging problem in the hospital industry -- as well as the general problem in applied work in


                                                   35
industrial organization of identifying the effects of competition. We address both types of

problems here, using methods for identifying the effects of competition that could be applied in

other industries which have suitable data on consumer choices and in which broad product

characteristics (e.g., hospital size category and teaching status) are very difficult to change.

       Our analysis includes all nonrural elderly Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for treatment

of heart disease in a 10-year period that includes the recent growth in managed-care insurance.

Our methods develop indices of competition that are based on exogenous determinants of hospital

demand, rather than assumptions about the extent of markets and their competitiveness that are

either arbitrary or subject to the usual endogeneity problems. We also measure explicitly the key

outcomes of market performance, including effects on both patient health and medical

expenditures. Finally, because managed care organizations are likely to be an important

mechanism through which competition affects hospital markets, we investigate the extent to

which HMO enrollment rates in an area create spillovers that affect medical productivity and the

impact of competition on productivity.

       We find that, before 1991, competition led to higher costs and, in some cases, lower rates

of adverse health outcomes for elderly Americans with heart disease; but after 1990, competition

led both to substantially lower costs and significantly lower rates of adverse outcomes. Thus,

after 1990, hospital competition unambiguously improves social welfare. Increasing HMO

enrollment over the sample period partially explains the dramatic change in the impact of hospital

competition; hospital competition is unambiguously welfare improving throughout the sample

period in geographic areas with above-median HMO enrollment rates. Furthermore, point

estimates of the magnitude of the welfare benefits of competition are uniformly larger for patients


                                                  36
from states with high HMO enrollment as of their admission date, as compared to patients from

states with low HMO enrollment.

       The socially beneficial impact of post-1990 competition is nonlinear: the effect of an

interquartile change in competitiveness on expenditures and outcomes is much greater for areas

moving to or from the most and least competitive quartiles. Our finding that competition

improves welfare post-1990 is not affected by controlling for other factors that may affect hospital

market structure, such as distance to the nearest hospital, hospital bed capacity utilization, and

other hospital market characteristics. We also find that changes in capacity utilization are

themselves important determinants of health care costs and outcomes. Patients from hospital

markets with high levels of capacity per unit AMI patient volume experience generally higher

costs and higher mortality rates. We illustrate how our methods can be used to assess the impact

of proposed hospital mergers on a hospital-specific basis, with two examples of hospital mergers

challenged by the FTC in 1994.

       Are our results generalizable to other components of hospital production? Heart disease

is the largest single component of hospital production, accounting for around one-sixth of hospital

expenditures, so it seems unlikely that the overall effects of competition would differ dramatically,

at least for other serious acute health problems. However, less acute conditions provide greater

opportunities for patients to choose among hospitals, and also provide hospitals with the

opportunity to seek out relatively low-cost patients, both through choices of service offerings and

through the choice of health plans with which the hospitals contract. Particularly for nonacute

illnesses, it is possible that the growth of higher-powered payment incentives that has

accompanied the growth of managed care in the 1990s would encourage hospitals to avoid such


                                                 37
patients in the presence of greater competition. Along these lines, it is possible that privately-

insured patients would be affected differently by competition than publicly-insured patients.

       Finally, we do not explicitly model the mechanisms by which competition leads to its

welfare consequences. Most importantly, we do not model why the welfare effects of

competition changed around 1990, in conjunction with the rise of managed care. Our results

suggest that spillover effects from increasingly efficient treatment of privately-insured patients

affect the treatment regimen of publicly-insured patients, by mediating the consequences of

hospital competition in a way that enhances medical productivity. In particular, managed care

appears to increase efficiency by reducing the tendency of hospital competition to result in a

“medical arms race” of expenditure growth. Understanding how the productivity-increasing

effects of competition occur in health care, and how managed care enhances these effects, is an

important topic for further analysis.
