                                           ABSTRACT

We document the emergence of a disconnect between mortgage and Treasury interest rates in the
summer of 2003. Following the end of the Federal Reserve expansionary cycle in June 2003,
mortgage rates failed to rise according to their historical relationship with Treasury yields,
leading to significantly and persistently easier mortgage credit conditions. We uncover this
phenomenon by analyzing a large dataset with millions of loan-level observations, which allows
us to control for the impact of varying loan, borrower and geographic characteristics. These
detailed data also reveal that delinquency rates started to rise for loans originated after mid 2003,
exactly when mortgage rates disconnected from Treasury yields and credit became relatively
cheaper.

        Abstract. We document the emergence of a disconnect between mortgage and Treasury
        interest rates in the summer of 2003. Following the end of the Federal Reserve expan-
        sionary cycle in June 2003, mortgage rates failed to rise according to their historical
        relationship with Treasury yields, leading to significantly and persistently easier mort-
        gage credit conditions. We uncover this phenomenon by analyzing a large dataset with
        millions of loan-level observations, which allows us to control for the impact of varying
        loan, borrower and geographic characteristics. These detailed data also reveal that delin-
        quency rates started to rise for loans originated after mid 2003, exactly when mortgage
        rates disconnected from Treasury yields and credit became relatively cheaper.

  Mortgage interest rates fell significantly between 2000 and 2006, at the same time as
mortgage debt and house prices were rising to unprecedented levels. Figure 1.1 plots the
behavior of the 30-year conventional mortgage rate, the most widely used measure of the
economy-wide cost of mortgage financing. This rate dropped from an average of around 8%
during the 1990s expansion, and about 8.5% at its peak in 2000, to around 6.5% in 2006
and 2007, at the apex of the credit boom, with rates as low as 5% in the middle of 2003.
  The mortgage rate depicted in figure 1.1 is a national average of interest rates on “first-
lien prime conventional conforming home purchase mortgages with a loan-to-value of 80
percent” from Freddie Mac’s Primary Mortgage Market Survey.1 But during the first half

of the 2000s, this average is likely to have become less representative of overall conditions
in the U.S. mortgage market, due to the rapid diﬀusion over that period of non-conforming
products, such as subprime, jumbo, and Alt-A mortgages with high loan-to-value (LTV)
and other unconventional features. The spreading of non-conforming loans, in turn, was
supported by the meteoric rise of the private-label securitization market. As shown in
figure 1.2, the market share of non-agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which mostly
collected those non-conforming mortgages, increased from about 20% in the early 2000s to
more than 50% in 2005 and 2006, before evaporating in 2008. This paper studies the extent
to which this transformation in mortgage finance aﬀected the cost of mortgage credit during
the housing boom.
  Using detailed loan-level data, we compute a conditional spread of mortgage rates over
four Treasury market factors that summarize the level, slope, curvature and volatility of
the yield curve. This spread is “conditional” because it controls for a long list of observable
individual borrower and loan characteristics, such as the borrower’s FICO score, the loan-to-
value ratio, and the type of mortgage contract, which should all be reflected in the mortgage
rate. To the extent that those observable traits capture most of the well-documented
changes in the mortgage industry in the early 2000s, this spread should provide a measure

of the cost of mortgage credit that is comparable over time and across mortgages, even as
the underlying composition of the market was changing. In this respect, our approach is
similar in spirit to the analysis of corporate bond spreads of Gilchrist and Zakrajsek (2012).
    We document that the conditional mortgage spread over Treasuries fell by about 80
basis points in the summer of 2003, signaling a significant shift in credit conditions in
the mortgage market relative to Treasuries. This reduction in the conditional spread was
reabsorbed only gradually over the course of the subsequent few years. Moreover, it is
more pronounced for non-conforming loans included in private-label securitization pools,
and particularly for subprime mortgages.2
    We refer to this large, abrupt and persistent decoupling of mortgage interest rates from
the prevailing conditions in the Treasury markets as the mortgage rate conundrum, since
it shares some characteristics with the well-known Greenspan conundrum (2005). In par-
ticular, Greenspan was puzzled by the fact that long-term Treasury rates did not rise in
response to the Federal Reserve’s tightening campaign between 2004 and 2006, when the

 Antinolfi et al. (2016) also use loan-level data to study the evolution of mortgage interest rates during the
housing boom as a function of loan and borrower characteristics. Diﬀerently from us, they focus on the
systematic part of this relationship and its evolution over time, rather than on the conditional mortgage
spread.

Federal Funds rate increased from 1 to 5.25 percent. Similarly, we show that conditional
mortgage rates did not budge in response to the significant steepening of the Treasury yield
curve over the weeks following the FOMC meeting of June 24-25, 2003, when the Com-
mittee lowered the FFR from 1.25 to 1 percent, signaling the end of that monetary policy
easing cycle.
  The emergence of this conundrum, by itself, does not shed light on the factors that
might have driven lending rates significantly below their historical relationship with Trea-
sury yields, but the sharp identification of the timing of this discontinuity does. Several
important events occurred in quick succession following the June FOMC meeting, which
together suggest that the summer of 2003 marked a turning point in the development of
the credit boom.
  First, the massive refinancing wave that had been surging over the previous two years
came to an abrupt conclusion in July 2003. However, this drop in refinancing activity was
not followed by a fall in employment among loan brokers, in sharp contrast with what
had occurred at the end of the previous two refinancing waves in 1994 and 1999. At the
same time, the issuance of non-agency MBS continued to grow rapidly, even though agency
securitization slowed down. These facts suggest that lenders started to push harder into
subprime and other previously underserved segments of the mortgage market following the
collapse of their refinancing business, in order to sustain their elevated level of activity.
They did so by keeping mortgage rates low, in the face of an increase in Treasury rates,
especially for those marginal borrowers that ex post appear to have contributed dispropor-
tionately to inflating the housing bubble (e.g. Landvoigt et al., 2015), and that ended up
defaulting in large numbers (e.g. Mian and Sufi, 2009, Demyanyk and Van Hemert, 2011,
Foote et al., 2012, Palmer, 2015, Santos, 2015, Ospina and Uhlig, 2017). In fact, we com-
plement the literature on the evolution of loan quality during the boom by documenting
that the growth rate of delinquencies, as a function of the time of mortgage origination, was
subject to a break exactly around the summer of 2003, even after controlling for the evo-
lution of borrower/loan characteristics and prevailing economic conditions. Put diﬀerently,
mortgages issued after the emergence of the conundrum in mid 2003 started to become
delinquent more and more frequently down the road.

used in our paper and the methodology to extract a measure of conditional spread from

Treasuries. Section 4 presents our empirical results, while section 5 relates these findings
to other important developments in mortgage markets. Section 6 studies the consequences
of the conundrum in terms of loan quality and delinquency rates, and section 7 concludes
highlighting the main takeaways from the paper.


                                             2. Data

  The goal of this paper is to study the evolution of mortgage interest rates during the U.S.
housing boom. The rich microeconomic data used in this analysis comes from two main
sources, which we supplement with macroeconomic and other data as further described
below. The primary dataset includes mortgages securitized by private-label issuers of MBS,
which provide a comprehensive picture of the transformation in mortgage financing that
took place during the 2000s. For comparison, section 4 also analyzes data on mortgages
securitized by the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), as well as those held by banks
in their portfolios.
  The Private Label Securities Database (PLSD, sometimes referred to as ABS/MBS)
covers the near universe of mortgages that have become part of non-agency securitization
pools. This data is based on publicly available information collected by CoreLogic Loan
Performance. It includes details about the characteristics of the loans and of the borrowers.
For example, for most mortgages in the dataset, we observe the date of origination, the
borrowing rate and other loan characteristics, as well as the value of the collateral backing
the loan, the loan-to-value ratio, the credit score of the borrower, and whether she provided
any income documentation. In addition, the dynamic version of the dataset follows the life
of each loan, also recording its performance status every month.
  The PLSD contains observations on approximately 25 million individual mortgages issued
since the 1980s, but our analysis concentrates on the period between 2000 and mid 2007,
which corresponds to the most intense phase of the housing boom. Moreover, the private-
label MBS market was very thin outside this period, as show in figure 2.1. Origination of
non-agency loans took oﬀ around the turn of the millennium, and completely dried up at
the onset of the financial crisis in 2007.
  The PLSD also provides a classification of each mortgage as prime, Alt-A or subprime,
based on a flag assigned to the loan by the issuer of the MBS. Approximately two thirds of
the dataset consists of subprime mortgages. This relatively large share of subprime loans

reflects the fact that the GSEs cannot securitize them, which is why most of them ended
up in private-label pools. However, it would be too simplistic to identify private-label MBS
with subprime mortgages, since a substantial fraction of the loans in the PLSD are prime
(11 percent) or Alt-A (25 percent).


                                                                                                           3. Methodology

  We use the microeconomic data described in the previous section to study the behavior
of mortgage rates in the U.S. between 2000 and 2007. In particular, we are interested in
analyzing the extent to which mortgage credit became progressively cheaper during this
period, since “cheap credit” is one of the most often cited culprits for the housing boom and
bust.
  As an illustrative first pass at this question, figure 3.1 plots the spread between the
average mortgage interest rate in the PLSD and the 10-year Treasury yield. This spread
is informative because Treasury securities are used by originators as benchmarks to set up
mortgage rates. This spread declines steadily from above 4.5 percentage points in 2001
to around 2.5 percentage points after 2004, with a particularly pronounced, abrupt and
persistent fall in the middle of 2003.

  Aggregate data, or cross sectional averages like the ones shown in figure 3.1, however,
provide a potentially misleading picture of the overall behavior of mortgage rates, because
they miss the role of the well-documented changes in the mortgage finance industry during
the first decade of the millennium, especially as reflected in the evolution of typical loan
terms and borrower types. For example, suppose that average mortgage rates are constant
over time. This observation does not necessarily imply that the price of credit is unchanged,
because banks might be oﬀering loans at the same interest rate to customers with diﬀerent
relevant characteristics, such as higher or lower credit worthiness. This simple consideration
highlights the importance of controlling for the observed evolution of loan and borrower
characteristics when studying if indeed mortgage credit became cheaper during the housing
boom. Loan-level data as those in the PLSD are essential to perform this task.
  To this end, we estimate the following empirical model of the evolution of mortgage rates

(3.1)                            ri,t = c + ft0    1   + x0i,t + other controls + "i,t .

In this expression, ri,t denotes the interest rate on mortgage i at time t (the month of the
deal closing date), c is a constant term, xi,t and ft are vectors of borrower/loan-specific and
                                   THE MORTGAGE RATE CONUNDRUM                                                   8

aggregate variables, and other controls are additional geographic and time controls, such
as dummies for the month and the state in which the loan was issued.3
   The vector xi,t is a comprehensive set of controls for loan and borrower characteristics,
which should a priori be reflected in mortgage interest rates. As a guide to determine what
explanatory factors to include in xi,t , we rely on loan-rate sheets. These documents list
diﬀerent mortgage products oﬀered by lenders and their interest rates, as a function of
variables such as the borrower’s credit score, the LTV ratio, whether the loan is a jumbo
mortgage, it is intended for purchase or refinancing, and more. A list of the variables
included in xi,t can be found in table 1, along with some summary statistics that we will
discuss in the next section.
   Turning to the aggregate variables, the vector ft contains four term-structure factors for
Treasuries. The role of these factors in the regression is to control for the comovement
between mortgage and Treasury rates in a more comprehensive manner than by simply
taking the diﬀerence from a long-term Treasury yield, as we have done for illustrative
purposes in figure 3.1. Therefore, we interpret the residual of the regression of mortgage
rates on Treasury factors as a “spread” that captures the extent to which each mortgage is
cheaper, or more expensive, than what is suggested by the historical correlation with the
Treasury market. More specifically, we extract the first three principal components from a
panel of Treasury yields of maturities ranging from 3 months to 10 years. These principal
components have the interpretation of level, slope and curvature factors, which eﬀectively
summarize the observed variation in Treasury rates over time. In addition, ft includes a
volatility factor, computed as the realized volatility of the daily 2-year Treasury yield over a
rolling 60-day window. We include this measure of interest rate volatility in the regression
as a simple way to capture the eﬀect of interest rate uncertainty on the prepayment option
value embedded in mortgage rates (Gilchrist and Zakrajsek, 2012). These aggregate factors
are included in the regression with a lag, to account for the fact that mortgage rates are
typically “locked in” a few weeks in advance of closing, which is the point at which we
observe ri,t .4



3We omit a geographic subscript on the interest rate to lighten the notation.
4Antinolfi et al. (2016) study the evolution of the sensitivity of mortgage interest rates to risk factors. To this
end, they estimate an equation similar to (3.1), including a subset of our loan and borrower characteristics
and an aggregate factor capturing the level of Treasury rates.
                                 THE MORTGAGE RATE CONUNDRUM                                              9

   Our strategy to study the behavior of mortgage rates focuses mostly on the residuals
of equation (3.1). We interpret these residuals as a spread between actual mortgage rates
and their predicted value based on aggregate factors alone, as summarized by the evolution
of the four Treasury factors, after controlling for the loan and borrower characteristics
included in xi,t . Given how we construct them, we refer to these residuals as conditional
mortgage rate spreads. They provide a measure of what happened to the underlying cost
of mortgage credit over the housing boom, once we take into account the changes in the
types of loans being originated, and in the kinds of borrowers that took out those loans, as
well as in the macroeconomic and monetary policy environment as reflected in the Treasury
market. Persistent negative realizations of these spreads indicate that mortgage rates are
systematically lower than expected, based on their historical correlation with idiosyncratic
and aggregate risk factors. We examine the time-series behavior of these spreads in the
next section, where we also discuss their econometric and economic interpretation in more
detail.


                                              4. Results

   This section presents the empirical results. We begin with some summary statistics on
the characteristics of the loans and corresponding borrowers in the PLSD. We then comment
briefly on the parameter estimates for equation (3.1), before analyzing the behavior of the
error distribution, which is our main object of interest.
   As mentioned in section 2, the analysis focuses on the period of the housing boom, be-
tween 2000 and mid 2007, during which private-label securitization flourished. In addition,
we restrict attention to first-lien mortgages with a maturity of 30 years, destined to the
purchase or refinancing of owner-occupied housing.5 These restrictions result in a relatively
more homogeneous sample, which however still captures the main changes observed in the
mortgage market over this period.

4.1. Summary statistics. Table 1 provides summary statistics for the variables included
in the regressions. About two thirds of mortgages in the dataset are subprime, with the

5Second-lien mortgages usually have a substantially lower claim on the collateral, and mortgages backed by
investment properties are more likely to default, since the borrower does not live in the house and thus has
less at stake. Together with mortgages with maturity lower than 30 years, these loans have a substantially
diﬀerent risk profile among them and with respect to the those included in our sample, and hence are likely
to be priced quite diﬀerently.

remaining third approximately equally split between prime and Alt-A. The share of Alt-
A mortgages exhibits a marked upward trend after 2003, while the fraction of prime and
subprime loans declines. Another striking feature of the data is the trend in the share of
standard fixed-rate mortgages, which falls from approximately one half to one fourth of
the sample. Progressively more and more loans are instead either interest-only or balloon
mortgages. Combined, these unconventional products account for about 50 percent of the
sample in 2007.6

6Interest-only mortgages are loans requiring only the payment of the interest on the principal, for a set
term. Balloon mortgages are loans that require a final large payment (the so-called “balloon payment”) at
the end of the amortization period.

  Perhaps surprisingly, both the FICO score of the average borrower and the LTV ratio
of the loans are approximately constant over time. Instead, the fraction of borrowers
presenting full income documentation drops quite substantially from 73 percent in 2000 to
43 percent in 2007 consistent with the findings of Keys et al. (2012) and Mian and Sufi
(2015). Overall, table 1 paints the picture of a transforming mortgage finance industry,
in which non-traditional mortgage products become gradually more popular, at least until
2007. Some of these loans are riskier than more traditional products, and thus involve
relatively higher interest rates. Others, such as adjustable-rate mortgages (ARM), might
instead be associated with lower “teaser” rates at origination. Therefore, failing to control
for these changes might lead to a misrepresentation of the behavior of mortgage rates for
given loan and borrower characteristics.



4.2. Parameter estimates. Table 2 presents the coeﬃcient estimates of equation (3.1).
The first column reports the baseline, most comprehensive specification, which includes 11
million observations on fixed and variable interest rate mortgages, for both purchase and
refinancing.
  According to the regression, Alt-A and, especially, subprime mortgages carry a higher
interest rate on average. However, this classification does not capture all dimensions of
risk. In fact, even within these groups, riskier borrower profiles, such as those with higher
LTV ratios, lower FICO score, or without full income documentation, as well as jumbo
mortgages command higher mortgage rates. On the contrary, mortgage rates are generally
somewhat lower when refinancing, regardless of whether this involves equity extraction.
Finally, interest-only, ARM and balloon mortgages have substantially lower interest rates at
closing, since the main feature of these contracts are smaller initial payments and enhanced
initial aﬀordability.
  To allow for the possibility of varying interest rate sensitivity to risk factors across diﬀer-
ent broad classes of mortgages, columns II-V in table 2 analyze more restrictive specifica-
tions, with smaller, but more uniform samples. In particular, columns II and III distinguish
between mortgages intended for purchase or refinancing, while column IV only focuses on
fixed-rate mortgages. The last column is the most restrictive specification, with fixed-rate
mortgages only intended for purchase. The sign of the estimated coeﬃcients is the same
across all these specifications, and their magnitude is also approximately similar.

  The primary objective of regression equation (3.1) is to recover a measure of mortgage
rate spreads over the Treasury factors, which controls for the changes in mortgage finance

observed in the early 2000s. Therefore, the exact interpretation of the coeﬃcients in the
regression is not crucial to the analysis of those spreads. However, the signs of these coeﬃ-
cients are all consistent with the hypothesis that equation (3.1) corresponds to a mortgage
supply schedule, according to which riskier loan-borrower combinations are charged higher
interest rates.7 This interpretation is in turn consistent with a model of the mortgage mar-
ket in which all financial institutions post similar rate sheets, and the borrowers take the
conditions in those sheets as given. Under these assumptions, most of the cross-sectional
variation in mortgage rates would originate from the observed variability in the character-
istics of loan demand, as captured by the covariates included in vector xi,t . In any case,
this interpretation of equation (3.1) is not essential to the results that follow.

4.3. Regression residuals: the conditional mortgage spread. This subsection presents
the central result of the paper, which concerns the evolution of the residuals of equation
(3.1) over time, what we have referred to as the conditional mortgage rate spread.
   Figure 4.1 depicts the cross-sectional mean of the distribution of these residuals, for each
month in the sample. By construction, the time average of this sequence of cross-sectional
means is equal to zero. This time series, however, exhibits a peculiar pattern: it bounces
around a positive average between 2000 and 2003, but drops sharply in the middle of 2003.
After this large fall of about 80 basis points, the mean of the residuals moves back, but
only very gradually.8
   Figure 4.1 also demonstrates that this phenomenon is not just due to the increasing
popularity of products with attractive teaser rates. Rather, it is common to all the specifi-
cations of equation (3.1) described in table 2, including the most restrictive one that only
includes fixed-rate purchase mortgages. In fact, all five specifications agree on the size and
timing of the shift in the residuals, even if they often diverge in the period before.
   Figure 4.2 addresses more systematically the concern that the rapid fall in residuals
around the summer of 2003 might in part reflect shifts in the composition of the pool
7The only coeﬃcient that is apparently at odds with this interpretation is the one capturing the relationship
between mortgage rates and the (log) size of the loan origination amount. However, closer inspection reveals
that the negative estimate in this linear model is entirely due to the eﬀect of small loans. Since the mortgage
originator pays a fixed cost to issue each loan, small loans carry relatively higher interest rates to cover
that cost.
8These results are robust to a number of variants of the baseline model, such as the inclusion of the
borrower’s combined LTV and debt-to-income ratio, or a set of originator dummies as explicit controls.
Our baseline specification omits these variables because they are only available for a small fraction of our
dataset.

of mortgages in our dataset. We do so by constructing an alternative measure of the
conditional mortgage rate spread, obtained as a monthly weighted average of the mean
residual across eighteen mortgage bins, with weights corresponding to the sample share of
each of these categories between January 2000 and May 2003. These mortgage bins are
defined by interacting prime, subprime and alt-A indicators with the six contract types listed
in table 1, because these are the dimensions along which the sample composition appears
to be changing the most around 2003, albeit smoothly rather than abruptly. Figure 4.2
compares this alternative version of the spread with our baseline. The very small diﬀerences
between these two measures indicate that compositional changes are unlikely to be a major
driver of the evolution of the conditional spread in the summer of 2003 and after.
  In principle, these persistently low residuals could be due to variation in unobserved
borrower characteristics. In practice, however, there are at least two compelling reasons to
rule out this interpretation of our results. First, the fall of the conditional mortgage spread
in the summer of 2003 is very abrupt. Therefore, to explain it, we would need an equally
sudden change in unobserved borrower characteristics around the same time, which does not
seem particularly plausible. Second, to rationalize the estimated lower mortgage spreads,
unobserved borrower quality should have improved over the boom after 2003, which is at

odds with the conventional and anecdotal views. In fact, in section 6 we will document that
unobserved quality—as measured by ex-post loan performance—started to deteriorate, not
improve, after the summer of 2003.
  A more natural interpretation of our finding is that, in the middle of 2003, mortgage credit
became significantly and persistently cheaper with respect to the prevailing conditions in
the Treasury market, even after controlling for the concomitant evolution of observable
loan and borrower characteristics. We refer to this decoupling between conditions in the
mortgage and Treasury markets as the mortgage rate conundrum.

4.4. The mortgage rate conundrum. This section attempts to shed more light on the
origin of the mortgage rate conundrum described above. The question that we want to
address is to what extent the abrupt fall in the conditional spreads in the middle of 2003
shown in figure 4.1 was due to an actual reduction in mortgage rates, or to changes in
the conditioning factors. The main conclusion of this investigation is that the conundrum
emerged due to the lack of response of mortgage rates to the developments in Treasury
markets that followed the FOMC meeting of June 2003, rather than to an abrupt change in
mortgage rates themselves. The peculiar behavior of mortgage rates identified above, there-
fore, is reminiscent of the puzzling stability of long-term Treasury yields in the face of rising

policy rates that emerged between 2004 and 2006, Alan Greenspan’s famous conundrum
(Greenspan, 2005).
  To illustrate the relative behavior of mortgage rates and Treasury yield factors, it is useful
to estimate equation (3.1) in two steps. In the first step, we re-estimate the model excluding
the aggregate factors, ft , but including a set of time dummies instead. By construction,
these time dummies force the cross-sectional average of the regression residuals to be zero
at each point in time. Figure 4.3 plots the behavior over time of the coeﬃcients on the time
dummies in the baseline specification that includes all mortgages. This time series captures
the evolution of average mortgage rates (up to a constant term), after controlling for all
the loan and borrower characteristics included in xi,t . This average conditional mortgage
rate falls steadily between mid 2001 and mid 2004, by about 3.5 percentage points in total,
consistent with the idea that mortgage credit became significantly cheaper over this period.


  Of course, conditions in the Treasury market were also changing at the same time, which
account for the bulk of the movements in the time-dummy coeﬃcients. To control for the
eﬀect of these changes in the Treasury market, the second step of the procedure is to regress
                                THE MORTGAGE RATE CONUNDRUM                                          17

the time eﬀect on the term-structure and volatility factors ft .9 Figure 4.3 plots the residuals
of this second-stage time series regression, which look very similar to the average residuals
of the baseline regression reported in figure 4.1.
  Comparing the two series in figure 4.3, we see that the abrupt fall in residuals that occurs
in mid 2003 was not due to a sudden fall in average conditional mortgage rates. The time
eﬀect briefly stops falling around that time, and even rises somewhat for a few months,
but this movement is swamped by the drop in the residuals. What happened, therefore, is
that credit conditions tightened significantly in the Treasury market, as a response to the
end of the monetary policy easing cycle in June 2003. But mortgage rates barely moved in
response.
  To support this evidence, we run a second experiment, motivated by the fact that the
estimated model (3.1) fits the data better between 2000 and mid 2003 than afterwards. In
particular, the average residuals over that period appear to fluctuate around a constant
without any evident pattern. This evidence suggests that the peculiar dynamics in the
second part of the sample might be due to a break in the coeﬃcients of equation (3.1). To
verify this statement, we first estimate our baseline specification with data from 2000 to
June 2003. We then project mortgage rates after mid 2003 conditional on the estimated
coeﬃcients and the realizations of the regressors after mid 2003. Figure 4.4 plots the average
diﬀerence between the actual and projected values of the mortgage rates. In the first part
of the sample, this diﬀerence is just the average of the regression residuals, which fluctuates
around a roughly zero mean. After mid 2003, however, a large and persistent discrepancy
between actual and projected rates emerges. This discrepancy has a similar magnitude and
time series pattern as the residuals plotted in figure 4.1. It hovers between 60 and 80 basis
points into 2005, and it reverts to positive territory only in 2006.
  Taken together, the two empirical exercises that we just described lead us to conclude
that

    (1) The relationship between conditional mortgage rates and Treasury factors was sub-
        ject to an abrupt break in the middle of 2003;



9The R-squared of this regression is 92 percent. In principle, this procedure suﬀers from a generated-
regressor problem, but we have so many observations to estimate the coeﬃcients on the time dummies, that
their standard errors are eﬀectively equal to zero.

       (2) This break reflects a tightening of credit conditions in the Treasury market, as
               captured by changes in the factors included in ft , rather than an abrupt fall in
               mortgage interest rates.

We investigate next the extent to which this break was a widespread phenomenon across
diﬀerent types of mortgages, before analyzing some of the factors that might have triggered
it.

4.5. How common was the conundrum? Figure 4.5 plots the evolution of the average
residuals in alternative specifications of equation (3.1), in which we focus separately on
prime, Alt-A and subprime mortgages. The drop in residuals in the summer of 2003 is
evident in all these regressions, but it is more pronounced for subprime mortgages, which
is consistent with the evidence of Demyanyk and Van Hemert (2011).
      Next, we study if this phenomenon was specific to the private-label market, or also
common to mortgages sold to the GSEs or held in banks portfolios. We investigate this
question with a diﬀerent dataset, the Residential Mortgage Servicing Database (RMSD).
This dataset covers the universe of mortgages issued by the 10 largest originators in the
U.S. (now fewer due to mergers), which represent about two-thirds of installment loans in
the residential mortgage market. Overall, this larger database contains about 151 million

relative to the PLSD. This information is collected by Black Knight Financial Services
(formerly known as Lender Processing Services Inc. (LPS) Applied Analytics; McDash
Analytics) and it reaches back to 1992, although we focus again on the period between
2000 and 2007.
  As in Antinolfi et al. (2016), we use the RMSD to obtain information about mortgages
held in banks’ portfolios, or sold to the GSEs to become part of agency MBS. For this
classification we define the loans as “agency” or “portfolio” mortgages based on who owns
them six months after origination, as in Amromin and Kearns (2014).
  Using these data, we re-estimate equation (3.1) separately for agency and portfolio loans.
The average residuals from this regression are plotted in figure 4.6, together with the average
residuals from the baseline specification estimated using private-label loans. The spread
on agency and portfolio loans also declines in 2003, but by a smaller amount and less
abruptly than for private-label products, suggesting that the conundrum was primarily a
phenomenon aﬀecting mortgages in private-label securitizations. This fact is important,
because private-label securitization took oﬀ exactly between 2003 and 2004, and quickly

                5. The Summer of 2003: A Turning Point of the Credit Boom

  The empirical results presented in the previous sections suggest that mortgage rates
disconnected from Treasuries in mid 2003, and that this gap closed only around 2006. In this
section, we discuss in more detail the timing of this disconnect and its relationship with other
important developments in mortgage markets around the same time. We conclude from this
investigation that the summer of 2003 was a crucial turning point in the development of
the credit boom, as systematically confirmed by industry contacts that we interviewed for
this project. This was mainly due to a shift in the behavior of mortgage lenders, which is
most evident in the loan-level interest rate data that are the focus of this paper.
  We begin by discussing the exact timing of the sharp fall in the conditional mortgage
rate spread, which we estimated as taking place in August 2003. Recall that we model
mortgage rates observed in the month of the deal closing as a function of lagged Treasury
factors. This lag accounts for the fact that the mortgage terms are typically “locked in”
a few weeks before the actual closing, and thus they are influenced by conditions at that

time. Therefore, the initial decoupling between mortgage and Treasury rates must have
occurred in July 2003.
  This dating of the emergence of the mortgage conundrum is especially notable because
it immediately follows the FOMC meeting of June 24-25, 2003. At that meeting, the
Committee decided to cut the federal funds rate by 25 basis point, from 1.25 to 1 percent.
This was going to be the lowest level reached by the policy rate over the course of that cycle,
a fact that became progressively clearer to market participants during the following days
and weeks. As a result, the Treasury yield curve steepened significantly over the course of
the following month, as shown in figure 5.1. Already on the day of the policy decision, the
10-year Treasury yield increased by 15 basis points. This represents a very large surprise
to the market, corresponding to more than two standard deviations of the daily change in
this yield on FOMC meeting dates between 1994 and 2007. In the following weeks rates
continued to rise and, by the end of July, long-term Treasury yields had increased by more
than 100 basis points, reflecting an upward revision in the expectations about the future
path of the policy rate. As shown in the previous section, though, mortgage rates barely
reacted to this significant tightening in credit conditions in the Treasury market, leading
to a large drop in their conditional spread over the Treasury factors.

        ployment of mortgage and nonmortgage loan brokers (thousands, seasonally ad-
        justed).


  Another consequence of the realization after the June FOMC meeting that policy rates
were unlikely to fall any further was the end of the refinancing wave that had been surging to
unprecedented levels since 2002. Figure 5.2 shows that the Mortgage Bankers Association
refinance index reached an all-time high in June 2003, from which it dropped precipitously
immediately following the FOMC meeting.
  However, employment among loan brokers did not fall after the refinancing boom came to
an end, as also illustrated in figure 5.2. This stability is in contrast with the pattern observed
at the end of the previous two refinancing waves in 1994 and 1999, when employment in the
sector fell significantly in response to a sharp reduction in the level of refinancing activity. In
fact, the number of loan brokers was roughly stable in the second half of 2003 and then rose
again until early 2006. This discontinuity in the correlation between sectoral employment
and the level of refinancing activity in the summer of 2003 is all the more notable given
the extremely large and sudden drop in the latter, which dwarfs the magnitude of the two
previous episodes.
  Instead of reducing employment and overall activity in response to the disappearance of
refinancing opportunities, as they had done in previous similar episodes, mortgage lenders

appear to have redirected some of their resources towards the origination of new mortgages.
The issuance of agency MBS fell very significantly after the end of the refinancing wave, in
response to a dearth of conforming raw material to securitize (figure 1.2). In contrast, non-
agency securitizations grew rapidly in 2003 and 2004, gaining a sizable market share (figure
1.2). It follows that the majority of the newly originated loans after the summer of 2003
were the non-conforming products that fed private-label MBS. This shift in the absolute and
relative supply of non-conforming loans is also reflected in the behavior of the conditional
mortgage spreads that we computed in section 4. In fact, a mortgage conundrum appears
at the same time both among the conforming loans in the RMSD and among the privately
securitized ones in the PLSD, but it is more pronounced among the latter, especially those
designated as subprime (figures 4.5 and 4.6). This push by mortgage lenders into new
markets is also confirmed by the findings of Scharfstein and Sunderam (2015), who observe
a sharp increase in competitive pressures in local mortgage markets between 2003 and 2004
(figure 1 in their paper).10
  In summary, the sequence of events that we have just reviewed suggests that the mortgage
industry underwent a significant change in focus in the summer of 2003, when the end of the
monetary policy easing cycle brought the ongoing massive refinancing wave to its abrupt
conclusion. Following this drop in the refinancing business, lenders shifted their attention
towards subprime borrowers and other previously underserved segments of the mortgage
market by keeping mortgage rates low especially for those borrowers, in the face of an
increase in Treasury rates.



                            6. Consequences for Loan Quality

  What were the consequences of this shift in the supply of credit towards marginal bor-
rowers? Demyanyk and Van Hemert (2011), Foote et al. (2012), Santos (2015) and Palmer
(2015), among others, have documented the steady deterioration in the performance of


10An important open question is why mortgage lenders shifted into non-conforming loans precisely at this
time. One obvious consideration is that the volume of business generated by refinancing activity over the
previous two years was probably more than they could handle. As the refinancing wave surged, however,
issuing non-conforming loans had probably become a gradually more attractive and accessible business, for
reasons that have already been explored in the literature (e.g. Shin, 2012, Bernanke et al., 2011, Foote
et al., 2012). Therefore, this push into more marginal borrowers probably appeared like a more viable
substitute for the lost refinancing business in the summer of 2003 than it might have been before.

mortgages originated over the course of the boom, in terms of delinquencies and foreclo-
sures.11 This section complements this literature by demonstrating that this process of
progressive deterioration started exactly in the middle of 2003, right after the emergence
of the mortgage rate conundrum.
  Figure 6.1 oﬀers a preliminary look at the raw data by plotting the fraction of mortgages
in our PLSD dataset becoming delinquent within 2, 3 and 4 years of origination, as a
function of their date of issuance. In this analysis, a mortgage is defined delinquent if its
payments are sixty or more days late, or if it is reported as being in foreclosure, real-estate-
owned, or in default. The figure shows that delinquency rates declined slowly in the first
part of the 2000s, but started to rise for loans originated immediately after the summer
of 2003. Mortgages issued around 2006 performed particularly poorly, as it is well-known,
also due to the subsequent plunge in property values and deep recession.
  To control for the impact of these time-varying economic conditions, we follow Demyanyk
and Van Hemert (2011) and study the frequency of mortgage delinquencies by estimating
11More recently, Ospina and Uhlig (2017) have studied the implications of this deterioration in mortgage
performance on the losses sustained by private label RMBS, based on a carefully constructed dataset that
includes the near universe of non agency securitizations up to 2013. They find that RMBS losses were
roughly stable up to 2003 and started increasing for securities issued from 2004/5 onwards, especially for
the lower rated tranches (see their Figure 6).

where ⇤ is the cdf of the standard logistic distribution. In this equation, pi,t,a denotes the
probability that loan i, originated in quarter t, becomes delinquent for the first time at age
a; zi,t and wi,t,a are two sets of controls that include all the loan and borrower characteristics
listed in table 1, as well as the percent changes in income and house prices between t and
t+a in the county where the mortgage was issued; da and dt are the coeﬃcients of an age and
an origination dummy. Diﬀerently from Demyanyk and Van Hemert (2011), our baseline
estimation of model (6.1) uses a 40 percent random sample of all mortgages in the PLSD
database, rather than focusing only on one million subprime loans. In addition, we track
mortgage performance for up to four years after origination, since we have now been able to
observe the loans for longer, yielding a sample of 95 million quarterly performance records.
Finally, we estimate the eﬀect of quarterly, rather than annual, origination dummies, to
gain some insights into what happened within 2003.
   The first panel of figure 6.2 visualizes the estimated impact of loan and borrower char-
acteristics (zi,t ) on the probability of delinquency within 2 to 4 years, for mortgages issued
since 2000. The evolution of these observable traits drives a decline in delinquency rates up
to the middle of 2003, and a slow increase after this date. Towards the end of 2006, observ-
able characteristics again contribute to push delinquency rates down, since the onset of the
financial crisis led originators to issue safer loans. The process of progressive deterioration
in credit quality starting in the middle of 2003 is even more evident when focusing on the
unobservable factors, captured by the origination dummies (dt ). This is illustrated in the
second panel of 6.2, which plots the estimated vintage eﬀect on the cumulative delinquency
rates. This eﬀect is constant for the early origination vintages, but it starts increasing
steadily right after the summer of 2003.12

  These findings suggests that the (conditionally) cheaper mortgages that started being
oﬀered in the summer of 2003, turned out to be of progressively lower average quality, as
measured by their ex-post performance. This lower quality was partly reflected in some of
the observable characteristics included in equation (6.1). For instance, there was an increase
in the incidence of mortgages with no documentation and with non-traditional features such
as low amortization. In addition, figure 6.2 indicates that a notable deterioration in credit
quality also happened along dimensions that are not spanned by the controls, and that are

captured instead by the origination dummy. Finally, a closer inspection of these patterns
reveals that this phenomenon was especially pronounced for subprime mortgages.
  In summary, the sharp and persistent decline in conditional mortgage rates documented
above was accompanied by a worsening of the observable and unobservable quality of the
credit being extended. A natural interpretation of these facts is that the summer of 2003
witnessed a shift in the supply of credit that ultimately resulted in the origination of
mortgages with lower interest rates and of worse overall quality. As shown in section 5, a
majority of these mortgages were non-conforming and were thus absorbed by private-label
securitization pools. The fact that an important dimension of these loans’ lower quality
was not publicly observable helps to explain why these MBS performed especially poorly.


                                  7. Lessons Learned

  This paper contributes to the literature documenting the shift in the supply of credit
towards marginal borrowers during the US housing boom. What we add to this literature,
through our focus on loan-level interest rates and their conditional spread over Treasuries,
is a sharper identification of the timing of this discontinuity, and of some of the factors
behind it. In terms of timing, we pin-point the emergence of the conundrum to July 2003,
and highlight that a process of progressive credit quality deterioration started immediately
after this date. In terms of factors, we relate the conundrum to the attempt of originators
to sustain their level of activity by entering new markets, following the collapse of the
refinancing business.
  A further contribution of this analysis is to refine our understanding of the role of mone-
tary policy during the credit boom. According to a popular narrative, the Federal Reserve
was instrumental to the boom since it kept the policy rate “too low for too long” over
that period (e.g. Taylor, 2007), especially when the federal funds rate marched gradually
upwards starting in 2004, at a pace that the FOMC described as “likely to be measured”
(see FOMC statement of June 30, 2004). According to our results, this narrative misses
a crucial element: after the summer of 2003, mortgage rates were low by up to 100 basis
points even compared to the behavior of Treasury factors. This fact, in turn, suggests that
some emphasis in our attempts to reconstruct the chain of events that led to the credit
boom should be shifted towards the behavior of mortgage lenders in the summer of 2003,
and their response to the end of the easing cycle.
