Many studies have replicated the finding that the forward rate is a biased predictor of the future
change in the spot exchange rate. Usually the forward discount actually points in the wrong
direction. But virtually all those studies apply to advanced economies and major currencies. We
apply the same tests to a sample of 14 emerging market currencies. We find a smaller bias than for
advanced country currencies. The coefficient is on average positive, i.e., the forward discount at
least points in the right direction. It is never significantly less than zero. To us this suggests that
a time-varying exchange risk premium may not be the explanation for traditional findings of bias.
The reasoning is that emerging markets are probably riskier; yet we find that the bias in their
forward rates is smaller. Emerging market currencies probably have more easily-identified trends
of depreciation than currencies of advanced countries.

                     The Forward Market in Emerging Currencies:
                        Less Biased than in Major Currencies

                          Jeffrey Frankel and Jumana Poonawala

        Thirty years ago, researchers found the forward exchange rate to be a biased
predictor of the future spot exchange rate. Worse, in a regression of the future change
in the spot rate against the forward discount, the exchange rate was found on average to
move in precisely the opposite direction from what was predicted.1 This surprising
finding has been replicated many times since, on many sets of data, and with many
refinements. But virtually all the tests have been applied to major currencies and
industrialized countries, not to currencies of developing countries. By now enough
emerging market currencies are represented by forward markets that it is possible to
apply the same tests to them.2

1. Introduction: Tests of Bias in the Forward Discount

        Although many explanations have been given for the finding of bias in the
forward market, they fall broadly into two categories. The first category of
explanations, to which an apparent majority of authors subscribe, maintains the
assumption of rational expectations, and interpret the systematic component of the
forward market’s prediction errors as a risk premium. The second category attributes
the systematic component of the forward rate’s prediction errors to expectation errors on
the part of market participants that are themselves systematic, at least within the sample.3
Algebraically, the regression equation is:

                   s t+1 =    + fd t +      t+1   ,
where
                   s t+1 is ex post future percentage depreciation, defined as s t+1 – s t ,

1
  The first tests included Rogoff (1977), Hansen and Hodrick (1980), and Frankel (1980); they included
consideration of two problems of the error term distribution: moving average errors (from overlapping
contracts) and non-normal distributions (from the “peso problem”). Tryon (1997) was the first to run the
regression in the form of changes relative to the contemporaneous spot rate, and Fama (1984) made this
specification famous. Useful surveys of the literature include Hodrick (1987), Froot and Thaler (1990),
Engel (1995) and Lewis (1995). More recent contributions to the literature include Bacchetta and van
Wincoop (2005), Backus, Foresi and Telmer (2002), Breuer (2000), Lustig and Verdelhan (2005) and
Verdelhan (2006).
2
  Bansal and Dahlquist (2000) test whether the interest differential for developing countries is an unbiased
forecast of future exchange rate changes. Similarly, Flood and Rose (2002) find that the bias in the interest
differential is less for crisis countries, while not significantly different between developed versus
developing. But one cannot invoke covered interest parity, and thereby associate such findings with
forward rate bias, in the same way one could for advanced countries. The reason is that many of these
countries have capital controls, default risk, and interest rates that are not freely determined in the
marketplace.
3
  This phrasing is intended to be broad enough to include the peso problem, learning, and other sources of
error patterns that appear statistically significant within the sample. The definition need not imply that
market participants are irrational.


                                                                                                           2
fd t is the forward discount, of a maturity matching that of the ex post depreciation,
defined as f t – s t ,
s t log of the spot exchange rate at time t (defined as domestic units per foreign), and
f t log of the forward exchange rate at time t.
The null hypothesis of unbiasedness is = 1. The null would imply that there is no
systematic time-varying component to the prediction errors:

                          E t s t+1 - fd t = .

The null hypothesis is actually a joint hypothesis, comprising of two distinct conditions:
                  rational expectations: E t s t+1 = st e,            plus
                  no time-varying risk premium: rp t E t s t+1 - fd t – = 0 ,
where E t s t+1 is the mathematical expectation (within-sample), and
   st e is the expectation held by investors.
  t+1 is the error term, which would be equal to the forward market prediction error under
the null hypothesis. But the null hypothesis is almost always rejected statistically, and
often the finding is < 0. The question then becomes whether the findings of bias are
to be interpreted as a time-varying risk premium, or as systematic expectation errors.

         The simple purpose of this paper is to test for bias in the forward markets in
emerging market currencies, and to see how the bias compares to that for major
currencies. One motivation is to shed some possible light on the two competing
interpretations of bias. Intuitively, emerging market currencies are probably riskier to
hold than major currencies; one might think that the risk premium would therefore be
larger and more variable than for major currencies. At the same time, emerging market
currencies are more prone to bouts of high inflation and other sources of medium-term
trends, so that one might think it would be easier to forecast the direction of movement of
the spot rate than is the case for major currencies, where the exchange rate is closer to a
random walk.4 If the bias is greater for emerging market currencies, that would point
toward the risk premium interpretation; if less, then the other interpretation. We hasten
to add that this suggested motivation is not demonstrated on the basis of formal theory.
It would be hard to do so. It would not be easy, for example, to rule out the possibility
that even though emerging market currencies have higher variance, their risk is highly
diversifiable so that the risk premium could in theory go the other way.5 However, there
is a bit of evidence, from survey data, that investors indeed find it easier to forecast the
direction of movement of emerging market currencies than of major currencies.6

         In the financial markets, efforts to exploit the forward discount bias generally go
under different-sounding names. Exploiting the bias means “going long” in the
currency that sells at a forward discount, relative to others. By covered interest parity,
this is the same thing as going long in the currency that pays a higher short-term nominal
interest rate, relative to others. Among European currencies in the early 1990s -- with

Italian interest rates, for example, above German interest rates -- this strategy was known
as the convergence play. The convergence play may again be relevant for Central
European currencies hoping to join the euro. In the mid-1990s, with Japanese interest
rates very low, the strategy of borrowing in yen and going long in other currencies --
especially dollar-linked currencies in Asia -- was known as the yen carry trade. One
striking pattern about these episodes is that there are long intervals during which one
would have happily made money on average with these strategies, but that these intervals
were dramatically punctuated (though not fully reversed) by crises, in 1992 in Europe and
1997-98 in Asia. During the years 2001-2006, with US interest rates low, the strategy of
borrowing in dollars and going long in euros or emerging market currencies has been
known as the dollar carry trade. Again, all these strategies are equivalent to attempts to
exploit the finding of forward discount bias, which constitutes another motivation for
testing to see whether the finding extends equally to emerging market currencies.

         The paper examines forward markets for 35 currencies, classified under the two
broad groupings of emerging market currencies versus the currencies of advanced
economies countries (including 11 European Monetary Union countries). The data set
starts from December 31, 1996, and runs into 2004.
         Our results show that the bias in the forward discount for emerging market
economies is smaller than for advanced economies. While we reproduce the standard
finding that the coefficient is substantially less than zero for industrialized economies,
and generally highly significant statistically, we find that the coefficient is much closer to
zero for emerging market currencies: often positive and seldom significantly less than
zero. To us the fact that the bias is stronger for advanced country currencies, which are
presumably more stable, suggests that it may not be entirely due to an exchange risk
premium.

2. The Data Sample

         Although many national money markets have been liberalized since the 1970s,
there is still only a relatively limited set of currencies in which forward exchange
contracts are actively traded by international investors. Thus Asia is more heavily
represented in our sample than Latin America or, certainly, Africa. Countries in our
analysis have been classified as emerging market economies based on the IMF Country
Grouping Classification.7 These also include some countries that are classified by the
IMF as newly industrialized economies: Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan.
         Our regression analysis proceeds first country by country, and then pooled. We
start in December 1996 because data are not available for enough emerging markets
before then. We use Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR) to correct for the likely
correlation of the error term across currencies.
         In order to understand the impact of the Asian Financial Crisis, two sets of
regressions have been conducted: one includes the period of financial crisis, while the
other does not. The results from the regression analysis starting December 1996 onwards
are presented in Section three. Regression results for post Asian financial crises (from
December 1998 onwards) are reported in the Appendix.

        Some in our sample never experienced a large change in the exchange rate.
Some countries with tightly fixed exchange rates were not included in the analysis. But
if we had left out specifically all those emerging market currencies that had relatively
stable currencies during the sample period, it might have biased the sample in favor of
volatile emerging market currencies. (Hong Kong has been included; there is a small
band which allows some room for movement even though it has a currency board.)
Countries with capital controls (India) are not excluded from our sample. An established
forward market in these countries shows that there exists a demand for forward exchange
transactions. We have 14 currencies classified as emerging. Data details are given in the
appendix.8

        As has long been recognized in this literature, the use of overlapping contracts (3-
month forward contracts observed at a one-month frequency) creates a moving average
error process. We address this problem in the simplest way possible: by using non-
overlapping contracts. Our data are sampled at the same frequency as the horizon of the
forward exchange rate -- one month. It is necessary to avoid ‘mismatching’ which would
involve incorrect pairing of the forward exchange rate and the future spot rate to which it
pertains. Specifically, we use the forward and spot exchange rates from the last working
day of each month.9 (Raw data series are reported in Appendix VI of the 2004 working
paper: http://ksghome.harvard.edu/~jfrankel/currentpubsspeeches.htm#On%20Emerging%20Markets.)

3. Results Country by Country

        We begin with the country by country regression results, presented in Table 1.
The scatter plots for each country are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2.   To repeat the
regression equation,
                             s t+1- s t = α + β (f t - s t ) + ε t+1

        The results confirm the usual finding of a strong forward rate bias for most of the
industrialized country currencies. All the currencies except for the Greek drachma and
Japanese yen show coefficients that are statistically less than one at very high
significance levels. Most of the advanced countries show coefficients that are also
significantly less than zero at the 5% level. Only Canada, Greece, Italy, Japan and the
UK are not significant at the 5% level. Thus we can reject the hypotheses that the
coefficient is zero for sixteen of the twenty-one advanced economies, and we can also
reject the hypotheses that =1 for nineteen of the twenty-one countries in our advanced
country sample.

  Indonesia, where the end-date of available forward exchange rate data does not coincide with the data-sets
available for other countries was included in individual country regressions, but was dropped from the
pooled regression.

  Breuer and Wohar (1996) identify timing pitfalls, and suggest that they can be reduced by taking data
from the middle of the month instead of the end.

        Our key result first appears in Table 2: the emerging market economies
have coefficients that are generally less negative than their developed country
counterparts. Somewhat more of them are greater than zero than negative. The
average coefficient for emerging market economies is also positive: 0.0033,
versus -4.3331 for advanced economies. To be sure, the forward market is still a
biased predictor for more than half of the emerging currencies: we can easily
reject the hypothesis that the coefficient is 1.0 for eight of the fourteen emerging
market economies (Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South
Africa, Taiwan and Turkey). But in none of the emerging market currencies is the
coefficient statistically less than zero at the 5% significance level.

        Thus far the results support a significant difference between the results of
the industrialized economies and the emerging markets. That the absolute values
for emerging markets are smaller suggests that the forward exchange rate is a less
biased indicator for the future expected spot rate in emerging market economies.11

        Next, in Table III, we correct for correlation of the error term across countries in
the error term, using the technique of Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR).12 The
SUR analysis starts from October 1997, which is the starting point for India and Hungary
in our dataset, so as to standardize the number of observation dates. Therefore all
currencies have 78 data points.


11
   Appendix 5 presents the regressions results for the data set not including the turbulent period covering
the Asian Financial crisis.
12
   Such a correlation is almost inevitable when using bilateral exchange rates. For example, a strong dollar
or a contagious currency crisis in a particular month would likely show up across many of the bilateral
dollar exchange rates.


                                                                                                          9
        Except for South Africa, and Canada and Japan, which appear as outliers
in their sets -- emerging market economies and advanced economies respectively
-- the emerging markets under SUR all continue to yield coefficient estimates that
are less negative than all the industrialized economies. Among advanced
currencies, 5 of 10 show coefficients that are clearly significantly less than zero,
while among emerging markets only 2 of 14 do so (Mexico and South Africa).

4. Results from Pooled Analysis
        We next attempt, in Table IV, to capture more information from our data set by
running a pooled country regression analysis with all currencies constrained to have the
same coefficient within each class of countries. The pooled analysis lets us bring all the
data to bear at once to get the best estimator. We keep separate pools for the emerging
market economies and the industrialized economies. (See Figure 3.) To eliminate
double counting of observations, only the Euro has been included in the pooled analysis
for industrialized economies; individual EMU member countries have been excluded.
This brings the number of advanced countries included in the pooled regression analysis
from 21 to 10.

        The for the pooled analysis for emerging market currencies is -0.028. This
estimate is significantly less than 1.0 at the 5% level. However we cannot reject the
hypotheses that =0. The coefficient for the pooled analysis for advanced economies is
-2.023 (shown in graph below). Again, while we can reject the hypothesis =1 at the 5%
level, and we can reject =0 for the advanced economies, we cannot do so for the
emerging markets. Increasing the ‘n’ leads us to a sharper difference in the estimated
with a more negative value for the industrialized economies than for the emerging
markets.

       We also run Seemingly Unrelated Regressions in the pooled regression analysis to
address cross-currency correlation. (See Table V.) The pooled SUR analysis dropped
observations for the last three countries, alphabetically (Taiwan, Thailand and Turkey), to
make the number of emerging market observations equal the advanced countries (ten
currencies for each).



     5. Conclusions

         The regression analysis conducted in this paper produces a striking result. While
the bias in the forward discount as a predictor of the future change in the spot exchange
rate is present among emerging market currencies and advanced country currencies alike,
the bias is less severe in the former case than in the latter. Unlike major currencies,
which generally show a coefficient significantly less than zero, suggesting that the
forward rate actually points in the wrong direction, the coefficient for emerging market
currencies is on average slightly above zero, and even when negative is rarely
significantly less than zero. One implication for traders is that the “yen carry trade” and
“dollar carry trade” on average may not be as profitable when the strategy is to go long in
emerging market currencies as when it is to go long in major currencies. An implication
for international finance theorists, in light of the intuitively high riskiness of emerging
currencies, is that the source of forward discount bias may not lie entirely in the exchange
risk premium.

of available forward exchange rate data does not coincide with the data-sets available for the remaining
countries)

          Note on DW Stat: For the test of null hypotheses (no autocorrelation) at the 5%
          significance level, the appropriate dL and dU critical values for 53 observations
          and one explanatory valuable are 1.503 and 1.585. In other words, we reject if
          d<1.503 and do not reject if d>1.585.
