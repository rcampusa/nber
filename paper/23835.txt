                                          ABSTRACT

Sovereign debt crises are associated with large and persistent declines in economic activity,
disproportionately so for nontradable sectors. This paper documents this pattern using Spanish
data and builds a two-sector dynamic quantitative model of sovereign default with capital
accumulation. Recessions are very persistent in the model and more pronounced for nontraded
sectors because of default risk. An adverse domestic shock increases the likelihood of default,
limits capital inflows, and thus restricts the ability of the economy to exploit investment
opportunities. The economy responds by reducing investment and reallocating capital toward the
traded sector to support debt service payments. The real exchange rate depreciates, a reflection of
the scarcity of traded goods. We find that these mechanisms are quantitatively important for
rationalizing the experience of Spain during the recent debt crisis.

1     Introduction
During the recent sovereign debt crisis in Europe, many countries experienced a large and
persistent decline in output. As previously documented for emerging markets crises, the
decline in production was more pronounced in less traded sectors. Using industry-level data
from Spain, we document large differential output performance across sectors, with less
traded sectors experiencing much larger declines in output. We build a dynamic model
of sovereign default risk, capital accumulation, and two sectors that rationalizes both the
large and persistent decline in aggregate output as well as the relatively sharper drop for
nontradables during a sovereign debt crisis.
    The main mechanism in our model that replicates the dynamics of sectoral and aggregate
output during the crisis is the rise in sovereign default risk. Default risk amplifies and prolongs
the recession, especially for the nontraded sector. Low aggregate shocks increase default risk
and make international financial conditions tight by increasing bond spreads. In response
to these shocks, investment is greatly reduced, not only because of the low productivity but
also to smooth the decline in tradable consumption. Tradable production, however, decreases
less than nontradable production because the economy reallocates inputs toward the traded
sector to support external debt repayment at higher bond spreads. The decline in investment
has persistent adverse effects on financial conditions, slowing down the recovery. The real
exchange rates depreciates as a reflection of the scarcity of traded goods.
    Using two-digit sectoral data for Spain, we document sizable and robust differential per-
formance across sectors during the debt crisis, correlated with tradedness. Using input-output
tables, we define a continuous measure for tradedness as the ratio of exports to total out-
put. The variation in tradedness across sectors is large, ranging from 0% to 50%, that is,
anything from no exports to over half of the production being exported. We find that the
output decline from the peak of 2007 to the trough of 2013 is larger for sectors that are less
traded. Within manufacturing, the peak-to-trough decline is about 30% for sectors with zero
tradedness and about 0% for those with 50% tradedness. We also find that the comovement
of annual growth rates with the sovereign bond spread, a measure of the severity of the debt
crisis, varies with tradedness. We find that a 1% increase in the bond spread is associated
with an average decline of 3% in the annual growth rate for sectors with zero tradedness and
actually an increase in annual growth of about 1.5% for sectors with 50% tradedness.
    We build a dynamic, small open economy model with capital accumulation and two sectors
producing tradable and nontradable goods. International debt is unenforceable, and the
economy can default on its debt. The interest rate on debt carries a spread that compensates
for endogenous default risk. Consumption and investment are produced with a bundle of

                                                2
traded and nontraded goods, and the international debt is denominated in tradable goods.
Aggregate capital accumulates over time as a result of investment decisions and is allocated
across sectors such that the marginal product of capital is equalized. The economy is subject
to aggregate productivity shocks that affect both sectors symmetrically.
    In this framework, default risk restricts capital inflows and limits the ability of the econ-
omy to smooth consumption and effectively exploit productive domestic investment opportu-
nities. The degree to which the country is indebted matters for investment and consumption
as well as for the allocation of inputs across sectors. High indebtedness leads to declines in in-
vestment since tight financial conditions arising from default risk, more binding in high-debt
states, lead the economy to shift resources away from investment and toward consumption.
Consumption also falls despite this shift simply because more output is needed to service a
larger debt level. In high debt states the allocation of inputs is also tilted towards the traded
sector to support debt repayment.
    We analyze the impulse response functions to declines in aggregate productivity that af-
fect both sectors equally. A decline in aggregate productivity of 0.5% results in an increase
in bond spreads of about 0.3% and a decline in aggregate output of about 0.7%. The decline
in aggregate output is very persistent. By period 15 after impact, the shock has largely
recovered, yet aggregate output continues to be about 0.4% below trend. The responses are
markedly different across sectors. Nontraded production falls by more than 1% on impact,
whereas traded production is almost unchanged. The decline in tradable consumption, how-
ever, is more than twice the decline in nontradable consumption, leading to a real exchange
rate depreciation.
    To tease out how default risk shapes these impulse responses, we compare them against
a standard two-sector reference model without default risk. The impulse responses in this
reference model are quite different from those in the benchmark default model. The decline
in aggregate output is more muted, and output recovers rapidly after the shock. The sectoral
decline across sectors is similar, with traded production actually declining a bit more than
nontraded production. The reason is that with enforcement and thus no default risk, the
economy can borrow more when it experiences low shocks and smooth consumption. Well-
functioning financial markets in the reference model prevent the large and persistent decline
in investment as well as the real exchange rate depreciation present in the benchmark default
model.
    We conduct an event analysis and compare our model implications directly to Spanish
data. We focus on the peak-to-trough performance from 2007 to 2013. We feed in the
sequence of shocks such that the model replicates the 9.6% decline in aggregate output


                                                3
observed in Spain. We then compare the implications of the model against the data for
bond spreads, sectoral output, and real exchange rate depreciation. We find that the model
predicts an increase in spreads of 3%, close to the 2.7% value observed in the data. The
model predicts declines of 10% and 6.8% for nontraded and traded sectors, respectively, very
close to the data counterparts of 10% and 6.4%. The model also predicts, as in the data,
a real exchange rate depreciation. The magnitude of the average depreciation of 2.4% in
the model is, however, higher than the 1.1% observed in the data. The predictions of our
model with default stand in contrast to those of the reference model with no default, which
predicts a more muted recession that is larger for the traded sector and with no change in
bond spreads or the real exchange rate.
    Finally, we also use our model to forecast the persistence of the recession. We extend the
event such that the shocks in the model after 2013 recover following their Markov chains. We
find that our model predicts a very slow recovery. By 2040 our model predicts that aggregate
output will have closed only half of the gap from trend.

Literature. Our paper is closely related to the literature studying the boom-bust cycle and
sectoral differential responses — for example Schneider and Tornell (2004), Kehoe and Ruhl
(2009), Pratap and Urrutia (2012), and de Ferra (2016). First, in terms of empirical findings,
it has been documented that during crises, real exchange rates depreciate and nontradable
sectors suffer a bigger decline than tradable sectors; see Schneider and Tornell (2004) for
a review. Schneider and Tornell present these stylized facts with an event study for the
boom-bust cycles of 11 countries from 1980 to 1999. Kehoe and Ruhl (2009) and Pratap
and Urrutia (2012) confirm these stylized facts for Mexico’s 1994 crisis, and the recent paper
de Ferra (2016) reports similar results for Italy’s 2012 crisis. Our empirical contribution
confirms these findings for Spain with disaggregated data, using a continuous measure for
tradability.
    In terms of theory, both Kehoe and Ruhl (2009) and Pratap and Urrutia (2012) focus on
the effect of sudden stops on aggregate total factor productivity and exchange rate depreci-
ations. Kehoe and Ruhl model sudden stops as an unexpected halt in foreign capital flows.
Pratap and Urrutia have a working capital setup and model sudden stops as an exogenous
interest rate shock. Hence, in their paper, a sudden stop is exogenous, whereas aggregate
total factor productivity is endogenous. In our paper, productivity shocks generate endoge-
nous sudden stops and interest rate fluctuations arising from default risk. de Ferra (2016),
as in our work, has endogenous default risk. This paper, however, abstracts from capital
accumulation and the persistence of recessions and emphasizes the endogenous fiscal policies


                                              4
during the recession.
    Our finding that default risk generates amplification and persistent effects echoes the
classic ideas by Bernanke et al. (1999) and Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) that financial fric-
tions amplify cycles. Mendoza (2010) quantifies these ideas in an international context with
financial frictions arising from exogenously imposed collateral constraints. Our work shares
a conclusion similar to Mendoza’s in that financial frictions amplify the shocks and lead to
a slow recovery. Our model differs from his work in that our financial frictions arise from
endogenous default risk and the associated bond spreads.
    Our model extends the standard sovereign default model, as in Arellano (2008) and
Aguiar and Gopinath (2006), with two sectors: production and capital. A few papers have
also considered the connection between default risk in the context of a multisector framework.
Na et al. (2014) study a government’s trade-off between devaluation and default in a sovereign
default model with sticky wages. Asonuma (2016) documents the link between the real
exchange rate and sovereign default in a pure-exchange sovereign default model. Most works
in sovereign default literature abstract from capital, except for Bai and Zhang (2012) and
Gordon and Guerrón-Quintana (2013). Gordon and Guerrón-Quintana focus on the effect of
capital on sovereign spreads, while Bai and Zhang pay attention to the effect of default risk on
international risk sharing. In contrast, we emphasize the amplification during international
business cycles and the differential sectoral responses.


2       Spanish Sectoral Data
We document the large decline in production that Spain experienced during the debt crisis.
From the peak of 2007 to the trough in 2013, aggregate real GDP declined by 8% in absolute
terms.1 In this section, we document that the decline in output was not homogeneous across
sectors and is correlated with the tradedness of the sector.
    To document these facts, we use two-digit sectoral real gross value added data for Spain
from Eurostat to construct sectoral output series from 2000 to 2014. We define the tradedness
of the sector by the ratio of exports of goods and services to total use gross output using
the 2011 input-output table from Eurostat. Tradedness is a continuous variable that proxies
for how tradable the output of each two-digit sector is. Appendix B provides further details
about our measure and its relation to output contraction during the crisis.
    We find large variation in the tradedness of sectors, ranging from 50% for water transport

    1
    The decline is much larger when it is computed relative to trend. From 2000 until 2007 GDP in Spain
grew 3% annually. Hence, from 2007 to 2013 the decline in GDP relative to a 3% trend is more than 20%.

                                                  5
to 0% for services such as education and health. Within manufacturing, we also find large
variation in tradedness, ranging from 50% for manufacture of motor vehicles to about 2% for
repair and installation of machinery, again at the two-digit level.
    To assess the contraction of sectoral output during the crisis, we compute the growth rate
of real value added for each sector. We construct two growth series for each sector. The
first series measures growth as the peak-to-trough percentage change in value added from
2007 to 2013. The second is an annual growth rate. We construct these series relative to
the corresponding sector average to filter out sector-specific growth rate trends. In appendix
B, we report the details of the tradedness and peak-to- trough declines across all two-digit
sectors.
    We start analyzing the relation between tradedness and output performance during the
debt crisis by focusing on manufacturing and the peak-to-trough growth rate. The peak-to-
trough growth rate is -14% on average across these sectors but varies considerably. Some
rates, such as manufacturing of machinery, contracted by about 8%, whereas others, such
as repair and installations of machinery, declined by 47%. In Figure 1 we illustrate the
relation between the tradedness of sectors and the peak-to-trough decline in sectoral output
for two-digit sectors within manufacturing. The figure shows that sectors with low tradedness
experienced a much larger decline in output relative to sectors with high tradedness. In the
first column of Table 1, we report the estimates of a cross-sectional linear regression of
peak-to-trough growth rates on tradedness for the two-digit manufacturing data. The 0.72
coefficient on tradedness indicates that the decline in output is 36% larger for sectors with
0% tradedness relative to 50% tradedness over six years from 2007 to 2013.
    In the second column of Table 1, we report results for the cross-sectional regression of
the peak-to-trough growth rate on tradedness across all two-digit sectors. As in the case
for manufacturing sectors only, more traded sectors experienced a smaller decline in output
from 2007 to 2013. The coefficient on tradedness is significant and positive, although the
magnitude is smaller than for manufacturing sectors alone. The smaller coefficient arises
because across all sectors of the economy, there is a large fraction of sectors with very small
tradedness, such as services and construction with varying performance during the crisis.
    In the third and fourth columns of Table 1, we consider a panel data set with our second
measure for sectoral growth, the annual output growth rate. We regress this variable on a
time-varying measure of the crisis given by the government spread and on the interaction
between the government spread and the sector’s tradedness. This interaction term allows
us to recover the differential effect of the crisis on sectors based on their tradability. The
third column shows results for two-digit manufacturing sectors, and the fourth column shows

results for all two-digit sectors.
    In these regressions, the coefficients on the government spread are negative and significant,
whereas the coefficients on the interaction terms are positive. The sign of these coefficients
indicates that sector growth declines in periods of high government spreads and that the
decline is smaller in sectors that are more traded. The magnitude of the coefficients for the
manufacturing regression implies that a 1% increase in the government spread is associated
with an average growth rate decline of 3% for sectors with zero tradedness. The growth rate
for sectors with high tradedness, e.g., 50%, is actually positive and equal to 1.5% (−0.03 +
0.09 × 0.5). The coefficients in the sample including all sectors are similar, although the
magnitudes are somewhat smaller.
    In summary, the large decline in aggregate output that Spain experienced during the
recent debt crisis was not homogeneous across different sectors of the economy. Less traded
sectors experienced a more severe downturn than more traded sectors. This empirical fact is
present across all sectors of the economy as well as within manufacturing only.


3    Model
We consider a two-sector, dynamic small open economy model with capital accumulation and
a sovereign government that can default on its debt. The model extends to two sectors the
one-sector framework of Bai and Zhang (2012) and Gordon and Guerrón-Quintana (2013),
who study sovereign default in an environment with capital accumulation. The two sec-
tors produce tradable and nontradable goods that are used for consumption and investment
purposes. The government is benevolent and trades one period bonds with international,
risk-neutral lenders. International debt is unenforceable, and the government can default on
it. The costs of default consist of temporary exclusion from financial markets and a reduction
in productivity. We consider the problem of a government that directly chooses allocations.
Below we show that this problem can be decentralized with an appropriate choice of taxes.
    Firms in each sector produce tradable and nontradable goods, yT t and yN t , using capital
with decreasing returns to scale technology and productivity zt :

                                          yT t = zt kTαTt                                    (1)
                                                    αN
                                         yN t = zt kN t.                                     (2)

Productivity is subject to shocks that follow a first-order Markov process with transition
matrix π(zt , zt−1 ). These are the only aggregate shocks in the model.


                                                 8
    The small open economy starts each period with the aggregate capital stock kt , which
is distributed for production across the two sectors after the shocks are realized such that
kt = kT t + kN t . Capital depreciates each period at rate δ and accumulates with investment
xt subject to adjustment costs Ψ(kt+1 , kt ). The law of motion for capital is

                             kt+1 = (1 − δ)kt + xt − Ψ(kt+1 , kt ).                        (3)

    The government trades international discount bonds denominated in tradable goods with
risk-neutral lenders that discount the future at the international interest rate R. Each period
the government starts with debt bt and decides whether to repay the debt or default. If the
government repays the debt, then it can borrow bt+1 at price qt . The price is given by a bond
price schedule that compensates lenders for the expected loss from default.
    Traded goods produced by the small open economy, yT t , and new borrowing, qt bt+1 , are
used for consumption and investment purposes as well as for paying back the debt. The
traded goods budget constraint is

                                cT t + xT t = yT t + qt bt+1 − bt .                        (7)

Nontraded goods produced by the small open economy, yN t , are used for consumption and
investment:
                                  cN t + xN t = yN t .                               (8)

    We abstract from labor supply and the reallocation of labor across sectors. Given de-
creasing returns to capital in production, the setup can be reinterpreted as featuring inelastic,
sector-specific labor supply.


3.1    Recursive Formulation
The aggregate states of the small open economy are the exogenous productivity shock z and
the endogenous states of capital k and debt b, as well as a record of whether the country is
in a state of financial market exclusion following default. Let S be the state of the economy
given by (h, s) with s = (b, k, z) and h denoting which regime the country is in, h = 0 normal
market access and h = 1 while in default.
    Let V (s) be the value of the benevolent government in the normal regime with state s.
The government chooses to repay the debt d = 0 or default d = 1 to maximize its value:

                                                  dV n (s) + (1 − d)V d (k, z) .
                                              
                          V (s) = max                                                        (9)
                                  d={0,1}


where V n (s) is the value of repayment and V d (k, z) is the value of default. The value of
default depends only on capital and productivity because debt is eliminated following default.
Whenever the government defaults d = 1, its next-period regime is the one associated with
default and market exclusion, i.e. h0 = 1.
   Conditional on repaying the debt, the government chooses the allocation of capital be-
tween tradable and nontradable sectors {kT , kN }, tradable and nontradable consumption and
investment {cT , cN , xT , xN }, and new borrowing b0 to maximize its value:

                          V n (s) =               max                 u(c) + βEV (s0 )      (10)
                                      {kN ,kT ,cT ,cN ,xT ,xN ,b0 }


subject to the tradable and nontradable budget constraints (7) and (8), the constraint on
capital k = kT + kN , the accumulation of capital (3), and the consumption and investment
aggregators (6) and (4). When choosing its debt, the government understands that in the
following period, it has the option to default.
    If the government chooses to default, its debt obligations b are eliminated from the budget
constraint but is temporarily excluded from international bond markets, and the economy
suffers productivity losses. Every period after default, the government faces a probability λ
that it will reenter financial markets and productivity costs will be lifted. Upon reentry, the
government starts with zero debt. Conditional on default, the government also chooses the
allocation of capital between tradable and nontradable sectors {kT , kN } and tradable and


                                                        10
nontradable consumption and investment {cT , cN , xT , xN } to maximize its value:

            V d (k, z) =                               u(c) + βE λV (0, k 0 , z 0 ) + (1 − λ)V d (k 0 , z 0 )
                                                                                                            
                                    max                                                                          (11)
                           {kN ,kT ,cT ,cN ,xT ,xN }


subject to the constraint on capital k = kT + kN , the accumulation of capital (3), and the
consumption and investment aggregators (6) and (4). The tradable and nontradable budget
constraints during default are

                                                 cT + xT = z d (z)kTαT                                           (12)
                                                                  αN
                                                cN + xN = z d (z)kN  ,                                           (13)

where z d (z) ≤ z, reflecting the productivity costs of default.
    This problem gives rise to policy functions for default d(s), the allocation of capital
{kT (S),kN (S)}, tradable and nontradable consumption and investment {cT (S),cN (S),xT (S),
xN (S)}, and borrowing b0 (s).
    International lenders are risk neutral and discount at the international interest rate R.
The bond price schedule q(b0 , k 0 , z) compensates international lenders for default risk. It is a
function that depends on the choice of borrowing b0 and capital next period k 0 because the
default decision in the following period d(b0 , k 0 , z 0 ) depends on both endogenous states. Since
the productivity shock z is persistent, with a Markov structure, knowledge of its value today
helps to forecast its future realizations. The break-even bond price satisfies

                                                         1
                                    q(b0 , k 0 , z) =      Ez0 ,z [1 − d0 (b0 , k 0 , z 0 )].                    (14)
                                                         R

    The government takes as given the bond price function in its recursive problem, but
internalizes that different choices of b0 and k 0 map into different bond prices. We define the
spread as the inverse of the bond price relative to the risk-free rate spr = 1/q − R.
    We now define the equilibrium of this economy.

Recursive equilibrium. Given state S = (h, s), the recursive Markov equilibrium consists
of policy functions for default d(s), the allocation of capital {kT (S), kN (S)}, tradable and
nontradable consumption and investment {cT (S), cN (S), xT (S), xN (S)}, and borrowing b0 (s);
value functions {V (s), V d (s), V n (k, z)}, and the bond price function q(b0 , k 0 , z) such that: (i )
the policy and value functions for the government satisfy its optimization problem and (ii )
the government bond price schedule satisfies equation (14).



                                                               11
3.2    Prices and the Real Exchange Rate
We show in Appendix C that the allocations from the centralized problem described above
can be decentralized in an economy with the appropriate choice of capital taxes. The de-
centralized environment consists of competitive traded and nontraded firms that rent capital
from the households. Identical households decide on investment and the consumption of
traded and nontraded goods. Households buy investment goods from competitive producers,
who choose the mix of traded and nontraded investment inputs. Only the government has
access to international financial markets. It decides how much to borrow and whether to
default. It transfers the net proceeds from these operations to the households, lump sum.
   In this decentralized economy, we show that the relative price of nontraded goods to
traded goods, denoted by pN , determines many of the sectoral allocations as well as the real
exchange rate. Households choose the ratio of the marginal utility of nontraded relative to
traded consumption to equal pN . Investment producers choose the ratio of the marginal
product of nontraded relative to traded investment goods to equal pN :
                                              −1/η                           −1/η
                             θ        cN (S)             (1 − θ)       xN (S)
                   pN (S) =                            =                                .   (15)
                            1−θ       cT (S)                θ          xT (S)

    The sectoral allocation of capital across traded and nontraded firms also depends on the
relative price. Firms rent capital from households such that the marginal product equals the
domestic rental rate RK . This implies that in equilibrium the ratio of marginal products
across sectors also equals the relative price of nontraded goods:

                                                αT kT (S)αT −1
                                   pN (S) =                    .                            (16)
                                                αN kN (S)αN −1

The common CES functions for aggregate consumption and investment imply that the ratio
of traded to nontraded consumption equals the ratio of traded to nontraded investment
goods inputs and that the price index for aggregate consumption pC equals the price index
for aggregate investment pX . This aggregate price index is a function of the relative price of
nontraded goods given by
                                                               1
                        pC (S) = pX (S) = (1 − θ) + θpN (S)1−η 1−η ,

where we have expressed the index relative to the price of traded goods PT , normalized to 1.
The real exchange rate in this environment, eC , is then the inverse of the consumption price
index. We can easily derive this relation by imposing the law of one price for traded goods


                                                 12
such that PT = εP ∗ where ε is the nominal exchange rate and P ∗ is the international price.

                                            εP ∗   PT     1
                                 eC (S) =        =    =        .                               (17)
                                            PC     PC   pC (S)

    These relations imply that a depreciation of the real exchange rate translates into reduc-
tions in the ratio of traded to nontraded consumption and investment and increases in the
ratio of traded to nontraded capital allocation.
    In our two-sector model, we define GDP in terms of tradable goods as

                                     GDPt = yT t + pN t yN t .

Following standard accounting practices, we will also define real GDP using constant prices
as GDPt = yT t + p¯N yN t where p¯N is the base period or average nontraded relative price.

    There are two sets of parameters. The first is taken directly from the literature, and we
calibrate the second to match stylized facts related to sovereign default (see Table 2).
    The first set of parameters includes {σ, αT , αN , η, θ, δ, R, ρ, σz }. We set the risk aversion
σ to 2 and the yearly net risk-free rate R − 1 to 4%. We take the capital shares and elasticity
of substitution between tradable and nontradable goods from Mendoza (1995). The capital
share in the tradable sector αT is 0.57, while that of the nontradable sector is αN = 0.66.
The elasticity η is 0.74. We choose the share of nontradable goods in the CES bundle, θ, to
be 0.6. The capital depreciation rate δ is standard, 7% annually. The return parameter λ is
chosen to be 0.25 so that defaulting countries are excluded from financial markets for four
years, consistent with Gelos et al. (2011). We pick the shock persistence ρ and volatility σz

4.2    Default Risk and Decision Rules
Before describing the model time series, we illustrate the model mechanisms by describing
how default risk limits capital flows to the economy. We also discuss how the choices of
consumption, investment, and the sectoral allocation of capital vary with the economy’s level
of debt.
    As is typical in dynamic sovereign default models, default risk restricts capital inflows to
the economy. In our model, given a shock realization this period of z, each combination of
levels of borrowing and capital choices is associated with a different bond price, encoded in
the bond price function q(b0 , k 0 , z). In the left panel of Figure 2 we plot the spread schedule,


                                                14
spr(b0 , k 0 , z) = 1/q(b0 , k 0 , z) − R as a function of borrowing. Spreads increase in the borrowing
level b0 . The schedule is also tighter for a smaller capital choice k 0 and when productivity z is
low. As explained in detail by Gordon and Guerrón-Quintana (2013), lower capital or lower
productivity or both are associated with a lower debt repayment capacity, which increases
default risk today. The bond price schedule also encodes a “Laffer curve” of borrowing and
a maximum amount of capital inflow. In the right panel, we plot the capital inflows schedule
q(b0 , k 0 , z)b0 . Capital inflows are restricted by default risk and bound by the peak of the Laffer
curve.

    Next we describe the decision rules as a function of the economy’s level of debt at the
start of the period, b. In Figure 3, we plot the economy’s choices, holding constant the level
of capital k and shock z at their mean levels, while we vary b, which we normalize by the
mean level of aggregate output. The panels in the figure feature two different regions. When
debt is low enough, the economy repays the debt and the policy rules vary with b. When
debt is high enough, b ≥ 0.2, the economy defaults and the policy rules no longer vary with
b.
    Panel (a) plots the allocation of capital {kT , kN }, which translates directly into sectoral
output. As debt increases, more capital is allocated to the tradable sector to support repaying
the increasing debt. For high enough debt levels, the economy defaults and the allocation of
capital reverts back toward a larger nontraded sector because the economy no longer services
the foreign, traded-denominated debt.
    In Panel (b), we plot the choices of tradable and nontradable consumption {cT , cN } as
well as aggregate consumption as functions of debt. Consumption of each of the two goods
falls with debt. Tradable consumption falls despite an increasing traded output because more

                                                              15
of the economy’s traded resources are devoted to debt repayment. Nontraded consumption
falls too because of the shift in resources away from the nontraded sector that arises as debt
increases. When debt is high enough and the economy defaults, the consumption of the two
goods settles at levels similar to those at moderate levels of debt.
    Panel (c) contains the choices for tradable and nontradable investment {xT , xN }. The
use of traded goods for investment falls with debt because net capital inflows qb0 − b are
more restricted when debt is high. As illustrated by the capital inflows schedule in Figure
2, in our model the economy faces limits on the extent to which the traded input can flow
into the economy to exploit investment opportunities. These restrictions in capital flows are
more binding for investment when the economy has to pay large levels of debt. The use of
nontraded goods for investment falls with debt also because of the lower nontraded output
due to the sectoral shift toward traded goods production.

in the following period when z 0 is again kept at its mean. A large debt today lowers capital
and output tomorrow because of the decline in investment. For example, as debt increases
from 10% to 20% of output, GDP next period falls by about 5%.


4.3    Impulse Responses: Benchmark
We now describe the time series dynamics of our model by presenting impulse response
functions of aggregates to a negative productivity shock.
    We construct the impulse response functions in our nonlinear model following Koop et al.
(1996). We simulate 3000 paths for the model for 350 periods. From periods 1 to 300, the
aggregate shock follow its underlying Markov chains so that the cross-sectional distribution
of debt and capital converges to the limiting distribution of endogenous states. In period 301,
the impact period, normalized to 0 in the plots, we decrease all histories’ productivity shocks
by the same amount. From period 301 on, the productivity shocks follow the conditional
Markov chain. The impulse responses plot the average, across the 3000 paths, of the variables
from period 299 to 325, conditional on the economy not defaulting.
    In Figure 4 we plot the impulse responses to productivity declines for the productivity
shock z, the bond spread, real GDP and aggregate consumption, and capital. Panel (a)
shows that average productivity falls a bit over 0.55%, which corresponds to about half of
one standard deviation of the shock. After the impact period, the shock follows its Markov
chain, and by period 15 it recovers by more than 75%, to about 0.1% below the average level.
In these impulse response functions, we are conditioning on the histories without default; the
mean productivity including the paths with default is negligibly different, about 0.03% lower
than the plot here.
    In Panel (b) we plot the path for the bond spread. The spread increases from about 2.2%
to about 2.5% on impact following the decline in productivity. Low productivity increases the
probability that the economy will default. The spread rises to compensate for such default
risk. The spread largely recovers by period 15. In Panel (c) we plot the responses for real
GDP and aggregate consumption. Real GDP falls on impact by the same magnitude as the
shock, about 0.55%, because capital is predetermined. In the period after the impact, GDP
declines further to about 0.7% below average because investment also contracts due to the
low productivity. GDP starts to recover two periods after the impact period, but only very
slowly. By period 15, GDP continues to be depressed, about 0.4% below average. Aggregate
consumption falls sharply on impact, not only because production is depressed but also
because of the high borrowing interest rate spreads. Consumption contracts on impact more
than production because the economy experiences net capital outflows due to the restricted

capital inflow schedule and associated high interest rates spreads. Consumption recovers
after adjusting the debt but remains depressed thereafter. By period 15, consumption is
almost as depressed as production.
    In Panel (d) we plot the impulse response for aggregate capital. It falls substantially
for about 8 periods after the initial shock, to more than 0.5% below its average. Afterward,
capital recovers but only very slowly. After 25 periods, capital continues to be quite depressed,
more than 0.4% below the mean.
    The large endogenous persistence that our model generates is due to two reasons. First,
the capital stock reacts slowly to productivity shocks because of adjustment costs. This effect
is present in standard small open economy models with capital adjustment costs. Second, the
financial frictions that arise in the model because of default risk also make recessions more
persistent. Default risk severely limits the ability of the economy to smooth fluctuations
in consumption and exploit investment opportunities. When productivity is low, financial
frictions tighten. The economy then reduces investment to support consumption. These
financial frictions effectively act like an additional adjustment cost, one that makes recessions
more persistent.2
    To illustrate the effect of default risk on aggregate capital dynamics, it is useful to analyze
the first-order conditions for capital and borrowing from the model.3 As is standard in models
with multiple assets, the allocation of capital and borrowing is such that the expected return
on capital, denoted by RK (S 0 ), weighted by the marginal utility equals the expected return
on borrowing, denoted by RB (S 0 ):

                                 Eu0cT (S 0 )RK (S 0 ) = Eu0cT (S 0 )RB (S 0 ).                          (18)

    The return on capital equals the marginal benefit of capital tomorrow in terms of tradables
relative to the marginal benefit of capital today. The marginal benefit of capital equals the
marginal product of capital plus the undepreciated capital minus the adjustments costs. The
marginal cost of capital is one plus the adjustment costs today as well as the effect capital
directly has on the bond price:

                                         p0X (S 0 )(z(S 0 )αT kTαT −1 + 1 − δ − Ψ02 )
                           RK (S 0 ) =                                     dq 0
                                                                                      .                  (19)

      These results are consistent with the findings in Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) that recessions accompanied
by financial crises are followed by slower and more modest recoveries.

      In deriving these expressions, we assume that the value function and bond price function are differen-
tiable.

   The return on borrowing equates the marginal cost of servicing debt tomorrow, which
only occurs in the no-default states, relative to the benefit of borrowing, which equals the

                                                    q + db 0b



    In times of high spreads, q is low and the sensitivity of the price with respect to borrowing
is large, as shown in the spread curves in Figure 2, both of which increase the return on
borrowing RB (S 0 ).
    The response of capital to a low productivity shock shown in Panel (d) of Figure 2
can be understood as a response to low expected return on capital RK (S 0 ) because of low
productivity and also as a response to a high return on borrowing RB (S 0 ). When productivity
is low, spreads increase, which pushes up the return on borrowing RB (S 0 ). Capital then
decreases because of the large borrowing costs, which are encoded not only in the high
spread but also in the slope of the bond price. The large and persistent decline in capital
leads to a persistent decline in aggregate output and consumption.
    We now turn to the impulse responses of sector-specific production and consumption, as
well as the impulse responses of the real exchange rate to the decline in aggregate productivity.
Panel (a) in Figure 5 plots the responses of traded and nontraded production. The model
generates a large differential response to the shock across the traded and nontraded sector. So
on impact, traded production increases about 0.2% whereas nontraded production declines
over 1%. Recall that the traded and nontraded sectors are subject to a common productivity
shock. The reason why nontraded goods decline by more is that capital inputs are reallocated
to the traded sector to support the payment of the external debt, which carries higher bond
spreads. After the impact period, traded production declines slightly more than nontraded
production and both sectors recover at an equal rate.
    In Panel (b) we plot the sectoral consumption paths. Traded consumption declines on
impact about 1.1%, much more than nontraded consumption, which declines about 0.5%.
Nontraded consumption declines less than production because the use of nontraded goods for
investment xN declines such that nontraded consumption is smoothed. Traded consumption
declines despite the increase in production and large decline in investment xT because of the
large debt repayment at high bond spreads. The relative decline in traded and nontraded
investment is equal to the decline in relative consumption, xT /xN = cT /cN , as this ratio only
depends on the real exchange rate.
    Panel (c) plots the real exchange rate, as defined in (17). The real exchange rate depreci-


                                                  20
ates on impact about 0.5%. The depreciation occurs because of the increase in bond spreads
and tight international borrowing conditions that push down the relative price of nontraded
goods. The depreciation is short-lived, and the exchange rate reverts back to a slightly more
appreciated level thereafter. Real exchange rate depreciations during debt crises are a robust
feature documented for emerging markets.4

    In summary, the impulse responses to low productivity shocks show that our model gen-
erates persistent recessions accompanied by sluggish recovery in investment and tightening of
international borrowing conditions, manifested in high bond spreads. The responses across
sectors are different, with larger declines in nontraded relative to traded production.

markets.

4.4       Impulse Responses: Reference Model with No Default
We now assess the endogenous amplification that our model generates by comparing its
dynamics to a no-default reference model. The reference model we consider is a standard
two-sector small open economy model that trades bonds in international markets. Unlike
in our benchmark model, here the bonds are enforceable. We find that our benchmark
model with default risk provides a large endogenous amplification of shocks and contrasting
implications for the evolution of sectoral production. The no-default model differs in that
it generates larger declines in tradables relative to nontradables, which is at odds with the
data.
    The reference model is a version of our model but without default risk. We close this
small open economy reference model and ensure stationarity following Schmitt-Grohé and
Uribe (2003), with a price debt elasticity formulation such that

                                                          1
                                    q(b0 ) =                             .
                                               R + φB [exp(b0 − b̄) − 1]

We hold all the parameters in this reference model constant at their values in the benchmark.
The additional parameters controlling the price debt elasticity {b̄, φB } are chosen such that
the mean level of debt in the reference model equals the level in the benchmark such that
the elasticity of bond prices is minuscule.5
    In Figure 6 we compare the impulse response functions for real GDP, aggregate capital,
and traded and nontraded production of the no-default reference model to our benchmark
model. As seen in Panels (a) and (b), the no-default model has a much more muted and
less persistent recession than our benchmark model. GDP in the benchmark model falls
about 40% more than in the reference model. Capital falls much less and quite slower in the
reference model than in the benchmark. By five periods after impact, the fall in capital in
the benchmark model is five times smaller than in the reference model.
    Panel (c) contains the impulse responses for traded and nontraded output. In contrast to
the benchmark model, in the reference no-default model, traded output falls more on impact
than nontraded output, about 50% more. The smaller decline in traded production in the
reference model reflects the more relaxed frictions in the financial markets available in this
environment. When low productivity hits, the economy expands borrowing at low interest
rates to smooth traded consumption and investment. The availability of traded goods from
international markets allows capital to be allocated away from the traded sector toward the
support of the nontraded sector. In contrast, in our benchmark model with default risk, low

productivity shocks restrict the availability of international borrowing, which generates the
opposite sectoral responses.


4.5       Event Analysis for Spain
We now compare the quantitative implications of the model to Spanish data. We are inter-
ested in quantifying our model against the peak-to-trough data in Spain from 2007 to 2013.6
We analyze GDP, tradable and nontradable output, and bond spreads during the event.
    We construct data series for tradable and nontradable output based on the sectoral ev-
idence in Section 2. We define tradable output as the sum of the value added output for
two-digit sectors that have an export share greater than or equal to 10%, which corresponds
to about the median share across 62 two-digit sectors. Nontradable output is the sum of
the output for the rest (those under 10%). We deflate the nominal output series with the
GDP deflator and detrend the annual time series for GDP, tradable output, and nontradable
output by logging the series and filtering with the Hodrick-Prescott filter, using a smoothing
parameter of 100.
    We conduct the numerical experiment in the model with a procedure similar to the
impulse responses. We simulated 3000 paths for 300 periods. We use the resulting limiting
distribution of capital, debt, and productivity shocks in period 300 as the initial condition for
the event. We then feed in a path of shocks such that the conditional mean aggregate output
of the model reproduces the path of Spanish GDP from 2004 to 2013.7 The shocks during
the event are parallel deviations across all the 3000 paths. For reference, we also conduct the
event study for the no-default reference model, where in each period we feed in the average
productivity shocks recovered from the benchmark model.
    We focus on the peak-to-trough dynamics of GDP and the government spread, as well as
tradable and nontradable output. Table 3 reports the difference in the time series between
2007 and 2013, with the corresponding levels of these two years for the data and the models.
In the data, GDP declines by 9.6%, varying from 5.5% above trend to 4.4% below trend.
The nontradable output has a similar magnitude of decline in this period, whereas tradable
output declines much less, only 6%. In 2013, nontradable output is about 6% below trend
and tradable output is only 1.4% below trend. As for most crises, Spain’s spread increases,
climbing from an initial value of almost 0%, and reaching a final value of 2.7% in 2013.
    By construction, our benchmark model aims at matching the dynamics of GDP during
this episode and thus generates the sizable decline of GDP as in the data. The government

   6
       GDP reaches a trough in 2013; however, the spread peaks in 2012, with a value of 4.2%.
   7
       We choose 2004 as a start year because Spain’s GDP in that year is close to the trend.

                                                     24
spread increases by 3%, rising from a level close to 0%. The model also successfully generates
the observed decline in both tradable and nontradable output, 6.8% and 10.1% respectively.
In addition, the benchmark model matches the levels in the peak, 3.3 for tradable and 4.3 for
nontradable. We overshoot the decline in the tradable output, -3.5 for the model but -1.4 for
the data. Nonetheless, as in the data, the nontradable sector suffers more than the tradable
one.
    To explore the role of default risk, we contrast with the no-default model. Because of
the TFP shock, the no-default model exhibits a bust as well, but with a smaller decline in
GDP, about -6.8%. It is obvious that this model cannot produce any movement in spread.
Most important, opposite to the data and the benchmark model, the tradable sector has a
larger decline than the nontradable sector: -7.5% versus -6.2%. The reason is because the
nontradable sector has a smaller boom in 2007, 3.7%, and a smaller bust in 2013 in the
no-default model, only -2.4%.
    We also consider the implications of the model for the real exchange rate. In the data,
the real exchange rate in 2007 is around its trend. It depreciates by 2.5% in 2008, then
appreciates and comes back to the trend by 2013. The average depreciation relative to 2007
is about 1.1%. Our benchmark model has a similar pattern, about 0% in 2007, reaching the
peak in 2008 about 2.8%, and appreciating afterward. The average depreciation relative to
2007 in the benchmark model is 2.4%. In contrast, the no-default model implies an almost
zero average depreciation.
    Finally, we are interested in the persistence of the recession. After 2013, we let TFP follow
the underlying AR(1) shock process from the model. As shown in Figure 7, the productivity
returns to the mean by 2040. With capital, the no-default model generates a slower recovery
than TFP: it is still 1% below the trend in 2040. With financial frictions, the benchmark
model takes longer to build up capital and generates an even slower recovery, still 2% below
the trend in 2040.


5    Conclusion
We have developed a theory of sovereign debt crises affecting differentially traded and non-
traded sector production that replicates the sectoral data of Spain. In the data, the sovereign
debt crisis was accompanied by a large and persistent recession with nontraded sectors declin-
ing by more than traded sectors. In the model, these observations arise as the endogenous
response to tight financial conditions and high bond spreads. An adverse domestic shock
increases the likelihood of default and bond spreads. The economy responds by reducing

investment and reallocating capital toward the traded sector to support debt payments. The
recession is persistent because the low investment keeps financial conditions tight.
    The connection between sovereign debt crises and production is a major open question
for macroeconomics. This paper contributes to this literature by making sovereign credit
market conditions directly affect private borrowing rates for investment. Arellano et al.
(2017) document the spillover from the sovereign to the private financial conditions using
firm-level data. Consistent with this paper, they find that these spillovers were important
during the European debt crisis. We think that an important area for future work is to
understand the details and channels for financial and fiscal links between sovereign debt
crises and production.

A     Computation
We compute the sovereign’s problem in Section 3.1 using value function iteration. For periods
with financial markets access, the state space is given by (z, k, b), whereas during default it
is (z, k). We discretize the AR(1) process for the z shock using 21 equally spaced grid points
                                                                      p
over ±3 standard deviations of the ergodic distribution LN (0, σ 2 / 1 − ρ2 ). For the bonds
we use a grid with 72 equally spaced points on b ∈ [0, 0.45] and for capital we use a grid with
72 equally spaced points on k ∈ [2.25, 3.25]. The capital is expressed in units of the CES
composite, whereas debt is in terms of tradable commodity units. For reference, the mean
GDP level, expressed in tradable units, is 2.35, out of which yT = 1.0 is the mean output
level in the tradable goods sector and the rest is contributed by pN yN .
    The sovereign makes investment/asset decisions b0 and k 0 for next period (k 0 only, if in
default). We restrict these choice variables to be on the grid. Then, for every (z, k, b) point
in the state space and for every possible asset choices (k 0 , b0 ), we solve for the domestic
allocation:

  1. Solve for the quantity of capital employed in the tradables sector, kT , as the root of
     equation
                                                    −1/η
                     1 − θ zkT αT + q(b0 , z)b0 − b         αN (k − kT )αN −1
                          
                                                          =                   .
                       θ         z(k − kT )αN                  αT kT αT −1

  2. Compute the mix of inputs in the CES composite for consumption and investment:

                                  cT   xT   zkTαT + q(b0 , z)b0 − b
                                     =    =                         .
                                  cN   xN       z(k − kT )αN

  3. Use the level of investment to determine the levels of xT and xN , given their ratio found
     in the previous step (a system of two equations in two unknowns):
                                                 h                            iη/(η−1)
                                                          (η−1)/η     (η−1)/η
                k 0 − (1 − δ)k + Ψ(k 0 , k) = I = (1 − θ)xT       + θxN                .


  4. Use the resource constraint in each sector to determine cT and cN as residuals, and
     compute the CES aggregate C.

    During default, the same equations characterize the domestic allocation, with the addi-
tional constraint that b0 = 0 and TFP is zd ≤ z.
    We use a one-loop algorithm in which we update the value functions and the bond price
schedule each iteration. We stop when changes in all the value functions and the bond price
schedule do not exceed 1.0e-5.

C       Decentralization
In this appendix we describe the decentralization of the benchmark model. We start char-
acterizing the optimality conditions of the centralized model described in the paper. The
state of the country is given by S = (h, s) with s = (z, k, b) and h denoting which regime the
country is in, h = 0 normal regime and h = 1 default regime.

Characterization of the centralized problem The solution of the centralized model
includes allocations {cT , cN , xT , xN , kT , k 0 , x, b0 }, all as a function of the state S. They
satisfy the resource constraints (1), (7), (8), the capital accumulation (3), and the following
equations:

C.1     Decentralized model
We assume the government imposes capital control and only itself can choose international
borrowing and lending. The government makes the default decision. The government also
imposes capital tax τk and lump-sum transfer T to implement the centralized allocations.
The private sectors choose consumption and investment.

Consumer’s problem Consumers take as given the government’s policy functions τk (S),
T (S), d(S), and b0 (S), market prices, and dividend as given and choose tradable and non-
tradable consumption and investment to maximize their lifetime value,

Tradable firm’s problem All firms are competitive. Thus, tradable firms rent kT to
equate the marginal product of capital with the rental cost,

                                             ẑ(S)f 0 (kT ) = RK (S).

Note that the firm’s productivity depends on the aggregate state, in particular the govern-
ment’s default policy. When the government is in the normal regime h = 0 and chooses not
to default, d(S) = 0, ẑ(S) = z; otherwise, ẑ(S) = z d (z).

tionally. The government’s policy includes d, b0 , τk , T . The government chooses whether or
not to default:

C.2     Equivalence
Proposition 1. With tax function τk (0, s) from equation (37) and τk (1, s) = 0, the allocations
in the decentralized equilibrium in Section C.1 solve the centralized problem in Section 3.

Proof. Let us first consider the unconstrained problem of the government, that is, the prob-
lem of (35), (36), and, 38) without the implementability conditions. It is easy to see that the
optimization coincides with the centralized problem. In particular, the solution can be char-
acterized with equations (21)-(25). These are the same as the implementability conditions
under the tax system of τk . Thus, the constrained problem with implementability conditions
is the same as the unconstrained problem and the same as the centralized problem. Q.E.D.
