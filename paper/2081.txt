       The Export Performance of Swedish and U.S. Multinationals




                                ABSTRACT



     While the U.S. and Sweden both lost more than 20 per cent of their shares
of world and developed countries' exports of manufactures over the 15 years or
so after the mid-1960's, the export shares of their multinational firms stayed
fairly stable or even increased. The multinationals, while first increasing
and then holding fairly constant their shares of exports by their home
countries, raised the proportion of their worldwide exports that they supplied
from their overseas affiliates. These developments suggest that the declining
trade shares of the U.S. and Sweden were not due mainly to deterioration in
the innovatjveness or inventiveness of American and Swedish firms or declines
in their management ability or in their technological capabilities, but rather
to economic developments in the firms' home countries.

     The finding that firms have done better as exporters than their home
countries is strengthened when we look at different industry groups. In both
the U.S. and Sweden, and in all industry groups, with one exception, the
multinationals' export shares increased relative to those of their home
countries. The margins were often wide, and were mostly larger for Swedish
firms than for U.S. firms.

      In general, though the basic story was quite similar for the U.S. and
Sweden, there were some notable differences. One was that the share of exports
originating in affiliates was lower for Sweden than for the U.S. To a large
extent, this difference in the siting of export production reflected the much
greater export orientation of Swedish parents relative to U.S. parents, presu-
mably a consequence of the relatively small size of the Swedish domestic
market. Another difference between U.S. and Swedish multInationals was that
while the U.S. firms' share in world manufacturing exports remained stable
over the studied period, the Swedish firms' share rose by 14 per cent. We are
so far not in a position to say whether this was because Swedish firms
increased their competitiveness more than U.S. firms or because there was a
higher conversion of Swedish firms into multinational status.

 Introduction

     Most governments worry about the competitiveness of their economies, and

Sweden and the U.S. are no exceptions, particularly since they have both gone

through episodes in which their shares in world trade have declined sharply.

Trade theory traditionally assigns the responsibility for such changes to

macroeconomic developments such as inflationary monetary policy or expansive

fiscal policy. There is also another strand of literature that attributes

these changes to more "structural" characteristics of an economy, in the sense

that they are more deeply imbedded and long-term, and not subject to manipula-

tion by macroeconomic policy. These include the income elasticity of demand

for the country's products and changes in the productivity of the country and

its firms relative to that of their competitors. Some recent discussions of

U.S. trade problems have emphasized factors of the second type, in particular

supposed changes in the character of U.S. firms, such as deteriorations in

the provision of data from the direct investment surveys of the IUI, of their
hospitality during a series of visits to Sweden by Robert Lipsey and of
assistance by Kerstin Wennberg in the use of their data. Magnus Blomström's
work on this project was done while he was a member of the staff of the IUI.

their innovativeness or inventiveness, in their management abilities, and -in

their   technological capabilities (See e.g. Abernathy et al., 1983, and

Thurow, 1985).

     This last type of competitive factor has been given a somewhat different

role in recent literature on direct investment. These are the elements of the

competitiveness and comparative advantage of individual firms that enable them

to produce outside their own countries in competition with local firms that

presumably have the advantage of knowledge of local markets and the favor of

local consumers and governments. Thus, these elements of competitiveness and

comparative advantage are treated in the literature on multinationals as

belonging to firms rather than countries, and as being readily transferable by

firms from country to country within the firm (See e.g. Dunning, 1981). The

more transferable these attributes are geographically, the less they can be

the basis for national competitiveness and comparative advantage.

     An implication for national trade policy is that factors that contribute

to firm competitiveness and comparative advantage will not necessarily contri-

bute to national competitiveness and comparative advantage. Subsidies to

R & 0, to innovation, or to management or technical training may enhance the

competitiveness of national firms in world markets, but that competitiveness

may be exploited by producing outside the home country.

     A corresponding implication is that the factors producing firm com-

parative advantages should be studied by examining measures of the com-

petitiveness and comparative advantage of firms rather than that of their home

countries. And any large difference between the trade performance of a country

and that of the firms based in it helps us to determine whether the respon-
                                        -3—


sibility for changes lies with macroeconomic policy or with the determinants

of firm advantages such as management or technology.

    A simple illustration of this distinction and of the pattern of

ownership and location of production expected from it is presented in the

diagram below for the U.S. and Sweden alone. Country comparative advantage

is shown on the horizontal axis, and company comparative advantage on the

vertical axis, and the arrows show increasing comparative advantage.

The combination of U.S. country and U.S. company comparative advantage

results in home production by U.S. companies while the combination of

Swedish country and company comparative advantage results in home produc-

tion by Swedish companies. The combination of U.S. company comparative

advantage with a location advantage for Sweden as a country results in pro-

duction in Sweden by U.S.-owned companies while the combination of Swedish

company comparative advantage with location advantage for the U.S. results

in production in the U.S. by Swedish companies. The location advantage
                                   -4-

might rest on factor abundance or prices or on access to that country's

market or closeness to other markets.

     There are various ways we could observe U.S. and Swedish competitiveness

and comparative advantage and those of their firms, and compare them with

those of the world as a whole or of particular countries. We could compare

U.S. and Swedish shares in world production or exports, shares of the two

countries as exporters to particular markets, or shares of U.S. and Swedish

firms as producers in or exporters from individual country markets. In the

last case, we could be comparing the two countries' firms, holding constant

the characteristics of the country in which the production is located.

     In this paper we have concentrated on competition on the world market and

comparisons with the world as a whole and developed countries as a group. And

we have measured competitiveness and comparative advantage by exports rather

than by production.

     The main advantage of using exports rather than production for this pur-

pose is that exports are somewhat more footloose. A country has more power to

determine which producers supply its home market than which supply export

markets. We suspect, therefore, that shares in export markets represent the

underlying advantages of firms to a greater degree than do shares in domestic

markets.

     That is not to say that export markets are unaffected by government

interventions or other non-economic factors. There have been many complaints

in the U.S. about export requirements and subsidies imposed on or offered to

U.S. affiliates, especially in developing countries. It is more that these

export promoting policies are circumscribed by the ability of companies to
                                  —5—

move their export production to other locations, if the policies impose too

 large costs on them, and by the watchfulness of other countries over their

home and export markets.

     Ideally, we should examine a variety of measures of firms'

competitiveness. A drawback of the export measure is that it ignores differen-

ces in the tradability of products. The skills of U.S. food companies in

advertising and promotion that enable them to operate in many countries are

probably undervalued by this measure because the products are traded very

little. Measures of production, consumption, or employment shares might

reflect some of these advantages better but have drawbacks of their own,

including greater difficulty in assembling comparable data and the greater

susceptibility of production for the host-country market to manipulation by

government interventions.

     There are several advantages of using the U.S. and Sweden for comparative

study. The two countries are similar in several respects. Both are highly

industrialized and are homes to major multinational firms. In both countries,

these firms account for large shares of manufacturing industry and trade.

Furthermore, the trade of both countries is biased toward high R & 0

industries. Finally, both countries provide us with comprehensive data on the

activities of their multinationals.1

     There are also some major differences between the U.S. and Sweden that

should be noted. Swedish firms are typically smaller when they venture abroad

for the first time than are American firms, Swedish multinationals supply

their foreign markets from their home production to a much greater extent than


                 U.S. direct investment abroad are mainly from the 1957, 1966,
1977, and 1982 surveys of U.S. multinational enterprises (U.S. Department of
Commerce, 1960, 1975, 1981, and 1985). The data on Swedish foreign investment
come from the Industriens Utredningsinstitut (IUI) of Stockholm and have been

do U.S. multinationals, and import very little from their foreign manufac-

turing operations (Swedenborg, 1979, Chapter 3). Some of these differences

reflect the fact that the Swedish home market is so much smaller than the U.S.

market--no more than 3 or 4 per cent in population or income. There are also

substantial differences between Sweden and the U.S. with respect to policy

towards multinationals. The Swedish government has regulated both outward and

inward foreign investment much more directly than the U.S. government. In

particular, Swedish firms have been prohibited since the early 1970s from

financing their foreign subsidiaries with Swedish capital. No similar regula-

tions have governed U.S. firms for most of the period.

     The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. First we examine the

international competitiveness of the U.S. and Sweden and of their firms for

manufacturing industries as a whole and then for broad industry groups. We

continue by characterizing the comparative advantages of U.S. and Sweden and

of U.S. and Swedish multinationals and analyze changes in these comparative

advantages. Finally, we discuss some implications of our findings.




analyzed in a series of volumes by Birgitta Swedenborg (1973, 1979, and 1982).
The IUI has completed four surveys of Swedish multinationals covering 1965,
1970, 1974, and 1978. In general, the surveys are comparable, but there -is a
difference in the definition of a multinational enterprise which should be
mentioned. In the Swedish data, parents must have majority-owned production
affiliates abroad in order to be included in the sample. The U.S. surveys, on
the other hand, use a broader definition, including also firms with only
minority interests and/or sales affiliates abroad. For 1970, when information
based on the broader definition is available also for Sweden, the firms
excluded by the narrower definition accounted for some 25 per cent of exports
from Sweden by Swedish parent firms. This means that we understate the role
of multinationals in Swedish exports as compared with that of U.S. multina-
tionals in U.S. exports. And -if there was a shift among Swedish firms from
having only sales affiliates abroad into production abroad, it would
exaggerate the rise in export shares of Swedish multinationals, as compared
with U.S. multinationals.

 The International Competitiveness of the U.S. and Sweden and of Their Firms

     The U.S. and Sweden both declined in competitiveness from the mid-1960's

 to the early 1980's, if we define competitiveness as shares of world or deve-

 loped country exports.2 Swedish export shares declined by about 26 - 29 per

 cent between 1965 and 1982, while the U.S. shares fell by 15 - 19 per cent

over the same period.

There was a temporary reversal of the decline in the case of the U.S. between

1978 and 1982, but none for Sweden. One can think of these declines as

reflecting to a large extent, the declines of Swedish and U.S. shares of world

output. The Swedish share of output fell by almost 20 per cent relative to

reasons (see Lipsey, 1984). However, for our purpose here of comparing the
performance of countries and their firms, we think it is a reasonable approxi-
mation.

from 1965 to 1980, while the U.S. shares fell by 22 and 16 per cent.

    In contrast to the decline in country competitiveness, the shares in

world exports of firms based in the two countries fell by much less and the

shares of their multinational firms stayed fairly steady or even increased.

    U.S. multinationals' share in world exports was virtually unchanged over

16 years while the U.S. share fell by 18 per cent. Swedish multinationals'

share rose by 14 per cent in 13 years while the share of Sweden itself fell by

nationals, but it was smaller than that for Sweden.

    A change in the share of multinationals can take place in two ways. One is

a shift of firms into or out of multinational status. The other is a change in

the competitiveness of those firms that are initially multinational and remain

so. The population of U.S. parent firms was stable, or even declined slightly

between 1966 and 1977, and then declined substantially between 1977 and 1982

(Lipsey and Kravis, 1986, Table U-b). Thus, for the U.S., the stability or

rise in the competitiveness of multinationals was not the result of a movement

into multinational operations by firms that had not been multinational before.

    For Sweden, the story is not so clear. The number of Swedish firms with

production affiliates abroad rose from 82 in 1966 to 118 in 1978 (Swedenborg,

1982, Table 3,2, p. 38). Of these, 47 were in the group continuously. Another

17 disappeared, but in effect remained because they were merged into other

firms in the multinational group. There were about 40 genuine disappearances

and 94 new entrants to the multinational class, a number that suggests the

possibility that the aggregate was substantially affected by the conversion of

firms to multinational status.

    That question can be at least partially resolved by comparing these

measures of competitiveness for all Swedish multinationals with corresponding

ones for a fixed group of the largest multinationals:

From these data it appears that changes in the status of firms do not account

for the rising share of multinationals. The stability or rise in com-

petitiveness for the fixed panel of 28 firms is similar to the trend for all

Swedish multinationals, partly because these 28 are the larger firms. The

trend for these 28 firms may tend to be tilted upward because they have

absorbed other multinationals during the period, but it is diluted, on the

other hand, by the absorption of non—multinational firms. We cannot say,

therefore, without a more detailed study, whether mergers raise or lower the

trend for these firms.

   The similarity in the experience of Swedish and U.S. multinationals extends

to the shares of home-country exports. These rose in both countries from the

mid—1960's to the late 1970's. The 28—firm data for Sweden show a continuation

of that rise through 1983, but the aggregate data for the U.S. show a decline

from 1977 to 1982 and 1983.

    The apparent decline in the share of multinationals in U.S. exports

reflects, to some degree, changes in the list of multinational firms. The cutoff

point below which full data for affiliates did not have to be reported was

increased from $500,000 in 1977 to $3 million in 1982. Any parent firm with no

affiliates above the cutoff size was exempt from reporting. Therefore, there

may have been some illusory reduction in the list of parent firms. However,

there was also some real movement of firms away from overseas activity, and we

are not sure at this point how much of the apparent decline in participation

in overseas activity is real and how much is an artifact of the change in

reporting requirements.

    Another parallel between the Swedish and U.S. multinationals is the rise

in shares of world exports accounted for by their affiliates. That share

increased rapidly until at least the mid—1970's in both countries. There was

some slowdown in the 1974-78 period in Sweden and no change for U.S. majority-

owned affiliates between 1977 and 1982.

    This rapid rise in the affiliates' share of world trade while that of the

multinationals as a whole was increasing slowly or holding steady implies that

multinationals in both countries were shifting their production for export,

in percentage terms, from their home countries to the host countries in which

their affiliates were operating.

     Among U.S. multinationals, there was a large shift toward exporting from

affiliates between 1966 and 1977 but little change in the next five years.

The shift to exporting from foreign affiliate production rather than from home

production was even stronger for Swedish firms than for U.S. firms, but it

started from a much lower base. The share of multinational firm exports coming

from affiliates was much lower throughout the period for Swedish firms,

starting from a quarter of the U.S. share in 1965. The lower ratio for

Swedish firms was not primarily the result of a greater export orientation of

U.S. affiliates than of Swedish affiliates, although the U.S. affiliates were

somewhat more export oriented (exports were 31 per cent of U.S. affiliates'

sales in 1977 as compared to 24 per cent for Swedish affiliates in 1978). The

explanation is to be found in the greater export orientation of Swedish

parents than of U.S. parents. Over 50 per cent of Swedish parents' sales were

exported in 1978, while U.S. parents exported less than 10 per cent of their

sales in 1977. This divergence between the Swedish and U.S. parents appears

despite the omission from the Swedish data of parents with only sales affi-

liates abroad. This difference may be one explanation of the high share of

Swedish foreign investment in "marketing activities" that was reported in

Eliasson et al. (1985). However, the increase in affiliate shares of Swedish

multinationals' exports was notable: an 84 per cent jump for Swedish multina-

tionals as a group and almost a doubling among the 28 large firms.

Competitiveness Within Industry Groups

     The declines in the competitiveness of the U.S. and Sweden, as mani-

fested in their falling shares of world exports during the decade or so

ending in the late 1970's, were reflected in similar declines within broad

industry groups.


    3See also the discussion in Swedenborg (1979, Chapter 3). The share of
affiliates in exports of Swedish multinationals would have been even lower if
it had been measured on the U.S. definition, as mentioned above.

Overall, the competitiveness of Swedish manufacturing declined a little less

during that decade than that of the U.S., and much less in chemicals (where it

actually increased), metals, and electrical machinery. The roughly equivalent

performance in manufactured goods as a whole suggests, as will be discussed

later, that U.S. comparative advantage was tilted more than that of Sweden

towards industries growing faster in world trade.

     The performance of both countries looks somewhat more favorable com-

pared with that of developed countries than in comparison with all market

economies, because the developing countries were expanding their exports of

manufactures more rapidly than the developed ones. That was the case par-

ticularly for electrical machinery and other manufacturing. Relative to deve—
                                  — 15 —




loped countries, Sweden's share in chemicals exports rose by four percentage

points and it fell by only six percentage points in metals and electrical

machinery, the "best" performing Swedish industries in this sense. In the

case of the U.S. it was the two machinery industries that held their shares

best in most comparisons and the metals industries that fared the worst. The

extension of the U.S. data to 1982 produced an improvement for the U.S. not

only overall but also in most industry groups.

     Our main interest in these country competitiveness measures is in the

comparison with those for the two countries' multinational firms, shown

below. As was pointed out earlier, U.S.-based multinationals' shares in

world manufacturing exports were essentially stable while the Swedish

multinationals' shares increased. However, the U.S. multinationals' shares

probably come closer to representing the competitiveness of a fixed or even

declining group of firms; the rising share of Swedish-based firms may include

some effects of shifts into multinational status by Swedish firms.

     The industry group in which U.S.-multinationals' share declined substan-

tially relative to the world and to developed countries was transport equip-

ment, especially in the longer span to 1982. Over that period, when the U.S.

as a country lost as much as a third of its market share in a couple of

industry groups and some share in all of them, U.S. multinationals increased

their shares relative to developed countries in three of the groups by five

percent or more, held their share within three per cent in another, and lost

almost 20 per cent in only one group. Swedish multinationals gained strongly

relative to the world and to other developed countries in five groups

(although from extremely low initial shares of under one half of one per cent
                                     — 17   —




 in   two of them) and lost only in the machinery industries, the groups in which

 their shares were initially largest.

       We can compare the changes in competitiveness of each country's

multinationals with those of their home countries by taking ratios of

changes in multinationals' shares to the changes in shares of the countries

 in which they are based. In both countries, and in all the industry groups,

with one exception, the multinational firms' export shares increased rela-

tive to those of their home countries. The margins were often wide, and were

mostly larger for Swedish firms than for U.S. firms. The exceptions were

chemicals, metals and machinery. In the case of metals, Swedish multina-

tionals gained in export share while U.S. firms lost, and both countries lost
                                     — 18   -




 export   shares, but the decline for the U.S. as a country was so much greater

 than that for Sweden that the margin over the home country was larger for U.S.

 firms. In the case of machinery, U.S. and Swedish firms lost shares by simi-

 lar amounts but the U.S. as a country lost market share more severely than

 Sweden did.

      In general, multinationals from both Sweden and the U.S. fared better

 than their home countries in just about every industry group. The margins

tended to be largest in groups where the home countries' shares fell the

most, although that was not universal. The changes in multinationals'

shares tended to be smaller than those in home-country shares, perhaps

because the multinationals had the flexibility to shift production from

higher-cost or increasing-cost locations to cheaper ones.

The Comparative Advantage of U.S. and Swedish Multinationals

     We can characterize the comparative advantages of U.S. and Swedish multina-

tionals relative to each other and to their home countries by the distributions

of their exports. We cannot compare them with multinationals based in other

countries on the basis of exports because the data are not available, but we

can compare them with other multinationals on the basis of their activities in

Sweden and in the U.S. In this section we ask three questions. First, what corn-

parative advantages distinguish U.S. multinationals from Swedish ones? The

second question is, what are the comparative advantages of Swedish and U.S.

multinationals relative to their own countries? That is, what distinguishes

them from other firms of the same nationality? Finally, what comparative advan-

tages do U.S. and Swedish multinationals have relative to multinationals from

other countries?

      We   can compare the industry distribution of Swedish and U.S. multina-

 tionals' exports for 1977 and 1978, the closest pair of years for which both

 countries' data are available.

U.S. multinationals appear to have had a relatively stronger position in the

food, chemical, and motor vehicle industries, while Swedish multinationals

were oriented more towards metals industries and other manufacturing, the

latter group including the traditional Swedish wood and paper and related

industries.4

     To some extent, this comparison reflects the differing comparative advan-

tages of the home countries for two reasons. One is that the firms do have

large parts of their operations in their home countries, perhaps for political

or historical reasons, and exports from home production are included here. A

second is that the firm comparative advantages that are carried to foreign

countries may reflect current or past home-country comparative advantages

because the firms have absorbed these through learning-by-doing.


    41n order to be placed in a specific industry, a Swedish multinational
must have at least 60 per cent of its total sales in that industry. Swedish
parents that do not fulfill this requirement are classified as "mixed firms"
and are included in "other manufacturing." This means that we overstate the
Swedish multinationals' position in other manufacturing by some 4 to 5 percen—

     That the countries differ a good deal in their comparative advantages

 is indicated by their export patterns. In particular, the U.S., as a

country, relative to Sweden, seems to have comparative advantages in foods,

chemicals, and transport equipment, and Sweden in metals and other manufac-

turing. However, the two countries' machinery industries both account for

roughly 30 per cent of manufactured exports, about two thirds non-electrical

machinery and one third electrical machinery. Some of the differences between

the two sets of multinationals thus seem to reflect the country differences.

     Another way of looking at the comparative advantages of the two

countries' firms is to compare U.S. multinationals' comparative advantage

relative to the U.S. as a country with Swedish firms' comparative advantage

relative to Sweden. In other words, in which industries do U.S. and Swedish

multinationals have comparative advantages beyond what they draw from their

national origins?

Both countries' multinational firms seem to possess some comparative advantage

relative to their home countries in transport equipment and electrical

machinery and equipment, and comparative disadvantages in foods and other

manufacturing. There were some contrasts between the two countries. U.S., but

not Swedish, multinationals appeared to have some comparative advantage over

their home countries in chemicals and some comparative disadvantage in metals

and non-electrical machinery.

     We have two sets of observations on the comparative advantage of U.S. and

Swedish multinationals relative to those of other countries. One is a com-

parison between the operations in the U.S. of Swedish multinationals and those

from other countries. The second is a comparison between the operations of U.S.

and non-U.S. multinationals in Sweden.

     The most distinctive characteristic of Swedish-owned manufacturing

enterprises in the U.S. was their extreme concentration in the machinery

industry. Almost three quarters of the sales of Swedish-owned manufacturing

enterprises in the U.S. were in that group in 1980, as compared with about a
                                     — 22 —




 fifth   for all foreign affiliates and all affiliates from developed countries

 (Appendix Table S-b). Most of the other Swedish affiliate sales were in metals,

a little below the average share, and in other manufacturing, far below the

average. Concentration on machinery was a little lower measured by employment

and considerably lower, but still high, measured by assets (Appendix Tables S-8

and S-9). The degree of concentration was not only high for the machinery

industry; it was high for any industry. The highest degree of concentration in

an industry other than machinery was Germany's in chemicals, at about 60 per

cent. Most of. the industry concentrations were a third or less of any country's

total direct investment assets.

     Another way of describing the strength of Swedish firms' concentration on

machinery among their direct investments in the U.S. is that it was 3 1/2

times that of all countries' firms combined. That was a much larger deviation

from the world pattern than that of Germany in chemicals, which was a little

more than twice the world average. The other side of this concentration was

that the shares of Swedish—owned affiliate sales in industry groups other than

machinery were far below the world averages. The share of Swedish affiliate

sales that were in the food products and chemicals industries in particular

was extremely low, under 5 per cent as compared with over 40 per cent for all

countries combined.

     U.S. multinationals in Sweden were also heavily concentrated in the machi-

nery industry, particularly non—electrical machinery. Almost 40 per cent of

their sales were in that group in 1970, as compared with only 5 per cent for

foreign affiliates based in other countries (Appendix Table S-17). Compared to

the other foreign-owned manufacturing affiliates in Sweden, U.S. firms were also
                                     — 23 —




stronger    in chemicals but weaker in foods, electrical machinery, and other manu-

facturing. In transport equipment, there is no foreign participation at all in

the Swedish market. Foreign firms -in this industry do not seem to possess enough

competitive strength to compete with Swedish firms on the latter's home market.

     Since Samuelsson (1977) provides data on shares in Swedish output for 126

5—digit SNI industries in 1970, we can attempt to distinguish between the

industry characteristics associated with high U.S. shares and those associated

with high shares of non-U.S. multinationals to discover what factors underlie

U.S. multinationals' comparative advantages relative to multinationals from

other countries aside from Sweden. We relate U.S. and other multinationals'

shares to three industry characteristics: ratios of technical and sales

employment to total employment as measures of the skill or technical intensity,

and the marketing intensity of the industry and the average value added per

establishment, as an indicator of scale economies.

     The equations suggest that skill intensity or technical complexity was

 more important for U.S. multinationals than for those from other countries.

 Sales effort or marketing intensity, on the other hand, was important for

 non-U.S. multinationals but not at all for those from the U.S. Our indicator

of the existence of economies of scale in an industry was significant only for

U.S. firms.

    These results suggest that the comparative advantage of U.S. firms, as

compared to those of other countries, is based on high skill intensity or

technical complexity and on economies of scale. The comparative advantage of

non-U.S. multinationals is based partly on the same technical characteristics

but more strongly on sales effort or marketing intensity.

Comparative AdvantaQe, Growth in Demand, and Overall Competitiveness

     Changes in the overall competitiveness of countries and their multinatio-

nals can be thought of as consisting of several elements. One is changes in

their competitiveness within industries. A second is their comparative advan-

tage, which determines the extent to which they produce and export in each

industry. The third is the rate at which world trade grows in each industry.

We have examined the first two factors in the preceding sections. Here we take

up the last link in the chain.

     Whatever the period chosen for measuring growth rates, the two industry

groups with the fastest rates of export growth are electrical machinery and

transport equipment, followed by chemicals. Non—electrical machinery exports

grew at close to the average rate, and the whole machinery group at somewhat

above the average. Other manufacturing grew at a below average rate, and foods

and metals at the lowest rates, far below the average.

     For both Sweden and the U.S., the distribution of exports in 1965 was

oriented towards industries that enjoyed above-average export growth in the

next 13 years. If their exports in each industry had grown in the next 13 years

at the world average rate, Swedish exports in 1978 would have been 7.5 times

their 1965 value and U.S. exports 7.6 times the initial value, as compared

with a world multiple of 735 In fact, Swedish exports in 1978 were only 5.7

times the 1965 level, and the growth in U.S. exports was even slower. Thus,

the initial comparative advantages of the two countries do not explain their

relatively slow export growth.

        The comparative advantage of Swedish multinational firms, in their world-

wide activities, was tilted a little more toward rapidly growing export

industries than that of Sweden. If the multinationals' exports had grown at

the average rate for their industries, their exports would have reached 7.7

times the 1965 level. The bias towards high export growth was strongest for

the U.S. multinationals. If they had held their 1966 shares within

industries, they would have reached almost 6 times their 1966 level by 1977,

as compared with the world average of 5.5. By 1982, the 1966 shares would have

implied exports 9.4 times the 1966 level, as compared to the actual world




highest—growth industry groups, electrical machinery and transport equipment,
Sweden had low shares of the fastest-growing subgroups, electronic equipment,
and motor vehicles, in 1965.
                                   — 27 -



 ratio   of 8.6.

     It is clear, then, that the stability in the U.S. firms' share of world

 manufactured exports was a combination of two elements: a concentration of acti-

 vity in relatively fast-growth industry groups, combined with some loss of

 ground within the groups. We can see that from the fact that the actual ratio

 for U.S. multinationals, 1977/1966, was 5.4 as compared with 5.9 they would

 have had with constant shares in each industry, and the actual ratio in

 1982/1966 was 8.6 as compared with the hypothetical ratio of over 9.4.

     The story is different for Swedish multinationals. Their share of world

exports grew faster than it would have if they had retained their 1965 shares

in each industry. The multiple for their exports was 8.4 compared with the 7.7

they would have had with constant industry shares.

    As in the earlier discussion, the problem in interpreting the Swedish

results is that we do not know what part of the high actual growth in

multinationals' exports came from the shift of individual firms into multina-

tional status, a factor we believe was not important in this period for the

U.S. multinationals' share. We will not be able to make the distinction bet-

ween the results of a shift of firms to multinationality and rising com-

petitiveness with confidence until we can examine the trends for a fixed panel

of firms.

Changes in the Comparative Advantages of the U.S. and Sweden and their Firms

     The direction of changes in country comparative advantage can be

summarized by the shifts in the proportions of exports coming from each

industry sector. Both Sweden and the U.S. were shifting the composition of

their exports towards electrical machinery, transport equipment, and chemicals

which were, as mentioned earlier, the fastest—growing sectors. In each case,

the shift was more extensive in Sweden than in the U.S. and more rapid than

the world and developed-country shift -in chemicals (from a very low initial

share) and in electrical machinery. The rest of the world was shifting more

rapidly toward transport equipment than either of the two countries, but

within that group, Sweden was moving rapidly into the fast-growing motor

vehicles subgroup.

     Swedish and U.S. multinational firms were both shifting towards chemicals

and transport equipment between the mid-1960's and the late 1970's, and both

were shifting out of metals, but while Swedish firms were shifting more

rapidly than the world or developed countries as a group, U.S. firms were

moving less quickly in this direction. Multinationals from both countries, but

especially from Sweden, were reducing their concentration in the machinery

industries.

       Finally, we may ask whether, given these changes in the industry distribu-

tion of exports, the U.S., Sweden and their firms were still, in 1977-78, more

oriented than the world towards the fast-growth industries of the previous

decade. If the composition of exports in 1965/66 had been that of 1977/78 for

the U.S., Sweden, their firms, and the world, and if the industry export

growth rates of the 1965/66 - 1977/78 period had been as they were, the

constant-share growth rates would have been as follows:

       At the end of the period, Sweden, the U.S., and their multinationals all

still had industry compositions of exports biased toward relatively fast
                                   - 30   -




 growth. Both countries' multinationals remained more biased toward export
 growth than their countries, and the U.S. and its multinationals more biased

 than Sweden and its multinationals. The margin over the world constant-share

 growth rate decreased for U.S. and Swedish multinationals and for Sweden as a

 country, but increased for the U.S. Thus, taking account of all movements into

 and out of the various industry groups, we find that the world as a whole was

 restructuring faster than Swedish and U.S. mutlinationals and Sweden as a

whole, but that the U.S. kept up with, or even a little ahead of, the rest of

the world.

Concluding Remarks

    The evidence from this study shows the importance in analyses of com-

petitiveness and comparative advantages, of taking into account the implica-

tions of the mobility of capital, technology and other factors of production

within multinationals. While the U.S. and Sweden both lost more than 20 per

cent of their shares of world and developed countries' exports of manufactures

over the 15 years or so after the mid-1960's, the export shares of their

multinational firms stayed fairly stable or even increased. The mult-ina-

tionals, while increasing their shares of home-country exports, shifted their

production for export in percentage terms from their home countries to the

host countries in which their affiliates were located. These developments

suggest that the declining competitiveness of the U.S. and Sweden was not due

mainly to deterioration in the innovativeness or inventiveness of American and

Swedish firms or declines in their management ability or in their tech-

nological capabilities. Rather, one should probably look for explanations of

declining country competitiveness in events specific to the countries, such as
                                    - 31   -




 their   macro-economic policies.

     The finding that firms have done better than their home countries is

 strengthened when we look at different industry groups. In both the U.S. and

 Sweden, and in all industry groups, with one exception, the multinationals'

 export shares increased relative to those of their home countries. The margins

were often wide, and were mostly larger for Swedish firms than for U.S. firms.

The margins in favor of the multinational firms tended to be largest in groups

where the home countries' shares fell the most, although that was not

universal. The changes in multinationals' shares of world exports tended to be

smaller than those in home country shares, perhaps because the multinationals

had the flexibility to shift production from higher-cost or increasing-cost

locations to cheaper ones.

    Part of the explanation for the growth of each country's exports and those

of its multinationals is the initial composition of exports, or the com-

parative advantages of the countries and their companies. The comparative

advantages of Sweden and the U.S. and their multinationals were skewed, in the

mid-1960's, to industries that were to enjoy rapid worldwide export growth in

the next decade or so. Despite these comparative advantages, the exports of

both countries fell far behind world export growth. The declines may be

related, to some extent, to the distribution of each country's exports within

these broad industry groups, a subject for future investigation.

    The comparative advantages of multinational firms in both countries were

biased toward fast—growth industries even more than those of the countries

themselves, and that fact partly accounted for the better export performance

of the multinationals relative to their home countries. However, the restruc-
                                     - 32   -




 turing   of the two countries' economies toward faster-growing industries moved

 more rapidly in the decade after the mid-1960's than that of the multina-

 tionals.

     In general, despite differences between the U.S. and Sweden, the basic

 story we find is quite similar. An implication for government policy, con-

 firmed here for both Sweden and the U.S., is that a country's competitiveness

 can behave very differently from that of firms that are based in the country

 but produce abroad as well. National policies aimed at improving the com-

petitiveness of a country may fail if they involve creating, or reducing the

cost of, assets that improve the competitiveness of the country's firms but

can be exploited as well by producing abroad as by producing at home. Thus,

subsidies to R & 0, to innovation, or to management or technical training

might give little encouragement to production at home if the assets created

move easily across national borders within firms.

    Aside from these similarities between the U.S. and Swedish experience,

there were also some notable differences. One was that the share of exports

originating in affiliates was lower for Sweden than for the U.S. To a large

extent, this difference in the siting of export production reflected the much

greater export orientation of Swedish parents relative to U.S. parents, presu-

niably a consequence of the relatively small size of the Swedish domestic

market.

    Another difference in performance between U.S. and Swedish multinationals

was that while the U.S. firms' share in world manufacturing exports remained

stable over the studied period, the Swedish firms' share rose by 14 per cent.

We are so far not   in a position to say   whether this was because Swedish firms
                                     — 33 —



increased their competitiveness more than U.S. firms or because there was a

higher conversion of Swedish firms into multinational status.

    It is often suggested that multinational firms are relatively immune to

controls by their home governments because they are free to move their produc-

tion from one jurisdiction to another. At least as far as export production is

concerned, this may be less true for Swedish multinationals than for U.S.

multinationals. The reason is that while almost half of the exports by U.S.

firms originate in their overseas affiliates, 80 per cent of Swedish

multinationals' exports originate in Sweden. The Swedish firms may therefore

be more vulnerable not only to home-country controls but also to changes in

home-country macroeconomic policy.
