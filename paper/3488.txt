      The Gold Standard, Deflation, and Financial Crisis in the Great
Depression: An International Comparison

      I.   Introduction

      Recent research on the causes of the Great Depression has laid

much of the blame for that catastrophe on the doorstep of the

international gold standard. In his new book, Temin (1989) argues that

structural flaws of the interwar gold standard, in conjunction with

policy responses dictated by the gold standard's "rules of the game",

made an international monetary contraction and deflation almost

inevitable. Eichengreen and Sachs (1985) have presented evidence that

countries which abandoned the gold standard and the associated

contractionary monetary policies recovered from Depression more quickly

than countries that remained on gold. Research by Hamilton (1987,1988)

supports the propositions that contractionary monetary policies in

France and the U.S. initiated the Great Slide, and that the defense of

gold standard parities added to the deflationary pressure.'

      The gold standard-based explanation of the Depression (which we

will elaborate in Section 2) is in most respects compelling. The length

and depth of the deflation during the late 1920s and early l930s

strongly suggest a monetary origin, and the close correspondence (across

both space and time) between deflation and nations' adherence to the

gold standard shows the power of that system to transmit contractionary

monetary shocks. There is also a high correlation in the data between

deflation (falling prices) and depression (falling output), as the

previous authors have noted and we will demonstrate again below.
                                                                             2


       If the argument as it has been made so far has a weak link,

however, it is probably the explanation of how the deflation induced by

the malfunctioning gold standard caused depression; that is, what was

the source of this massive monetary non-neutrality?2 The goal of our

paper is to try to understand better the mechanisms by which deflation

may have induced depression in the 1930s. We consider several channels

suggested by earlier work, in particular effects operating through real

wages and through interest rates. Our focus, however,is on a channel

of transmission that has been largely ignored by the recent gold

standard literature; namely,   the   disruptive effect of deflation on the

financial system.

      Deflation (and the constraints on central bank policy imposed by

the gold standard) was an important cause of banking panics, which

occurred in a number of countries in the early 1930s. As discussed for

the case of the U.S. by Bernanke (1983), to the extent that bank panics

interfere with normal flows of credit, they may affect the performance

of the real economy; indeed, it is possible that economic performance

may be affected even without major panics, if the banking system is

sufficiently weakened. Because severe banking panics are the form     of
financial   crisis most easily identified empirically, we will focus on

their effects in this paper. However, we don't want to lose sight of a

second potential effect of falling prices on the financial sector, which

is "debt-deflation" (Fisher 1933, Bernanke 1983, Bernanke and Gertler

1990). By increasing the real value of nominal debts and promoting

insolvency of borrowers, deflation creates an environment of financial

distress in which the incentives of borrowers are distorted, and in
                                                                           3



which it is difficult to extend new credit. Again, this provides a

means by which falling prices can have real effects.

      To examine these links between deflation and depression, we take a

comparative approach (as did Eichengreen and Sachs). Using an annual

data set covering twenty-four countries, we try to measure the

differences between (for example) countries on and off the gold

standard, or between countries experiencing banking panics and those

that did not. A weakness of our approach is that, lacking objective

indicators of the seriousness of financial problems, we are forced to

rely on dummy variables to indicate periods of crisis. Despite this

problem, we generally do find an important role for financial crises- -

particularly   banking panics- - in explaining the link between falling

prices and falling output. Countries in which, for institutional or

historical reasons, deflation led to panics or other severe banking

problems had significantly worse depressions than countries in which

banking was more stable. In addition, there may have been a feedback

loop through which banking panics, particularly those in the United

States, intensified the severity of the worldwide deflation. Because of

data problems, we do not provide direct evidence for the debt-deflation

mechanism; however, we do find that much of the apparent impact of

deflation on output is unaccounted for by the mechanisms we explicitly

consider, leaving open the possibility that debt-deflation was

important.

      The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly

recapitulates the basic case against the interwar gold standard as a

source of deflation and depression, and provides some new evidence

consistent with this view. Section 3 takes a preliminary look at some
                                                                            4



mechanisms by which deflation may have been transmitted to depression.

In Section 4 we provide an overview of the financial crises that

occurred during the interwar period. Section 5 presents and discusses

our main empirical results on the effects of financial crisis in the

l930s, and Section 6 concludes.



      2.    The Gold   Standard and Deflation

      In this section we discuss, and provide some new evidence for, the

claim that a mismanaged interwar gold standard was responsible for the

worldwide deflation of the late 1920s and early 1930s.

      The gold standard- -generally viewed at the time as an essential

source of the relative prosperity of the late nineteenth and early

twentieth centuries--was suspended at the outbreak of World War I.

Wartime suspension of the gold standard was not in itself unusual;

indeed, Bordo and Kydland (1990) have argued that wartime suspension- -

followed   by a return to gold at pre-war parities as soon as possible- -

should be considered part of the gold standard's normal operation.

Bordo and Kydland pointed out that a reputation for returning to gold at

the pre-var parity, and thus at something close to the pre-war price

level, would have made it easier for a government to sell nominal bonds

and would have increased attainable seiguorage. A credible commitment

to the gold standard thus would have had the effect of allowing war

spending to be financed at a lower total cost.

      Possibly for these reputational reasons, and certainly because of

widespread unhappiness with the chaotic monetary and financial

conditions that followed the war (there were hyperinflations in central

Europe and more moderate but still serious inflations elsewhere), the
                                                                            5



desire to return to gold in the early 1920s was strong. Of much concern

however was the perception that there was not enough gold available to

satisfy world money demands without deflation. The 1922 Economic and

Monetary Conference at Genoa addressed this issue by recommending the

adoption of a gold exchange standard, in which convertible foreign

exchange reserves (principally dollars and pounds) as well as gold would

be used to back national money supplies, thus "economizing" on gold.

Although "key currencies" had been used as reserves before the war, the

Genoa recommendations led to a more widespread and officially sanctioned

use   of   this practice (Lindert 1969; Eichengreen 1987).

       During the 1920s the vast majority of the major countries

succeeded in returning to gold. (The first column of Table 1 gives the

dates of return for the countries in our data set.) Britain returned at

the pre-var parity in 1925, despite Keynes' argument that at the old

parity the pound would be overvalued. By the end of 1925, out of a list

of 48 currencies given by the League of Nations, 28 had been pegged to

gold (Memorandum on Currency and Central Banks). France returned to

gold gradually, following the Poincare' stabilization, although at a new

parity widely believed to undervalue the franc. By the end of 1928,

except for China and a few small countries on the silver standard, only

Spain, Portugal, Rumania, and Japan had not been brought back into the

gold standard system. Rumania went back on gold in 1929, Portugal did

so in practice also in 1929 (although not officially until 1931), and

Japan in December 1930. In the same month the Bank for International

Settlements gave Spain a stabilization loan, but the operation was

frustrated by a revolution in April 1931, carried out by republicans

who- -as one of the most attractive features of their program- - oppposed
                                                                           6



the foreign stabilization credits. Spain thus did not join the

otherwise nearly universal membership of the gold standard club.

                                 [Table I about herel

      The classical gold standard of the pre-war period functioned

reasonably smoothly and without a major convertibility crisis for more

than thirty years. In contrast, the interwar gold standard, established

between 1925 and 1928, had substantially broken down by 1931 and

disappeared by 1936. An extensive literature has analyzed the

differences between the classical and interwar gold standards. This

literature has focused, with varying degrees of emphasis, both on

fundamental economic problems that complicated trade and monetary

adjustment in the interwar period and on technical problems of the

interwar gold standard itself.

      In terms of "fundamentals", Temin (1989) has emphasized the

effects of the Great War, arguing that, ultimately, the war itself was

the shock that initiated the Depression. The legacy of the war

included- -besides physical destruction, which was relatively quickly

repaired- -new political borders drawn apparently without economic

rationale; substantial overcapacity in some sectors (such as agriculture

and heavy industry) and undercapacity in others, relative to long-run

equilibriun; and reparations claims and international war debts that

generated fiscal burdens and fiscal uncertainty. Some writers (notably

Charles Kindleberger) have also pointed to the fact that the pre-war

gold standard was a hegemonic system, with Great Britain the

unquestioned center. In contrast, in the interwar period the relative

decline of Britain, the inexperience and insularity of the new potential
                                                                           7



hegemon (the United States), and ineffective cooperation among central

banks left no one able to take responsibility for the system as a whole.

      The technical problems of the interwar gold standard included:

      1) The asymmetry between surplus and deficit countries in the

required monetary response to gold flows. Temin suggests, correctly we

believe, that this was the most important structural flaw of the gold

standard. In theory, under the rules of the game", central banks of

countries experiencing gold inflows were supposed to assist the price-

specie flow mechanism by expanding domestic money supplies and

inflating, while deficit countries were supposed to reduce money

supplies and deflate. In practice, the need to avoid a complete loss of

reserves and an end to convertibility forced deficit countries to comply

with this rule; but, in contrast, no sanction prevented surplus

countries from sterilizing gold inflows and accumulating reserves

indefinitely, if domestic objectives made that desirable. Thus there

was a potential deflationary bias in the gold standard's operation.

      This asymmetry between surplus and deficit countries also existed

in the pre-war period, but with the important difference that the pre-

war gold standard centered around the operations of the Bank of England.

The Bank of England of course had to hold enough gold to ensure

convertibility, but as a profit-making institution it also had a strong

incentive not to hold large stocks of barren gold (as opposed to

interest-paying assets). Thus the Bank managed the gold standard (with

the assistance of other central banks) so as to avoid both sustained

inflows and sustained outflows of gold; and, indeed, it helped ensure

continuous convertibility with a surprisingly low level of gold

reserves. In contrast, the two major gold surplus countries of the
                                                                              8



 interwar period, the U.S. and France, had central banks with little or

 no incentive to avoid accumulation of gold.

       The deflationary bias of the asymmetry in required adjustments was

magnified by statutory fractional reserve requirements imposed on many

central banks, especially the new central banks, after the war. While

Britain, Norway, Finland, and Sweden had a fiduciary issue- -a fixed note

supply backed only by domestic government securities, above which 100%

gold backing was required- -most countries required instead that minimum

gold holdings equal a fixed fraction (usually close to the Federal

Reserve's 40%) of central bank liabilities. These rules had two

potentially harmful effects:

      First, just as required "reserves" for modern commercial banks are

not really available for use as true reserves, a large portion of

central bank gold holdings were immobilized by the reserve requirements

and could not be used to settle temporary payments imbalances. For

example, in 1929, according to the League of Nations, for 41 countries

with a total gold reserve of $9,378 million, only $2,178 million    were

"surplus" reserves, with the rest required as cover. (League of Nations

1944, 12). In fact, this overstates the quantity of truly free

reserves, because markets and central banks became very worried when

reserves fell within 10% of the minimum. The upshot of this is that

deficit countries could lose very little gold before being forced to

reduce their domestic money supplies; while, as we have noted, the

absence of any maximum reserve limit allowed surplus countries to    accept
gold inflows without inflating.

     The second and related effect of the fractional reserve

requirement has to do with the relationship between gold outflows and
                                                                           9


domestic monetary contraction. With fractional reserves, the

relationship between gold outflow and the reduction in the money supply

was not one-for-one; with a 40% reserve requirement, for example, the

impact on the money supply of a gold outflow was 2.5 times the external

loss. So again, loss of gold could lead to an immediate and sharp

deflationary impact, not balanced by inflation elsewhere.

        2)   The pyramiding of reserves. As we have noted, under the

interwar gold-exchange standard, countries other than those with reserve

currencies were encouraged to hold convertible foreign exchange reserves

as a partial (or in some cases, as a nearly complete) substitute for

gold. ut these convertible reserves were in turn usually only

fractionally backed by gold. Thus, just as a shift by the public from

fractionally backed deposits to currency would lower the total domestic

money supply, the gold-exchange system opened up the possibility that a

shift of central banks from foreign exchange reserves to gold might

lower the world money supply, adding another deflationary bias to the

system. Central banks did abandon foreign exchange reserves en masse in

the early 1930s, when the threat of devaluation made foreign exchange

assets quite risky. According to Eichengreen (1987), however, the

statistical evidence is not very clear on whether central banks after

selling their foreign exchange simply lowered their cover ratios- -which

would have had no direct effect on money supplies- -or shifted into gold

-   -which would have been contractionary. Even if the central banks

responded only by lowering cover ratios, however, this would have

increased the sensitivity of their money supplies to any subsequent

outflow of reserves.
                                                                          10



        3) InsufficIent powers of central banks. An important

institutional feature of the interwar gold standard is that, for a

majority of the important continental European central banks, open

market operations were not permitted or were severely restricted. This

limitation on central bank powers was usually the result of the

stabilization programs of the early and mid-1920s: By prohibiting

central banks from holding or dealing in significant quantities of

government securities, and thus making monetization of deficits more

difficult, the architects of the stabilizations hoped to prevent future

inflation. This forced the central banks to rely on discount policy

(the terms at which they would make loans to commercial banks) as the

principal means of affecting the domestic money supply. However, in a

number of countries the major commercial banks borrowed very

infrequently from the central banks, implying that except in crisis

periods the central bank's control over the money supply might be quite

weak.

        The loosening of the link between the domestic money supply and

central bank reserves may have been beneficial in some cases during the

1930s, if it moderated the monetary effect of reserve outflows.

However, in at least one very important case the inability of a central

bank to conduct open market operations may have been quite

destabilizing: As discussed by Eichengreen (1986), the Bank of France,

which was the recipient of massive gold inflows until 1932, was one of

the banks that was prohibited from conducting open market operations.

This severely limited the ability of the Bank to translate its gold

inflows into monetary expansion, as should have been done in obedience

to the rules of the game. The failure of France to inflate meant that
                                                                                    11



it continued to attract reserves, thus imposing deflation on the rest of

the world.3



        Given both the fundamental economic problems of the international

economy and the structural flaws of the gold standard system, even a

relatively minor deflationary impulse might have had significant

repercussions. As it happened, both of the two major gold surplus

countries--France and the U.S., who at the time together held close to

60% of the world's monetary gold- -took deflationary paths in 1928-29

(Hamilton 1987).

        In the French case, as we have already noted, the deflationary

shock took the form of a largely sterilized gold inflow. For several

reasons- - including a successful stabilization with attendant high real

interest rates, a possibly undervalued franc, the lifting of exchange

controls, and the perception that France was a safe haven' for capital

-
    -beginning   in early 1928 gold flooded into that country,   an   inflow that

was to last until 1932. In 1928, France controlled about 15% of the

total of monetary gold held by the twenty-four countries in our data set

(Board of Governors 1943); this share, already disproportionate to

France's economic importance, increased to 18% in 1929, 22% in 1930, 28%

in 1931, and 32% in 1932. Since the U.S. share of monetary gold

remained stable at something greater than 40% of the total, the inflow

to France implied significant losses of gold by countries such as

Germany, Japan, and the U.K.

        With its accumulation of gold, France should have been expected to

inflate; but in part because of the restrictions on open market

operations discussed above and in part because of deliberate policy
                                                                            12



 choices, the impact of the gold inflow on French prices was minimal.

The French monetary base did increase with the inflow of reserves, but

because economic growth led the demand for francs to expand even more

quickly, the country actually experienced a wholesale price deflation of

almost 11% between January 1929 and January 1930.

      Hamilton (1987) also documents the monetary tightening in the U.S.

in 1928, a contraction motivated in part by the desire to avoid losing

gold to the French but perhaps even more by the Federal Reserve's

determination to slow down stock market speculation. The U.S. price

level fell about 4% over the course of 1929. A business cycle peak was

reached in the U.S. in August 1929, and the stock market crashed in

October.

      The initial contractions in the U.S. and France were largely self-

inflicted wounds;   no   binding external constraint forced the U.S. to

deflate in 1929, and it would certainly have been possible for the

French government to grant the Bank of France the power to conduct

expansionary open market operations. However Temin argues that, once

these destabilizing policy measures had been taken, little could be done

to avert deflation and depression, given'-the commitment of central banks

to maintenance of the gold standard. Once the deflationary process had

begun, central banks engaged in competitive deflation and a scramble for

gold, hoping by raising cover ratios to protect their currencies against

speculative attack. Attempts by any individual central bank to reflare

were met by immediate gold outflows, which forced the central bank to

raise its discount rate and deflate once again. According to Temin,

even the U.S., with its large gold reserves, faced this constraint.

Thus Temin disagrees with the suggestion of Friedman and Schwartz (1963)
                                                                           13



that the Federal Reserve's failure to protect the U.S. money supply was

due to misunderstanding of the problem or a lack of leadership; instead,

he claims, given the commitment to the gold standard (and, presunably,

the absence of effective central bank cooperation), the Fed had little

choice but to let the banks fail and the money supply fall.

      For our purposes here it does not matter much to what extent

central bank choices could have been other than what they were. For the

positive question of what caused the Depression, we need only note that

a monetary contraction began in the U.S. and France and was propagated

throughout the world by the international monetary standard.4

      If monetary contraction propagated by the gold standard was the

source of the worldwide deflation and depression, then countries

abandoning the gold standard (or never adopting it) should have avoided

much of the deflationary pressure. This seems to have been the case.

In an important paper, Choudhri and Kochin (1980) documented that Spain,

which never restored the gold standard and allowed its exchange rate to

float, avoided the declines in prices and output that affected other

European countries. Choudhri and Kochin also showed that the

Scandinavian countries, which left gold along with the U.K. in 1931,

recovered from Depression much more quickly than other small European

countries that remained longer on the gold standard. Much of this had

been anticipated in an insightful essay by Haberler (1976).

      Eichengreen and Sachs (1985) similarly focused on the beneficial

effects of currency depreciation (i.e., abandonment of the gold standard

or devaluation). For a sample of ten European countries, they showed

that depreciating countries enjoyed faster growth of exports and

industrial production than countries which did not depreciate.
                                                                            14


 Depreciating countries also experienced lower real wages and greater

 profitability, which presumably helped to increase production.

 Eichengreen and Sachs argued that depreciation, in this context, should

 not necessarily be thought of as a "beggar-thy-neighbor" policy; because

 they reduced constraints on the growth of world money supplies,

depreciations may have conferred benefits abroad as well as at home

 (although a coordinated depreciation presumably would have been better

than the uncoordinated sequence of depreciations that in fact took

place).5

      Some additional evidence of the effects of maintaining or leaving

the gold standard, much in the spirit of Eichengreen and Sachs but using

data from a larger set of•countries, is given in our Tables 2 through 4.

These tables summarize the relationships between the decision to adhere

to the gold standard and some key macroeconomic variables, including

wholesale price inflation (Table 2), some indicators of national

monetary policies (Table 3), and industrial production growth (Table 4).

To construct these tables, we divided our sample of 24 countries6 into

four categories: 1) countries not on the gold standard at all (Spain)

or leaving prior to 1931 (Australia and New Zealand); 2) countries

abandoning the full gold standard in 1931 (14 countries); 3) countries

abandoning the gold standard between 1932 and 1935 (Rumania in 1932, the

U.S. in 1933, Italy in 1934, and Belgium in 1935); and 4) countries

still on the full gold standard as of 1936 (France, Netherlands,

Poland).7   Tables 2 and 4 give the data for each country, as well as

averages for the large cohort of countries abandoning gold in 1931, for

the remnant of the gold bloc still on gold in 1936, and (for 1932-35,

when there were a significant number of countries in each category) for
                                                                             15



all gold standard and non-gold standard countries. Since Table 3

reports data on four different variables, in order to save space only

the averages are given in that table.8

      The link between deflation and adherence to the gold standard,

shown in Table 2, seems quite clear. As noted by Choudhri and Kochin,

Spain's abstention from the gold standard insulated that country from

the general deflation; New Zealand and Australia, presumably because

they retained links to sterling despite early abandonment of the strict

gold standard, did however experience some deflation. Among countries

on the gold standard as of 1931, there is a rather uniform experience of

about a 13% deflation in both 1930 and 1931. But after 1931 there is a

sharp divergence between those countries on and those off the gold

standard. Price levels in countries off the gold standard have

stabilized by 1933 (with one or two exceptions), and these countries

experience mild inflations in 1934-36. In contrast, the gold standard

countries continue to deflate- -although at a slower rate- -until the gold

standard's dissolution in 1936.

                              [Table 2 about here]

      With such clearly divergent price behavior between countries on

and off gold, one would expect to see similarly divergent behavior in

monetary policy. Table 3 compares the average behavior of the growth

rates of three monetary aggregates, called for short MO, Ml, and M2, and

of changes in the central bank discount rate. MO corresponds to money

and notes in circulation, Ml is the sum of MO and commercial bank

deposits, and M2 is the sum of Ml and savings bank deposits.9 The

expected differences in the monetary policies of the gold and non-gold

countries seem to be in the data, although somewhat less clearly than we
                                                                           16



had anticipated: In particular, despite the twelve percentage point

difference in rates of deflation between gold and non-gold countries in

1932, the differences in average money growth in that year between the

two classes of countries are minor; possibly, higher inflation

expectations in the countries abandoning gold reduced money demand and

thus became self-confirming. In 1933 through 1935, however, the various

monetary indicators are more consistent with the conclusion stressed by

Eichengreen and Sachs, that leaving the gold standard afforded countries

more latitude to expand their money supplies and thus to escape

deflation.

                             (Table 3 about here

      The basic proposition of the gold standard-based explanation of

the Depression is that, because of its deflationary impact, adherence to

the gold standard had very adverse consequences for real activity. The

validity of this proposition is shown rather clearly by Table 4, which

gives growth rates of industrial production for the countries in our

sample. While the countries which were to abandon the gold standard in

1931 did slightly worse in 1930 and 1931 than the nations of the Gold

Bloc, subsequent to leaving gold these countries performed much better.

Between 1932 and 1935, growth of industrial production in countries not

on gold averaged about seven percentage points a year better than

countries remaining on gold- -a very substantial effect.

                              (Table 4 about here]

      In summary, data from our sample of twenty-four countries support

the view that there was a strong link between adherence to the gold

standard and the severity of both deflation and depression. The data

are also consistent with the hypothesis that increased freedom to engage
                                                                            17


in   monetary expansion was a reason for the better performance of

countries leaving the gold standard early in the 1930s, although the

evidence in this case is a bit less clearcut.



        3. The Link Between Deflation and Depression

        Given the above discussion and evidence, it seems reasonable to

accept the idea that the worldwide deflation of the early 1930s was the

result of a monetary contraction transmitted through the international

gold standard. But this raises the more difficult question of what

precisely were the channels linking deflation (falling prices) and

depression (falling output); This section takes a preliminary look at

some suggested mechanisms. We first introduce here two principal

channels emphasized in recent research, then discuss the alternative of

induced financial crisis.

        1) Real wages. If wages possess some degree of nominal rigidity,

then falling output prices will raise real wages and lower labor demand.

Downward stickiness of wages (or of other input costs) will also lower

profitability, potentially reducing investment. This channel is

stressed by Eichengreen-Sachs (see in particular their 1986 paper) and

has also been emphasized by Newell and Syinons (1988).

        Some evidence on the behavior of real wages during the Depression

is presented in our Table 5, which is similar in format to Tables 2-4.

Note that Table S uses the wholesale price index (the most widely

available price index) as the wage deflator, According to this table,

there were indeed large real wage increases in most countries in 1930

and 1931. After 1931 countries leaving the gold standard experienced a

mild decline in real wages, while real wages in gold standard countries
                                                                            18



 exhibited a mild increase. These findings are similar to those of

 Eichengreen and Sachs (1985).

                                 (Table 5 about herej

       The reliance on nominal wage stickiness to explain the real

effects of the deflation is consistent with the Keynesian tradition, but

 is nevertheless somewhat troubling in this context. Given 1) the

severity of the unemployment that was experienced during that time, 2)

the relative absence of long-term contracts and the weakness of unions,

and 3) the presumption that the general public was aware that prices and

hence the cost of living were failing, it is hard to understand how

nominal wages could have been so unresponsive. Wages had fallen quickly

in many countries in the contraction of 1921-22. In the U.S., nominal

wages were maintained until the fall of 1931 (possibly by an agreement

among large corporations; see O'Brien 1989), but fell sharply after

that; in Germany, the government actually tried to depress wages early

in the Depression. Why then do we see these large real wage increases

in the data?

      One   possibility   is measurement problems. There are a number of

issues, such as changes in skill and industrial composition, that make

measuring the cyclical movement in real wages difficult even today.

Bernanke (1986) has argued, in the U.S. context, that because of    sharp

reductions in workweeks and the presence of hoarded labor, the measured

real wage may have been a poor measure of the marginal cost of labor.

      Also in the category of measurement issues, Eichengreen and Hacton

(1987) correctly point out that nominal wages should be deflated by the

relevant product prices, not a general price index. Their table of

product wage indices (nominal wages relative to manufacturing prices) is
                                                                           19



reproduced for 1929-38 and for the five countries for which data are

available as our Table 6. Like Table 5, this table also shows real

wages increasing in the early l930s, but overall the correlation of real

wage increases and depression doesnt appear particularly good. Note

that Germany. which had probably the worst unemployment problem of any

major country, has almost no increase in real wages10; the UK. which

began to recover in 1932. has real wages increasing on a fairly steady

trend during its recovery period; and the US has only a small dip in

real wages at the beginning of its recovery, followed by more real wage

growth. The case for nominal wage stickiness as a transmission

mechanism thus seems, at this point, somewhat mixed.

                               [Table 6 about here]

      2) Real interest rates. In a standard IS-LM macro model, a

monetary contraction depresses output by shifting the Ut curve

leftwards,   raising real interest rates, and thus reducing spending.

However, as Temin (1976) pointed out in his original critique of

Friedman and Schwartz, it is real rather than nominal money balances

that affect the Ut curve; and since prices were falling sharply, real

money balances fell little or even rose during the contraction.

      Even if real money balances are essentially unchanged, however,

there is another means by which deflation can raise ex ante real

interest rates: Since cash pays zero nominal interest, in equilibrium

no asset can bear a nominal interest rate that is lower than its

liquidity and risk premia relative to cash. Thus an expected deflation

of ten per cent will impose a real rate of at least ten per cent on the

economy, even with perfectly flexible prices and wages. In an IS-Ut

diagram drawn with the nominal interest rate on the vertical axis, an
                                                                              20


 increase in expected deflation amounts to a leftward shift of the IS

 curve.

          Whether the deflation of the early 1930s was anticipated has been

 extensively debated (although almost entirely in the U.S. context). We

will add here two points in favor of the view that the extent of the

worldwide deflation was less than fully anticipated.

          First, there is the question of whether the nominal interest rate

floor was in fact binding in the deflating countries (as it should have

been if this mechanism is to operate). Although interest rates on

government debt in the U.S. often approximated zero in the 1930s, it is

less clear that this was true for other countries. The yield on French

treasury bills, for example, rose from a low of 0.75% in 1932 to 2.06%

in 1933, 2.25% in 1934, and 3.38% in 1935; during 1933-35 the nominal

yield on French treasury bills exceeded that of British treasury bills

by several hundred basis points on average)1

        Second, the view that deflation was largely anticipated must

contend with the fact that nominal returns on safe assets were very

similar in countries abandoning and staying on gold. If continuing

deflation was anticipated in the gold standard countries, while

inflation was expected in countries leaving gold, the similarity of

nominal returns would have implied large expected differences in real

returns. Such differences are possible in equilibrium, if they are

counterbalanced by expected real exchange rate changes; nevertheless

differences in expected real returns between countries on and off gold

on the order of 11-12% (the realized difference in returns between the
two   blocs   in 1932) seem unlikely)2
                                                                           21



      3. Financial crisis. A third mechanism by which deflation can

induce depression, not considered in the recent literature, works

through deflation's effect on the operation of the financial system.

The source of the non-neutrality is simply that debt instruments

(including deposits) are typically set in money terms. Deflation thus

weakens the financial positions of borrowers, both nonfinancial firms

and financial intermediaries.

      Consider first the case of intermediaries (banks).13 Bank

liabilities (primarily deposits) are almost entirely fixed in nominal

terms. On the asset side, depending on the type of banking system (see

below), banks hold either primarily debt instruments, or combinations of

debt and equity. Ownership of debt and equity is essentially equivalent

to direct ownership of capital; in this case, therefore, the bank's

liabilities are nominal and its assets are real, so that an

unanticipated deflation begins to squeeze the bank's capital position

immediately. When only debt is held as an asset, the effect of

deflation is for a while neutral or mildly beneficial to the bank.

However, when borrowers' equity cushions are exhausted, the bank becomes

the owner of its borrowers' real assets, so subsequently this type of

bank will also be squeezed by deflation.

      As pressure on the bank's capital grows, according to this

argument, its normal functioning will be impeded; for example, it may

have to call in loans or refuse new ones. Eventually, impending

exhaustion of bank capital leads to a depositors' run, which eliminates

the bank or drastically curtails its operation. The final result is

usually a government takeover of the intermediation process. For

example, a common scenario during the Depression was for the government
                                                                           22


to finance an acquisition of failing banks by issuing its own debt; this

debt was held (directly or indirectly) by consumers, in lieu of

(vanishing) commercial bank deposits. Thus, effectively, government

agencies became part of the intermediation chain.14

      Although the problems of the banks were perhaps the more dramatic

in the Depression, the same type of non-neutrality potentially affects

nonfinancial firms and other borrowers. The process of "debt

deflation", i.e., the increase in the real value of nominal debt

obligations brought about by falling prices, erodes the net worth

position of borrowers. A weakening financial position both affects the

borrower's actions (e.g.. the firm may try to conserve financial capital

by laying off workers or cutting back on investment) and also, by

worsening the agency problems in the borrower-lender relationship.

impairs access to new credit. Thus, as discussed in detail in Bernanke

and Certler (1990), "financial distress" (such as that induced by debt-

deflation) can in principle impose deadweight losses on an economy, even

if firms do not undergo liquidation.

      Before trying to assess the quantitative impact of these and other

channels on output, we briefly discuss the international incidence of

financial crisis during the Depression.



      4. Interwar Banking and Financial Crises

      Financial crises were of course a prominent feature of the

interwar period. We focus in this section on the problems of the

banking sector, and to a lesser extent on the problems of domestic

debtors in general, as suggested by the discussion above. Stock market
                                                                           23



crashes and defaults on external debt were also important, of course,

but for the sake of space will take a subsidiary role here.

      Table 7 gives a chronology of some important interwar banking

crises. The episodes listed actually cover a considerable range in

terms of severity, as the capsule descriptions should make clear.

However the chronology should also make the points that 1) quite a few

different countries experienced significant banking problems during the

interwar period, and 2) these problems reached a very sharp peak between

the spring and fall of 1931, following the Creditanstalt crisis in May

1931 as well as the intensification of banking problems in Germany.

                             [Table 7 about here)

      A statistical indicator of banking problems, emphasized by

Friedman and Schwartz (1963), is the deposit-currency ratio. Data on

the changes in the commercial bank deposit-currency ratio for our panel

of countries is presented in Table 8. It is interesting to compare this

table with the chronology in Table 7. Most but not all of the major

banking crises were associated with sharp drops in the deposit-currency

ratio; the most important exception is in 1931 in Italy, where the

government was able to keep secret much of the banking system's problems

until a government takeover was effected. On the other hand, there were

also significant drops in the deposit-currency ratio that are not

associated with panics; restructurings of the banking system and

exchange rate difficulties account for some of these episodes.

      What caused the banking panics? At one level, the panics were an

endogenous response to deflation and the operation of the gold standard

regime. When the peak of the world banking crisis came in 1931, there

had already been almost two years of deflation, and accompanying
                                                                           24


 depression. Consistent with the analysis at the end of the last

 section, falling prices lowered the nominal value of bank assets, but

 not the nominal value of bank liabilities. In addition, the rules of

 the gold standard severely limited the ability of central banks to

 ameliorate panics by acting as a lender of last resort; indeed, since

 banking panics often coincided with exchange crises (as we discuss

 further below), in order to maintain convertibility central banks

 typically tightened monetary policy in the face of panics.   Supporting
 the connection of banking problems with deflation and "rules of the

 game" constraints is the observation that there were virtually no

 serious banking panics in any country after abandonment of the gold

 standard- -although it is also true that by time the gold standard was

 abandoned, strong financial reform measures had also been taken in most
countries.

      However, while deflation and adherence to the gold standard were

necessary conditiona for panics, they were not sufficient; a number of

countries made it through the interwar period without significant bank

rums or failures, despite being subject to deflationary shocks similar

to those experienced by the countries with banking problems)5 Several

factors help to explain which countries were the ones to suffer panics:

      1) Banking structure. The organization of the banking system was

an important factor in determining vulnerability
                                                   to panics. First,
countries with 'unit banking', i.e., with a large number of small and

relatively undiversified banks, suffered icore severe banking panics.

The leading example is of course the U.S., where concentration in

banking was very low, but a high incidence of failures among small banks

was also seen in other countries (e.g., France).
                                                   Canada, with branch
                                                                            25



banking, suffered no bank failures during the Depression (although many

branches were closed). Sweden and the U.K. also benefited from a

greater dispersion of risk through branch systems.16

      Second, where "universal" or "mixed" banking on the German or

Belgian model was the norm, it appears that vulnerability to deflation

was greater. In contrast to the Anglo-Saxon model of banking, where at

least in theory lending was short-term and the relationship between

banks and corporations had an arm's-length character, universal banks

took long-term and sometimes dominant ownership positions in client

firms. Universal bank assets included both long-term securities and

equity participations; the former tended to become illiquid during a

crisis, while the latter exposed universal banks (unlike Anglo-Saxon

banks, which held mainly debt instruments) to the effects of stock

market crashes. The most extreme case was probably Austria: By 1931,

after a series of mergers, the infamous Creditanstalt was better thought

of as a vast holding company rather than a bank; at the time of its

failure in May 1931, the Creditanstalt owned 64 companies, amounting to

65% of Austria's nominal capital (Kindleberger 1984).

      2) Reliance of banks on short-term foreign   liabilities.   Some of

the most serious banking problems were experienced in countries in which

a substantial fraction of deposits were foreign-owned. The so-called

"hot money" was more sensitive to adverse financial developments than

were domestic deposits. Runs by foreign depositors represented not only

a loss to the banking system but also, typically, a loss of reserves; as

we have noted, this additional external threat restricted to the ability

of the central bank to respond to the banking situation. Thus, banking

crises and exchange rate crises became intertwined.17    The resolution
                                                                           26


 of a number of the central European banking crises required so-called

 "standstill agreements", under which withdrawals by foreign creditors

 were blocked pending future negotiation.

       International linkages were important on the asset side of bank

 balance sheets as well. Many continental banks were severely affected

 by the crises in Austria and Germany, in particular.

       3) Financial and economic experience of the 1920s. It should not

 be particularly surprising that countries which emerged from the 1920s

 in relatively weaker condition were more vulnerable to panics. Austria,

Germany, Hungary, and Poland all suffered hyperinflatiori and economic

dislocation in the 1920s, and all suffered severe banking panics in

1931. While space constraints do not permit a full discussion of the

point here, it does seem clear that the origins of the European

financial crisis were at least partly independent of American

developments- -which argues against a purely American-centered

explanation of the origins of the Depression.

      It should also be emphasized, though, that not just the existence

of financial difficulties during the 1920s but also the policy response

to those difficulties was important. Austria is probably the most

extreme case of nagging banking problems being repeatedly "papered

over". That country had banking problems throughout the   l920s, which

were handled Principally by merging failing banks into still-solvent

banks. An enforced merger of the Austrian Bodencreditanstalt with two

failing banks in 1927 weakened that institution, which was part of the

reason that the Bodencreditanstalt in turn had to be forceably merged

with the Credjtanstalt in 1929. The insolvency of the Creditanstalt,

finally revealed when a director refused to sign an "optimistic"
                                                                           27


financial statement in May 1931, sparked the most intense phase of the

European crisis.

      In contrast, when banking troubles during the earlier part of the

l920s were met with fundamental reform, performance of the banking

sector during the Depression was better. Examples were Sweden. Japan,

and the Netherlands, all of which had significant banking problems

during the l920s but which responded by fundamental restructurings and

assistance to place banks on a sound footing (and to close the weakest

banks). Possibly because of these earlier events, these three countries

had limited problems in the 1930s: A large Swedish bank (Skandinaviska

Kreditaktiebolaget) suffered heavy losses after the collapse of the

Kreuger financial empire, and a medium-sized Dutch bank (Amstelbank)

failed because of its connection to the Creditanstalt; but there were no

widespread panics, only isolated failures.

      A particularly interesting comparison in this regard is between

the Netherlands and neighboring Belgium, where banking problems

persisted from 1931 to 1935, and where the ultimate devaluation of the

Belgian france was the result of an attempt to protect banks from

further drains. Both countries were heavily dependent on foreign trade

and both remained on gold, yet the Netherlands did much better than

Belgium in the early part of the Depression (see Table 4). This is a

bit of evidence for the relevance of banking difficulties to output.

      Overall, while banking crises were surely an endogenous response

to depression, the incidence of crisis across countries reflected a

variety of institutional factors and other preconditions. Thus it will

be of interest to compare the real effects of deflation between

countries with and without severe banking difficulties.
                                                                                 28




         On "debt-deflation", i.e., the problems of nonfinancial borrowers,

 much less has been written than on the banking crises.    Only for the

 U.S. has the debt problem in the 1930s been fairly well documented
                                                                          (see

 the summary in Bernanke 1983 and the references   therein). In that

 country large corporations avoided serious difficulties, but most other

 sectors--small business, farmers, mortgage borrowers, state and local

 governments- -were severely affected, with usually something close to

 half of outstanding debts being in default. A substantial portion of
 New   Deal reforms consisted of various forms of debt adjustment and
 relief.
        For other countries, there are plenty of anecdotes but not much
systematic   data. Aggregate data on bankruptcies and defaults are

difficult to interpret because increasing financial distress forced

changes in bankruptcy practices and procedures; when the League of

Nations' Monthly Bulletin of Statistics dropped its table on

bankruptcies in December 1932, for example, the reason given was that

"the numerous forms of agreement by which open bankruptcies are now

avoided have seriously diminished the value of the table".     Perhaps the
most extreme case of a change in rules was Rumania's April 1932 Law on

Conversion of Debts, which essentially eliminated the right of creditors

to force bankruptcy. Changes in the treatment of bankruptcy no doubt

ameliorated the effects of debt default, but the fact that these changes

occurred indicates that the perceived problem must have been severe.

debt problems, although here interesting recent work by Eichengreen and

Portes (1989) and others gives us a much better base of knowledge to

         . Reression    Results

         In this section we present empirical results based on our panel

data set. The principal question of interest is the relative importance

of various transmission mechanisms of deflation to output. We also

address the question, so far not discussed, of whether banking crises

could have intensified the deflation process itself.

         The basic set of results is contained in Table 9, which relates

the log-differences in industrial production for our set of countries to

various combinations of explanatory variables. The definitions of the

right-hand side variables are as follows:

         lnPW: log-difference of the wholesale price index

         lnEX:   log-difference   of nominal exports

         lnW:    log-difference of nominal wage

         DISC:   central bank discount rate, measured relative to its 1929

value (a government bond rate is used for Canada; since no 1929 interest

      Exports are included to control for trade effects on growth,

including the benefits of competitive devaluation discussed by

Eichengreen and Sachs; and the wage is included to test for the real

wage channel of transmission from deflation to depression. Of course,

theory says that both of these variables should enter in real rather

than in nominal terms; unfortunately, in practice the theoretically

suggested deflator is not always available (as we noted in our

discussion of the real wage above). We resolve this problem as follows:

Suppose that the true equation is, for example,



      0 lnIP — (lnEX         -      + fl(lnW -    AlnP)   + error



      where P and P, the optimal deflators, are not available. Let

the projections of log-changes in the unobserved deflators on the log-

change in the wholesale price deflator be given by



                                   1. —
      (2) lnPi jAlnPW + Uj


      where the Uj are uncorrelated with A1nPW and presumably the      are

positive. Then (1) becomes



      (3) lnIP — -                   + PeM1
                   + fllnW + new error



      This suggests allowing lnPW and the nominal growth rates of

exports and wages to enter the equation separately, which is how we

proceed.18 Putting A1nPW in the equation separately has the additional
                                                                            31



advantage of allowing us to account for any additional effect of

deflation (such as debt-deflation) not explicitly captured by the other

independent variables.

        The discount rate DISC is included to allow for the interest rate

channel, and as an additional proxy for monetary policy. Since lnPW is

included in every equation, inclusion of the nominal interest rate DISC

is equivalent to including the actual cx post real interest rate, i.e.,

we are effectively assuming that deflation was fully anticipated; this

should give the real interest rate hypothesis its best chance.

        In an attempt to control for fiscal policy, we also included

measures of central government expenditure in our first estimated

equations. Since the estimated coefficients were always negative (the

wrong sign), small, and statistically insignificant, the government

expenditure variable is excluded from the results reported here.

        Construction of the dummy variable PANIC required us to make a

judgment about which countries' banking crises were most serious, which

we did from our reading of primary and secondary sources. We dated

periods of crisis as starting from the first severe banking problems; if

there was some clear demarcation point (such as the U.S. bank holiday of

1933), we used that as the ending date of the crisis, otherwise we

arbitrarily assumed that the crisis's effects would last for one year

from its most intense point. The exact list of banking crises included

in the dummy is as follows (see also Table 7):

        1. Austria (May 1931--January 1933). From the Creditaristalt

crisis to the date of official settlement of the Creditanstalt's foreign

debt.
                                                                            32


       2. Belgium (May 1931--April 1932; March l934--February 1935).

 For one year after the initial Belgian crisis, following Creditanstalt,

 and for one year after the failure of Banque Beige de Travail led to a

 general crisis.

       3. Estonia (September l931--August 1932). For one year after the

 general banking crisis.

       4. France (November 1930- -October 1932) For one year following

 each of the two peaks of the French banking crises, in November 1930 and

October 1931 (see Bouvier 1984).

       5. Germany (May 1931- -December 1932) From the beginning of the

major German banking crisis until the creation of state institutes for

the liquidation of bad bank debts.

      6. Hungary (July 1931--June 1932) For one year following the

runs in Budapest and the bank holiday.

      7.
           Italy (April 1931--December 1932) From the onset of the

banking panic until the takeover of bank assets by the IRI.

      8. Latvia (July 1931--June 1932) For one year following the
onset of the banking crisis.

      9. Poland (June 1931- -May 1932) For one year following the onset

of the banking crisis.

      10. Rumania (July 1931- -September 1932) From the onset of the

crisis until one year after its peak in October 1931.

      11. United States (December 1930- -March 1933) From the failure

of the Bank of the U.S. until the bank
                                         holiday.
      The inclusion of Austria,
                                  Belgium,Germarty, Hungary, Latvia,
Poland, Rumania, or the U.S. in the above list cannot be controversial;

each of these countries suffered serious panics.    (One might quibble on
                                                                           33



the margin about the exact dating given--for example, Temin (1989) and

others have argued that the U.S. banking crisis did not really begin

until mid-1931- -but we doubt very much that changes of a few months on

these dates would affect the results.) The inclusion of France and

Italy is more controversial: For example, Bouvier (1984) argues that

the French banking crisis was not as serious as some others, since

although there were runs and many banks failed, the very biggest banks

survived; also, according to Bouvier, French banks were not as closely

tied in to industry as other banking systems on the Continent. For

Italy, as we have noted, early and massive government intervention

reduced the incidence of panic (see Ciocca and Toniolo 1984); however,

the banks were in very poor condition and (as noted above) eventually

signed over most of their industrial assets to a massive new state

holding company, the Istituto por le Riconstruzione Iridustriale (IRI).

      To check the sensitivity of our results, we re-estimated the key

equations omitting from the PANIC variable first only the French crisis,

then the French and Italian crises. Leaving out France had a minor

effect (lowering the coefficient on PANIC and its t-statistic about 5%

in a typical equation); the additional exclusion of the Italian crisis

had essentially no effect.19

      As a further check, we also re-estimated our key equations

omitting, in separate runs, 1) the U.S.; 2) Germany and Austria; 3) all

Eastern European countries. In none of these equations were our basic

results substantially weakened, which indicates that no single country

or small group of countries is driving our findings.

                               (Table 9 about here]
                                                                           34



      The first seven equations in Table 9 are not derived from any

single model, but instead attempt to nest various suggested explanations

of the link between deflation an depression. Estimation was by OLS,

which opens up the possibility of simultaneity bias; however, given our

maintained view that the deflation was imposed by exogenous monetary

forces, a case can be made for treating the right-hand side variables as

exogenous or predetermined.

      The principal inferences to be drawn from the first seven lines of

Table 9 are as follovs20

      (1) Export growth consistently enters the equation for output

growth strongly, with a plausible coefficient and a high level of

statistical significance.

      (2) When wage growth is included in the output equation along

with only wholesale price and export growth (line 5), it enters with the

wrong sign. Only when the PANIC variable is included also does nominal

wage growth have the right (negative) sign--see lines 6 and 7. In the

equation encompassing all the various channels, equation 7, the

estimated coefficient on wage growth is of the right sign and a

reasonable magnitude, but it is not statistically significant.

      (3) The discount rate enters the encompassing equation (line 7)

with the right sign and a high significance level. A 100 basis point

increase in the discount rate is estimated to reduce the growth rate of

industrial production by 3.6 percentage points.

      (4) The effect of banking panics on output is large (a year of

panic is estimated in equation 7 to reduce output growth by 12 x .0138,

or more than 16 percentage points) and highly statistically significant

(t-statistjcs of 4.0 or better). The measured effect of the PANIC
                                                                             35


variable does not seem to depend much on what other variables are

included in the equation.

      (5) There may be some residual effect of deflation on output not

accounted for by any of these effects. To see this, note that in

principle the coefficient on D1nPW in equation (7) of Table 9 should be

equal and opposite the weighted sum of the coefficients on lnEX, 1nW,

and DISC (where the weights are the projection coefficients of the

respective "true" deflators on lnPW). Suppose for the sake of

illustration that each of the projection coefficients equals one (that

is, the wholesale price index is the correct deflator). Then the

expected value of the coefficient on lnPW should be approximately .052;

the actual value is .296, with a standard error of .123. Thus there may

be other channels relating deflation to depression than the ones

explicitly accounted for here. One possibility is that we are simply

picking up the effects of a simultaneity bias (a reverse causation from

output to prices). Alternatively, it is possible that an additional

factor such as debt-deflation should be considered.

      As an alternative to the procedure of nesting alternative channels

in a single equation, in equation (8) of Table 9 we report the results

of estimating the reduced form of a simple aggregate demand- -   aggregate
supply system. Under conventional assumptions, in an AD-AS model output

growth should depend on money growth and autonomous spending growth

(represented here by growth in real exports21), which shift the AD

curve; and on nominal wage growth, which shifts the AS curve. In

addition, we allow PANIC to enter the system, since banking panics could

in principle affect both aggregate demand and aggregate supply. The

results indicate large and statistically significant effects on output
                                                                           36


 growth for real export growth, money growth, and banking panics.

 Nominal wage growth enters with the correct sign but the coefficient is

 very small and statistically insignificant.



      We have so far focused on the effects of banking panics (and other

variables) on output. There is an additional issue that warrants some

discussion here; namely, the possibility that banking panics might have

themselves worsened the deflationary process.

      Some care must be taken with this argument. Banking panics

undoubtedly had large effects on the composition of national money

supplies, money multipliers, and money demand. Nevertheless, as has

been stressed by Temin (1989), under a gold standard small country price

levels are determined by international monetary conditions, to which

domestic money supplies and demands must ultimately adjust. Thus

banking panics cannot intensify deflation in a small country.22 Indeed,

a regression (not reported) of changes in wholesale prices against the

PANIC variable and time dummies (in order to isolate purely cross-

sectional effects) confirms that there is very little relationship

between the two variables.

      The proposition that bank panics should not affect the price level

does not necessarily hold for a large country, however. In econometric

language, under a gold standard the price level of a large country must

be cointegrated with world prices; but while this means that domestic

prices must eventually adjust to shocks emanating from abroad, it also

allows for the possibility that domestic shocks will influence the world

price level. Notice that if banking panics led to deflationary shocks

in a large country, and these shocks were transmitted around the world
                                                                            37



by the gold standard, a cross-sectional comparison would find no link

between panics and the price level.

      The discussion of the gold standard and deflation in Section 2

cited Hamilton's (1987) view that the initial deflationary impulses in

1928-29 came from France and the U.S. --both "big" countries, in terms of

economic importance and because of their large gold reserves. This

early deflation obviously cannot be blamed on banking panics, since

these did not begin until at least the end of 1930. But it would not be

in any way inconsistent with the theory of the gold standard to

hypothesize that banking panics in France and the U.S. contributed to

world deflation during 1931.32.23

      Empirical evidence bearing on this question is presented in Table

10. We estimated equations for wholesale price inflation in the U.S.

and France, using monthly data for the five-year period 1928-32. We

included an error-correction term in both equations to allow for

cointegration between the U.S. and French price levels, as would be

implied by the gold standard. This error-correction term is the

difference between the log-levels of U.S. and French wholesale prices in

period t-l; if U.S. and French prices are in fact cointegrated, then the

growth rate of U.S. prices should respond negatively to the difference

between the U.S. price and the French price, and the French growth rate

of prices should respond positively. Also included in the equations are

lagged inflation rates (to capture transitory price dynamics), current

and lagged base money growth, and current and lagged values of the

deposits of failing banks (for the U.S. only, due to data availability).

                             (Table 10 about here]
                                                                           38



      The results are interesting. First, there is evidence for

cointegration: The error-correction terms have the right signs and

reasonable magnitudes, although only the U.S. term is statistically

significant. Thus we may infer that shocks hitting either French or

U.S. prices ultimately affected both price levels. Second, both U.S.

base money growth and bank failures are important determinants of the

U.S. (and by extension, the French) deflation rates; these two variables

enter the U.S. price equation with the right sign and marginal

significance levels of .0005.

      With respect to the effect of banking panics on the price level,

then, the appropriate conclusion appears to be that countries with

banking panics did not suffer worse deflation than those without

panics24; however, it is possible that U.S. banking panics in particular

were an important source of world deflation during 1931-32, and thus, by

extension, of world depression.



      6. Conclusion

      Monetary and financial arrangements in the interwar period were

badly flawed and were a major source of the fall in real output.

Banking panics were one mechanism through which deflation had its

effects on real output, and panics in the U.S. may have contributed to

the severity of the world deflation.

      In this empirical study, we have focused on the effects of severe

banking panics. We believe it likely, however, that the effects of

deflation on the financial system were not confined to these more

extreme episodes. Even in countries without panics banks were

financially weakened and contracted their operations. Domestic debt
                                                                           39


deflation was probably a factor, to a greater or lesser degree, in every

country. And we have not addressed at all the effect of deflation on

the burden of external debt, which was important for a nuniber of

countries. As we have already suggested, more careful study of these

issues is clearly desirable.

             The original diagnosis of the Depression as a monetary

phenomenon is of course due to Friedman and Schwartz 1963. We find the

more recent work, though focusing to a greater degree on international

aspects of the problem, to be essentially complementary to the Friedman-

Schwartz analysis.
      2
             Eichengreen and Sachs (1985) discuss several mechanisms and

provide some cross-country evidence, but their approach is somewhat

informal and they do not consider the relative importance of the

different effects.

          To be clear, gold inflows to France did inctease the French

monetary base directly, one-for-one; however, in the absence of

supplementary open market purchases, this implied a rising ratio of

French gold reserves to monetary base. Together with the very low value

of the French money multiplier, this rising cover ratio meant that the

monetary expansion induced by gold flowing into France was far less

significant than the monetary contractions that this inflow induced

elsewhere.

          Temin (1989) suggests that German monetary policy provided yet

another contractionary impetus.

          There remains the issue of whether the differences in timing of

nations' departure from the gold standard can be treated as exogenous.

Eichengeen and Sachs (1985) argue that exogeneity is a reasonable

assumption, given the importance of individual national experiences,

institutions, and fortuitous events in each country's decision of when
to go off gold. Strong national differences in attitudes toward the

gold standard (e.g., between the Gold Bloc and the Sterling Bloc) were

remarkably persistent in their influence on policy. For example, League

of Nations (1935) reports that in July 1933, representatives of six

member nations of the Gold Bloc met in Paris and "drew up a protocol

providing for the common defence of the gold standard. An immediate

result was a subsiding of active speculation against the Dutch florin

and the Swiss franc." Yet in the same month, the League of Nations

report continues, six members of the British Commonwealth fornally

agreed that they should "persist by all means in their power, whether

monetary or economic, within the limits of sound finance, in the policy

of furthering the rise in wholesale prices until there is evidence that

equilibrium has been reestablished, and that thereupon they should take

whatever measures are possible to stabilize the position just attained."

      6 The countries in our sample are listed in Table 1. We included

countries, other than Latin American countries, for which the League of

Nations collected reasonably complete data on industrial production,

price levels, and money supplies (League of Nations' !1onthly Bulletin of

Statistics and Yearbooks, various issues; see also League of Nations,

Industrialization and   Foreign   Trade, 1945). Our   exclusion   of Latin

America was motivated by concerns about the data and our expectation

that factors such as commodity prices would play a more important role

for these countries. However, see Campa (forthcoming) for evidence that

the gold standard transmitted deflation and depression to Latin America

in a manner very similar to that observed elsewhere.

         We define abandonment of the gold standard broadly as occurring

at the first date in which a country imposes exchange controls,
devalues, or suspends gold payments; see Table 1 for a list of dates.

An objection to this definition is that some countries continued to try

to target their exchange rates at levels prescribed by the gold standard

even after "leaving" the gold standard by our criteria; Canada and

Germany are two examples. We made no attempt to account for this, on

the grounds that defining adherence to the gold standard by looking at

variables such as exchange rates, money growth, or prices risks assuming

the propositions to be shown.

      8 In   constructing the grand averages taken over gold and non-gold

countries, if a country abandoned the gold standard in the middle of a

year, it is included in both the gold and non-gold categories with

weights equal to the fraction of the year spent in each category. We

use simple rather than weighted averages in the tables, and similarly

give all countries equal weight in regression results presented below;

we do this because, for the purpose of testing hypotheses, e.g., about

the relationship between deflation and depression, it seems most

reasonable to treat each country (with its own currency, legal system

financial system, etc.) as the basic unit of observation, and to afford

each observation equal weight. If we were instead trying to measure the

overall economic significance of, e.g., an individual country's policy

decisions, weighted averages would be more appropriate.

         The use of the terms Ml and M2 should not be taken too

literally here, as the transactions characteristics of the assets

included in each category vary considerably among countries. The key

distinction between the two aggregates is that commercial banks, which

were heavily involved in commercial lending, were much more vulnerable
to banking panics. Savings banks, in contrast, held mostly government

securities and thus often gained deposits during panic periods.

        10 However, it must be mentioned that recent exponents of the

real wage explanation of German unemployment invoke it to account for

high levels of unemployment throughout the mid- and late 1920s, and not

just for the period after 1929 (Borchardt 1979).

        11 In the French case, however, there may have been some fear of

government default, given the large deficits that were being run;

conceivably, this could explain the higher rate on French bills.

        12 A possible response to this point is that fear of devaluation

added a risk premium to assets in gold standard countries. This point

can be checked by looking at forward rates for foreign exchange,

available in Einzig 1937. The forward prernia on gold standard

currencies are generally small, except immediately before devaluations.

In particular, the three-month premium on dollars versus the pound in

1932 had a maximum value of about 4.5% (at an annual rate) during the

first week of June, but for most of the year was considerably less than

that.

        13 The effect of deflation on banks, and the relationship between

deflation and bank runs, has been analyzed in a theoretical model by

Flood and Gerber (1981).

        14 An important issue, which we cannot resolve here, is whether

government takeovers of banks resulted in some restoration of

intermediary services; or if, instead, the government functioned

primarily as a liquidation agent.

        15 In the next section we divide our sample into two   groups:   11

countries with serious banking problems and 13 countries without these
problems. In 1930, the year before the peak of the banking crises, the

countries that were to avoid banking problems suffered on average a 12%

deflation and a 6% fall in industrial production; the comparable numbers

for the group that was to experience panics were 13% and 8%. Thus,

there was no large difference between the two groups early in the

Depression. In contrast, in 1932 (the year following the most intense

banking crises), industrial production growth in countries without

banking crises averaged -2%; in the group that experienced crises the

comparable number was -16%.
           16
                Although this correlation seems to hold during the Depression,

we don't want to conclude unconditionally that branch banking is more

stable; branching facilitates diversification but also increases the

risk that problems in a few large banks may bring down the entire

network.
        17
                Causality could run in both directions. For example, Wigmore

(1987) argues that the 1933 U.S. banking panic was in part created by a

run   on   the dollar.

        18 It has been pointed out to us that if nominal wages were

literally rigid, then this approach would find no effect for wages even

though changes in the real wage might be an important channel for the

effects of deflation. The reply to this is that, if nominal wages are

completely rigid, the hypothesis that real wages are important can never

be distinguished from an alternative which proposes that deflation has

its effects in some other way.

       19 In another sensitivity check, we also tried multiplying PANIC

times the change in the deposit-currency ratio, to allow for

differential severity of panics. The results exhibited an outlier
problem: When Rumania (which had a change in the deposit-currency ratio

of -   .76 in 1931) was excluded, the results were similar to those
obtained using the PANIC variable alone. However, inclusion of Rumania

weakened both the magnitude and statistical significance of the effect

of panics on output. The "reason" for this is that, despite its massive

deposit contraction, Rumania experienced a 5% growth of industrial

production in 1931. Whether this is a strong contradiction of the view

that panics affect real output is not clear, however, since according to

the League of Nations the peak of the Rumanian crisis did not occur

until September or October, and industrial production in the subsequent

year fell by 14%. Another reason to downplay these results is that the

change in the deposit-currency ratio may not be a good indicator of the

severity of the banking crisis, as the Italian case indicates.

        20 Results were unchanged when lagged industrial production

growths was added to the equations. The coefficient on lagged

production was typically small and statistically insignificant.

        21 Deflation is by the wholesale price index.

        22 A   possible exception to this proposition for a small country

might be a situation where there are fears that the country will devalue

or abandon gold; in this case the country's price level might drop below

the world level without causing inflows of reserves. An example may be

Poland in 1932. A member of the Cold Bloc, Poland's wholesale price

level closely tracked that of France until mid-1931, when Poland

experienced severe banking problems and withdrawals of foreign deposits,

which threatened convertibility. From that point on, even though both

countries remained on the gold standard, money supplies and prices in

Poland and France began to diverge. From the time of the Polish crisis
in June 1931 until the end of 1932, money and notes and circulation

dropped by 9.1% in Poland (compared to a gain of 10.5% in France);

Polish commercial bank deposits fell 24.5% (compared to a 4.1% decline

in France); and Polish wholesale prices declined 35.2% (compared     to a

decline of 18.3% in France). Despite its greater deflation, Poland lost

about a sixth of its gold reserves in 1932, while France gained     gold.
         23 This hypothesis does not bear on Temin's claim that there was

little    that central banks could do about banking crises under the gold

standard; rather, the argument is that if, fortuitously, French and U.S.

banking panics had not occurred, world deflation in 1931-32 would have

been less severe.
      24
             Indeed, if banking panics induced countries to abandon gold,

they may have indirectly contributed to an eventual rise in price

levels.
