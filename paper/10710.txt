                                           ABSTRACT

Merger policy is the most active area of U.S. antitrust policy. It is now widely believed that merger

policy must move beyond its traditional focus on static efficiency to account for innovation and

address dynamic efficiency. Innovation can fundamentally affect merger analysis in two ways. First,

innovation can dramatically affect the relationship between the pre-merger marketplace and what

is likely to happen if a proposed merger is consummated. Thus, innovation can fundamentally

influence the appropriate analysis for addressing traditional, static efficiency concerns. Second,

innovation can itself be an important dimension of market performance that is potentially affected

by a merger. We explore how merger policy is meeting the challenges posed by innovation.

I.     INTRODUCTION

       Merger policy is the most active area of U.S. antitrust policy. From 1991 to 2002, for

example, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice conducted an average of 161

merger investigations each year, which is more than all of the Division’s other civil and criminal

investigations combined.1 Merger investigations constitute a similarly important part of the

Federal Trade Commission’s “Maintaining Competition Mission.”2

       Traditionally, merger policy focused on the question of whether a proposed transaction

would lead to higher or lower prices, based on a static analysis that compared market power and

efficiency effects. Dynamic considerations such as research and development, while not

altogether absent, played relatively little role.3 Today, innovation is widely recognized as an

important driver of national economic welfare. Productivity growth driven by technological

change has been credited with stimulating the major economic expansions of the 1960’s, 1980’s,

and 1990’s.4 Although precise estimates of the particular percentages of economic output or

growth that can be attributed to innovation are hard to make, there is strong consensus among

       anticompetitive practices (e.g., the Microsoft case).

       Innovation considerations were raised in some early non-merger cases. United States v. Aluminum Co. of
       Amer., 148 F.2d 416, 427 (2d Cir. 1945) recognized the effects of market power on innovation, although
       innovation concerns did not play a significant role in the decision. Innovation played a more central role in
       United States v. Automobile Manufacturers Ass'n, 307 F. Supp. 617, 618 (C.D. Cal. 1969), in which the
       court found that the leading American automobile manufacturers had engaged in a conspiracy "to eliminate
       competition in the research, development, manufacture and installation of motor vehicle air pollution
       control equipment . . . " in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act (aff'd in part and appeal dismissed in
       part, 397 U.S. 248 (1970)).

policy makers and economists that innovation is a critical component of a sustained, healthy

economy.

       The consensus about the value of innovation has spread to antitrust policy. It is now well

recognized by antitrust enforcement officials that investment in research and the diffusion of

innovations are among the most important dimensions of market performance. One official

observed that “the more important that innovation becomes to society, the more important it is to

preserve economic incentives to innovate,”5 and another observed that, “as important as price

competition is to us, a second major and possibly even greater concern is maintaining

competition for innovation.”6 Merger policy has thus increasingly focused on innovation,

although exactly what that means or how it translates into enforcement has proven difficult to get

a handle on.

       In this paper, we examine the developing role of innovation in U.S. merger policy.

Considerations of innovation are central to merger policy in at least two ways. First, because

dynamic efficiency is critical to successful economic performance, there can be considerable

interest in the effects of a merger on innovation. In other words, innovation can itself be an

important dimension of market performance that is potentially affected by a merger. Merging

parties frequently assert that the transaction will allow them to engage in greater innovation,

while antitrust enforcers may object to a transaction on the grounds that it will lead to a loss of

competition that would otherwise spur innovation. In order fully to assess the impact of a

merger on market performance, merger authorities and courts must examine how a proposed

transaction changes market participants’ incentives and abilities to undertake investments in

innovation. We will refer to this first role for innovation in merger policy as the "innovation

incentives" criterion.

        A second way in which innovation is central to antitrust policy is that the presence of

innovation can fundamentally alter the nature of the appropriate analysis even if one focuses on

traditional performance measures, such as static pricing efficiency. In brief, merger analysis

forms a prediction of a proposed transaction’s effects on consumer welfare by examining present

characteristics of the parties to the transaction and the market setting in which those parties

operate. Innovation can dramatically affect the relationship between the pre-merger

marketplace and what is likely to happen if the proposed merger is consummated. For example,

market shares are often used as a measure of market power. But, in theory at least, significant

innovation may lead to the rapid displacement of a supplier that, by traditional measures such as

current market share, appears to be dominant. This raises the broad question of how merger

analysis should form predictions about the likely competitive effects of a proposed transaction.

We will refer to this second role for innovation in merger analysis as the "innovation impact"

criterion.

        Under the innovation incentives criterion, one asks how the change in market structure

and competition brought about by a merger will likely affect consumer welfare through effects

on the pace or nature of innovation that might reduce costs or bring new products to consumers.

Under the innovation impact criterion, the situation is reversed. It refers not to how market

structure will affect innovation, but to how innovation will affect the evolution of market

structure and competition. Innovation is a force that could make static measures of market




                                                      3
structure unreliable or irrelevant, and the effects of innovation may be highly relevant to the kind

of remedy antitrust authorities choose to adopt.

       The two ways that innovation may factor into merger analysis have important policy

implications. To the extent that innovation is itself a significant objective, antitrust agencies

need to understand the relationship between market structure and innovation in a given case with

sufficient rigor to distinguish legitimate from merely opportunistic claims that the merger will

benefit, or at least not harm, innovation incentives. Similarly, the fact that innovation may affect

the post-merger marketplace in ways that are hard to predict challenges merger authorities to

devise ways to distinguish mere claims by the merging parties that they face potential

competition due to innovation from situations in which such potential entry really exists.

Finally, the importance of innovation incentives raises the question of whether the enforcement

guidelines and precedent aimed at promoting conventional competitive goals of low prices and

high output are consistent with the promoting the goal of efficient innovation.7 To the extent

there is tension between innovation and static economic goals of merger policy, merger

enforcement will have to develop a framework for deciding how to make tradeoffs between those

objectives. If merger authorities wish to take a more dynamic approach to maximizing consumer

or social welfare, our analysis suggests that merger policy should strengthen its basic framework

by adding to its current set of tools and by developing a more sophisticated approach for

incorporating uncertainty about future economic events into decision making.

       In this chapter, we explore both of the avenues through which innovation affects, and is

affected by, merger policy. We begin, in Section II, by considering three illustrative scenarios of




                                                      4
the impact of innovation on the central concerns of merger policy. As background, in Section

III, we review the established framework for merger enforcement. We then examine in Sections

IV and V how successfully that framework is likely to be in addressing the different challenges

related to innovation. To illustrate how these challenges are met in practice, in Section VI we

discuss and evaluate several merger cases in which the antitrust agencies have focused on

innovation. We conclude with some observations about the current relationship between merger

policy and innovation and about the possible evolution of that relationship.


II.    DEFINING “INNOVATION” IN A MERGER CONTEXT

       Implicit in any discussion of how innovation might factor into merger analysis is a

definition of "innovation." The concept of innovation can span a spectrum of activities ranging

from pure research aimed at making discoveries in basic science to developmental activities that

apply known scientific results to improve existing products or production processes. The closer

the innovation at issue in a particular merger is to resulting in an identifiable, predictable

product, the more likely the issue for merger review will be how the innovation will affect future

structure and performance in the product market relevant to the transaction (i.e., the innovation-

impact criterion). The farther the innovation is from a tangible result, the more likely the

question for merger authorities will be how the transaction will affect the likelihood and level of

continued investment in R&D (i.e., the innovation-incentives criterion). To illustrate further

how the question for merger policy changes as the nature of the innovation changes, we next




7
       Of course, from a long-run perspective, promoting innovation and promoting low quality-adjusted prices
       are largely the same objective. The distinction we draw in the text can be viewed as one between static
       pricing efficiency and dynamic pricing efficiency.


                                                           5
discuss three abstract cases that show the different problems that different forms of innovation

present for merger review.

       Case 1: Innovation that is well underway to create or improve defined products and

processes. We begin by considering situations in which the innovation efforts of the merging

parties and their rivals are largely complete.8 In some cases, the firms may already be product-

market competitors, with ongoing R&D efforts aimed at improving existing products and

processes. In other cases, the firms seeking to merge may not yet be competitors in any product

market, but these firms may be developing products that will enable the firms to compete with

one another in one or more product markets in the future. Where innovation efforts are well

under way but have not yet resulted in a tangible product, the ongoing innovation may serve as

evidence to support treating the merging firms as potential competitors: firms that have made

substantial investment and progress toward entering a market are much more predictable entrants

than are firms that merely could undertake such investment.

       In the settings just described, the potential harms from a merger arise not from the

elimination of competing R&D, but rather from the elimination of future product-market

competition between the merging parties. Hence, the focus of merger analysis is the

conventional one of product-market competition rather than anything specially to do with

innovation. However, the presence of not-yet-complete innovative efforts complicates the

predictions of how the merger will affect product-market competition. This is so because the

central task for merger analysis is to form predictions about what competition will look like in

the future, with and without the merger. In the case of merging firms that do not yet compete in



8
       This case is, admittedly, somewhat artificial. Actual markets are likely to have ongoing waves of
       innovation.


                                                           6
a product market, there will tend to be a lack of definitive evidence about cost and demand

conditions on which to base predictions of the state of competition. Even where firms are

already product-market competitors, ongoing R&D efforts may be likely to change the future

competitive positions of one or more suppliers. The potentially dramatic effects of innovation

can greatly increase the difficulty of predicting a merger’s effects on price competition.

       Case 2: Innovation-based race to market dominance. We next consider situations in

which the innovation efforts of the merging parties and their rivals are the focus of the merger

analysis, and product-market competition is largely unaffected by the merger. Such situations

arise when firms are undertaking competing R&D efforts and the “winner” of this R&D

competition will achieve market dominance because of a patent, the realization of network

effects, or some other winner-take-all phenomenon. If the process literally is winner-take-all,

then the question of how the merger affects product-market competition, which lies at the heart

of conventional merger analysis, simply does not arise. In these situations, the post-innovation

product market is monopolized, whether or not the proposed merger is consummated. The

public policy concern here is whether the merger will diminish R&D competition and thus either

retard the introduction of a new product or result in a product that offers consumers smaller net

benefits.

       In some markets subject to strong technological progress, this process may play itself out

repeatedly. That is, competition may take the form of a succession of “temporary monopolists”

who displace one another through innovation. At any one time, there is little or no head-to-head

price competition. But there is significant innovation competition over time. This pattern of

competition is often referred to Schumpeterian rivalry, after Joseph Schumpeter, who asserted

that it is a central feature of the modern economy. As we shall discuss below, some observers


                                                     7
have questioned whether central elements of conventional merger analysis are at all helpful in

understanding Schumpeterian competition.

       Case 3: Commercially rational delay in competitive innovation. Our final case illustrates

the fact that there can be a tension, and hence the need to make a tradeoff, between static and

dynamic policy objectives. When successful innovation cannot be protected from replication or

imitation by competitors, perhaps because of weak intellectual property rights, a firm may not

race for the lead but instead wait for another firm to do the hard work that the waiting firm can

then copy. If all firms reason this way, then no firm will want to take the lead and subsidize its

competitor’s R&D, and the result will be a waiting game. Innovation will be delayed, possibly

forever. In this case, antitrust agencies may face a choice between (1) allowing the waiting firms

to merge and internalize the free-riding problem, which would then hasten innovation but end

product-market competition, and (2) blocking the merger, which would preserve product-market

competition for existing products but might permanently delay the development and introduction

of new products. In other words, the choice is whether to promote long-run innovation or protect

short-run product pricing competition.

       As we discuss below, actual enforcement choices may not be as polarized as in this

hypothetical. In particular, alternative institutions, such as research joint ventures—under which

competing suppliers jointly invest in innovation and share the results among themselves—may

allow firms to cooperate in the conduct of R&D while remaining product-market competitors.

Hence, the evaluation of these alternative institutions may be an important component of merger

analysis in certain situations where innovation is an important dimension of market performance.


       Each of the three cases above implies a distinct kind of merger inquiry and hence

illustrates the different ways in which innovation could factor into merger policy. The first two

                                                     8
cases above represent the ends of a spectrum that begins with conventional considerations of

actual or potential competition in product markets, where innovation serves as supporting

evidence, and runs all the way to cases in which innovation is the sole or central concern of the

merger analysis. The third case illustrates that there can be situations in the middle where there

potentially are significant tradeoffs between static and dynamic competition or there is a need to

evaluate alternative institutions in terms of both types of efficiency considerations

simultaneously.


III.   A BRIEF REVIEW OF THE U.S. LEGAL PROCESS AND PREVIEW OF THE
       ISSUES RAISED BY INNOVATION

       To understand the implications of innovation for the application of merger policy, we

next present a brief survey of the current U.S. merger review process and its substantive

guidelines. Although our focus is on the United States, it is worth observing that the European

Commission and many other competition policy agencies in other nations have modeled their

merger review processes in whole or in part on the U.S. approach.


       A.       Legal and Economic Underpinnings

       The choice of welfare standard is a central feature of any public policy toward mergers.

Economists generally favor some notion of economy-wide efficiency, while the statutes often are

interpreted as imposing a consumer-welfare standard.9 Although some antitrust commentators

write as if the pursuit of economic efficiency and the maximization of consumer welfare are




9
       Under the total welfare standard, efficiency gains benefit firms and, insofar as they are passed on in lower
       prices or higher quality, also their customers. Both are equally valued. See, Oliver Williamson (1968)
       “Economies as an antitrust defense: the welfare trade-offs,” American Economic Review, 58:18-36. Under
       the alternative consumer welfare standard, the competition authority takes into account only those benefits
       passed on to consumers.


                                                            9
identical objectives, they are not.10 The critical difference is that an economic efficiency

objective considers the effects of actions on the welfare of both producers and consumers, while

a consumer-welfare standard considers only the latter. As we will discuss below, the choice

between these two standards can have profound effects on merger analysis, particularly when

innovation is significant.

       The fundamental premise of merger policy, and of antitrust policy in general, is that

increased competition results in improved economic performance.11 Specifically, antitrust policy

is grounded on the belief that competitive markets do the best job of producing and delivering at

the lowest feasible prices the goods and services consumers want. The vast majority of mergers

that are challenged in the U.S. by federal antitrust agencies are challenged under Section 7 of the

Clayton Act, which makes it illegal for one company to acquire some or all of the assets of a

competitor where the effects “may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a

monopoly.”12

       Both the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (“Justice Department”) and

the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) are charged with enforcing the Clayton Act. The Justice

Department can seek to block a merger by filing a complaint in federal district court. The FTC




10
       See, e.g., Damien J. Neven and Lars-Hendrik Roller (2000) “Institution Design: The Allocation of
       jurisdiction in international antitrust.” European Economic Review, 44: 845-855.
11
       See, e.g., Antitrust Enforcement and the Consumer, available at:
       <http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/div_stats/9142.pdf> (2001), §§ 1, 2, 4; Antitrust Guidelines for
       Collaborations Among Competitors on the FTC web site (04/2000), available at:

       15 U.S.C. § 18. Mergers can also be challenged under §1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §1, which bars
       “[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or
       commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations.”


                                                           10
can bring a case before its own administrative law judges or in a federal district court.13 The

cases filed in district court only rarely proceed to trial. Typically an agency’s filing of a

complaint either causes the merger to be called off or to be resolved through a consent decree

that incorporates remedies against potential post-merger harm to competition. Examples of each

outcome, respectively, are the recently scuttled merger between Echostar and DirecTV, against

which the Justice Department filed a complaint in 2003, and the merger between Pfizer and

Warner-Lambert, completed in 2000 subject to remedies after the FTC filed a complaint against

that transaction.

       The Justice Department and FTC have issued a set of Horizontal Merger Guidelines,

(“Merger Guidelines”) that purport to provide a blueprint for how the agencies will conduct

their analysis of a merger.14 It should be observed that the Merger Guidelines do not have the

force of law and, indeed, the Merger Guidelines explicitly (and accurately) state that the

agencies may pursue different lines of argument in litigation.15 Nonetheless, the Merger

Guidelines are broadly adopted by the agencies and the courts.16




13
       In addition, there can be private challenges to mergers (although they face antitrust-injury and standing
       hurdles), which may be motivated by very different considerations than governmental challenges. Our
       focus here is on public policy.

       In practice, merger policy in the United States focuses on how the merging parties’

combination will affect concentration in one or more relevant markets.17 This is done because an

increase in concentration in the relevant product and geographic markets is taken as a proxy for a

decrease in competition that—if large enough—will lead to a significant increase in the prices

faced by consumers.18 In U.S. v. Philadelphia National Bank, for example, the Supreme Court

defined the relevant product as a cluster of services that constitute “commercial banking” and

defined the relevant geographical market as the four-county area in which the merging parties

had offices.19 The Court held that a merger between the region’s first and second largest banks,

which would have given the merged entity a 35 percent market share measured in terms of

assets, created impermissible concentration and had to be enjoined.20 As we shall discuss, there

is ongoing debate on the degree to which changes in concentration levels are good predictors of

the likely competitive effects of a merger, especially when innovation is an important feature of

the industry under examination.


       B.       The Legal Analytical Process

       There is a largely standardized process by which courts evaluate mergers when the

agencies bring legal challenges. We briefly outline the stages in that process.

       For the most part, economic theory and antitrust policy have long favored more competition over less for
       the purpose of lowering prices, expanding output, and making consumers better off. There are, however,
       limited exceptions to this view. For example, certain industries, in which per-unit cost declines as output
       increases to the point that it is most efficient to have just one firm producing all output in a given market,
       have come to be known as “natural monopolies.” Historically, telecommunications networks were a
       leading example, and public policy actually served to limit entry. That view has since changed. For
       instance, the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C. §§ 151 et seq, seeks to promote competitive
       entry.

               1.       Market Definition

       Market share calculations typically play a central role in merger litigation. In order to

calculate shares, it is necessary to define the relevant market of which various suppliers have

shares.21 Thus, defining the boundaries of one or more markets with respect to their product and

geographic scopes is a first step under the Merger Guidelines and is typically also an issue early

in any antirust case in the U.S. courts.22

       A long-standing principle by which economists define the product scope of a market is to

include two goods or services in the same relevant market if consumers view them as sufficiently

close substitutes and not to include them in the same relevant market if consumers do not view

them as sufficiently close substitutes.23 A similar logic is used for geographic scope. When are

substitutes "sufficiently" close to be included in the same market? To some extent, chocolates

compete with automobiles for consumers’ dollars, but one should not conclude that chocolates

and automobiles are in the same product market. To give more precision to the concept of

sufficiently close substitutes, economists undertaking market delineation exercises often conduct

a so-called hypothetical monopolist test. This test asks whether a hypothetical, profit-

maximizing monopolist over a group of products in a given area could profitably raise price

above a specified level by a ‘small but significant’ amount for a sustained period of time.24 The

group of products considered in the test is a candidate relevant market. The smallest group of

products that satisfies the test constitutes a relevant market.25

       A price increase will raise a hypothetical monopolist’s profits unless unit sales volume

falls sufficiently to offset the higher price received for the units sold.26 Thus, the hypothetical

monopolist test indicates that a set of products or a geographical area constitutes a relevant

market if the hypothetical monopolist could make a small but significant and non-transitory

increase in price without causing enough consumers to switch to substitute goods that the price

increase becomes unprofitable.

       The hypothetical monopolist test is used both by enforcement agencies and by the courts

that review agency actions. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, for example,

reversed the FTC’s injunction of a merger between two hospitals in a single town on the grounds

that the FTC had failed to show that its narrow definition of the relevant market could satisfy the

hypothetical monopolist test.27

       Although the courts and enforcement agencies emphasize defining relevant markets, it is

widely believed among economists that a proper economic analysis does not require formal

market definition and that an over-reliance on the mechanics of market definition can be an

obstacle to good analysis. Professor Jonathan Baker, a former Director of the U.S. Federal Trade

Commission’s Bureau of Economics, observed:

       Indeed, if a merger can be shown to harm competition directly, antitrust should
       not need to spend much effort on market definition … [I]f the likely harm to
       competition from a merger can be demonstrated directly, there exists a market
       where harm will occur, but there is little need to specify the market’s precise

       boundaries.28

Similarly, Professor Janusz Ordover, a former Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Economic

Analysis at the Department of Justice, wrote:

       From the perspective of economic theory, antitrust law’s preoccupation with
       market definition has always seemed somewhat peculiar. Arguments for and
       against a merger that turn upon distinctions between broad and narrow market
       definitions are, to an economic purist, an inadequate substitute for, and a
       diversion from, sound direct assessment of a merger’s effect.29

Nonetheless, market definition continues to play an important role in practice. Indeed, it is often

said that the outcome of merger litigation turns almost entirely on whether the market is defined

narrowly or broadly.30


               2.        The “Analysis” of Market Shares

       Once a relevant market has been defined, one can calculate shares. Legally, there is a

rebuttable presumption that a high resulting level of concentration indicates a competitive

problem.31 In addition, the Department of Justice and the FTC often take increases in

concentration as a reason to be concerned about a merger when deciding whether to pursue an

enforcement action.32 There is no general theorem of economics proving that higher

concentration leads to higher prices or less output. There are, however, a number of reasons to

expect this relationship absent innovation. First, many, but not all, formal economic models of

markets likely to attract merger scrutiny (i.e., those markets in which only a few firms compete)

indicate that equilibrium output falls and equilibrium prices rise as the number of firms declines.

This is especially true in markets where firms cannot quickly and easily adjust output levels as

they vie to take the market share of the exiting firm. Empirically, there is substantial evidence to

support the theoretical correlation of prices and market concentration,33 as U.S. consumers have

readily experienced in such markets as long-distance and wireless telephone services, air travel,

and pharmaceuticals. To be sure, in other models and under specified conditions, increased

concentration may not lead to higher prices and entry may not lead to lower prices. Hence, the

use of market shares as only the starting point for the analysis of market power.


               3.       The Analysis of Other Market Conditions

       If the plaintiffs establish that a merger will lead to high levels of concentration, then the

defendants attempt to rebut the presumption of a competitive problem by pointing to other

factors, such as the possibility of entry by new competitors or certain market characteristics that

can make it difficult to raise prices (e.g., the presence of large, sophisticated buyers who can

exert bargaining pressure). As the Merger Guidelines recognize, “market share and

concentration data provide only the starting point for analyzing the competitive impact of a

merger.”34 A complete analysis considers both the abilities and incentives of competitors to

expand their output levels and/or change the attributes of their products in response to price

changes by the merging parties that would harm consumers.

               4.       Efficiencies

       If the analysis of market shares and other market characteristics demonstrates that a

proposed merger will not give rise to a significant competitive problem, one can conclude that

the merger will not harm competition and consumers. But if a significant competitive problem is

predicted by the preceding stages of analysis, then one must conduct another stage of review to

predict correctly whether a proposed merger will benefit or harm consumers. Simply put, a

merger that is expected to give the merging parties the ability to raise prices profitably might

nonetheless lead to lower prices or at least to greater social welfare if the merger gives rise to

sufficient cost savings of the right sort. These cost savings are referred to as ‘efficiencies.’35

       Not all cost savings count as efficiencies. First, there is a requirement that the savings be

merger specific. 36 If there is a simple, arms-length transaction that would allow the parties to

reap the cost savings in some way that would not raise competitive concerns, then those cost

savings do not justify the merger. As should be readily apparent, it often can be very difficult to

assess whether there is a practical alternative for realizing the cost savings. More generally, it is

typically very difficult to predict with any certainty the magnitude of cost savings likely to result

from a proposed merger because doing so entails making predictions about the results of

combining complex operations and corporate cultures.




35
       The Merger Guidelines describe the process as follows:
           The Agency will not challenge a merger if cognizable efficiencies are of a character and
           magnitude such that the merger is not likely to be anticompetitive in any relevant market. To
           make the requisite determination, the Agency considers whether cognizable efficiencies likely
           would be sufficient to reverse the merger's potential to harm consumers in the relevant market,
           e.g., by preventing price increases in that market. [§4, Internal footnote omitted.]

               5.      Remedies

       Several public policy responses are available if analysis indicates that the effect of a

merger in its proposed form may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a

monopoly. One, of course, is simply to block the transaction. Often, however, less drastic steps

are available that can allow a modified version of the transaction to take place. In theory, such

remedies allow the realization of efficiencies while averting the harms that might otherwise arise

from the loss of competition between the two merging suppliers. Potential remedies include the

divestiture of assets where competitive overlaps are particularly significant, the mandatory

licensing of intellectual property to other firms to allow them to compete more effectively with

the merging parties, and limitations on the merged firm’s conduct (e.g., a requirement to offer

the same prices to all customers to prevent the merged firm from targeting customers whose only

practical options were the two merging suppliers).


       C.      The Interaction of Merger Policy and Intellectual Property Policy

       Merger policy is part of a broader legal framework governing business behavior.

Intellectual property law is another part of that framework of particular relevance to the

interaction of merger policy and innovation. There are various methods for obtaining intellectual

property rights, including in-house invention, licensing, and merger. Patents, copyright, and

trademarks all are assets subject to Clayton Section 7. Even though intellectual property rights

are sometimes said to give the holder the right to a monopoly, there is no free pass for a merger

because it involves intellectual property.




                                                     18
       In the past, a widely held view was that there was a fundamental tension between

intellectual property rights and antitrust policy, such as merger enforcement.37 In this view,

intellectual property rights regimes create monopolies to spur innovation, while merger policy

seeks to prevent monopolies from forming. The modern view holds that both intellectual

property policy and merger policy seek to promote consumer welfare by creating an economic

environment in which innovative activities are stimulated by both competition and the promise

of returns to successful innovation.38 In this regard, both sets of policies have something else in

common: the relationships between public policy, market structure, and innovation are complex,

and it is sometimes difficult to know what policy best promotes innovation and consumer

welfare.

       The intellectual property rights regime can interact with merger enforcement in

interesting ways. The presence of strong intellectual property rights regimes, such as patent and

copyright, may facilitate licensing by increasing the extent to which licensing contracts are

enforceable. In contrast, licensing can be very difficult in situations where intellectual property

is protected through secrecy. For instance, a seller cannot afford to reveal its technology to a

potential licensee because the licensee may then simply appropriate the information. And it is

also difficult to limit a licensee’s further dissemination of the information. The feasibility of

licensing due to a strong intellectual property rights regime has at least two consequences for

merger policy. First, when the primary efficiencies claimed for a merger involve intellectual



37
       See, e.g., SCM Corp. v. Xerox Corp., 645 F.2d 1195, 1203 (2nd Cir. 1981)(“While the antitrust laws
       proscribe unreasonable restraints of competition, the patent laws reward the inventor with a temporary
       monopoly that insulates him from competitive exploitation of his patented art”).
38
       See, e.g., Atari Games Corp. v. Nintendo of America, Inc., 897 F.2d 1572, 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1990)(“[T]he
       aims and objectives of patent and antitrust laws may seem, at first glance, wholly at odds. However, the
       two bodies of law are actually complementary”).


                                                           19
property assets, the question arises whether licensing could serve as a less restrictive alternative

to a full merger. Second, when licensing is feasible, it can be used in fashioning a remedy to a

proposed merger that raises significant concerns of competitive harms.

       The fact that licensing can form the basis for merger remedies suggests that intellectual-

property policy and merger policy can be complementary. A firm may merge and still reap the

benefits of its innovation through licensing royalties, while that same licensing can preserve

competition in innovation that the transaction would otherwise harm. Moreover, as our later

discussion of specific mergers will show, licensing remedies have become an important tool in

the review and clearance of mergers in which innovation is a central feature. Only if one takes

the extreme position that IP-related competitive harm can never form the basis for blocking a

merger, ostensibly on grounds that such a basis would constitute a limitation of the IP right, do

merger policy and IP policy necessarily come into conflict.


IV.    THE IMPACT OF INNOVATION ON COMPETITION

       The merger-review process described in Section III has well-known problems that arise

whether or not innovation is significant. In the present section and the one following, we

identify particular challenges created by the presence of significant innovation. In the present

section, we address how the presence of significant actual or potential innovation affects

application of the legal analytical framework to the consideration of product-market competition

and traditional, static pricing concerns. In the next section, we will consider the issues that arise

for the legal analysis when one attempts to evaluate a merger in terms of its effects on

innovation.




                                                     20
       A.       Market Definition

       Significant innovation raises two issues with respect to market definition for an analysis

of static pricing efficiency. First, the hypothetical monopolist test typically is applied to price

changes ranging from five to ten percent. Some have questioned the value of such a test in

markets where quality-adjusted prices may fall 20 percent or more per year. We believe that this

objection is readily dealt with in theory, although practice is somewhat more difficult. Second,

and more important, rapid innovation can make it difficult to define relevant product markets

because business executives and government officials alike may not yet know what the future

products will be.

       In American and European Union competition policy, a ‘small but significant’ price

increase in the context of the hypothetical monopolist test is often taken to mean a price change

in the range of five to ten percent. 39 Several different criticisms have been made regarding




39
       Merger Guidelines, §1.11 (“In attempting to determine objectively the effect of a ‘small but significant and
       nontransitory’ increase in price, the Agency, in most contexts, will use a price increase of five percent
       lasting for the foreseeable future.”). European Commission, Commission Notice of the Definition of the
       Relevant Market for the Purposes of Community Competition Law, September 12, 1997
       (http://europa.eu.int/comm/competition/antitrust/relevma_en.html) (“The question to be answered is
       whether the parties’ customers would switch to readily available substitutes or to suppliers located
       elsewhere in response to an hypothetical small (in the range 5%–10%), permanent relative price increase in
       the products and areas being considered.”).
       For most mergers, pre-merger prices are taken at the benchmark. In cases where pre-merger prices reflect
       coordinated behavior, some measure of a competitive price is used instead. Merger Guidelines, §1.11.


                                                           21
application of this approach to markets with rapid technological progress, where prices might fall

by 20 percent or more annually.40

       One critique is that a five- or ten-percent price increase is “too small” when quality-

adjusted prices are routinely changing by much greater amounts.41 However, neither those

offering this critique, nor the Merger Guidelines themselves, discuss the rationale for

considering a price increase of any particular size. It is apparent that the intent of the

Guidelines’ approach is to consider a price change that would have a significant effect on

consumer welfare. It is less apparent that 10-percent increase becomes insignificant simply

because the baseline is rapidly falling. One should also keep in mind that the hypothetical

monopolist test is only one part of the competitive analysis.

       Another criticism is that the hypothetical monopolist approach to defining market

boundaries conducts a test based on the assumption that other suppliers hold their prices

constant, when such prices may, in fact be falling. This criticism is somewhat misplaced: under

the hypothetical monopolist test, the prices of potential substitute products are assumed not to

change in response to a change in the monopolist’s price, but this does not preclude the

possibility of technological progress as a driver of price changes over time. The criticism does,

however, raise an important question: what baseline prices for the hypothetical monopolist and



40
       In addition to the issues in the text, Hartman et al. offer another criticism of the standard hypothetical
       monopolist approach to market definition. Their criticism, however, appears to be based on a
       misunderstanding of the Merger Guidelines. Hartmand et al. write that "During [the 1970s] a variety of
       [minicomputer] systems competed on price and performance while exhibiting price differences of several
       hundred percent. Strict interpretation of the Merger Guidelines suggests that such price differences imply
       that the products are in different markets." (Raymond Hartman, David Teece, Will Mitchell, and Thomas
       Jorde (1993) “Assessing Market Power in Regimes of Rapid Technological Change,” Industrial and
       Corporate Change, 2:317-350 at 323.) The hypothetical monopolist test, however, is based on the effects
       of price changes, not existing price differentials.




                                                           22
other suppliers should be used in the defining the product scope of a market with rapid

technological progress? Specifically, should one use current or future prices?

       Because the concern of merger analysis is with post-merger market performance, there is

an argument that it is more appropriate to use projections of future prices. Of course, forming

reliable projections can sometimes be very difficult, and this difficulty can be compounded by

the fact that innovation can itself be affected by the merger. And, when there is ongoing

technological progress, the scope of the product market may continue to change, so that multiple

projections are necessary. However, relying on current prices can lead to market definitions that

are either too narrow (when there is rapid technological progress in substitute products) or too

broad (when the hypothetical monopolist’s product is subject to greater technological progress

than are substitute products).42

       A second difficulty that arises in defining relevant markets when innovation is important

is more fundamental. The issue is that the agencies and the courts may not know which products

will be viable substitutes in the near future. Under the traditional approach to market definition,

whether using the hypothetical monopolist test or some other algorithm, the central aim is to

identify existing products that are at present meaningful substitutes for one another from a

consumer’s perspective. When innovation is significant, the analysis may need to be much more

forward looking. Innovation may result in the creation of new products that compete in the




41
       See, e.g., Christopher Pleatsikas and David Teece (2001) “The Analysis of Market Definition and Market
       Power in the Context of Rapid Innovation,” International Journal of Industrial Organization, 19:665-693
       at 671.
42
       For the latter reason, Pleatsikas and Teece are incorrect when they assert that “defining markets from a
       static perspective when innovation is rapid will inevitably lead to identification of markets that are too
       narrow.” (Pleatsikas and Teece, supra note 41, at 687. [Footnote citing D. Teece and M. Coleman (1998)
       “The Meaning of Monopoly: Antitrust Analysis in High Technology Industries,” Antitrust Bulletin,
       43:801-857 at 826-828, omitted.])


                                                           23
relevant market, or innovation may lower the costs of producing existing products that are, at

present, too expensive to be considered viable substitutes for the products of the merging parties.

       The brevity of our discussion should not be taken as a sign that this problem is minor or

readily dealt with. Conceptually, the issues are straightforward and are compatible with the

Merger Guidelines’ market definition framework, as long as that framework is applied on a

forward-looking basis.43 However, the practical difficulties of projecting future substitution

possibilities in a fast-changing and highly uncertain environment should not be minimized.


       B.      The Use of Market Share in Dynamic Markets

        Once a market has been delineated, the suppliers participating in that market can be

identified and one can develop a measure or measures of market shares. The difficulties

identifying future substitutes discussed in the previous subsection have important analogues in

identifying market participants and calculating market shares.

       Relatively little attention tends to be paid to the identification of competitors in most

merger analyses, perhaps because this part of the analysis is relatively easy or at least is

perceived to be a simple counting exercise once market boundaries have been set. The

conventional focus is on actual rather than potential competitors, the latter of which are included

in the market only when certain conditions of imminence and probability are met. But when

innovation is important, identifying potential innovation and product-market competitors may be

particularly critical to understanding competition. Identifying potential competitors is often

difficult, and competitive potentiality in the innovation context often hinges on the possession of

certain skills and information assets that can be particularly hard to identify and measure. In the




                                                     24
other direction, the existence of ongoing innovation efforts can render claims of potential

product-market competition more readily verifiable.

       Innovation also raises a fundamental question with respect to the calculation and

interpretation of market shares as predictors of the static price and output effects of a merger.44

That question is whether current product-market shares are meaningful predictors of future

competitive conditions and thus relevant to the prediction of the price and output effects of a

merger. If a market is in constant turmoil due to dramatic innovation, the argument goes, then

what does one learn from current product sales?

       Even absent innovation, there are reasons to be cautious about the interpretation of

market share data. In order to generate sensible predictions of the effects of a merger, the

measurement and analysis of market shares should always be tied to a coherent theory of

competitive effects that fits the facts of the industry under consideration.45 Put another way, the

analysis of market shares can most confidently be used to predict adverse competitive effects of

a merger when one has an empirically supported theory that market shares are informative of

competitive conditions and that an increase in concentration will harm competition and

consumers.

       In general, high market share does not in itself suffice to show market power. One reason

is that many market share measures are backward-looking (e.g., shares of installed base) or at

best contemporaneous (e.g., shares of sales to customers who are new to the industry). As such,



43
       In this regard, there is some tension between a forward-looking approach and the Merger Guidelines’
       treatment of entry, which tends to take a limited perspective. (Merger Guidelines, § 3.)
44
       And, of course, the issues that innovation raises for the definition of relevant markets affect the resulting
       calculation of market shares.
45
       Under the process described by the Merger Guidelines, “Market shares will be calculated using the best
       indicator of firms’ future competitive significance.” Merger Guidelines, §1.41.

market shares reflect where firms were or are, but not necessarily where they are going. This is a

particularly critical shortcoming in industries characterized by significant innovation and

dramatic technological change. Innovation may render market shares unstable and hard to

predict. Even if the merged firms would have a dominant market share immediately post-merger,

another firm in the market could produce the next great new advance and leave the merged entity

behind.46 Indeed, market shares may be altogether irrelevant in some cases because there may be

markets in which innovation is so characteristic and sustained that firms compete not just for

market share, but for markets as a whole. A firm's monopoly today may say little about the

firm's prospects one, two, or five years from now.

       The Merger Guidelines recognize that in changing markets current market share may be

an inaccurate measure of a firm’s forward-looking competitive significance.47 There is a strong

consensus among economists that rival suppliers’ capacity to enter and expand in a market must

be considered in addition to market share data. It is especially imperative in markets

characterized by innovation that merger enforcement agencies look beyond market share data.


       C.       Remedies

       Innovation gives rise to intellectual property, which sometimes figures prominently in

merger remedies. Merging firms sometimes agree to divest or license intellectual property to

keep product-market competition from being lost. For example, in 2001, the U.S. Department of

Justice filed a complaint challenging the proposed acquisition of DTM Corporation ("DTM") by



46
       As discussed in Section V, the flip side of this is that a merger may have substantial effects on competition
       even if the post-merger market share is permissible within the enforcement guidelines. If the merger brings
       together two imminent technologies that otherwise would have competed, then consumers lose out on
       rivalry that otherwise would have come to exist absent the merger.
47
       Merger Guidelines, §1.521. The extent to which the agencies are willing to adopt forward-looking views
       of competition is the subject of some debate.

                                                            26
3D Systems Corporation ("3D").48 The firms competed in the sale of rapid prototyping ("RP")

systems, which transform a digitally encoded design into a three-dimensional object. The

process can be used to produce models and even low-volume production quantities by what

might be loosely thought of as three-dimensional laser printing.

       Both 3D and DTM held extensive patent portfolios related to RP systems production that

prevented firms that sold RP systems abroad from competing in the United States. As discussed

in Section VI.C, below, the Department of Justice was concerned that the merger would

significantly reduce competition. The Department of Justice and the parties reached a settlement

that required 3D and DTM to grant a non-exclusive license to manufacture and sell products

under the defendants' RP patent portfolios within specific fields of use.49 The idea was to allow

a foreign supplier to enter the U.S. market as a replacement for the loss of an independent

competitor through merger. The licensee was required to be a firm currently manufacturing

industrial RP systems in a foreign market, so that it would have a demonstrated ability to

compete.50

       As a general matter, there are two antitrust rationales for compulsory licensing: (a) to

remedy a refusal to license that itself is held to be exclusionary and to constitute an antitrust

violation, and (b) to ameliorate the effects of another action that is illegal or—absent licensing—

       Holdings, Inc. International Paper Company, and Masonite Corporation. Similarly, U.S. v Miller
       Industries involved acquisitions of tow truck companies holding important patents and led to a connsent
       degree with mandatory licensing.

would be prohibited under the antitrust laws. Licensing as a remedy in a merger case falls into

this second category.

       It is useful to distinguish between a duty to deal and licensing as a remedy because they

may have very different effects on incentives to innovate. A general duty to deal under antitrust

law compromises the scope of intellectual property rights and may create a priori disincentives

to engage in certain innovative efforts. In contrast, compulsory licensing as a remedy that allows

a merger to go through may not weaken innovation incentives and, theoretically, could even

increase them. The reason is the following. Suppose that the licensing allows a merger to be

completed that would otherwise be blocked. To the extent that licensing is a means of restoring

competition that is less costly to the defendant than are alternatives (e.g., dissolving the merger),

the defendant benefits from having created intellectual property that can be incorporated into a

remedy. While it is far from evident that these positive effects on R&D are significant, the

argument does suggest that any negative incentive effects may be insignificant.


       D.      Post-Merger Considerations

       Innovation considerations may also affect antitrust policy towards a merged entity after

an acquisition is consummated. If a merger turns out to have anticompetitive effects, it is at least

theoretically possible to “unscramble the eggs” and order the newly formed enterprise to break

itself into its previous components or to divide along some other basis that will restore

competition. Such divestiture is easier when the harm to competition stems from consolidation

of physical assets that can be cleanly sold off. Post-merger divestiture is potentially a much

messier prospect when the harm stems from consolidation of R&D assets in the form of human

capital. Although a firm can be ordered to sell off a research unit, employees cannot be required




                                                     28
to remain with that unit, and the end result might be to weaken the merged entity without

restoring competition.

       There may also be difficult challenges in determining when and how the antimonopoly

provisions of Section 2 of the Sherman Act should apply to innovative firms.51 Suppose a

merged entity turns out to become dominant. Separating the degree to which the dominance

flows from beneficial innovation or from anticompetitive actions can be difficult. Much of the

public debate surrounding the Department of Justice’s pursuit of Microsoft, for example,

involved precisely that question. Even defining a violation can be particularly difficult. Is

integration of increasingly advanced functions into a product efficient innovation or

anticompetitive tying or bundling? And once a violation is proven, it can be especially difficult

to design a remedy in fast-moving environments of technological change. Antitrust authorities

face the challenge of crafting remedies that constrain anticompetitive behavior without reducing

innovation or network benefits that may have accrued to consumers.

       The scope of this chapter does not allow a detailed analysis of how innovation affects

application of antitrust laws generally. But the purpose of our brief discussion here is to show

that, in considering the role antitrust might play in the post-merger environment, innovation

cannot be ignored as a force there as well as in the merger context. The complexity that

innovation may introduce into the possibilities for later antitrust scrutiny of the merged firm in

turn lends particular importance to getting the merger review right in the first place.

V.     THE IMPACT OF COMPETITION ON INNOVATION

       We next consider the issues that arise for the legal analytical process of merger review

when one attempts to evaluate a merger in terms of its effects on innovation. As we shall

discuss, incorporating innovation effects into the analysis poses fundamental challenges,

although challenges that we believe ultimately can be met.


       A.      Market Definition

       The purpose of defining relevant markets is to identify the boundaries of competition.

When competition takes the form of innovation, there is a fundamental issue whether a focus on

product markets is appropriate. An argument in favor of taking a product-market focus is that

the ultimate aim of innovation is to create products and processes that allow the innovator (or its

licensees) to compete successfully in one or more product markets. An argument against this

approach is that the notion of a well-defined product market is too limiting because the

successful products of the future cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. A potential

response is to consider markets defined in terms of innovation capabilities rather than specific

products. But even here, one must ultimately tie the analysis to some notion of (potentially)

competing products in order to know which innovation capabilities are important. One way of

reconciling these two views is to observe that product markets matter, but that future boundaries

and the possibility of potential competition play much greater roles than in static analyses.

       Consider two firms wishing to merge that have strong R&D capabilities in similar areas,

but that are not significant product-market competitors with one another, either because they do

not compete in any product market in common or because the markets in which they do compete

with one another are unconcentrated. From the standpoint of static price competition, there is

presumptively no public policy rationale for blocking the merger. But if the firms are the only

                                                    30
two, or among the few firms, that have the capability to undertake substantial innovation efforts,

then the antitrust agencies might nonetheless be concerned with the consumer-welfare effects of

the proposed merger.

       Antitrust enforcers might be concerned either that: (1) the two firms would have

otherwise engaged in competing R&D efforts that would have led to their becoming direct

product-market competitors, or (2) the merged firm will reduce R&D to the detriment of

consumers. The first of these concerns is about potential competition in the particular product

market(s) at issue in the merger. The second concern, however, is about innovation. Moreover,

this concern arises even when—in the non-merger counterfactual—the innovation under

consideration might not lead to product-market competition. These two concerns raise legal and

economic issues for market definition and the subsequent competitive effects analysis.

       A first issue arises from the fact that potential competition cases are difficult to bring

successfully in the United States. Courts tend to be skeptical of claims that a merger will harm

consumers by reducing future competition between two merging firms that are not at present

competing with one another.52 A second issue is that it may be extremely difficult to define a

product market if one does not yet know what the product will be. In response to these

difficulties, Richard Gilbert and Steven Sunshine, then working at the Department of Justice,

introduced the concept of innovation markets.53 Instead of potential competition in product

markets, the concept shifts attention to actual competition in innovation markets. As discussed



52
       General principles of antitrust law require “clear proof” or at least a “reasonable probability” that entry into
       the new market would in fact have occurred in the near future and disallow speculation about “ephemeral
       possibilities.” (United States v. Marine Bancorp, 418 U.S. 602, 617, 623 (1974); Tenneco, Inc. v. FTC, 689
       F.2d 346, 352 (2d Cir. 1982); In re B.A.T. Industries, 104 F.T.C. 852, 919-928 (1984).)

                                                             31
above, one can question whether a separate concept is needed on the grounds that all competitive

concerns ultimately tie to some market in which goods and services are offered to consumers.

And, in practice, although innovation markets were used in United States v. General Motors

Corp., since then they have been little mentioned.54

       Whether or not a separate concept is useful, the underlying idea that the set of

competitors is sometimes best identified by examining which firms have the skills and assets

needed to compete effectively is a sound one. Thus, one of the challenges that arises in applying

the current merger review framework to innovation is to adapt a concept of market definition

based on consumers' substitution among existing products to one based on firms' capabilities to

engage in innovation to create new substitute products. Under a forward-looking approach,

instead of identifying what products compete with each other today and which firms produce

those products, antitrust authorities would have to determine which assets and skills are needed

to innovate and how many firms possess those skills and assets. These are fundamentally

different inquiries, one of which is based on the behavior of consumers and the other of which is

based on the capabilities of firms.


       B.       Market Share and the Concentration-Competition Presumption

       Even if the market in which innovation takes place can be well defined, the question

arises of how changes in market structure will affect performance of that market. The use of

market share data to predict a merger’s likely effects on innovation competition raises two

fundamental issues. The first is whether one should consider concentration of product sales or

concentration of R&D capabilities. R&D is conducted with an eye toward the future. Thus, one



54
       We will return to this point in our review of selected innovation cases below.


                                                            32
can raise serious doubts about the value of current product-market sales as indicia of the state of

innovation competition.55 Moreover, the threat of entry or potential competition may be a

stronger spur to innovation efforts than to lowering current prices and increasing current

output.56 Indeed, even R&D programs that never succeed in developing new products or

processes may nonetheless benefit consumers by stimulating potential rivals to innovate.

Although these are important issues, they are similar to those just discussed in the context of

market definition.

       Our focus in the remainder of this section is thus on the second issue: is concentration—

whether measured by product-market sales or the number of viable R&D competitors—a reliable

basis for predicting the strength of innovation competition. Even if market shares were likely to

remain stable post-merger and the transaction truly would concentrate the market in a sustained

way, that concentration may affect innovation incentives differently from how it affects static

economic variables like price and output.

       A central tenet of merger policy is that markets characterized by atomistic competition

generally promote consumer welfare better than do concentrated markets.57 The presumption

that increased benefits come from an increased number of competitors is weaker, however, when

the policy goal is not just lower prices for a given set of goods produced under a fixed set of

       Journal of Economic Literature, XIII:1–37, at 20, (“concentration reflects the current sellers of a product
       and may be quite unrelated to the extent of actual and potential rivalry in innovating new products”.) See
       also, Evans and Schmalensee, supra note 51, at 16-18, and Hartman, Teece, Mitchell, and Jorde, supra
       note 40, at 322 and 323.
56
       Under the theory of “limit pricing” incumbent firms set low prices today to deter future entry. In many
       circumstances, however, the threat entry will have little effect pre-entry prices, and potential competition
       plays a relatively small role in price setting.
57
       There are some exceptions. Even in static settings, for instance, perfect competition does not attain the
       first best in the presence of externalities, and distortions due to concentration may in some cases offset
       those due to externalities.

                                                             33
technologies, but also efficient innovative activity by firms over time. Economic theory has long

raised questions about the degree to which increased product-market competition or an increase

in the number of firms undertaking R&D leads to an increase in overall R&D investment.58 Both

the theoretical and empirical bases for predicting that an increase in concentration will lead to

less innovation are mixed.

       Consider, first, the theoretical basis. Economic theory identifies situations in which high

market shares are conducive to R&D investment. For instance, the possibility of sudden and

sweeping entry, combined with large up-front investment demands, can necessitate high initial

returns to allow costs to be recouped before the next innovator supplants the incumbent investor.

A firm with a large market share and significant market power may better amortize the fixed

costs of the R&D and appropriate a high percentage of the R&D’s benefits. Conversely, it has

been said that “[the] best of all monopoly profits is a quiet life,”59 and considerable anecdotal

evidence suggests that competition drives organizations to be more innovative than do protected

monopoly positions.

       The idea that the economic conditions that maximize innovation over time may not be the

same conditions that allocate resources efficiently in the short run was suggested over 50 years

ago by Joseph Schumpeter, who wrote that, for purposes of promoting economic welfare,

“perfect competition is not only impossible but inferior, and has no title to being set up as the




58
        For example, in their 1975 survey of work on innovation and market structure, Kamien and Schwartz
       stated that “Few, if any, economists maintain that perfect competition efficiently allocates resources for
       technical advance.” (Kamien and Schwartz (1975), supra note 55, at 2.) Today, economists have a deeper
       appreciation for licensing and other forms of innovation diffusion, so there might be less agreement with
       such a sweeping statement because there are multiple possible interpretations of what is meant by perfect
       competition in this context.

model of ideal efficiency.”60 Schumpeter’s argument that most technological innovation would

come from large corporations with market power and organized R&D operations implied that

antitrust law’s ideal of competition could have substantial social costs over time.61

       Theoretical research has shown that, depending on various conditions, either monopoly

power or competition may leads to greater total innovation.62 Although Schumpeter wrote

mostly about large firms, and their associated economies of scale for R&D and ability to attract

capital and talented scientists, his critique of perfect competition and discussion of the benefits

of market power suggest that his ideal innovators were not only large, but dominant as well.

Early theoretical explorations of Schumpeter’s claim found that when the polar cases of

monopoly and perfect competition were compared, the latter provided stronger incentives for

cost-reducing innovations.63 Subsequent models found oligopoly—competition among a few

firms—to be the market structure most conducive to development of new products and

processes.64

61
       Of course, antitrust policy’s competitive ideal has evolved over time. When Schumpeter was writing, the
       ideal was rivalry among small, atomized economic actors. Any cooperation or concentration that deviated
       from that standard was inherently suspect. The Chicago School revolution did much to improve
       understanding of why different market structures might result in different contexts and, thereby, to reduce
       rigid adherence to the perfectly competitive model. Competition, because of its benefits for allocative
       efficiency, nonetheless remained the touchstone of antitrust policy.

       Although there have been many advances and refinements to the model described

above,65 much of the research on market structure and innovation has a straightforward intuition

behind it. On the one hand, a firm facing strong product-market rivalry has incentive to develop

new products and processes that will help it improve or defend its market position. Similarly, a

firm engaged in a race with several others to develop a new, patentable technology, will be under

pressure to act quickly in order to win the race. On the other hand, suppliers with many product-

market rivals may have less ability to appropriate the gains from innovation that make the

investment worthwhile, either because their innovations are readily copied or invented around by

rivals, or because atomistic competitors lack the other assets needed to exploit their innovations

fully (e.g., a firm with a small share of the product market may not amortize its cost-reducing

innovation over very many units of output). Similarly, if many firms are racing to obtain a

patent, each firm may conclude that its chances of winning the race are sufficiently small that it

is not profitable to invest as much in R&D as it would absent so many competitors.

       Strong intellectual property rights can reduce some of the risks from innovation,

specifically those associated with rapid imitation. And licensing may make if possible and

profitable to diffuse an innovation throughout an industry with many firms. Even if intellectual

property rights give the innovator a temporary monopoly, however, rivals may develop similar or

better advances and may get around the originator's patent. This is a risk that exists for

competitive firms and monopolists alike. But the risk that another firm will successfully

innovate may grow with the number of firms competing in the relevant product market and, at

some point, the expected return to innovation may not justify the cost.



65
       See Scherer (1992), supra note 62, and Jennifer F. Reinganum (1989) “The Timing of Innovation:
       Research, Development, and Diffusion,” in Handbook of Industrial Organization, Vol. I, Schmalensee and


                                                        36
       A firm with significant product-market power or few R&D rivals, by contrast, probably

has a better chance of recouping R&D investment. Large, established firms might be

particularly adept at marshaling resources for incremental innovation or for helping to bring a

small firm’s invention to market. And even a profit-maximizing monopolist—especially an

unregulated one—has an incentive to engage in cost-reducing innovations. But, because a

monopolist already has the market share for which competitive firms strive, it may have less

incentive to pursue product innovations and improvements than firms facing competition.

Further, a monopolist will have an incentive to innovate strategically to protect its monopoly by

excluding rivals and by avoiding cannibalization of its existing business, perhaps delaying

implementation of those innovations it does develop. It might therefore be a qualitatively

inferior innovator from the perspective of consumers and overall economic welfare.66

       Although economic intuition suggests an overarching presumption that innovation will be

most intense in firms with a mix of competitive incentives and supra-competitive returns, it is

also clear that, depending on assumptions, the theoretical balance could swing towards either

greater competition or monopoly in a given case.

       Unfortunately, empirical data do not resolve the ambiguous theoretical relationship

between competition and innovation. Many analyses supported the Schumpeterian view by

finding a positive correlation between market concentration and R&D investment.67 Other

66
       It should be observed that, in terms of efficiency, the social value of innovation is the incremental
       improvement that it represents over the existing technology. Hence, the fact that a monopolist is concerned
       with cannibalization is not entirely indicative of an efficiency problem.
67
       See, e.g., Edwin Mansfield (1968) Industrial Research and Technological Innovation, New York: Norton.

analyses, however, found data to show concentration to have a negative effect on innovation.68

An early and influential study by F.M. Scherer indicated that both could be correct over a

sufficiently large range of market structures because the relationship between innovation and

concentration is non-linear. His study, which corroborated the theoretical intuition discussed

above, found the relationship between market structure and innovation to follow an “inverted-U”

pattern: innovation is observed to be low at high levels of competition, to reach its peak at

intermediate levels of oligopoly (where the four leading firms control roughly half the market),

and then to fall off as market structure approaches monopoly.69 Several studies replicated and

confirmed Scherer’s results.70

       Later work, however, raised serious doubts about these findings. Indeed, in their review

of the empirical literature, Cohen and Levin concluded that “Together, these results leave little

support for the view that industrial concentration is an independent, significant, and important

determinant of innovative behavior and performance.” 71 There are several reasons for

exercising caution in the interpretation of the empirical literature. First, there are issues

regarding the statistical significance of the parameter estimates leading to a U-shaped

relationship and whether they are, in fact, picking up the effects of omitted variables such as

technological opportunity.72 Second, extreme care must be taken interpreting cross-sectional

studies because the causality between market structure and innovation rates can run in both

directions.73 One detailed analysis of British data found that the higher profit expectations in

concentrated markets increased innovative activity but that, over time, innovation reduced

concentration levels in the sample industries.74 Many empirical studies fail to account for the

fact that market structure itself might be affected by the perceived possibilities for innovation

and that market structure might therefore be a result rather than a cause of innovation incentives.

Moreover, the literature addressing how market structure affects innovation (and vice versa) in

the end reveals an ambiguous relationship in which factors unrelated to competition play an

important role.

       The systematic presumption that favors increased competition for purposes of static

pricing and output efficiency thus has no analog when it comes to creating the optimal

conditions for innovation. By the same token, it should be observed that “Schumpeterian”

claims that merger policy should favor increased concentration as a means of promoting

innovation equally lacks firm empirical grounding. Where this leaves merger authorities is the



72
       See Kamien and Schwartz (1975), supra note 55, at 20-22. Kamien and Schwartz summarized their survey
       of the empirical literature as follows: “In reviewing the diverse findings on research efforts and
       concentration, we find little consensus” (at 22), and “Our review of the impact of market structure on
       innovation has netted little more than reaffirmation of the early observation that both competitive pressures
       and market opportunity seem important.” (at 24). Somewhat surprisingly, they then concluded their
       survey with “A new empirically inspired hypothesis has emerged to the effect that a market structure
       intermediate between monopoly and perfect competition would promote the highest rate of innovative
       activity.” (at 32).
73
       In terms of theory, a recent demonstration of this possibility is provided in a paper by Jan Boone, which
       finds that an increase in the intensity of competition can drive a leading firm to increase its innovation by
       relatively more than its rivals and thus increase future concentration. (Jan Boone (2001) “Intensity of
       competition and the incentive to innovate,” International Journal of Industrial Organization, 19:705-726.)

following. Meaningful general presumptions have not been identified: innovation is affected by

a variety of market factors other than concentration, as well as variables related to a firm’s

regulatory status, products, and technologies. While more rivalry rather than less will often

remain the applicable rule of thumb, enforcement authorities cannot as confidently presume as a

matter of economic theory that more competition is good or that market power is bad for R&D.

Nonetheless, although it is impossible to make definitive general statements about the linkage

between market structure and innovation, one often can make reasonable, unambiguous

predictions about the effects of specific transactions or alternative institutional arrangements

within a particular industry structure based on a fact-intensive investigation.


       C.      Other Market Characteristics and Competitive Effects Analysis

       Even more so than with price competition, it is necessary to look beyond market share

data to understand innovation competition. Here we make two points very briefly. One, for the

reasons discussed above, it is important to understand the distribution of R&D assets among

various actual and potential rivals. Second, there are reasons to predict that suppliers will find it

more difficult to coordinate their strategies to reduce R&D investments than to raise prices in the

static sense. Although the underlying principles are generally the same, R&D activities have

certain characteristics that give rise to differences in practice. For example, R&D efforts may be

more complex and more difficult for rivals to observe than are prices, and this greater

complexity and difficulty observing actions both tend to make coordinated strategies more

difficult.75 Similarly, the stochastic nature of R&D output can greatly increase the difficulty of

reaching and monitoring an agreement to restrict R&D efforts.


       D.       Innovation: Too much of a Good Thing?

       Once a merger's likely effect on innovation has been predicted, an issue arises that does

not come up in the analysis of conventional, static concerns. Although it is extremely

counterintuitive to many people, a large body of economics literature has established that profit-

maximizing firms may invest more in R&D than is socially efficient.76 An important implication

is that the social welfare effects of an innovation-reducing merger may be positive. This situation

can arise, for example, in patent races due to “business stealing” effects. In a race to obtain a

pharmaceutical patent, for example, preempting its rivals by a day may allow a pharmaceutical

firm to obtain intellectual property rights whose value far exceeds the social benefits of having

the patented drug available one day sooner.77 Moreover, in some cases, an innovation may allow

a supplier to increase its share of the economic pie without increasing the total pie (e.g., a

product or database innovation may facilitate price discrimination having these effects). Such an

innovation might have private value for the innovator, but no overall social value.

       In most cases, firms will have little incentive to over-invest in R&D broadly. The

theoretical possibility of excessive private incentives notwithstanding, as an empirical matter

private incentives to invest in R&D typically are too low.78 This situation arises because,



75
       Kamien and Schwartz (1975), supra note 55, at 15, attribute this general idea to Galbraith.
76
       For a survey, see Reinganum (1989), supra note 65.

       Similar effects may arise when being first to market creates a durable advantage in terms of favorable
       consumer perceptions.

       R&D,” Quarterly Journal of Economics 113: 1119-1135.

generally, private firms are unable fully to appropriate the benefits that their R&D generates for

the economy.79 Moreover, consumers almost always benefit from additional R&D. Even in

patent race models in which firms engage in more than the socially efficient levels of R&D

expenditures, consumers would be better off if firms invested still more and thus brought the

fruits of innovation to the market even faster.80 Finally, there is a specific set of conditions

under which firms can have socially excessive incentives, and one can examine any particular

market to determine if those conditions are present. Whether enforcement authorities would want

to act when such conditions for over-investment in innovation hold, however, raises the possible

tension between consumer welfare and social welfare when merger policy focuses on innovation

rather than static competition. We discuss this possible tradeoff from allowing mergers that

reduce inefficient innovation in the section below.


       E.       Efficiencies

       Merging parties sometimes identify increased innovation capabilities as a significant

efficiency that will result from their transaction. Thus, there can be a need to predict whether a

merger will improve the combined firm’s innovation capabilities in ways that will generate

consumer benefits. This can be a difficult undertaking for several reasons. Indeed, the agencies

themselves have expressed skepticism about this type of merger efficiency and have asserted that



79
       Dennis Carlton and Robert Gertner point out that empirical studies generally compare average private and
       social returns, while the privately and socially optimal R&D levels depend on marginal returns. (Dennis
       W. Carlton and Robert H. Gertner (2003) “Intellectual Property, Antitrust and Strategic Behavior” in
       Innovation Policy and the Economy, Vol. 3, Jafee, Lerner, and Stern (ed.s), Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.)
       In settings where R&D investment is driven by preemption incentives, the private marginal returns may
       deviate from the private average returns by more than the marginal social returns deviate from the average
       social returns, suggesting that perhaps there is a problem of excessive private incentives. It is far from
       evident, however, that patent preemption incentives are of empirical significance in many industries.
80
       The source of the socially excessive R&D is the fact that the innovating firm’s rivals may see their profits
       fall as a result of the innovation, and the innovator does not count this reduction in total surplus as a cost.


                                                              42
“Other efficiencies, such as those relating to research and development, are potentially

substantial but are generally less susceptible to verification and may be the result of

anticompetitive output reductions.”81


               1.       Potential Sources of Efficiencies

       A first issue is how a merger will lower the costs of R&D or in other ways increase the

merging firms’ abilities to innovate successfully. There are at least three types of effect that the

merging parties might asset: (a) increased capabilities realized by combining complementary

assets; (b) larger firm size, which somehow gives rise to a greater ability to fund, or absorb the

risks of, R&D; or (c) less competition and greater product-market profits, which can then fund

R&D.

       With respect to combining complementary assets, a fundamental issue is whether there is

an alternative means (e.g., licensing of complementary intellectual property) that could achieve

the same efficiencies without removing a competitor. Mergers have specific institutional

features that may give rise to certain advantages in facilitating the exchange of complementary

assets, but the issue needs careful attention on a case-by-case basis.82

       There has been considerable debate about the relevance of firm size for innovation.83

Following Schumpeter, some observers have praised large enterprises for their superior ability to

attract the financial and human capital, bear the risk, and recoup the investment required for

sustained R&D activities.84 Other analysts tout small firms as being more creative than larger,

more bureaucratic enterprises.85 Many empirical studies have addressed the relationship

between firm size and innovation. Most recent research yields a consensus that, in general, R&D

rises only proportionally with firm size, and only up to a point.86 The strength of the causal

relationship between firm size and R&D remains somewhat questionable despite the observed

correlations. Because many variables correlate with firm size, it is unclear in many studies

whether firm size itself is a statistically significant factor in innovation. Although early studies

did purport to find significance,87 others have found that when other firm and industry

characteristics are factored in, firm size does not significantly affect R&D investment.88

Moreover, when the focus of analysis shifts from innovation inputs such as R&D expenditures to

outputs such as patents, large firms show no advantage at all over small ones.89 Data matching

R&D investment with patent output has in fact shown that smaller firms produce more

innovations per R&D dollar and per employee than do large firms.90

       The evidence overall thus suggests that, to the extent firm size has an effect on

innovation, its magnitude and direction depend on associated industry-level variables and are

susceptible to very few general presumptions. The results suggest that especially large firms like

those created by some recent mergers will have no special tendency—nor any predictable

reluctance—to engage in innovation, and that small, fringe firms may play important roles over

time in technologically advancing markets.91

       Lastly, consider the argument that greater product-market profits make it possible for

firms to conduct additional R&D. There are two interpretations of the profits-innovation

linkage. One is that the potential for product-market profits generates innovation incentives.

This is an issue about competitive effects and was addressed in subsection V.B above. The other

interpretation is that current profits can generate free cash to finance R&D efforts. This is more

of a statement about the production of innovation, and we will treat it as a kind of efficiency. A

first observation is that there is a remarkable and dangerous lack of a limiting principle in this

argument. By this argument, for example, why not grant a monopoly in an unrelated market in

order to generate the cash flow needed to conduct R&D in the market of concern? Second, given

the overall efficiency of U.S. capital markets, this argument is inherently suspect. It is not

surprising that, in their review of the empirical some years ago, Kamien and Schwartz found

that "In sum, the empirical evidence that either liquidity or profitability are conducive to

innovative effort or output appears slim."92

               2.       Merger Specificity

       As noted above, the possible use of alternative institutional arrangements, such as

research joint ventures, raises complex issues in determining whether the efficiencies are merger

specific. These issues arise because, in theory, two firms might be able to separate cooperation

regarding product-market activities from cooperation with respect to R&D activities. Thus, in

some cases an important element of merger analysis is to determine whether the parties need a

merger rather than a research joint venture or some other form of research cooperation (e.g.,

intellectual property licensing) that does not limit product-market competition. Although based

on just one industry, a recent empirical study suggests that this issue is an important one. Gugler

and Siebert (2004) found that research joint ventures in the semiconductor industry may achieve

innovation efficiencies that are comparable to those attained through merger, but may do so

without having mergers’ adverse effects on product-market competition.93


               3.       Tensions between Efficiency and Consumer Welfare

       Consideration of efficiencies in merger review typically brings to the fore the difference

between a consumer-welfare standard and an economic-efficiency, or total-surplus, standard.

Under a consumer-welfare standard, cost savings are relevant only to the extent that they are

passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices of better products. Thus, a consumer-welfare

standard would not count as benefits any projected savings in corporate overhead that are

predicted to have no effects on product prices. Nonetheless, such savings would represent real

gains to the economy, and they would be counted as benefits under a total-surplus standard.

       Ventures: Evidence form the Seminconductor Industry,” National Bureau of Economic Research Working

                                                        46
       The analysis of efficiencies from a static pricing perspective often focuses solely on

variable costs, on the grounds that changes in fixed costs will not affect the calculation of profit-

maximizing prices. However, a change in the “fixed” costs of innovation may trigger a change

in the resulting level innovation (i.e., whether a project is undertaken or not) which then has

consequences for consumer welfare. Consequently, it is important that fixed costs not be

summarily excluded from the efficiencies analysis where innovation is at issue. Another way of

describing this point is to state that it is important to remember that, over a long enough time

horizon, everything is variable.

       It should also be observed that, under an efficiency standard, one would take into account

the fact that a merger might eliminate socially wasteful duplication of R&D even if doing so did

not speed up the date at which innovation occurred or reduce quality-adjusted product prices.

Indeed, there are circumstances in which an economic efficiency standard would count as a

benefit the fact that a merger slowed the rate of innovation from a socially excessive level, but a

consumer surplus standard would find the merger harmful. If merger policy is going to focus

more on innovation it may therefore have to deal with welfare tradeoffs that antitrust does not

confront in conventional product-market competition cases.

       One way to resolve the social welfare/consumer welfare tradeoff is to insist that the cost

savings from any reduction in innovation be passed through in the form of lower prices to

consumers, an issue that arises in the context of productive efficiencies in a static merger review

framework. But in the conventional, static efficiencies situation, the consumer ideally gets the

same product at a lower price post-merger. In contrast, when a merger reduces inefficient

innovation, the consumer at best gets a different (less advanced) product at a lower price post-

merger and the price reduction may not compensate for the difference in product characteristics.


                                                     47
The inability to compensate consumers through pass-through of cost-savings is one consequence

of the fact, discussed next, that there may be no correspondence between the magnitude of the

R&D investment and the magnitude of the resulting consumer-welfare benefit.


               4.      Developing Reliable Projections of Consumer Benefits

       Efficiencies are typically difficult to project with any confidence, even when innovation

is not an issue. And, for a number of reasons, innovation makes the task even more difficult.

First, there is the large stochastic element of innovation and R&D projects often have very long

gestation periods. Second, as discussed above, the drivers of innovation are only imperfectly

understood. Third, where efficiency leads to greater product innovation and consumers have

heterogeneous valuations of quality, projecting net consumer benefits can be very complex.

Finally, the extent that innovation involves discrete projects and fixed cost commitments, even a

small change in fixed costs can lead to a large change in consumer welfare. This relationship

holds when the cost change (or other merger efficiency) tips the balance in favor of a supplier’s

undertaking a discrete investment that generates a large amount of consumer surplus, such as the

introduction of a new product. In principle, the consumer surplus generated by these new

services made possible by an R&D investment can exceed the merger-specific reduction in the

costs of conducting the R&D. Thus, the agencies have to be careful not to measure efficiencies

purely in terms of cost savings.


       F.      Remedies

       Merger remedies can involve the divesture or licensing of assets, including intellectual

property, in order to maintain innovation competition. The challenge for merger policy in

crafting remedies for cases in which innovation is central is to identify the right assets for



                                                     48
divestiture or, where those assets are intellectual property, for licensing. In the case where, for

example, two drugstore chains seek to merge, divestiture is in principle relatively

straightforward: the parties must divest stores where the pre-merger firms have overlapping

territories. To be sure there may be problems in assuring that those stores are divested in a way

that maintains their competitive viability against the merged entity, but there tends to be

relatively little problem in identifying what stores to divest.

       The problem is much harder when the assets to be divested are intended to maintain

competition in innovation.94 Which personnel are central to an innovation effort and in what

parts of the company are they located? Is R&D conducted in such a way that it is severable for

purposes of divestiture? What patents are needed for a particular R&D effort and are there

alternative technologies available? These questions are far from insurmountable, but they do

point out the particular challenges that innovation creates for remedial merger policy, and these

questions suggest that refocusing conventional analysis will be necessary for enforcement

agencies in innovation cases.


       G.      Schumpeterian Competition and Merger Policy

       As noted in Section II above, in some markets competition may take the form of

Schumpeterian rivalry in which a succession of “temporary monopolists” displace one another

through innovation. At any one time, there is little or no head-to-head price competition but

there is significant ongoing innovation competition. The nature of Schumpeterian competition

suggests to some observers that antitrust policy should be less concerned with attacking business

practices that might generate increased monopoly profits by harming competition within a




                                                      49
market, or should at least be more circumspect about doing so.95 However, there still is an issue

whether specific practices harm competition for the market. Moreover, in the merger context, it

is not at all clear that policy should not be more restrictive, rather than less.

        Proponents of the view that governmental intervention should be limited in this type of

market generally argue that merger policy is likely to make costly errors through enforcement

that will have the unintended effect of slowing innovation. Moreover, the argument goes, in

dynamic markets it is impossible to predict what is going to happen, current market positions are

irrelevant to future competition, and at any point the market is going to be monopolized

anyway.96 Therefore, the argument concludes, firms should be allowed to combine with

relatively little antitrust intervention in dynamic markets.

        The analysis of this chapter suggests that the claim for systematic laissez faire in such

markets is not soundly grounded in economics. Indeed, there are reasons to think that a merger

policy designed to foster and protect Schumpeterian competition might appear fairly restrictive

when viewed through the lens of conventional merger analysis. It will not always or even often

be true that the conditions that foster the intense investment in new technology that leads to

sequential competition "for the market" will be produced by unchecked consolidation. Indeed,




94
        In this regard, the divestiture of intellectual property to preserve product-market competition (see Section
        IV.C above), is more similar to the manufacturing/retailing paradigm than to the innovation paradigm.

        competition, see Evans and Schmalensee, supra note 51.
96
        Judge Posner has offered a different view of the problem. He argues that high-tech mergers can be dealt
        with well by existing institutions and policies, but that high-tech unilateral conduct cases are problematical
        because the agencies and courts can neither bring sufficient technical expertise to bear on the issues nor
        move in a timely enough fashion given industry's rate of change. Richard A. Posner “Antitrust in the New

Case 2 in Section II, above, is one in which a merger would be challenged precisely because it

would otherwise undermine Schumpeterian competition.

       Innovation would be the center of the inquiry designed to determine when innovation

requires antitrust agencies to intervene and when to stand back. In order to understand a

proposed merger’s potential effects on Schumpeterian competition, one would need to ask which

firms had the potential to be the next temporary monopolist. The current shares of most firms

might well be largely irrelevant to this assessment. (The large share of the current temporary

monopolist would be relevant insofar as it indicated what would be the status quo until the next

wave of innovation comes crashing through the market.) But it would be a mistake to think the

irrelevance of current market shares inexorably leads to “permissive” merger policy. For

instance, the Schumpeterian approach might instead imply that the currently dominant firm

should be allowed to merge with essentially no other firm because any other firm might be the

next successful rival. Similarly, it might be socially optimal to block a merger between two

firms that had no sales of the final product at present because each may be involved in beneficial

R&D that will make it the next market winner.


VI.    INNOVATION CASES

       The U.S. antitrust agencies have by now reviewed a number of merger cases in which

innovation has been an important factor. A review of those cases helps one to understand how far

the agencies have been willing to incorporate innovation concerns into merger policy and also to

assess the kinds of cases in which the agencies have been, or can be, successful in that enterprise.




                                                    51
       A.       Early Merger Cases: Starting to Take Innovation Seriously

       One of the first merger enforcement actions expressly motivated by innovation concerns

occurred in 1990, when the FTC challenged Roche Holding’s acquisition of Genentech as likely

to lessen research and development in several biotech products.97 Some of the concerns the

transaction raised were traditional ones of competition: for example, Roche was on the verge of

becoming the major challenger to Genentech’s dominant position in the market for products to

treat human growth hormone deficiency. But more central to the FTC’s complaint was that

Roche and Genentech were actual competitors in the research and development of important

therapies for the treatment of AIDS and HIV infection. Genentech was considered to be ahead

of its rivals in the development of such treatments, and Roche was actively involved in a

competing development effort. Concerns about how consolidation of actual R&D efforts would

affect the future product market and the pace of innovation drove the enforcement decision.98

       In terms of the abstract cases we discussed above, the Roche/Genentech case appears to

fit case 1 in Section II, in which the innovation concern is tied to potential competition in an

identifiable product market. With respect to treatments for human growth hormone deficiency,

Roche’s potential competitive impact was imminent and reasonably certain. While the potential

competition between Roche and Genentech in the AIDS/HIV therapy market was more

speculative because both firms were still in the R&D phase, the competing R&D efforts were

well under way and the FTC found strong evidence to support its prediction that the relevant

product market would develop and that Roche and Genentech would be important competitors in

that market. The FTC’s analysis was thus more one of potential competitive effects than of

effects on innovation per se.

       The Justice Department first challenged a merger on innovation grounds in 1993, when it

investigated ZF Friedrichshafen’s proposed acquisition of General Motors’ Allison Division.99

Allison and ZF together produced 85 percent of the world output of heavy-duty automatic

transmissions for trucks and buses, but actually competed head-to-head in few geographic

markets.100 The Justice Department nonetheless concluded that even markets whose

concentration would be unaffected by the merger would be harmed by the transaction’s reduction

in Allison and ZF’s incentives to develop new designs and products.101 This case therefore

reflects the economic conclusion that near-monopoly levels of concentration are bad for

innovation even in the absence of any changes in static efficiency and in the absence of any

specific development effort that could be identified as being compromised.

       The Roche/Genentech and ZF/Allison cases both considered innovation as an issue

distinct from competition in an existing product market, but there were important differences.

The FTC did not have to predict that there would be a reduction in rival innovation efforts from

the increase in industry concentration that would have resulted from the acquisition. Rather, the

increase in concentration was accompanied by concrete evidence that Roche was at an advanced

stage in developing a competing human growth hormone treatment and that Roche and

Genentech were the most promising of a small group of companies racing to develop certain

AIDS/HIV treatments. Given that Roche appeared to have reached a point where its entry into

the growth hormone market was no longer speculative, the question there was more a

conventional one of competition than of innovation.

       The FTC, however, framed the issue with respect to AIDS/HIV therapies purely as one of

innovation. The FTC’s focus was on the race to develop products, not on competition in the

market for existing products. But the evidence was clear that both Roche and Genentech were

among very few, serious participants in that development race. The merger would have

substantially concentrated actual, not merely potential or speculative, R&D efforts. In turn, the

merger would have reduced the number of players in an as-yet non-existent but likely and

predictable future product market.

       While the evidence that innovation efforts would be consolidated makes enforcement

appear warranted, it raises an interesting question about enforcement rationale. The

Roche/Genentech case is presented as a case about preserving innovation incentives in the

market for the drug therapies actually under development.102 But it doesn’t seem quite right to

explain the case as being about fostering incentives for firms to undertake innovation that was in

fact already occurring. To the extent the case was about innovation, then, it seems more

coherently explained as preserving a market structure that had proven itself conducive to

innovation and that therefore should not be allowed to concentrate further and reduce the

potential for future R&D. If that is the underlying rationale, then the case marks a significant

departure from conventional antitrust analysis. But the case could alternatively be explained as

really being about conventional product-market competition, with the evidence of innovation

serving to show that the merger would combine two future rivals and create higher prices when

the market for the infection treatments at issue does eventually develop. That interpretation is




                                                    54
still a dynamic one to which innovation is crucial, but it is in the end firmly within the traditional

competitive framework of antitrust.

       The Justice Department’s action in the ZF/Allison case was in an important respect

different from Roche/Genentech: there was no specific R&D effort the Justice Department found

would be compromised by the acquisition. But the decision indicates that where the change in

concentration is so great that it leaves an industry near monopoly and without other potential

sources of new developments, potential harm to the “innovation market” could justify a

challenge to the transaction.

       In the ZF/Allison case too, however, there is a lurking ambiguity about the underlying

rationale. On the surface it seems reasonable to block a merger that would result in an 85

percent share of the world market, even if there may be fringe firms capable of introducing

innovations and additional competition. In most cases such a merger would raise concerns about

both allocational efficiency and innovation incentives. In ZF/Allison, the efficiency issue was

absent because, although neither company was a monopolist in the global market, each had close

to a 100 percent share of the specific geographical markets in which it actually did business.

Consequently, few consumers would have faced a reduction in the number of competing

suppliers due to the merger. The case is therefore cast as preserving innovation incentives rather

than market competition.

       If, however, the companies for the most part do not compete in the product market, why

is there any reason to believe they compete in the “innovation market”? To be sure, monopolists

still have some incentive to reduce costs and increase profits, so the fact that the two companies’

do not compete in any geographical market does not mean they would not each have incentives



102
       See, e.g., Gilbert and Sunshine, supra note 53.
                                                         55
to innovate. But the same logic—that innovation incentives do not necessarily depend on

competition—could be applied to the merged entity and thus does not supply a rationale for

blocking a transaction between non-competing entities. This does not mean the ZF/Allison

decision was a bad one. It does indicate that separating innovation incentives from product-

market competition effects can be difficult and raises some of the difficulties in applying the

framework designed for static competitive analysis to dynamic questions of innovation.

       One possible rationale for the Justice Department’s action is that, over time, it is better to

have two potential innovators in the market rather than one, in order to preserve the potential for

a diversity of approaches to developing new technology and to preserve the possibility for future

product-market competition. The ZF/Allison decision is novel in that it preserves separate

entities not for reasons of price competition, but for reasons of future innovation. In the context

of a merger to near-monopoly, the idea doesn’t seem so radical, but in principle it represents an

important change in traditional merger analysis. The agency’s focus was not on preserving

innovation tied to any particular product or identifiable line of research, but instead on

preserving conditions likely to be more conducive to any innovation in the market sector. The

ZF/Allison merger, however, presents a relatively easy example of such a pure innovation case.

The merger to monopoly certainly reduced the potential for competition between the two major

firms. The case gives little insight however, into how the agencies would evaluate a case

involving a greater number of firms in which only innovation, and not product-market

competition, was at stake.


       B.      Transitional Cases: Innovation Moves to the Fore

       The two factors that were central to the Roche/Genentech and ZF/Allison cases, very

high levels of concentration and parallel, competing innovation efforts, have also formed the

                                                     56
basis for several more recent merger-enforcement actions through which the relationship

between antitrust and innovation has further developed.


                   1.   Aerospace Mergers

       The aerospace industry is one of the most innovative economic sectors in the United

States. The market is characterized by high concentration levels but also, outside the defense

sector, by international competition. In the late 1990’s, the FTC and Department of Justice,

respectively, approved one major aerospace merger and blocked another. Innovation

considerations were central to these enforcement decisions.

       In 1997, the FTC approved the merger of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, the two

largest commercial aircraft manufacturers in the United States.103 In that case, analysis of

innovation in the aerospace industry supported the merger, not because the transaction was

expected to increase R&D, but because the analysis showed that McDonnell Douglas had fallen

behind technologically and no longer could exert competitive pressure on its rivals.104

Acquisition by Boeing would therefore not reduce future competition and would allow

McDonnell Douglas’ assets to be put to better use by a more technologically advanced

enterprise.

       Concerns about progress in aerospace led to a different conclusion in Lockheed Martin’s

proposed acquisition of Northrop Grumman. The Justice Department’s challenge to the merger

explained that Lockheed and Northrop were two of the leading suppliers of aircraft and

electronics systems to the U.S. military.105 The Department concluded that the merger would

give Lockheed a monopoly in systems for airborne early warning radar, electro-optical missile

warning, fiber optic towed decoys, and infrared countermeasure systems.106 In addition, the

merger would reduce the number of competitors from three to two in high-performance, fixed-

wing military airplanes, on-board radio countermeasures, and stealth technology.107 The Justice

Department contended that consolidation in these markets would lead to higher prices, higher

costs, and reduced innovation for products and systems required by the U.S. military.108

       Although traditional competitive concerns about prices were an important part of the

Justice Department’s challenge to Lockheed’s acquisition of Northrop, innovation concerns were

central. For example, the Department noted that Lockheed and Northrop had both started

research and development for advanced airborne early warning radar systems and concluded that

consolidation of the two R&D efforts would harm future military procurement.109 The

Department also found evidence that competition is particularly important for technological

advances in high-performance military aircraft and that important innovations have often been

made by firms other than the incumbent suppliers of particular systems. It thus concluded that

“competition is vital to maximize both the innovative ideas associated with each military aircraft

program, as well as the quality of the processes used to turn innovative ideas into cost-effective,

technically sound, and efficiently produced aircraft.”110

       The Justice Department’s conclusion in the Lockheed/Northrop case that preserving

competition in the relevant markets would enhance innovation was based principally on two

factors that weighed against permitting the transaction: (1) evidence that Lockheed and

Northrop were either actually conducting competing R&D on important products or were the

leading contenders to conduct such R&D in the future; and (2) evidence that consolidation would

lead to either monopoly or substantial dominance in relevant product markets, not just reducing,

but in large part eliminating, competitive pressure. Thus, a combination of market structure and

parallel innovation efforts pointed towards a likely reduction in both actual and potential

innovative activity if the merger were consummated.

       Lockheed/Northrop thus fits to a large extent the parameters of our Case 2 in Section II.

Although a patent race was not necessarily at issue, what was at stake was the race to develop

technology that would win a major government contract, another form of winner-take-all (or

most) innovation contest. The Justice Department at least implicitly found that, in the

aerospace/defense sector, the benefits of faster innovation and a choice of alternative

technologies offset possible costs of effort duplication. There was, in addition, the possibility

that, if the two technologies that the competitors developed were truly substitutes, then the

government would also get the benefit of conventional product-market competition between

bidders for the contract. In other words, mixed in with the innovation concern central to the case

was also a more conventional, static pricing concern.111

       Similar issues arose and conclusions were reached in the Department of Justice’s challenge of a proposed
       merger of the only two companies that manufacture nuclear submarines for the United States. (United
       States of America v. General Dynamics Corporation and Newport News Shipbuilding, Inc., Verified

               2.       Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals.

       In the mid-1990s, the FTC focused on innovation concerns in crafting a consent

agreement with merging firms in the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals industry. Ciba-Geigy

and Sandoz announced plans to merge into a new company now known as Novartis. The FTC

raised several objections to the merger.112 Along traditional antitrust lines, the FTC was

concerned the combination would give the merged entity power to reduce competition and raise

prices in the markets for herbicides used in growing corn and for flea-control products for

pets.113 The FTC accordingly ordered one party to divest those businesses.114 The more novel

parts of the FTC’s challenge, however, had to do with research and development and the

prospects for future innovations in the market for gene therapy products—products that allow

treatment of diseases and medical conditions by modifying genes in patients’ cells.

       At the time of the FTC’s investigation in 1996 and 1997, no gene therapy products were

on the market or even approved by the Food and Drug Administration.115 Conventional merger

analysis therefore did not apply because there was no product market in which to analyze the

merger’s effects on prices and output. The FTC instead adopted a dynamic perspective; looking

to the future, it found long-run competitive concerns. The sales of gene therapy products were

expected to grow rapidly, with projections for a $45 billion market by 2010.116 Ciba and Sandoz

were either among very few, or the only, firms with the technological capability and intellectual

property rights necessary to develop gene therapy products commercially. The FTC stated in its

complaint against the proposed merger that Ciba and Sandoz were “two of only a few” entities

capable of the R&D necessary to enter the market. Together they would control essential

patents, know-how, and proprietary commercial rights without which other firms, even if capable

of developing gene therapy products, would be unable to commercialize them. The FTC was

concerned that Novartis, the newly named post-merger company, might not adequately license

its gene therapy intellectual property to assure that other firms would be able to close the R&D

gap. The FTC concluded that “preserving long-run innovation in these circumstances is

critical.”117

        The FTC did not, however, block the merger. Instead, it crafted a consent decree

designed to correct those aspects of the transaction that raised concerns for current and future

competition and innovation. As noted above, divestiture of certain overlapping herbicide and

flea-control businesses occurred. More interestingly, the FTC did not require divestiture of

either firm’s gene therapy division. Instead, Ciba and Sandoz agreed they would license

technology and patents sufficient for one of its major rivals to compete against the merged entity

in the development of gene therapy products.118

        The FTC’s remedy steered between the potentially conflicting economic effects a merger

might have on research and development. On one hand, consolidating complementary

capabilities can enhance innovation and allow a combination of firms to achieve what the firms

individually could not do as easily. On the other hand, concentrating markets to near-monopoly

levels can dampen the pressure to innovate and reduce the enhanced probability of success that

                                                    61
comes from multiple R&D efforts. Both concerns are reflected in the FTC’s enforcement action.

The FTC declined to order either Ciba or Sandoz to divest its gene therapy subsidiary because it

found that R&D efforts between the parent companies and their subsidiaries were closely

coordinated, making divestiture disruptive and counterproductive for innovation. The decision

instead to order compulsory licensing to a capable competitor was designed to preserve both

competition and the benefits of the merging parties’ relationships with each other and their

respective gene therapy subsidiaries.

       The market context in which the FTC’s focus on innovation occurred is significant. The

merger did not simply change the degree of competition within a middling range of market

concentration. Rather, the combination of Ciba and Sandoz concentrated virtually all innovation

efforts and essential inputs for commercialization of gene therapy under one corporate roof.

Innovation concerns were sufficient to motivate enforcement because the facts showed a

combination of monopoly market structure and reduction in the number of actual (as opposed to

potential) innovation efforts. To some degree, this was a traditional potential entry case with

respect to product-market competition. But the action also broke important new ground: it

expressly recognized that a current merger could be challenged on grounds of future innovation

and competition in a product market that does not yet—but likely will—exist. It is interesting to

contrast this action with the ZF/Allison action. In the case of ZF/Allison, the issue was a product

market with (as yet) non-existent innovation, while in Ciba/Sandoz the issue was innovation for

an (as yet) non-existent product market.


       C.      Recent Case Developments: More Nuanced Analysis

       The antitrust agencies' focus on innovation in merger review, which became evident in

the 1990s, has continued to develop. Although most innovation cases involve advanced stages

                                                    62
of innovation—so that the issue is more one of potential product-market competition than

innovation for its own sake—the Department of Justice and FTC have both also expressed

interest in protecting innovation for its own sake, as the following cases illustrate.

         The proposed $16 billion merger of Hoechst and Rhône-Poulenc into the pharmaceutical

company known as Aventis raised both potential and actual competition concerns for the FTC.
119
      Innovation was central to the potential competition aspects of the merger. Hoechst had an

existing anti-clotting product and Rhône-Poulenc was close behind, with a product almost

through the FDA review process. As in Ciba/Sandoz, the FTC was also concerned about a

combination of patent portfolios, in this case patents related to anti-clotting agents. In December

1999, the FTC entered into a proposed consent agreement settling its charges that the merger

would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act. The parties were allowed to merge on condition that

they divest assets relating to Rhône-Poulenc's direct thrombin inhibitor drug Revasc, in order to

preserve competition and the opportunity for innovation in direct thrombin inhibition as a

superior treatment for blood clotting diseases. The merged entity was also required to divest its

interest in a subsidiary that produced cellulose acetate in order to preserve competition in the

market for cellulose acetate thermoplastics.120

         The FTC again faced a mix of actual and innovation-based potential competition issues in

its challenge to the Amgen/Immunex merger in 2002.121 At the time Amgen and Immunex

proposed to merge, Amgen had the only IL-1 inhibitor, which is used to treat rheumatoid

arthritis, on the U.S. market. Immunex and one other firm, Regeneron, were the only other

companies with IL-1 inhibitors in U.S. clinical trials. The FTC feared that the combination of the

Amgen and Immunex patent portfolios might allow the merged firm to block entry by

Regeneron. The FTC expressed concern not only about harm to potential competition from the

merger, but also about the possibility that the combination would reduce R&D competition for

related new products. The FTC nonetheless allowed the merger to proceed based upon a consent

decree that required the licensing of certain patents to Regeneron. The FTC reached a similar

result in its review of the Glaxo/SmithKline Beecham merger in 2001.122

       The cases discussed so far may leave the impression that innovation has only been salient

in mega-mergers where billions of dollars are at stake in the transaction and/or in particular

market sectors, notably pharmaceuticals and defense aerospace. But that is not the case. As

noted in our earlier discussion of remedies in Section IV.C, the Department of Justice sued in

2001 to block 3D Systems Corporation's proposed $45 million acquisition of DTM Corporation,

alleging that the transaction, as originally structured, would have resulted in higher prices and

less innovation for industrial rapid prototyping (“RP”) systems in the United States.123 The

complaint alleged that “3D and DTM offered the most sophisticated systems in the industry and

competed directly against each other in the development, manufacture, and sale of industrial

rapid prototyping systems and materials”.124 The acquisition would have combined the two

largest manufacturers of RP systems in the United States, reduced the number of competitors in

the U.S. market for industrial RP systems from three to two, and resulted in the combined

company having a U.S. market share, by revenue, of 80 percent.125 The Department of Justice

settled the case through a consent decree that requires 3D and DTM to license their RP-related

patents to a firm that will compete against the merged enterprise in the U.S. market. The district

courts' decision entering the decree expressly discussed the merger's potential impact on

innovation as well as price competition in the market for rapid prototyping systems.126

       Taken together, the merger cases in which the U.S. antitrust agencies have made

innovation a central issue fall mostly into the first of the abstract cases we set out in Section II

above: they have involved innovation efforts sufficiently well under way that one of the merging

parties can convincingly be considered a potential competitor to the other. Review of those

mergers has thus fit relatively comfortably into the existing framework for merger policy. But at

lease some cases have paid lip service, or even purported to base enforcement, on the

preservation of innovation for its own sake in a particular industrial sector. In these cases--for

example GM/ZF and 3D/DTM—the agencies did not undertake a detailed analysis of the market

structures in the relevant industries that would be most conducive to innovation, nor did they

examine the welfare consequences of reduced innovation in the industries at issue. In the

GM/ZF case, the Department of Justice appears implicitly to have assumed that one larger firm

would be worse for innovation than two already quite large enterprises would be. In the

3D/DTM case, the consolidation from three to two major U.S. firms raised concerns about

innovation, although those concerns were deemed to have been allayed by the consent decree.

       The cases to date therefore do not yet give a sense of how the agencies are likely to

respond to transactions that fall into the second and third abstract cases that we discuss in

Section II above. Approaches to cases that raise questions about which market structures will be

most conducive to efficient R&D, or that raise welfare tradeoffs between price competition and

innovation, are not as well developed as review of cases where innovation matter solely through

existing projects’ effects on potential product-market competition. Merger policy’s

understanding of the relationship between competition and innovation will have to be further

developed, not only to identify objectionable transactions, but also to craft effective remedies,

where licensing of intellectual property rights has generally been assumed to cure both the

reduction in R&D and the reduction in potential competition that some mergers portend.


VII.   CONCLUSION: TOWARDS DYNAMIC MERGER POLICY

       When it comes to merger policy, innovation is tricky stuff. However, antitrust enforcers

have the tools to treat innovation in merger analysis. The cases in which the Department of

Justice and FTC have already addressed innovation demonstrate that the agencies are sensitive to

the ways that innovation can affect future competition in product markets. The use of

information about innovation to support objections to a merger based on potential competition

concerns does not require fundamental change to, or expansion of, the existing merger-policy

framework. The harder issues for merger policy involve four kinds of problems that transactions

involving innovation raise: (1) the need to assess potential product-market competition from

innovation efforts still far from completion; (2) the question of whether current product sales and

production capabilities are relevant to the assessment of future competition; (3) a merger’s effect

                                                     66
on innovation; and (4) possible tradeoffs between dynamic innovation benefits and static

competition benefits.

       The first issue is an evidentiary one. At what point is evidence of innovation sufficient

for the agencies or courts to determine that the innovator is a predictable product-market

competitor? Most of the cases to date have involved innovations that were essentially complete

and undergoing trials and/or regulatory approval. But some transactions will push enforcement

authorities to take a more dynamic view of potential competition. The challenge for the agencies

and courts in these cases will not involve changing the existing merger-review framework, but

instead involves articulating the parameters of the factual inquiry from which the agencies and

courts will infer potential competition from evidence of ongoing innovation.

       The second issue, whether current market shares are relevant to predicting future

product-market competition, can be addressed within the standard conceptual framework

codified by the Merger Guidelines, and there are well-developed economic tools for addressing

the issue. However, a movement away from a predominant focus on market shares and toward a

more refined analysis of industry conditions and the nature of competition would represent a

dramatic change in the practice of merger litigation.

       The remaining problems above are more difficult and fundamental for the existing

framework on both conceptual and practical levels. The issues of the efficient amount or timing

of innovation, and of the comparative values of competition today versus improved products

tomorrow do not fit easily into the conventional merger review framework. Antitrust agencies

could decide not to address these issues and, instead, the agencies could retain their focus on

more conventional product-market concerns. But the impact of innovation on economic welfare

and the impact of market structure on innovation will occur whether antitrust policy accounts for


                                                    67
them or not. Hence, if the agencies chose this course, judgments about these impacts would be

made implicitly and without reflection. To the extent antitrust policy makers wish to avoid the

potential costs of ignoring innovation, the question becomes how antitrust agencies should

proceed in incorporating innovation concerns into their mission.

       The overarching lesson from our analysis is that merger policy enforcers should

recognize that innovation will depend more heavily on factual inquiries specific to a given case

and less on systematic presumptions of the kind merger policy has long applied to static,

product-market competition. The analysis summarized above suggests several approaches that

the agencies charged with developing and enforcing merger policy might use to address

innovation and its potential effects in the merger review process.

       First, the agencies could develop and articulate guidelines for drawing inferences of

potential product-market competition from evidence of ongoing innovation. Doing so would

extend the existing framework to cover a number of situations in which innovation does or many

would say should play an important role in merger analysis.

       Second, agencies might continue to expand their consideration of mergers’ effects on

innovation and consumer welfare to cases in which the concern is with potential R&D projects

that are not already underway. So far, the agencies have been cautious in moving beyond

concerns about potential product-market competition based on well-defined innovative efforts.

The agencies also have not made explicit tradeoffs between short-term product-market

competition and innovation. The agencies could, however, consider broadening their inquiry to

take these important effects into account.

       Therefore, a third approach that the agencies might pursue would be to develop the

expertise that would allow case-by-case, fact-intensive inquiries to assess the welfare effects and


                                                    68
tradeoffs posed by mergers where innovation is at stake. Academic researchers could make an

important contribution to this effort by conducting industry-specific studies that provide a deeper

understanding of the history and conditions for innovation in different economic sectors

regularly at issue in mergers. As observed in Sections V.B and V.E.1 above, empirical research

demonstrates that industry-specific factors play important roles in mediating the relationship

between concentration and firm size on the one hand and the pace of innovation on the other.

Additional studies of the sort we recommend might lead to the identification of fact patterns that

allow clearer understanding of how to treat innovation in the context of different kinds of

transactions that come up for review.

       A fourth approach would be for the agencies to make use of the tools of decision theory

to deal with uncertainty, particularly with respect to innovation. Under current practice, for

example, the agencies often take an approach of considering a two-year horizon in assessing the

effects of entry, with little or no discounting within the horizon and complete discounting of

anything beyond.127 Similarly, efficiency benefits that are realized only with a lag are “given

less weight because they are less proximate and more difficult to predict.”128 Standard decision

theory, however, indicates that these approaches are poor heuristics for calculating expected

payoffs in the face of uncertainty. For example, these approaches to entry tend to underestimate

the effects of potentially revolutionary innovations that have some probability of having very

large effects over a period of a number of years. The conventional decision-theoretic approach

would be to estimate probability distributions for alternative potential outcomes and then use

       Merger Guidelines, § 3.2. The agencies sometimes take a more sophisticated view, at least when deciding
       whether to file a case against a proposed merger, if not in court.

those probabilities as weights in projecting an expected net present value of a merger’s effects on

consumer welfare.129 More broadly, the effects of mergers on innovation are uncertain and occur

over time, and the agencies and the courts have not made full use of established decision theory

to structure their analyses of consumer welfare effects.

       In conclusion, although a coherent and effective approach to innovation in merger policy

will be difficult, the analysis suggests the goal is achievable.

       We observe in passing that there are difficult legal issues concerning whether the courts can appropriately
       aggregate welfare affects across different generations of consumers.
