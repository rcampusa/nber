                  MONEY VERSUS CREDIT RATIONING;
         EVIDENCE FOR THE NATIONAL BANKING ERA, 1880-1914


                            ABSTRACT
     In this paper we examine the evidence for two competing
views of how monetary and financial disturbances influenced the
real economy during the national banking era, 1880-1914.
According to the monetarist view, monetary disturbances affected
the real economy through changes on the liability side of the
banking system's balance sheet independent of the composition of
bank portfolios. According to the credit rationing view,
equilibrium credit rationing in a world of asymmetric information
can explain short-run fluctuations in real output. Using
structural VARs we incorporate monetary variables in credit
models and credit variables in monetarist models, with
inconclusive results. To resolve this ambiguity, we invoke the
institutional features of the national banking era. Most of the
variation in bank loans is accounted for by loans secured by
stock, which in turn reflect volatility in the stock market.
When account is taken of the stock market, the influence of
credit in the VAR model is greatly reduced, while the influence
of money remains robust. The breakdown of the composition of
bank loans into stock market loans (traded in open asset markets)
and other business loans (a possible setting for credit
rationing) reveals that other business loans remained remarkably
stable over the business cycle.

1.   Introduction

      The provisions of the Acts of 1863 and 1865 that established the

national hsnking system were designed to remedy two perceived defects of

the antehellum state banking systems. One was the circulation of a wide

variety of state bank notes, often at a discount, which made for an

inefficient payments system.    The second defect was instability of the

note issue, marked by overissue, bank runs and failures, and periodic

suspensions of convertibility into specie. To resedy the firat defect,

state bank notes were replaced by national bank issues of U.S. bond-

secured currency.    To remedy the second defect, stringent reserve and

capital requirements, oversight and regulation by the Comptroller of the

Currency were conditiona for national bank charters. Unfortunately, the

remedies did not work as intended by the architects of the national

banking system. Instead, it was characterized by monetary and cyclical

instability, four banking panics, frequent atock market crashes, and other

financial disturbances.

       In this paper we examine the evidence for two competing views on how

monetary and financial disturbances influenced the resl economy during the

nationsl bsnking era.      These views stress either the asset or the

liability side of the banking system's balance sheet as the way in which

monetary shocks are transmitted.

       According to one view - -   the   monetarist view - -   the   way in which

monetary disturbances, such as gold flows and banking panics in the

national banking era, affected the real economy was through changes on the

liability side of the banking system'a balance aheet.1 Changes in bank

deposits impinge directly and indirectly (through changing interest rates)

on spending, while the composition of bank portfolios (reflected on the
asset side of the balance sheet) is not important in explaining
transmission

      According to the alternative view -   - the   credit rationing view -   -
the composition of the asset side is imporrant: chsnges in bank loans and

other credit variables, independent of changes in the quantity of money,

are the determinants of real fluctuations in the national banking period.2

Banks engage in credit rationing rather than raise interest rates because

in a world of asymmetric information a rise in interest rates may

encourage adverse selection, that is, borrowing by individuals and firms

more likely to default.      This approach follows an older tradition

stressing the asset side of the balance sheet.3

      Theoretically, credit rationing has been cast as an equilibrium

concept. Several authors have suggested that changes in the equilibrium

quantity of credit rationing can explain short-run fluctuations in real

output.4 The idea is that changes in the "level of uncertainty" in the

economy induce changes in the equilibriu.xn quantity of loans, and thereby

affect real activity.

      Recently Calomiris and Hubbard provided support for the credit

rationing view for the national banking period.5 We have followed their

approach but expand their simultaneous equations model by considering

additional factors that could explain the link they find between credit

and the real economy.     Our evidence suggests that it is difficult to

distinguish between the two views. When monetary variables are introduced

into the credit model, money is significant and credit declines in

importance though its contribution is not eliminated.           When credit

variables are introduced into the monetariat model, money is robust but
credit effects sre siso significsnt.

      The inconclusive simultsneous equstions results hsve led us to

examine institutional data for the national banking period for evidence

that helps distinguish between the two views. The key feature is the

intimate connection between the stock msrket and the national banking

system. A substantial fraction of the reserves of all national banks

ended up being invested in the New York City call loan market. We show

that loans secured by stock in New York City were volatile, but other

loans were not. A similar but more muted pattern is found for the United

States as a whole. Yet other loans comprise direct loans to businesses

and so are the principal candidates for credit effects, if such effects

were present.

      This pattern suggests that disturbances in the stock market were

mirrored in the call loan matket, which in turn dominsted total New York

City bank losns and, to a lesser extent, total 11.5. loans.     Thus the

significant influence of bank loans found in credit models may simply be

reflecting volatility in the stock market. To test this possibility, we

introduce a stock price index and the call loan rate into a simultaneous

equations model incorporating both loans and money. The effect is to

reduce greatly the influence of bank loans on real activity.          The

influence of money, however, remains robust.

      The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains

the   money and credit tationing views.    We first set out the credit

rationing story and contrast it with the money story. We then trace the

effects to be expected from various shocks according to the two views,

beginning with the more familiar modern setting with a central bank that
                                    4




engages in open market sales that reduce hank reserves and money supply,

with contractionary effects on national income. Then we turn to a gold

standard aetting, subject to gold outflows, in which banking panics occur.

      Section 3 reviews past attempts to assess the roles of money and

credit in the transmission mechanism, and then turns to the empirical

results of four simultaneous equations models of quarterly data that we

present to test the two views.

      Section 4 examines the role of the stock and call loan markets. We

describe the relation between the inverted pyramid of credit and the call

loan market. Data from the Comptroller of the Currency's annual reports

reveal the diverse pattern of loans secured by stock and other bank loans.

We present a simultaneous equations model incorporating stock market

variables, money, and U.S. loans.

      Section 5 summarizes the paper, drawing lessons for research

strategy.



2. Money versus Credit Rationing Theory

      A considerable theoretical and empirical literature exists on
whether     the monetary system affects the real economy through the

liability or the asset aide of the banking system.6

      Emphasis on bank credit as an alternative or additional channel to

money goes back to Adam Smith and the classical economists. The real

bills doctrine that dominated both nineteenth and early twentieth century

thinking atressed that bank lending based strictly on self-liquidating

commercial bills would alwaya be sufficient to finance economic activity.
Keynes in The General Theory suggested the possibility of credit

rationing. That suggestion led to the availability doctrine, whereby the

Federal Reserve would influence the availability of bank loans through its

open market operations.7 It was assumed that changes in bank deposits

would be offset by substitution into nonmonetary assets. Hence the only

way the monetary authorities could affect spending was by influencing

total credit.8 A modern proponent of these view bases them on extensive

empirical evidence showing a close connection between various credit

aggregates and economic activity.9

      In the past decade, various authors have given a new impetus to the

credit approach.'° Based on the theory of incomplete information and the

seminal "lemons" article,11 they have argued for a theory of 'equilibrium

credit rationing. 12   In their view, the market for loans is a customer

market where factors other than price are important, unlike the auction

markets which characterize many other commodities. Specifically, because

of asymmetric information available to lenders and borrowers, a rise in

the loan rate, by encouraging adverse selection (a predominance of loan

applicants with risky projects) and moral hazard (engaging in risky

behsvior after receiving a loan) on the part of borrowers, can increase

the incidence of defaults and reduce the real return earned by the

lenders. Under these circumstances, banks will charges "lemons premium"

to highly qualified borrowers, causing them to reduce their borrowing, and

will restrict loans to marginal borrowers.       With equilibrium credit

rationing, loan rates will not rise to cleat the loan market. The supply

curve is backward bending. In a macro setting, this theory predicts that

restrictive monetary pol.icy will lead to a reduction in bank lending with
                                       6

little influence on interest rates.        Extensions of this approach view

commercial banks as important because they use their expertise to screen

borrowers and hence reduce the information asymmetry. One device used is

the posting of collateral. In this context, restrictive monetary policy,

if it produces bankruptcy and declines in net worth because of debt

deflation, will disrupt the valuable credit intermediation network created

by the banking system, further reducing bank lending and economic
activity. '

      With    these views in mind, we trace the transmission of both monetary

and real shocks according to the money and credit rationing views. We

initially focus on a modern setting, and then on the pre-Federml Reserve

System and the classical gold standard.



                            A. The Modern Setting

      We compare the two views of transmission, first, following an open

market sale of government securities and second, following an unexpected

decline in exports.




1. An Open Market Sale of Government Securities

      In the simplest Vera ion of the money view, an open market sale

reduces the reserves of the commercial banks (we neglect the distinction

between borrowed and nonborrowed reserves).        In the face of declining

reserves (assuming no excess reserves), the banks sell investments and

call in (do not renew) their loans. As a result deposits decline. The

decline in deposits leads to a fall in expenditures, which in turn reduces

output and the price level.       Rising market interest rates as well as
                                    7

implicit rates connecting aaseta to service flows will be a key conduit

connecting money supply to spending. This approach assumes that deposits

and other financial assets are not close substitutes, whereaa loans and

other earning assets are)4'15

      In the credit view, the open market sale reduces reserves and leads

to a decline in bank loans (presumably, because loans and investments are

not close substitutes, the former decline more). As in the money view,

deposits are reduced, but because of a high degree of substitution between

transaction balances and near-monies, there is little effect from this

source on spending. In the Stiglitz and Weiss approach, as the decline in

lending threatens to raise interest rates, the danger of adverse selection

and moral hazard increases for lenders, so banks reduce their lending

further (they engage in credit rationing). If the contrsctionary policy

leads to bankruptcies, a stock market crssh or deflation, then the decline

in the net worth of firms subjects lenders to greater moral hazard and

increases adverse selection. The reduction in the value of collateral can

lead to further declines in bsnk loans.

      Both views assume that the central bank will act as a lender of last

resort to prevent the onset of a banking panic. The two views differ,

however, with respect to the empirical behavior of interest rstes and loan

aggregates at the business cycle peak. According to the money view, money

growth decelerates during mid-expansion snd is accompanied by s rise in

interest rates that persists beyond the business cycle peak and well into

the recession phase.    According to the credit rationing view, interest

rates do not exhibit this pattern because of the problems banks are said

to confront should interest rstes rise. According to the money view, the
allocation of credit between loans and investments in bank portfolios has

no effect on the aggregate of deposits. Banks expand their portfolios and

deposits with the availability of reserves.       According to the credit

rationing view, banks withdraw from loan expansion when their attitude

toward loan applicants hardens and that contracts the economy.



2. A Decline in Exports

      The outcome of a transitory real shock, such as a decline in

exports, according to the money view, depends on the actions of the

central bank. In the absence of a shock to hank reserves, banks will hold

excess reserves, and will lower interest rates. If demand for loans does

not increase in response to the interest rate decline, banks will expend

their portfolio of investments. A stable money supply and lower interest

rates will eventually provide a stimulus to the economy.

      In the credit view, a transitory real shock that lowers the demand

for loans may be exacerbated if the degree of uncertainty is affected.'6

If uncertainty is increased, this will cause banks to reduce their lending

further, because of the adverse selection and moral hazard problems

mentioned above. Unlike the money view, the credit rationing view, as

represented by Stiglitz,'7 provides no role for accommodating monetary

policy to mitigate the effects of a real shock.



                      B. The National Bankint Era

      In the pre-Federal Reserve setting, two key institutional

differences affected the transmission mechanism: the absence of a central

bank and the classical gold standard.     The first factor was important
                                    7

implicit rates connecting assets to service flows will be s key conduit

connecting money supply to spending. This approach assumes that deposits

and other financial assets are not close substitutes, whereas loans and

other earning assets sre.1'5

      In the credit view, the open market ssle reduces reserves and leads

to a decline in bank loans (presumably, because loans and investments are

not close substitutes, the former decline more). As in the money view,

deposits are reduced, but because of a high degree of substitution between

transaction balances and near-monies, there is little effect from this

source on spending. In the Stiglitz and Weiss spprosch, ss the decline in

lending threatens to raise interest rates, the danger of adverse selection

and moral hszsrd increases for lenders, so banks reduce their lending

further (they engage in credit rationing). If the contrsctionary policy

leads to bankruptcies, a stock market crash or deflation, then the decline

in the net worth of firms subjects lenders to greater moral hazard and

increases adverse selection. The reduction in the value of collateral can

lead to further declines in bank loans.

      Both views sssume that the central bsnk will act as a lender of last

resort to prevent the onset of a banking panic. The two views differ,

however, with respect to the empirical behavior of interest rates and loan

aggregates at the business cycle peak. According to the money view, money

growth decelerates during mid-expansion and is accompanied by a rise in

interest rates that persists beyond the business cycle peek end well into

the recession phase. According to the credit rationing view, interest

rates do not exhibit this pattern because of the problems banks sre said

to confront should interest rates rise. According to the money view, the
allocation of credit between loans and investaents in bank portfolios has

no effect on the aggregate of deposits. Banks expand their portfolios and

deposits with the availability of reserves.       According to the credit

rationing view, banks withdraw from loan expansion when their attitude

toward loan applicants hardens and that contracts the economy.



2. A Decline in Exports

      The outcome of a transitory real shock, such as a decline in

exports, according to the money view, depends on the actions of the

central bank. In the absence of a shock to bank reserves, banks will hold

excess reserves, and will lower interest rates. If demand for loans does

not increase in response to the interest rate decline, banks will expand

their portfolio of investments. A stable money supply and lower interest

rates will eventually provide a stimulus to the economy.

      In the credit view, a transitory real shock that lowers the demand

for loans may be exacerbated if the degree of uncertainty is affected.'6

If uncertainty is increased, this will cause banks to reduce their lending

further, because of the adverse selection and moral hazard problems

mentioned above. Unlike the money view, the credit rationing view, as

represented by Stiglitz,'7 provides no role for accommodating monetary

policy to mitigate the effects of a real shock.



                      B. The National Banking Era

      In the pre-Federal Reserve setting, two key institutional

differences affected the transmission mechanism: the absence of a central

bank and the classical gold standard.     The first factor was important
                                     9

because an effective lender of last resort did not exist.18            The

importance of the second factor was that a gold outflow, induced typically

either by a rise in Bank Rate by the Bank of England or by a dramatic

harvest failure -   -a   real shock that led to a deficit in the current

account --   reduced monetary gold reserves.

1. A Gold Outflow

      Uben the Bank of England raised its discount rate, this led to a

short-term capital outflow from the United States and a gold outflow that

reduced the reserves of the commercial banks.19 According to the money

view, both loans and investments declined, pan passu with deposits,

interest rates rose, and spending declined along with output and prices.

A key difference from the modern setting could, however, arise. There was

no ready source of high-powered money to replace the loss of monetary

reserves. In addition, if the external drain was also accompanied by an

internal drain, such as a seasonally-induced demand for reserves by

country national banks, the possibility arose of a banking panic generated

by a decline in the public's deposit-currency ratio as well as the bankihg

system's deposit-reserve ratio.25 This could produce a further decline

in the money supply. Resultant bank failures could lead to bankruptcies,

reductions in firma' net worth, and further bank failures, as the value of

bank assets declined. This process could continue unless some authority

intervened as lender of last resort or the convertibility of deposits into

currency was suspended.

      In the credit view, the decline in bank reserves reduced loans (more

than investments and more than deposits), as it would today, but the

incipient rise in interest rates could lead to credit rationing because of
                                   10

adverse selection and moral hazard. The fall in activity and the price

level would reduce the value of bank collateral, causing a further

reduction in bank loans. If a banking panic ensued, this exacerbated the

process, leading to a rise in the cost of intermediation. A stock market

crash also would reduce the net worth and collateral of firms, in turn

reducing bank lending.

2. A Harvest Failure

      In the money view, a transitory real shock such as a harvest failure

reduced output.    If country banks withdrew reserve balances from their

city correspondents and reduced loans and deposits, the national banking

system contracted. A fortuitous short-term capital inflow from abroad

could, however, cut short this process of decline. If the inflow did not

occur, interest rates fell, leading to a gold outflow. The gold outflow

reduced the money supply, output, and the price level until equilibrium

was restored, If a banking panic ensued, further declines in the money

supply occurred.

      In the credit rationing view, the story is the same for the modern

period and the national banking era. The real shock reduced the demand

for loans and the level of interest rates. If uncertainty increased, bank

lending would be reduced, reflecting adverse selection and moral hazard.

If bankruptcies, declines in net worth, and debt deflation ensued, then

further declines in bank lending occurred.    Finally, if the real shock

caused a stock market crash, then equity rationing might follow, as

declines in the net worths of firms made it harder for them to obtain

external finance,2'

3. Honey versus Credit: Some Empirical Results

      Before presenting our own   empirical   results, we review some earlier

studies. An early approach compared correlations between bsnk loans (and

other credit aggregates) and economic activity and those between various

monetary aggregates and activity in the post-World War II United States,

with the result that credit usually dominated.22 In contrast, a study

based on Oranger-causality tests and standard Vector Autoregressions

(VARs)23 led to the conclusion that money dominated credit.24

      These tests examine the reduced form predictive power of money and

credit vsrisbles, which is not necessarily the same as their causal role.

In particular, it is necessary to abstract from contemporaneous effects of

output on financial variables. One approach was to run a race between

money and credit by identifying episodes in the post-World War II period

when a contractionary monetary policy was adopted independent of the state

of the real economy.25        In this approach univariate forecasting

regressions lead to the conclusion that money is an active force in

transmission, with bank lending a reflecting force.

      Another approsch is that of structural 'JARs, according to which,

when explicit allowance is made for contemporaneous interactions between

output and credit and money, bank loans account for at least as much of

the variance of output as money.26 Subsequently the approach wss applied

to the pre-1914 national banking era.27

      Assessing the relative merits of the money and credit rationing

explanations requires that one disentangle a complex set of interactions

among economic variables. This task is complicated by different views

about the structure of these interactions held by the two schools of
                                            12

thought. In this section of the paper, we use a structural VAR      approach
to analyze a number of different models of the relationships among the

variables of central concern to the money and credit views.

       Structural VARs involve a strategy for identifying parameters in a

simultaneous equation model, that preserves some of the intent of the

original Cowles Commission approach, while remaining sensitive to Sims'

(1980) criticism of the "incredible" identification assumptions it

necessitated.28 The cost of this compromise is that the structural VAR

approach    requires the investigator to have great faith in the validity of

all aspects of the model.

       The structural and reduced forms of a linear simultaneous system can

be expressed as


 (1) Yr           XB - Vt          E1<V-E

 (2)   Yr     —
                  Xji + U

 (3)   II -




 (4)   Ur -

 (5)   EUUt       -         - (1



Here, Y and X are row vectors, respectively, of observations on the K

endogenous and H exogenous or predetermined variables. U end V are K

element row vectors of reduced form and structural errors, respectively.

The structural parameters are contained in the matrices F, B and E, whose

respective dimensions are K*K, H*K and K*K, while 0 and 0 are H*K and K*K

matrices of reduced form coefficients that can be estimated consistently
                                        13

from OLS regression of Y on X.

       Identification is accomplished by placing sufficient restrictions on

the structural coefficient matrices,29 that there is a unique solution

for r, fi   and S is possible from equations (3) and (5), given fl and 0. The

three prominent approaches to identification can be summarized as:

       (a) Restrict r and B, and leave S unrestricted (Cowles).

       (b) After ordering the endogenous variables in a suitable manner,

make r triangular, S diagonal, and leave B unrestricted (standard VAR).

       (c) Impose K(K-l) restrictions on I' and 5, and leave B unrestricted

(structural VAR).

The rationale for the Cowles approach was that the structural errors

contained the effects of variables not captured by the model, and since

there could be no presumption that the same variables had not been omitted

from more than one equation, one would expect the elements of Vt to be

correlated contemporaneously. This implied that a total of K(K-l) zero

restrictions needed to be placed on the r and B matrices.

       Sims3° criticized this approach, arguing that it was difficult to

believe the exclusion restrictions typically used, especially in the light

of rational expectations models that conditioned people's behavior, and

therefore observable variables, on all available past data. He advanced

the standard VAR      approach,   without claiming it represented structural

relationships. However, several authors argued that little meaningful

could be said unless a structural interpretation were placed on the

triangular form of I' used in Sims' approach, which, in turn, did not seem

plausible.3'

       The structural VAR      approach adopts Sims' skepticism concerning
                                      14

restrictions on B, but sides with the Cowles approach in maintaining that

restrictions on F are sensible.      There are K(K-l) free elements in F,

which ia the number of restrictions required for identification. The less

restrictions placed on F, the more must be imposed on Z.    Typically, the

maximum of K(K-l)/2 restrictions are placed on >, making it diagonal.32

This strains credibility from the Cowles viewpoint, since it does not

allow for correlation among variables omitted from equations: it is

tantamount to an extreme expression of faith in the specification of the

model,

         In identifying the models that follow, we use the diagonal-E

structural VAR strategy. This, in turn, necessitates that K(K-l)/2 of

the elements of F be zero. Since we are very far from believing any of

these models to be the last word, we shall attempt to trace patterns that

are consistent with the results of all the models.

         In all, we present four models in this section.     The first two

specifications we estimate include only the variables considered relevant

to the determination of real output by proponents of the money and credit

views, respectively.      The drawback with these models is that neither

allows for the effects of variables considered important by the other

story: neither is sufficiently rich to distinguish the roles of the asset

and liability sides of the banks' balance sheets. In order to compare the

merits of the two stories, we need to nest the two models in e larger

model. Unfortunately, such a system would be computationally intractable,

and so we present a separate generalization for each model.

         All models are estimated using quarterly data spanning the period

l880.I-l914.IV. All variables except those involving interest rates enter
                                       15

the estimated models as quarterly rates of change, but, for the sake of

brevity, we refer to these changes as M2, real CNP, etc. The sources of

the data series used are described in the Appendix. The same estimation

procedure is used for all the structural VAR specifications that we

examine, and it will prove useful to describe it in detail in the context

of the first model we discuss.




                            A. Monetarist Model

      Our basic monetarist model involves five variables, the monetary

base, M2, real GNP, the commercial paper rate and the CM? deflator. Thus

the vector Y in equation (1) is a row vector with five elements, the

observations at time t   on these five variables.         The first step in

implementing the structural VAR   approach   is to run a vector autoregression

of the system, which is equivalent to estimating the reduced form (2).

The variables in X are four lagged values of each of the five variables,

a constant term, time trend, and three seasonal du2mnies. These reduced

form regressions produce estimates of the reduced form errors, U, which

are related to the structural errors, V, by the linear transformation r,

as shown in equation (4).         The object of the second stage of the

estimation procedure is to extract estimates of r and E from the estimated

reduced form errors, essentially by using equation (5), which shows how

the covarjance matrix of U is related to these two parameter matrices.33

Equation (5) contains K +   K(K-l)/2    (15) distinct relationships. Before

the imposition of identification restrictions, Z has K ÷ K(K-1)/2 (15)

distinct parameters, and r has K2 (25). For a unique solution to equation

(5), K2 (25) restrictions on the parameters are required (to produce as
                                             16

many equations as unknowns). As discussed above, K (5) of these come from

normalizing diagonal elements of r' to unity, K(K-1)/2 (10) come from

restricting      to be diagonal and the remaining K(K-l)/2 (10) come from

setting elements of I' to zero.              The last type of restriction is a

limitation on the contemporaneous interactions among variables.34

Equivalently, in view of equation (4), it involves restrictions on the way

the observable reduced form errors, U, are composed of the unobserved

structural errors, Vt.

       Using the letters 'b'       'm', 'y', 'i' and 'p' to refer to the base,

M2, real GNP, conssercial paper rate and GNP deflator, respectively, and

=   -r1,   the contemporaneous interactions we identify in the Monetarist

model are35:


                         u., —    gu1   +
                                            g;u   + Vb

                         u    —         +   gu g;u+           +


                         u gu,,, g;u

                              -




       The Monetarist model              allows        the     base   to be   affected

contemporaneously only by interest rate and price shocks, reflecting the

operation of the gold standard.36             Increases in the interest rate and

decreases in the inflation rate are postulated to increase the base, via

capital inflows.     Some authors37 have argued that, during this period,

interest rate and price shocks from abroad were reflected fully and

quickly in domestic interest rate and price movements. These effects are

allowed for by the interest rate and price channels included in the base

equation. This explains why it is unnecessary to include explicit open
                                      17

economy variables.     The money multiplier drives the dependence of the

money supply on the base, while liquidity preference accounts for the

presence of the interest rate. The presence of M2 in the output equation

reflects demand shocks, and the interest rate and inflation rate are

inserted to allow for the possibility of supply side, or real interest

rate shocks. The interest rate is influenced by M2 and real output as a

result of the demand for money. Finally, inflation is driven by shocks to

the quantity of money. Notice that, since E is assumed to be diagonal,

the shocks to each variable (vb, Vm, etc) are assumed independent of each

other.

         The estimates of the contemporaneous interactions are shown in the

top panel of Table 1. As the table shows, three of the ten coefficients

do not have the anticipated signs. Several factors may be involved here,

besides the obvious possibility that the model is misspecified.      First,

the theory we are using to predict the signs of these interactions is

comparative static in nature, and doea not necessarily require that the

predicted effects be contemporaneous. Second, even if the theory were to

apply to contemporaneous relationships, the synchronization of the

available data leaves much to be desired.38 For both of these reasons,

we believe it to be more appropriate to examine jointly the

contemporaneous and lagged influence of one variable on another, by using

impulse response functions and decompositions of the variance of forecast

errors.

         Figure 1 shows the response of real output to innovations in the

base, M2 and the interest rate. Shocks to the levels of 142 and the base

have positive but permanent effects on output. Innovations in the interest
                                    18

rate have approximately a zero output effect on net, although the response

is initially positive for four quarters.

      The relative importance of shocks assigned to each variable can be

assessed from the decomposition of the variance of the forecast errors,

which is shown in the lower panel of Table I. Here the columns correspond

to the sources of the shocks (i.e., which element of V is responsible),

and the row names are those of the variable being predicted. The horizon

of the forecasts is twelve quarters in all cases. The salient feature of

these results is that 26.8 percent of the variance of output forecast

errors is assigned to base and M2 innovations.      It is also worth noting

that two-thirds of the variability of the interest rate comes from the

innovations to the base and the money supply, while innovations to the

interest rate have a considetably smaller effect.

       In auxsmary, there is little in these resulta that would lead a

monetariat to revise his or her views on the nature of the transmission

mechaniam.



                             B. Credit Model

       Table 2 describes the results of estimating a model designed to

capture the effecta of variables important to the credit view. This model

was developed by Calomiris and Hubbard, and is described in detail in

their paper.39 In their structural VAR, in addition to prices, output,

and interest rates, they introduce three variables to capture the role of

credit: real bank loans, a spread between risky and risklems assets of

similar maturity, and the liabilities of business failures.           These

variables capture both traditional credit interpretationa and the
                                    19

determinants of equilibrium credit rationing.     The spread and business

failures variables are intended to capture the increased "agency costs"

faced by lower quality firms in their efforta to raise funds in a

downturn.45 They do not include money in their model on the assumption

that the money supply was endogenous under the classical gold standard.4'

      The model focuses on the effects of the loan msrket on economic

activity, snd so relates the real volume of losns to the spread between

interest rates on low- and high-grade loans,42 and the rste of business

failures. Calomiris and Hubbard used a monthly series on loans extended

at national banks in New York, Boston and Philadelphia, while we use total

nstional bank loans for the entire United States. Similarly, our output

variable is real CNP, while they used the monthly pig-iron series.      In

spite of these differences, in addition to the fact that their sample

spanned the 1894-1909 period, the results from the two versions of the

model are quite similar.43

      As with the basic monetarist model, not all structural coefficients

are of the anticipated signs, the most notable being the positive impact

of the interest rate on output.    The impulse response functions show a

healthy impact of loan innovations on output, and also exhibit the initial

positive response to interest rate shocks found in the monetarist model

(Figure 2). The most striking feature of the results is the 35.9 percent

of output forecast error variance explmined by loan innovations.

Calomiris and Hubbard found that only 10.6 percent of this variance could

be explained by real loan shocks in their monthly data.      We will have

occasion to return to this difference in section 4 below. In summary, the

basic credit model, applied to the national banking era, does not turn up
                                     20

any evidence that would lead one to doubt it.




                       Uybrid Monetarist Model

       Table 3 describes the results of estimating a hybrid monetarist

model, expanded by adding credit variables.        Thus, we add business

failures and the spread variable to the five variables of the basic

monetarist specification. In addition, we use the         money supply and

base, since, from the credit viewpoint, it is real balance sheet variables

that are important.    Unfortunately, we sre not able to add the losns

variable to the basic monetarist model, because of the close relationship

between movements in the quantity of loans on the one hand, and the base

and money supply on the other. Of course, this difficulty dogs all tests

of the relative merits of the two views.44 This omission is remedied in

the fourth model, discussed below.

       The identification restrictions in the top part of Table 3 sre

driven by those in the two basit models.      Thus, increases in business

failures and the spread are anticipated by the credit view to have a

depressing effect on M2, real GNP and the deflator, after the monetarist

effects of the first model have been accounted for, while an increase in

business failures is expected to increase the spread between rates on low-

and high-quality bonds. The dependence of business failure and spread

innovations on interest rate and price innovations is as specified in the

basic credit model.        A substantially higher proportion of the

contemporaneous interactions have the wrong sign than in the basic

monetarist model, the most egregious being the response of M2 to the base,

and of real output to money. However, there is a strong positive response
                                     21

of output to M2 innovations after two quarters have elapsed (Figure 3).

Money innovstions appear to have a smaller permanent effect on the level

of output, and the permanent effect of base innovations has disappeared.

Similarly, the proportion of the output forecast error variance explained

by money add base innovations is 25 percent, little changed from the 26.8

percent found in the basic monetarist model. We also note that the

variables added to represent the credit story, the interest rste spread

and the rate of business failures, together explain only 9.6 percent of

the variability of real Cr42, which approximsLely matches their performance

in the basic credit model.



                           D. Hybrid Credit Model

         Table 4 describes the results of expanding the basic credit model

to include the effects of changes in the quantity of money. The delicate

issue here is whether loans and money should be expressed in real or

nominal terms.     The credit view holds that it is the real quantity of

loans that is important for real output, while the monetarist view focuses

on the short run output effects of changes in the nominal quantity of

money.     The specification of Table 4 casts both variables in nominal

terms, but allows for real effects to be consistently estimated by

 including the inflation rate in the output and loans equations.45

         The responses of real Cr42 to nominal loans and money both die out

 after about three years, as Figure 4 shows. Loans exhibit a substantial

permanent change in response to a money shock, hut there is not a marked

 response of money to a loan shock. Similsrly, the vsrisnce decompositions

 in the lower panel of Table 4 show thst 26.3 percent of loan variability
                                    22

is accounted for by money shocks, while only 5.9 percent of money

variability comes from loan shocks. This may, however, be a consequence

of including money in the loan equation, while excluding a contemporaneous

effect of loans on the supply of money. For this reason, the model is to

be understood as a monetarist generalization of the credit model.

      The variance decomposition also shows that the fraction of the

forecast error variance of real output attributable to loan shocks

declines dramatically, from 35.9 percent in the basic credit model, to 16

percent, when money is included. The contribution of money shocks to the

forecast error variance of real output is 14.3 percent. These figures do

not provide an exact comparison with the basic credit model, however,

since there loans enter in real terms. To provide such a comparison, we

recalculated the variance decomposition to assess the effect of real loan

shocks on real output, leaving money in nominal terms. The results, which

are shown in the addendum to Table 4, are little changed, although the

influence of money shocks declines slightly, while that of real loan

shocks is 2.5 percentage points larger than that of nominal loan shocks.

      The central message of this "hybrid credit model" is that the

channel of influence on output that operates through the money supply

cannot be ignored. Of course, loan shocks still account for a respectable

fraction of the variance of output forecast errors, even after money

shocks have been allowed for, and this is perhaps a greater surprise to

the monetarist camp than to the credit view.       However, it is always

possible that the loan variable is picking up shocks to the base, which is

not included in this model.

      The message of this section thus turns out to be generally negative
                                      23

as to the possibility of a clear choice between the two schools of

thought, using such aggregate data.         The basic models both appear

reasonably soothing to members of the associated school.           The hybrid

monetarist model leaves the money story intact when the interest rate

spread and business failures are added, but credit proponents could argue

that the base variable is accounting for the effects of loans. The hybrid

credit model suggests that money effects are important in addition to

those said to operate through the asset side of the banks' balance sheets,

but it is not a plank of the credit platform to say that money does not

matter at all. The close comovement between loans, money and the base

also clouds the interpretation here: monetarista could argue that the

incremental explanatory power of the loans variable arises because its

inclusion helps to separate base shocks from money demand shocks.

      It therefore appears that other data must be consulted, if we are

ultimately to be able to assess the relative merits of the two views. We

offer a first step in this direction in the next section of the paper, by

examining the composition of loans.



4. The Role of the Stock Market and Call Loan Market in the Institutional

Framework. 1880-1914

      The results of the VARs in the preceding section, if taken at face

value, suggest that both bank loans and money are important in the

transmission mechanism.    However, the institutional structure of the

national banking era directs attention to the fundamental reason for the

importance of bank loans in this period -   - the   intimate connection between

the stock market and the national banking system established by the
                                       24

inverted pyramid of credit and the New York call loan marker.

Disturbances to the stock market translated themselves into the call loan

market, which in turn had a dramatic impact on total bank loans in New

York City and in the rest of the country.

         A key feature of the regulations that defined the national banking

system was the imposition of different reserve requirements on three

separate classes of national banks.          Specifically, the Act of 1874

required country banks to hold 15 percent against their deposits, three

fifths of which, or 9 percent, could be held as bankers' balances with

correspondent national banks in reserve cities (with populations greater

than 50,000) or in central reserve cities (New York and, after 1887, also

Chicago and St. Louis). These balances earned up to 2 percent.            The

remaining two-fifths of required reserves were to be held in lawful money

(U.S. notes, specie, gold and clearing-house certificates). Reserve city

national banks were required to hold 25 percent of their deposits in

reserves, half of which had to be held in lawful money, the other half

available to be held as bsnkers' balances in central reserve city nationsl

banks.      Central reserve city national banks were required to hold 25

percent of their deposits in lawful money.46 Country and reserve city

banks kept excess reserves far above the required levels in the form of

bankers' balances in central reserve cities. These funds were a form of

secondary reserves. The reserve structure of the national banking system

has been described as an inverted pyramid, whereby most of the nation's

reserves ended up as bankers' balances in the central reserve cities, but

especially in New York.47

         Most of the reserves held as bankers' balances in New York nstions].
                                    25

banks were invested in the call loan market. Call loans were demand loans

secured by stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange and also by U.S.

and other bonds. Most of the loans were made to brokers who would then

consign the stock serving as collateral to the banks. The commercial

banks considered call loans the most liquid form of investment, since they

could be called at any time. The New York national banks dominated the

call loan market, with between a third and a half of their loan portfolios

in call loans during the period we cover.48      Close to 75 percent of

bankers' balances in New York were held in call loans between 1880 and

1904, the amount to be expected if the New York banks held the required 25

percent reserve requirement against those balances. In addition, country

and reserve city national banks and state commercial, savings, and trust

companies invested directly in the call loan market (using their central

reserve city correspondents as intermediaries) whenever the call loan rate

rose significantly above the 2 percent earned on bankers' balances. Thus

an inverse relationship existed between the call loan rate and bankers'

balances in New York City and a direct one between the call loan rate and

country bank excess reserves invested directly in the call loan market.49

      The inverted pyramid as well as the correspondent balance

arrangement and its intimate connection to the call loan market are widely

regarded as key elements in financial crises that punctuated the era.50

All the major banking panics of the period (1873, 1884, 1893, 1907) were

marked by withdrawals of bankers' balances (especially those representing

excess reserves) by the country and reserve city banks from the New York

banks. The decline in bankers' balances in turn put pressure on the call

loan market, causing call loan rates to rise and stock prices to fall --
                                    26

possibly inducing a stock market crash, The decline in New York bank

reserves could on occasion be so severe as to precipitate a psnic, which

could only be stopped by the restriction of convertibility of deposits

into currency.

      The evidence is mixed on whether the combined incidence of stock

market crashes and banking panics during the national banking ers reflects

causation from the banking system or vice versa.51 Although there were

twice as many crashes as there were panics, all of the major banking

panics also occurred close to stock market crashes.       On a number of

occasions (1899 and 1901), ayndicatea of prominent financial institutions

were able to reverse the pressure on the New York call loan market.52 On

other occaaions, panic was averted by the issue of clearing-house

certificates by the New York Clearing House and/or by Treaaury

intervention (1884, 1890).    However, on three occasions, (1873, 1893,

1907) this intervention was insufficient to prevent panic.          Only a

restriction of convertibility of deposits into currency sufficed.

      This experience suggests that a potential source of volatility in

bank loans may lie in call loans.        If that is the came this makes

questionable the importance of credit rationing.        To consider this

possibility we examine more closely the composition of loans in New York

City national banks and in national banks in the reat of the country.

      Bank loans were either demand or time loans, some secured by

different types of collateral: stocks and bonds, merchandise, and

receivables. The latter two categories of aecured loans were typically

issued on the real bills principle that they would be self-liquidating.53

The balance sheets of the New York City national banks had similar
                                    27

categories to that of the country national banks, but the composition was

quite different, reflecting the fact that New York City banks held no

excess reserves.

      Of the categories of assets just noted, credit rationing would refer

to loans secured primarily by merchandise, since discounts and call loan

rates were determined in active national markets.

      We show in Figures 5 and 6 data for one call date annually (usually

in September), 1880-1914, two categories of national bank loans as well as

total national bank loans for New York City and for all national banks.5

The two categories are loans secured by stocks and other loans.55

      The pattern that emerges from these figures is quite striking. New

York City loans secured by stock are highly volatile, exhibiting sharp

declines in the panic years 1884, 1893, and 1907 and slight declines in

two years with stock market crashes and no banking panics (1895 and 1899).

Other New York City loans by contrast are distinctly stable, with a mild

upward trend, and the movement of total New York City loans reflects that

of loans secured by stock.56

      For the United States as a whole, the pattern of loans secured by

stock is much less volatile than for New York City, but declines in the

panic years can be discerned. Other loans have a stable upward trend.

While total United States loans pick up some of the volatility of New York

City loans, they are considerably more stable.51

      The stable pattern of other loans compared to loans secured by stock

in New York City and, to a lesser extent, a similar difference in the

composition of loans in the United States as a whole, in country banks,

and in the United States minus New York City, suggest that whatever
                                    28

procyclical influence is exhibited by loans in New York City and for the

United States as a whole can be explained by the behavior of the call loan

aarket.   On the face of it, this leaves little room for an independent

influence on output variability of credit rationing.

      There remains, however, the question of the link between the decline

in the valuation of firms reflected in a fall in stock prices, and

declines in real output. On the one hand, this does not impinge directly

on the credit rationing story, which is typically limited to borrowers who

must resort to bank loans. On the other hand, some authors have argued

that a stock market crash can increase agency coats, causing investment

and real activity to decline.58      To measure the importance of this

channel of influence on real output, it is evidently necessary to control

for that part of stock price movements that is due to changes in

fundamentals, a subject for possible future research.

      To demonstrate the link between the stock market and loans secured

by stock, we plot in Figure 7 annual data in natural logs of New York City

loans secured by stock and the stock price index.        Figure 8 makes a

similar comparison between United States loans secured by stock and the

stock price index. As can readily be seen in Figure 7, volatility in the

stock price index is reflected in the New York City stock loan series.

The relationship is somewhat less transparent in Figure 8 for U.S. loans

secured by stock.

      One inference that can be drawn from Figures 7 and 8 is that the

significant results obtained for bank loans and other credit variables in

the VARs reported in section 3 reflect stock market disturbances, where

the principal stocks traded were railway stocks. These disturbances in
                                   29

turn could be reflecting earlier or contemporaneous monetary shocks,59 or

future output shocks.6° It is a mistake, however, to argue that the waves

of railroad construction in the late nineteenth century were independent

of financial markets, on the ground that 'There was no central bank to

mistakenly squeeze off economic activity by letting the money supply grow

too slowly."6' The stock market reflected banking panics and concerns

about the stability of the gold standard in the United States in 1890-97.

External finance that the stock market provided either advanced or

retarded railroad construction.

      It appears from this discussion that the principal source of

volatility in the series of total loans is the category of loans

collateraled by stock, whose effects are not the subject of the credit

story. The collateral for these loans was publicly priced, and not in any

way idiosyncratic to the individual loan contract.           Nor do the
characteristics of the borrower of such a loan enter into the pricing and

terms of the loan contract in any obvious way.        Instead, it is the

business loans represented by "other loans" that more faithfully relate to

the credit view. This is so even if loans collateraled by stock were not

used for stock purchases but, as money is fungible, were applied to

business use.

      Ideally, instead of the aggregate loans series used in the

estimation exercise of the preceding section, it would be desirable to

rerun it with data on other loans.      Unfortunately, quarterly data on

disaggregated categories of loans are not available for this period.

Instead, we have formulated a structural VAR model, which includes in

addition to the quarterly growth of aggregate loans, the quarterly change
                                    30

in stock prices, and the call loan rate. The latter variables are proxies

for the pattern of stock market loans, and so their inclusion should go

some way toward "filtering" the stock market loans froa the series of

total loans.

      The complete model, which also includes real GNP growth, real M2

growth, and the interest rate spread, is shown in Table 5. The call loan

rate is, in effect, serving both as an instrument for stock market loans,

and as a proxy for the commercisl paper rate. The exclusion of inflation

and the rate of business failures is explained by the need to limit the

size of the model. The results of the preceding section suggest that the

omission of these two variables is of little consequence.

      As Figure 9 shows, the response of output to real money shocks does

not wash out in the long run, while the output response to loan

innovations is more muted and transitory.     The variance decomposition

shows that 15.7 percent of the real loan forecast error variance is

accounted for by stock price and call loan rate innovations. While direct

comparisons cannot be made rigorously between models that are not nested,

it is nevertheless instructive to use the basic credit model of section 3

as a benchmark. In that model, 84.5 percent of loan variance comes from

loan innovations; with the inclusion of money and the proxies for stock

market loans, this proportion falls to 52.2 percent.62 There is also a

marked strengthening of the link between loans and the spread; 19.1

percent of loan vsrisbility comes from spread innovations, and 30.3

percent of spread variability comes from loan innovations in the stock

market model.   In contrast, these proportions are 4.4 percent and 8.8

percent, respectively, in the basic credit model.      These results are
                                       31

consistent with the discussion above of the significance of stock market

loans; the loans variable needs to be purged of the effects of stock

market loans in order to extract the essence of the credit interpretation.

        The bottom line is surely the proportion of output forecast error

variance explained by loan innovations, which is 9.2 percent in this

model, significantly lower than the 35.9 percent registered in the basic

credit model, and the 16.0 percent in the hybrid credit model. It is also

of interest to note that, when the stock market model is run with loans by

New York City banks - -    a   series similar to that used by Calomiris and

Hubbard (as noted above, with a far greater proportion of their loan

volume in the call loan market than was the case for total U.S. loans) -    -

the   contribution of loan innovations to the output variance forecast error

drops to 4.5 percent.63 Indeed a substantial fraction of the variability

in total United States loans is accounted for by movements in New York

loans, which in turn are largely composed of stock market loans. While

accounting for only one-sixth of total loans, the variance of New York

loans accounts for one-fourth of the variance of United States loans.

        In   summary, as one would expect from examination of the breakdown of
loans into their various categories, loans other than stock market loans
are not   closely related to output fluctuations during the national banking

period. In contrast, the contribution of money to output variability is

consistently in the range of 12-18 percent, and the combined contribution

of money and the base is about 25 percent.



5.    Conclusion

        A growing theoretical literature of the past decade assigns a major
                                    32

role to credit rationing by banks, defined as a reduction in bank lending

with little change in interest rates, in influencing the course of the

real economy. The theory, elaborated in the context of existing banking

and monetary arrangementa, is far more developed than empirical

verification of its propositions. The moat advanced efforts at empirical

verification apply the method of structural VARa to a limited number of

variables deaigned to show that credit variablea account for a

preponderance of output forecaat error variance. Our point of departure

is the application of the method by Calomiris and Hubbard to the national

banking period.

      We broaden the inquiry to encompass not only credit but also money

variables, and apply the atructural VAR   methodology to assess the relative
merita of money and credit explanations of real activity during the

national banking period.        This approach requires identification

aaawuptions to be made concerning the contemporaneous interactions among

variables. Since this approach also implies that the resulting system of

simultaneous equations containa no substantive misspecification, it is

well to teat the robustness of the conclusions drawn from any one model by

changing the identification assumptions. Experience with the models used

in this paper counsels that one place stock in those conclusions that are

consistent with all models.

      Table 6 summarizes our findings by showing the decomposition of the

output forecast error variance attributable to each model. The salient

feature of the estimation results is that the explanatory power of money

and the base is moderate and robust to changes in that specification of

the underlying model. Similarly, we repeatedly fail to find a sizesble
                                    33

output effect of the spread and business failures variables. Last, the

effect of loan variability on output fluctuations is highly sensitive to

changes in specification, and declines dramatically when money is

introduced into the model, and stock market loans are controlled for.

      These results motivate the conclusion that there is little support

during the national banking era for the "credit" view of the transmission

mechanism: that the asset side of bank's balance sheets is a significant

determinant of output fluctuations.      This inference, drawn from the

variAnce decomposition of our structural VAR exercises, is supported by

direct examination of the course of "other loans" (which we take to

represent business loans) over the national banking period. Other loans

exhibit little, if any, volatility, and so they cannot explain output

fluctuations.

      Our findings raise a number of issues that cannot be addressed

within the confines of the present study. We have not examined whether

interest rates flatten out instead of continuing to rise as output growth

reaches a peak, which is a critical implication of the credit story. The

VAR methodology is limited to an examination of short-run interactions

among macroeconomic time series.    The case of the equilibrium credit

rationing story is microeconomic in nature, and our data provide little

that can directly address the queation whether banks refrain from lending,

beyond a certain point, irrespective of their reserve positions.

      Similarly, we find striking the lack of fluctuation in "other

loans", a series that seems to grow with GNP. This may reflect an extreme

form of customer relations between lenders and borrowers, or it may be a

consequence of the relative ease of acquiring loans in a growing economy
                                    34

whose banking sector more than quadrupled over the period of our study.

It appears that these issues would most fruitfully be addressed by a study

of banks' historical records.

      Finally, we can ask whether it was the asset or the liability side

of bank balance sheets that contemporaries during the national banking

period regarded as problematical.    For them, it was unquestionably the

liability side, in particular, the inflexibility during financial crises

of the banks' bond-secured note issues.

      The policy conclusion that contemporaries reached was embodied in

the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. That legislation provided for the issue

of asset-backed Federal Reserve notes that were, expected to vary with

changes in demand. Credit rationing by banks was neither a concern nor a

policy issue.64 In the new regime, the prescription was once again for

loans to be based on short-term self-liquidating bills.      No essential

change was made in the regulations prevailing under the national banking

system with regard to credit.

14. The story can be complicated by distinguishing between certificates

of deposit and other deposits, with the former being close substitutes

for marketable securities. In this case, as E.F. Fama, "What's

Different About Banks?" Journal of Monetary Economics 15 (Jan. 1985),

pp. 24-39, and C. Romer and D. Romer, "New Evidence on the Monetary

Transmission Mechanism," Brookings Papers on Economic Activity (1,

1990), pp. 149-213, have demonstrated, if the reserve requirements on

certificates of deposit were the same as on demand deposits, the
                                     37

reduction in bank liabilitiea would have no effect on intereat rates and

bank loans would dominate in the transmission mechanism. Since reserve

requirements on certificates of deposit are considerably lower than on

demand deposits, this is unlikely.

15. According to K. Brunner and A. H. Meltzer, loans and other assets

(bonds) are not perfect substitutes (see "Friedmsn's Monetary Theory,"

in R.J. Cordon, ed., Milton Friedman's Monetary Framework: A Debate with

His Critics (Chicsgo, 1976), pp. 63-76). They construct s monetarist

model including a credit market, in which the effects of money dominate

those of credit.

32. An exception is Bernanke, "Money-Income Correlation," who, in a

six-variable system, permits one off-diagonal element of S to be non-

zero.


33. The actual estimation procedure used is full information maximum

likelihood (FIML) which converges in probability to the same values as

the "method of moments" solution of equation (5) mentioned in the text.

FIML minimizes the concentrated likelihood function:




                     -2lnlfl    in (raP)




over the unrestricted elements in r. The sample covarisnce matrix of

Ut, 0 ,   is   used in place of 0, for which it is a consistent estimator.

The covariance matrix of the structural errors, 2, is then estimated as

r 'or.


34. The ith column of r contains the contemporaneous coefficients in

the structural equation for the ith variable. Thus, in the Monetarist

model for example, one would impose the restriction that M2 does not

contemporsneously affect the base by restricting P21 to be zero.

35. The signs are those of the g3 terms. Since K equals S in the
                                    40

Monetarist model, ten of the off-diagonal elementa of I' are restricted

to be zero.

36. We also ran the model with gold flows in place of the monetary base.

The results are similar to those with the base, though less pronounced.

41. As evidence for this position, they cite studies showing interest

rate and price arbitrage between the U.S. and Britain, and unpublished

evidence that gold shocks reversed themselves within a short period of

time.

42. The spread variable was constructed from rates on different grades

of commercial paper, which are only available for Calomiris and

Hubbard's 1894-1909 ssmple period. We used the spread between rates on

low- and high-grade railroad bonds, constructed by Mishkin (see

Appendix).

43. A minor difference between the two specifications is that we do not

include the spread variable in the inflation equation, which aids the

convergence of our estimation procedure. This interaction was not

statistically significant in Calomiris and Hubbard's work.

Transmission Process," American Economic Review 78 (June 1988), pp. 446-

51.

45. We also ran the model using real loans, nominal money, and the

deflator, and found that the deflator coefficient in the real loans

equation was 0.94. This suggests that deflation of the loans seriea was

inappropriate in this model.

46. Although Chicago and St. Louis were important regional centers, New

York held the lion's share of bankers' balances. National banks in

central reserve cities also held substantial correspondent balances of

state banks, private banks, and trust companies.

47. The inverted pyramid was a natural outgrowth of the extensive

correspondent network developed before the Civil War. See J. James,

Honey and Capital Markets (Princeton, 1978), chap.4; and H. Myers, fl

New York Money Market (New York, 1935). In the unit banking system that

arose earlier in the century, holding balances with city correspondents

represented a valuable way in which a country bank could gain' acceas to

sn interregionml clearing mechanism (obtain domestic exchange and clear

out-of-town checks), obtain additional sources of credit (by interbank

loans and rediscounts, although rarely extended in this period), and

earn interest on excess reserves. The city banks on their part had

access to the interior and secured compensation for their services to

the country banks. The national banks thus extended an existing

framework.

there had been prior bad news in the stock market which was also

combined with increased commercial failures.

53. Other earning assets of the national banks were discounts and

investments. Discounts were usually not secured by collateral, and

differed from loans in that the interest charge was collected in

advance. Discounts consisted primarily of commercial paper, either in

the form of trade acceptances or lenders acceptances. Commercial paper

bore either two names or one name. The latter eclipsed the former by

the end of the period. These instruments usually traded in an active

national market, and the commercial paper rate fluctuated widely,

reflecting changing conditions in the money market. Investments

consisted of eligible U.S. securities required to back the note issue

and other U.S. securities held as a form of secondary reserves.

55. For 1880-88, the Comptroller showed four categories of loans:

    (1) loans on United States bonds on demand;

    (2) loans on other stocks, bonds, etc. on demand;

    (3) loans on single-name paper without other security;

    (4) all other loans.

       From 1891 to 1914, the Comptroller showed five categories:

       (1) loans on demand paper with one or more individual or firm names;

    (2) loans on demand, secured by stocks, bonds, and other securities;

       (3) loans on time, paper with two or more individual or firm names;

       (4) loans on time, single-name paper (person or firm) without other

           security;

       (5) loans on time, secured by stocks, bonds, and other personal

           securities, or on mortgages or other real estate securities.

        For each of the years 1889 and 1890, the Comptroller showed

different categories, not readily comparable to those of the preceding

and subsequent periods, and they are consequently omitted from the

figures.

         The first category of loans that we show in Figure 5 --       loans
secured by stocks -     - consists     for 1880-88 of categories (1) and (2), and

for 1891-1914 of categories (2) and (5). The second category in Figure

5 --    other loans - consists         for 1880-88 of categories (3) and (4), for

1891-1914, of categories (1), (3), and (4).

         We also compared demand loans secured by stock (i.e., call

loans) -   - category   (2) -   - to   the rest. The pictures are similar to those

presented here.

         We also drew similar figures for country banks and total United

States minus New York City. However, to save space we discuss but do
                                   44

not present the former, and the pattern of the latter, which includes

country banks, reserve city banks, and central reserve cities other than

New York, can be inferred from the figures we present.

56. Within the category of other loans, one of the subcategories

exhibited more volatility than the total.

57. For country banks, loans secured by stock were also more volatile

than other loans, but the difference between the two categories was not

as marked as for New York City. Results are similar for the U.S. minus

New York City.

62. Note that this also happens in the hybrid credit model, when money

alone is included.

63. In this specification, the spread and loans variables once again

explain minimal proportions of each other's forecast error variance.

64. Calomiris and Hubbard quote examples of "credit rationing and

credit market segmentation" which they state "appear frequently in

Sprague" (p. 437) (see his History of Crises). However, we interpret the

relevance of these quotations somewhat less broadly than do Calomiris

and Hubbard. All are drawn from Spragues chapter on the      panic   of 1907,

and are intended to illustrate the   inability   of reserve-constrained

banks to lend freely.
