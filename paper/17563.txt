                                              ABSTRACT

This paper investigates the behavior of asset prices in an endowment economy in which a representative
agent with power utility consumes the dividends of multiple assets. The assets are Lucas trees; a collection
of Lucas trees is a Lucas orchard. The model generates return correlations that vary endogenously,
spiking at times of disaster. Since disasters spread across assets, the model generates large risk premia
even for assets with stable fundamentals. Very small assets may comove endogenously and hence
earn positive risk premia even if their fundamentals are independent of the rest of the economy. I provide
conditions under which the variation in a small asset’s price-dividend ratio can be attributed almost
entirely to variation in its risk premium.

   This paper investigates the behavior of asset prices in an endowment economy in which
a representative agent with power utility consumes the dividends of N assets. The assets
are Lucas (1978, 1987) trees, so I call the collection of assets a Lucas orchard. Despite its
simple structure, the model generates rich interactions between the prices of assets, including
several phenomena that have been documented in the empirical literature; it illustrates “the
importance of explicit recognition of the essential interdependences of markets in theoretical
and empirical specifications of financial models” (Brainard and Tobin (1968)).
   Each of the assets is assumed to have i.i.d. dividend growth over time, though there may
be correlation between the dividend growth rates of different assets. This framework allows
for the case in which dividends follow geometric Brownian motions, but also allows for a
rich structure of jumps in dividends. Standard lognormal models make poor predictions
for key asset-pricing quantities such as the equity premium and riskless rate (Mehra and
Prescott (1985)). By allowing for rare disasters, I can avoid these puzzles in the manner
of Rietz (1988) and Barro (2006), without relying on implausible levels of risk aversion or
consumption volatility.
   I highlight the important features of the model in a pair of two-tree examples. In
the first, dividends follow independent geometric Brownian motions. An asset’s valuation
ratio depends on its dividend share of consumption: all else equal, an asset is riskier if it
contributes a large proportion of consumption than if it contributes a small proportion. A
cashflow shock to one asset affects the dividend shares, and hence valuation ratios, of all
other assets, so comovement arises even between assets whose dividends are independent.
(Such comovement is a feature of the data. Shiller (1989) shows that stock prices in the US
and UK move together more closely than do fundamentals, and Forbes and Rigobon (2002)
find consistently high levels of interdependence between markets.) In particular, a small
asset experiences strong positive comovement in response to good news about a large asset’s
fundamentals. As a result, the small asset’s beta is surprisingly high from a naive point of
view, given that its fundamentals are independent of the rest of the market. This behavior
was analyzed in the log utility case by Cochrane, Longstaff and Santa-Clara (2008). With
log utility, the CAPM holds, so the small asset has a surprisingly high risk premium to
go with its surprisingly high beta, but the effects are quantitatively tiny. Things become
more interesting as risk aversion rises. Quantitatively, risk premia rise fast, nonlinearly in
γ. Qualitatively, the CAPM fails, and the small asset earns a positive alpha. The ICAPM
(Merton (1973)) and consumption-CAPM (Breeden (1979)) do hold; here, though, prices
are not taken as given but are determined endogenously by exogenous fundamentals.

                                              2
   In the second example, dividends are subject to rare disasters. Now prices, interest
rates, and expected returns can jump, so the ICAPM and consumption-CAPM also fail. As
noted above, the introduction of disasters enables the model to avoid the equity premium
and riskless rate puzzles. Of greater interest, there is an extreme form of comovement:
disasters spread across assets. If a large asset experiences a disaster, the price of the other
(small) asset drops sharply. This effect provides a new channel through which disasters can
contribute to high risk premia. For example, suppose that small asset 1 has perfectly stable
dividends, but that large asset 2 is subject to occasional disastrous declines in dividends.
Then a disaster for asset 2 leads to a drop in the valuation of asset 1. The possibility of
such price drops may induce a substantial risk premium in asset 1, an ostensibly safe asset.
   After extending to the general case N ≥ 2, I revisit these effects in an example with
three assets with identical but independent fundamentals (N = 3 being the largest case that
can be easily represented on paper). With three assets, the state variables are the dividend
shares s1 , s2 , and s3 . These add up to one, so the state space can be thought of as the
unit simplex. Smaller assets comove positively in response to a positive dividend shock for
a large asset, while larger assets comove negatively in response to a positive dividend shock
for a small asset. The interplay between these two effects leads to complicated patterns of
return correlation at different points in the simplex. Large assets are robustly positively
correlated with other assets. Two very small assets are positively correlated with each
other, not because they respond positively to each other’s shocks—quite the contrary—but
because they respond strongly positively to the third, large, asset’s shocks. Intermediate
between these two cases, small and medium assets have roughly zero return correlation as
the two effects—positive comovement with the large asset, negative comovement with each
other—cancel out. However, jumps isolate the two effects: correlations spike down when a
small asset experiences a jump, and spike up when a large asset experiences a jump. These
dramatic shifts in correlation do not occur in otherwise similar calibrations without jumps.
   Although one might have expected the effects of interest would not be empirically rel-
evant for assets that make up a small share of overall consumption, it is clear from the
examples that in fact some of the effects are strongest when an asset is extremely small.
To address this issue I consider, in the N = 2 case, the limit in which one of the two assets
is negligibly small by comparison with the other. This limit represents the most extreme
departure from simple models in which price-dividend ratios are constant, and crystallizes
some distinctive features of the model. To illustrate this, suppose that the two assets have
independent dividend streams. It seems plausible that a small idiosyncratic asset should

                                              3
earn no risk premium and that it can be valued using a Gordon growth formula, so its
dividend yield should equal the riskless rate minus expected dividend growth. I show that
this intuition is correct whenever the result of the calculation is meaningful (i.e. positive).
But what happens if the riskless rate (determined by the characteristics of the large asset)
is less than the mean dividend growth of the small asset? I show that the small asset
then has a price-consumption ratio that, as one would expect, tends to zero in the limit; it
also a dividend yield of zero in the limit, so its expected return can be attributed entirely
to expected capital gains. An unexpected phenomenon emerges: despite its independent
fundamentals and negligible size, the small asset comoves endogenously, and hence earns a
positive risk premium. In the general case, I provide a precise characterization of when the
Gordon growth model does and does not apply, and solve for the limiting riskless rate, risk
premium and price-dividend ratio in closed form.
       I also derive simple closed-form approximations for these quantities that are valid near
the small-asset limit. Time variation in the dividend share of the small asset induces time
variation in its price-dividend ratio, in its expected excess return, and in the riskless rate.
Under certain conditions, variation in the small asset’s price-dividend ratio can be attributed
to variation in its expected excess return: variation in the riskless rate is negligible by
comparison. This is a feature of the data emphasized by Cochrane (2005, p. 400). I also
show that when the Gordon growth model breaks down for a small asset, its log price-
dividend ratio follows an (approximate) random walk.
       The same phenomena are present in the example with N = 3, though I am not able to
derive analytical results. Nonetheless, the intuition for what is going on is the same: if the
riskless rate is lower than a very small, idiosyncratic asset’s dividend growth rate, then the
very small asset has an enormous valuation ratio that is sensitively dependent on news for
the large asset.1 As a result, it comoves and earns a high risk premium.
       At one level, it is the interaction between multiplicative structure (power utility and
i.i.d. log dividend growth) and additive structure (consumption is the sum of dividends)
that makes the model hard to solve. I solve for prices, returns, and interest rates in terms
of integral formulas that can be evaluated numerically, subject to conditions that ensure
finiteness of asset prices, and hence of the representative agent’s expected utility. When
there are two assets whose dividends follow geometric Brownian motions, or when one of
   1
       In the case where the two other assets are both medium-sized, the riskless rate is high enough that the
standard Gordon growth model applies: with more than two assets, both types of behavior can be present
in the same calibration, in different regions of the state space.

the two assets is negligibly small, the integrals can be solved in closed form using techniques
from complex analysis, notably the residue theorem.
   The tractability of the model in the general i.i.d. case is due in part to the use of
the cumulant-generating function (CGF). Martin (2008) expresses the riskless rate, risk
premium, and consumption-wealth ratio in terms of the CGF in the case N = 1, and
the expressions found there are echoed here. Working with the CGF, the mathematics
is no harder than when working with lognormal models, and there are some important
advantages. Most obviously, the model can handle jumps. A second benefit is that CGFs
bring a perspective that actually clarifies some of the proofs. If we had restricted to the
lognormal special case, it would have seemed natural to prove some of the main results by
tedious and unenlightening algebra. Working in more generality, it becomes clear that the
same results can be proved more cleanly by exploiting convexity of the CGF. (This is not
to claim that no tedious algebra remains.) Finally, the CGF wraps the technological side of
the model into a convenient package that simplifies—up to a point—what would otherwise
be extremely complicated formulas.
   Various authors have investigated multi-asset equilibrium models. Brainard and Tobin
(1992, section 8) investigate a two-asset model in which per-period endowments are specified
by a Markov chain with a small number of states. They present limited numerical results,
and—after noting that their “model is simple and abstract; nevertheless it is not easy to
analyze”—no analytical results. Dumas (1992) considers a two-tree production-based model
with shipping costs. Menzly, Santos and Veronesi (2004) and Santos and Veronesi (2006)
present models in which the dividend shares of assets are assumed to follow mean-reverting
processes. By picking convenient functional forms for these processes, closed-form pricing
formulas are available, at the cost of complicated interactions between the cashflows of
different assets. Pavlova and Rigobon (2007) solve an international asset pricing model,
but impose log-linear preferences so price-dividend ratios are constant. The most closely
related paper is that of Cochrane, Longstaff and Santa-Clara (2008), who solve the model
with log utility, two assets, and dividends following geometric Brownian motions. My
solution technique allows for power utility, for jumps in dividends, and for N ≥ 2 assets. I
also solve for bond yields, and hence expand the set of predictions made by the model.
   When not included in the main body of the paper, proofs are in the Appendix.

1    Setup

Time is continuous, and runs from 0 (the present) to infinity. There is a representative
agent with power utility over consumption Ct , with coefficient of relative risk aversion γ (a
positive integer) and time preference rate ρ. The Euler equation, derived by Lucas (1978),
prices an asset with dividend stream {Xt }:
                                        Z     ∞                 −γ
                                                  −ρt       Ct
                               PX = E             e                    · Xt dt .                (1)
                                          0                 C0
    There are N assets, indexed i = 1, . . . , N , that throw off random dividend streams Dit .
Dividends are positive, which makes it natural to work with log dividends, yit ≡ log Dit . At
                                                                                    et ≡ yt − y0 ≡
time 0, the dividends (y10 , . . . , yN 0 ) of the assets are arbitrary. The vector y
(y1t − y10 , . . . , yN t − yN 0 ) is assumed to follow a Lévy process. This is the continuous-time
analogue of the discrete-time assumption that dividend growth is i.i.d.: it allows for the
possibility that the assets’ dividends grow deterministically, though I assume throughout
that at least one of the assets is nondeterministic (the fully deterministic case being trivial).
In the special case in which y
                             e is a jump-diffusion, we can write
                                                                  K(t)
                                                                  X
                                y t = y 0 + µt + AZ t +                  Jk .                   (2)
                                                                   k=1

Here µ is an N -dimensional vector of drifts, A a N × N matrix of factor loadings, Z t an N -
dimensional Brownian motion, K(t) a Poisson process with arrival rate ω that represents the
number of jumps that have taken place by time t, and J k are N -dimensional i.i.d. random
variables. (I will write J ≡ J 1 when I discuss the distribution of these random variables.)
This framework allows for the possibility that different jumps affect different subsets of the
assets. The covariance matrix of the diffusion components of the N dividend processes is
Σ ≡ AA0 , whose elements I write as σij .
    The following definition introduces an object which turns out to capture all relevant
information about the stochastic processes driving dividend growth.

Definition 1. The cumulant-generating function c(θ) is defined for θ ∈ RN by

                                 c(θ) ≡ log E exp θ 0 (e
                                                       y t+1 − y
                                                               e t ).

    Since Lévy processes have i.i.d. increments, c(θ) is independent of t. Table 1, below,
provides conditions that ensure that asset prices are finite. In general, the CGF takes the


                                                      6
form given in the Lévy-Khintchine representation. If log dividends follow a jump-diffusion

                                                      
as in (2), then c(θ) = θ 0 µ + θ 0 Σθ/2 + ω E eθ J − 1 .
    I close the model by assuming that the representative investor holds the market, and
that dividends are not storable, so that Ct = D1t + · · · + DN t .


2     The two-asset case

2.1   A suggestive example

Consider the problem of pricing the claim to asset 1’s output with log utility. We have
                              Z ∞        −1
                                    −ρt  Ct
                   P10 = E         e             · D1t dt
                                0        C 0
                                         Z ∞                    
                                               −ρt        D1t
                        = (D10 + D20 )        e E                   dt ,
                                           0           D1t + D2t
and unfortunately this expectation is not easy to calculate. This, essentially, is the major
analytical challenge confronted by Cochrane, Longstaff and Santa-Clara (2008).
    Here, though, is an instructive case in which the expectation simplifies considerably.
Suppose that D1t < 1 and D2t ≡ 1 at all times t, so that asset 2 is safe, but asset 1 is
subject to downward jumps at random times. (The jumps may be random in size, but they
must always be downwards.) Then we can expand the expectation as a geometric sum:
                                                  ∞
                D1t                2     3
                                                  X
                                                      (−1)n+1 D10
                                                                n c(n,0)t
                           
          E             = E D1t − D1t + D1t − ... =               e       .
              1 + D1t
                                                           n=1

Substituting back, we find that
                       Z ∞       ∞                                 ∞
                                 X                                 X (−1)n+1 D10n
      P10 = (1 + D10 )      e−ρt   (−1)n+1 D10
                                            n c(n,0)t
                                               e      = (1 + D10 )                .
                        t=0                                           ρ − c(n, 0)
                                 n=1                                  n=1

If we define s ≡ D10 /(D10 + D20 ) to be the share of asset 1 in global output—a definition
which is maintained throughout—we can rewrite this as
                                                ∞          s n+1/2
                                         1      X (−1)n ( 1−s )
                        P10 /D10 = p                                  .                   (3)
                                       s(1 − s) n=0 ρ − c(n + 1, 0)

This expression is easy to evaluate numerically once asset 1’s dividend process—and hence
c(θ, 0)—is specified. For example, if asset 1’s log dividend is subject to downward jumps of
constant size −b arriving at rate ω, then c(θ, 0) = ω(e−bθ − 1), so ρ − c(n + 1, 0) → ρ + ω as
n → ∞. Meanwhile, s/(1 − s) < 1 so the terms in the numerator of the summand decline
at geometric rate and numerical summation will converge fast.

                                               7
   In this special example, we can write D1t /(1 + D1t ) as a geometric sum. In the general
case, the analogous move is to write the equivalent of D1t /(1 + D1t ) as a Fourier integral
before computing the expectation. The gain from doing so is that, as above, it converts the
otherwise intractable function inside the expectation into an expression involving powers of
terms in D1t and D2t , which can be dealt with using the CGF.


2.2     The general solution
                                               α1 α2
Consider an asset with dividend stream Dα,t ≡ D1t D2t , α ≡ (α1 , α2 ) ∈ {(1, 0), (0, 1), (0, 0)}.
The three alternatives represent asset 1, asset 2, and a riskless perpetuity respectively. As-
set prices depend on the value of st = D1t /(D1t + D2t ) ∈ [0, 1], the share of aggregate
consumption contributed by the dividend of asset 1. It is often more convenient to use a
state variable that is a monotonic transformation of s:
                                               
                                         1 − st

While st ranges between 0 and 1, ut takes values between −∞ and +∞. As asset 1 becomes
small, ut tends to infinity; as asset 1 becomes large, ut tends to minus infinity. Since y1t
and y2t follow Lévy processes, ut does too. If, say, dividends follow geometric Brownian
motions with equal mean log dividend growth, then ut is a driftless Brownian motion.
    The next result supplies an integral formula for the price-dividend ratio on the α-asset.

    The expectation inside the integral is calculated, via a Fourier transform, in equation

lutely integrable, Fubini’s theorem applies—and writing u for y20 − y10 , we obtain (4):

                                z=−∞ ρ − c(α1 − γ/2 − iz, α2 − γ/2 + iz)

Equality (a) is valid if ρ − Re[c(α1 − γ/2 − iz, α2 − γ/2 + iz)] > 0 for all z ∈ R. In Appendix
A.3, I show that this inequality holds for all z ∈ R if it holds at z = 0, i.e. so long as
ρ − c(α1 − γ/2, α2 − γ/2) > 0. I refer to this as the finiteness condition, and assume that
it holds when (α1 , α2 ) = (1, 0), (0, 1), or (0, 0).

    The pricing formula (4) allows for the stochastic process governing log outputs to be
any Lévy process satisfying the assumptions of Table 1. Moreover, Fγ (z) is a strictly
positive function which is symmetric about z = 0, where it attains its maximum, and decays
exponentially fast towards zero as |z| → ∞, so (4) can easily be evaluated numerically.
Equation (25) of the Appendix provides an alternative representation of Fγ (z) in terms of
elementary functions, though it is less compact than (5).
    The proof of Proposition 1 shows that for s ∈ (0, 1), finiteness of the prices of the
two assets—and hence of expected utility—is assured by the assumptions that ρ − c(1 −
γ/2, −γ/2) > 0 and ρ − c(−γ/2, 1 − γ/2) > 0. I also assume that ρ − c(1 − γ, 0) > 0 and
ρ − c(0, 1 − γ) > 0, so that aggregate wealth is finite at the limit points s = 0 and s = 1.

    For many practical purposes, this is the end of the story, since the integral formula is

                                                       9
very well behaved and can be calculated numerically almost instantly; I take this direct
route in Section 2.3. But the pen-and-paper approach can be pushed further in some cases.
       To explain how, we need some terminology. Let f be a complex-valued function. The
function f is holomorphic in a subset G of the complex plane if limh→0 [f (z +h)−f (z)]/h ex-
ists for all z in some open set containing G. To give some examples, polynomials, convergent
power series, the exponential function, sine and cosine are holomorphic; and compositions
and finite sums and products of holomorphic functions are holomorphic.2
       Complex integration takes place over paths in the complex plane: an integral might be
“along the real axis from −∞ to +∞”; “around the unit circle |z| = 1”; or “along the real
line from −R to R, then around a semicircular arc lying in the upper half-plane from R
back to −R.” Integrals like (4) have integrands that are holomorphic everywhere except at
certain singularities, away from the path of integration, where they explode to infinity. If
f is holomorphic in some punctured disc D0 (a; r) ≡ {z ∈ C : 0 < |z − a| < r}, but not at
a, then a is an isolated singularity: for example, f (z) = 1/z is holomorphic except for at
an isolated singularity at the origin. In this case, f has a unique power series expansion
f (z) = ∞                n           0
        P
          n=−∞ cn (z − a) for z ∈ D (a; r). If cn = 0 for all n < 0, the point a is a removable
singularity. (In other words, it is not “really” a singularity at all. Consider f (z) = sin z/z,
whose singularity at 0 can be removed by defining f (0) = 1.) If there is some positive m
such that c−m 6= 0 and ck = 0 for all k < −m then the point a is a pole (of order m). The
residue of f at a, written Res {f (z); a}, is defined to be the coefficient on the term (z − a)−1
in a power series expansion of f (z). If f (z) = g(z)/h(z), where g(a) 6= 0, h(a) = 0, and
h0 (a) 6= 0, so that f (z) has a pole at a, then Res {f (z); a} = g(a)/h0 (a): I use this repeatedly
in Appendices A.4 and A.5. The result that makes all this so useful is

Fact 1 (The residue theorem). Let Ω denote a closed path of integration which is to be
integrated around in an anticlockwise direction. If f is holomorphic inside and on Ω, except
for at a finite number of poles at points a1 , . . . , am inside Ω, then
                             Z                   X m
                                f (z) dz = 2πi          Res {f (z); aj } .
                                    Ω                  j=1

       It is an amazing—and powerful—fact that such an integral can be computed by ana-
lyzing the behavior of the integrand at its poles. To illustrate, I show how to derive (3)
   2
       Evidently, to be holomorphic is to be complex-differentiable. But note that not every function that is
differentiable when considered as a function from R2 → R2 is differentiable when considered as a function
from C → C. For example, complex conjugation, which maps x + iy 7→ x − iy, is not holomorphic, although
the function from R2 to R2 that maps (x, y) 7→ (x, −y) is differentiable.

from the more general (4). Doing so also provides a roadmap for the Brownian motion case
that will be considered below. To streamline the discussion I proceed heuristically, taking
as given various facts that are proved for the Brownian motion case in Appendix A.4.
       The expression (3) is valid for s < 1/2, i.e. u > 0. Setting γ = 1 in (4), substituting
α1 = 1, α2 = 0 to calculate the price-dividend ratio of asset 1, and imposing the fact that
D2t ≡ 1, so that c(θ1 , θ2 ) is independent of θ2 and equals, say, c(θ1 , 0), we get
                                                         eiuz F1 (z)

                   P10 /D10 = [2 cosh(u/2)] ·                             dz .                             (6)
                                                  −∞ ρ − c(1/2 − iz, 0)

We now proceed in a series of steps. The basic strategy is to attack (6) via the residue
theorem. To do so, we must integrate around a closed contour, rather than over the real
axis. Loosely speaking, we want to integrate from −∞ to +∞ and then loop back along the
arc of an infinitely large semicircle. More formally, we will consider the limit of a sequence of
integrals around increasingly large semicircles with bases lying along the real axis. Each of
these integrals can be evaluated using the residue theorem, by summing over residues inside
these increasingly large semicircles. In the limit, the contribution of the integral along the
semicircular arc—as opposed to the base—tends to zero. (This often happens with integrals
that are amenable to this line of attack.) The upshot is that the original integral (6) equals
2πi times the sum of all the residues of the integrand eiuz F1 (z)/[ρ − c(1/2 − iz, 0)] in the
upper half plane. These residues occur at the poles of this function, i.e. at the poles of
F1 (z) and at the zeros of ρ − c(1/2 − iz, 0).
       In this example, things are particularly simple because there are no zeros of ρ − c(1/2 −
iz, 0) for z in the upper half-plane.3 It remains to consider the poles of F1 (z) = (1/2π)Γ(1/2+
iz)Γ(1/2−iz). We will need two standard properties of the Γ-function. First, Γ(n) = (n−1)!
for positive integer n. Second, Γ(z) has poles only at zero and at the negative real integers,
and the residue at −n is (−1)n /n!. As a result, the poles of eiuz F1 (z)/[ρ − c(1/2 − iz, 0)]
occur at z = (n + 1/2)i for n = 0, 1, 2, . . ., and the residue at (n + 1/2)i is
                                                                   s n+1/2

Summing over all the residues, n = 0, 1, . . ., multiplying by 2πi, and rearranging,
                                                  ∞          s n+1/2

       By the finiteness condition, ρ − c(1/2, −1/2) = ρ − c(1/2, 0) > 0. Moreover, c(x, 0) is decreasing in
x since D1t < 1, so ρ − c(1/2 + k, 0) > 0 for all k > 0. It follows from Lemma 1 of Appendix A.3 that
Re [ρ − c(1/2 − iz, 0)] ≥ ρ − c(Re(1/2 − iz), 0) = ρ − c(1/2 + Im z, 0) > 0 for all z in the upper half-plane.

as in equation (3). This example illustrates the more general point that residues at two
types of poles contribute to the integral: (i) poles of Fγ (z), which are located at regu-
larly spaced points (n + γ/2)i, for n = 0, 1, 2, . . ., on the imaginary axis; and (ii) poles
of 1/ [ρ − c(1 − γ/2 − iz, −γ/2 + iz)].     The Brownian motion case is tractable because
c(θ1 , θ2 ) is quadratic in θ1 and θ2 , so the latter poles occur at zeros of the quadratic
ρ − c(1 − γ/2 − iz, −γ/2 + iz), of which there is exactly one in the upper half-plane.
   Now we return to the general case. The expected return on an asset paying dividend
stream Dα,t can be expressed in terms of integrals very similar to those that appear in the
general price-dividend formula. The instantaneous expected return, Rα , is defined by

   The long rate is a constant, independent of the current state u, given by

                                                   12
    For comparison, in a one-tree economy with all consumption drawn from tree 1, the yield
curve would be flat, with an interest rate of ρ − c(−γ, 0); and if all consumption were drawn
from tree 2, the interest rate would be ρ−c(0, −γ). Equation (10) shows that the long rate is
at least as high in the two-tree economy as in either one-tree economy. The long rate is equal
to the long rate in one of these economies if the requirement in (10) that θ ∈ [−γ/2, γ/2]
is binding. In the lognormal case c(θ1 , θ2 ) = µ1 θ1 + µ2 θ2 + 21 σ11 θ12 + σ12 θ1 θ2 + 12 σ22 θ22 , so
θ = γ/2, say, occurs if µ1 − γσ12 ≤ µ2 − γσ22 . This is intuitive: if asset 1’s mean dividend
growth µ1 is sufficiently small, then it will be negligible in the distant future, so the long
rate ρ − c(0, −γ) is determined entirely by the characteristics of asset 2.
    It is possible, though, for asset 1 to influence long interest rates even if its share converges
to zero over time with probability one. Suppose that σ12 = 0 and µ2 − γσ22 < µ1 < µ2 .
Then, even though tree 2 dominates in the long run (because µ2 > µ1 ), the long rate does not
equal the rate that would prevail in a tree-2 economy (because µ1 − γσ12 > µ2 − γσ22 ). This
is an instance of a general principle that the pricing of long-dated bonds is very sensitive to
bad states of the world (Weitzman (1998), Gollier (2002), Martin (2009))—in this example,
to states in which the slow-growing tree makes a significant contribution to consumption.

Suppose now that the dividend processes follow potentially correlated geometric Brownian
                      √
motions, dyi = µi dt + σii dzi , i = 1, 2. Then asset prices can be expressed in terms of the
hypergeometric function F (a, b; c; z), which is defined for |z| < 1 by the power series

                       a·b       a(a + 1) · b(b + 1) 2 a(a + 1)(a + 2) · b(b + 1)(b + 2) 3
F (a, b; c; z) = 1 +          z+                    z +                                 z + ··· ,
                       1! · c       2! · c(c + 1)            3! · c(c + 1)(c + 2)
                                                                                            (11)
and for |z| ≥ 1 by analytic continuation of this series with respect to z.

Sketch proof. The result follows via the strategy laid out above: the integral formula (4) is
equal to the limit of a sequence of contour integrals around increasingly large semicircles in
the upper half of the complex plane. By the residue theorem, this limit can be evaluated
by summing all residues of the integrand in (4) in the upper half-plane. Carrying out this
summation involves some tedious calculation, but we end up at (12).
   Appendix A.4 has the details, but Figure 1 illustrates the approach by showing one of
the integrals in the sequence for a particular calibration and u > 0. The surface is the real

part of the integrand in (4); several poles are visible where it explodes to infinity. The dark
line indicates the semicircular contour along which we integrate, whose base lies on the real
axis. By the residue theorem, the integral over the contour can be evaluated by computing

                                                       14
the residues at those poles that happen to lie inside the semicircle. As the semicircle’s radius
becomes larger and larger, the integral along the base approaches (4), while the integral
around the semicircular arc tends to zero. Notice how the arc of the semicircle threads
between the poles that form a spine running up the imaginary axis: this is always possible
because once we get sufficiently far up the imaginary axis, the poles are evenly spaced.
   Finally, the riskless rate r is given, in the Brownian motion case, by r dt = − E(dM/M ),
where Mt ≡ e−ρt Ct−γ ; (13) follows by Itô’s lemma.

   This result can be extended to the case in which log dividends follow a jump-diffusion
as in (2), so long as the only type of jumps that occur are global jumps:

Definition 2 (Global jumps). A jump is global if it causes each asset’s dividend to decline
by the same proportion, i.e. J1k = J2k for all k in (2).

Proposition 5. If all jumps are global, then equation (12) of Proposition 4 continues to
hold with ρ replaced by ρ0 ≡ ρ − ω E e(1−γ)·J1 − 1 , and equation (13) continues to hold with
                                                  

ρ replaced by ρ00 ≡ ρ − ω E e−γ·J1 − 1 .
                                       


Proof. The global jumps condition implies that the CGF takes the form c(θ) = θ 0 µ +
θ 0 Σθ/2 + ω E eJ1 (θ1 +θ2 ) − 1 . In the case of the price-dividend ratio (4), we substitute
                                

θ1 = 1 − γ/2 − iz and θ2 = −γ/2 + iz into c(θ); in the case of the riskless rate (9), we
substitute θ1 = −γ/2 − iz and θ2 = −γ/2 + iz. In each case, the sum θ1 + θ2 is independent
of z, so the jump component of the CGF, ω E eJ1 (θ1 +θ2 ) − 1 , is a constant independent of
                                                             

z. We can therefore fold this constant into ρ, and the result follows.


2.3   Two examples

I now present two numerical examples. The first is a conditionally lognormal model driven
by Brownian motions, so the consumption-CAPM and ICAPM hold, and familiar intuition
can be brought to bear. It is also easy to use Itô’s lemma to calculate second-moment
quantities such as betas and return volatilities, and I do so without further comment. The
second example illustrates the effects of disastrous jumps, and is revisited later in the paper
with N > 2. Dividend growth is independent and symmetrically distributed across assets in
both examples, so that any correlations and asymmetries that emerge do so endogenously.
I consider several different risk aversion parameters γ, and adjust the time preference rate
ρ so that the long rate remains constant, at 7%, as γ varies. In each example, I consider the
largest possible range of γ ≥ 1 that is consistent with the finiteness assumptions in Table 1.

2.3.1   Dividends follow geometric Brownian motions

Suppose that the two assets have dividends which follow geometric Brownian motions.
Each has mean log dividend growth of 2% and dividend volatility of 10%. In the notation
of equation (2), µ1 = µ2 = 0.02, σ11 = σ22 = 0.12 , and σ12 = 0. Because both assets have
the same mean dividend growth, mean consumption growth does not vary with s. But
the standard deviation of consumption growth does vary: it is lowest “in the middle”, for
s = 0.5, where there is most diversification. At the edges, where s is close to 0 or to 1, one
of the two assets dominates the economy, and consumption growth is more volatile: the
representative agent’s eggs are all in one technological basket. Time-varying consumption
growth volatility leads to a time-varying riskless rate. Figure 2a plots the riskless rate
against asset 1’s share of output s. Riskless rates are high for intermediate values of s
because consumption volatility is low, which diminishes the motive for precautionary saving.
Riskless rates also respond to changing expected consumption growth, with a sensitivity that
depends on the elasticity of intertemporal substitution 1/γ, but this channel is absent in
the present example because mean consumption growth is constant.

             Figure 2: Left: Riskless rate. Right: Price-dividend ratio of asset 1.


   Figure 2b shows the price-dividend ratio of asset 1 and of the market. When s is small,
asset 1 contributes a small proportion of consumption. It therefore has little systematic
risk, and hence a high valuation. As its dividend share increases, its discount rate increases
both because the riskless rate increases and because its risk premium increases, as discussed
further below. The model predicts that assets may have very high price-dividend ratios but
not very low price-dividend ratios. Moreover, as an asset’s share approaches zero, its price-
dividend ratio becomes sensitively dependent on its share. I explore these issues further in
Section 2.4.

Figure 3: Left: The two components of expected returns: expected capital gains (solid) and
dividend yields (dashed). Right: Excess return on asset 1 against s.


   Figure 3a decomposes expected returns into dividend yield plus expected capital gain.
Most of the time-series and cross-sectional variation in expected returns can be attributed
to changes in dividend yield rather than in expected capital gains.
   Figure 3b shows how the risk premium on asset 1 varies with s for each γ. Holding
s constant, the risk premium is monotonically increasing in γ. In the limit s → 1, for
example, we are back in a one-tree world in which the risk premium is the familiar γσ11 ,
so at the right hand side of the figure the risk premia march up linearly as γ increases:
1%, 2%, . . . , 6%. In contrast, for fixed s close to zero, asset 1’s risk premium rises faster
than linearly in γ. In this lognormal calibration the consumption-CAPM holds, so the risk
premium depends on γ, on the correlation between asset 1 and consumption growth, κ1,∆c ,
and on the volatility of asset 1’s return σ1 and of consumption growth σ∆c : risk premium
= γκ1,∆c σ1 σ∆c . So two effects are in play. First, the price of risk, γσ∆c , increases linearly
in γ. Second, asset 1’s quantity of risk, κ1,∆c σ1 , increases. This could be due either to an
increase in the correlation of asset 1’s return with consumption growth, or to an increase
in the volatility of asset 1’s return; it will turn out to be due to the former.
   Now consider the behavior of the risk premium as s varies, holding γ constant. For γ
between 1 and 4, the risk premium is monotonically increasing in s, and it tends to zero
as s tends to zero, though for γ between 2 and 4 the risk premium rises very rapidly for
s close to zero, so that even very small assets earn economically significant risk premia.
For γ equal to 5 or 6, the risk premium is nonmonotonic, and tends to a strictly positive
quantity as s → 0. Again, this reflects the emergence of correlation despite the fact that,
for small s, asset 1’s fundamentals are almost uncorrelated with consumption growth. Thus



                                                                 17
we have the interesting feature that as γ increases, asset prices behave qualitatively, not
just quantitatively, differently. In the terminology of Section 2.4, where I explore this
further, asset 1 is subcritical if γ = 1; subcritical but nearly supercritical if γ = 2, 3, 4; and
supercritical if γ = 5, 6.

              (a) Excess volatility of asset 1.                           (b) Excess volatility of the market.


Figure 4: Left: Asset 1’s excess return volatility relative to its (constant) dividend volatility.
Right: The market’s excess return volatility relative to its (nonconstant) dividend volatility.


   At first sight it is surprising that asset 1’s risk premium achieves its maximum at a value
of s close to but strictly less than one. It does so because asset 1 has excess volatility at this
point. Figure 4a plots the amount, in percentage points, by which asset 1’s return volatility
exceeds its dividend volatility. Asset 1’s volatility is smaller than its dividend volatility for
small s and larger for large s. Since the larger asset has a higher weight in the market, the
model generates excess volatility in the aggregate market when γ > 1 (Figure 4b). With log
utility, there is no excess volatility because the price-dividend ratio of the aggregate market
is constant. For the same reason, there is no excess volatility when s = 1/2 or equivalently
u = 0: the market price-dividend ratio is flat, as a function of u, at that point. Lastly,
there is no excess volatility in the one-tree limits, s = 0, 1, or equivalently u = −∞ or +∞;
again, the market price-dividend ratio is flat as a function of u in the limit.
   In the two-asset case, two types of shock move an asset’s price: a shock to its dividends,
or a shock to the other asset’s dividends, which changes the asset’s price by changing its
price-dividend ratio. Figure 5 plots the percentage price response of asset 1 (solid) and asset
2 (dashed) to a 1% increase in asset 1’s dividends. When asset 1 is small, it underreacts
to good news about its own cashflow shock and asset 2 moves in the opposite direction.
When asset 1 is large, it overreacts to good news about its own cashflow shock, and asset
2 moves in the same direction. Note also that asset 2’s price moves considerably more, in
response to dividend news for asset 1, when asset 1 is large than when it is small. Again,

the sizes of these effects are nonlinear in γ. For γ equal to 5 or 6, it is even possible for
asset 1 to react more to asset 2’s dividend than to its own (because for these values of γ,
the response of asset 1’s price at the left-hand side of Figure 5a is less than the response of
asset 2’s price at the right-hand side of Figure 5b; note that the setup is symmetrical). The
result can be seen in Figure 5c: the two assets have highly correlated returns despite their
independent fundamentals. The amount of correlation increases sharply with γ, especially
when one asset is much larger than the other.

    Since the consumption-CAPM holds in this calibration, an asset’s risk premium lines up
perfectly with the covariance of its return with consumption growth. On the other hand,
the CAPM does not hold except in the log utility case γ = 1, so it is interesting to see the
pattern of deviations from the CAPM that the model generates. Figure 6a plots asset 1’s
CAPM beta, covt (d log P1 , d log PM ) / vart d log PM (where PM is the price of the market).
It is mechanically equal to 1 when s = 1 (because asset 1 is the whole market) and when
s = 1/2 (because assets 1 and 2 are identical, and hence have identical betas, which must


                                                                                          19
equal 1 because the aggregate market’s beta equals 1). For the smaller values of γ, asset 1’s
beta declines towards zero fairly quickly as the asset’s share goes to zero. But for the larger
values of γ, asset 1 has a sizeable beta even in the limit as s → 0 in which its fundamentals
are independent of consumption growth. Figure 6b shows asset 1’s CAPM alpha measured
in percentage points, the difference between its true expected excess return and the excess
return predicted by the CAPM. When γ = 1 the CAPM holds so alpha is zero for all s. For
larger values of γ, asset 1’s alpha is mechanically zero at the two end points (because in a
one-tree world, the market return is perfectly correlated with consumption growth, so the
CAPM holds) and at s = 1/2 (because the two assets are identical, so their alphas must
both be zero). As asset 1’s share increases from zero, its price-dividend ratio drops sharply
and its alpha increases sharply. Since the aggregate market’s alpha is zero, this means that
alpha drops below zero as s decreases below 1.

    What is the source of the small asset’s high beta? To answer this question, it is useful
to split asset 1’s return into one part due to shocks to its cashflow, and another part due

                                                                                        20
to shocks to its valuation ratio, and to explore how each covaries with the market return:

This is analogous to the exercise carried out by Campbell and Mei (1993) who asked, where
do betas come from? Figures 7d and 7g report βCF 1 and βDR1 in the model. The two figures
add up to CAPM beta, shown in Figure 7a. As asset 1 gets larger, an increasingly large
proportion of its CAPM beta is due to covariation between its fundamentals and the market
return. In contrast, a very small asset’s beta is almost entirely due to covariation between
its valuation and the market return. The importance of valuation effects is particularly
pronounced if γ is large.
   To understand where alphas come from, we can slice CAPM beta up in a different way,
splitting the market’s return into a cashflow component and a valuation component:
                                                                                            

      covt (d log P1 , d log PM )   covt (d log P1 , d log C)   cov t   d log P 1 , d log  C
                                  =                           +                                . (15)
            vart d log PM                vart d log PM                 vart d log PM
      |           {z            } |            {z           } |               {z             }
             CAPM beta                cashflow beta, βCF M      discount-rate beta, βDRM

This expression breaks the conventional CAPM beta into a cashflow beta that measures
the covariance of the asset’s return with shocks to the aggregate market’s cashflows, and
a discount-rate beta that measures the covariance of the asset’s return with shocks to the
aggregate market’s valuation ratio. It is the continuous-time version of the good-beta/bad-
beta decomposition of Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004). In a loglinear approximation of
a homoskedastic conditionally lognormal model, Campbell (1993) derives an ICAPM result
whose continuous-time analogue is that

                                  RP = γσ 2 βCF M + σ 2 βDRM ,                                  (16)

where RP1 denotes asset 1’s instantaneous risk premium, σ 2 is the instantaneous variance
of the market return, and βCF M and βDRM were defined in (15). The online Appendix
shows that (16) holds to high accuracy in the present calibration. Figures 7b and 7c plot
cashflow beta and discount-rate beta against s. For small assets, CAPM beta is composed
almost entirely of (“bad”) cashflow beta. When γ = 1, discount-rate beta is zero across the
whole range of s—hence CAPM beta is identically equal to cashflow beta—because with
log utility the consumption-wealth ratio, i.e. the market’s valuation ratio, is constant. For
larger values of γ, (“good”) discount-rate beta becomes a significant contributor once asset

                                                  21
1 is large. Since discount-rate beta earns a lower risk premium than cashflow beta, large
assets earn negative alphas and small assets earn positive alphas.
   To understand why the cashflow and discount-rate betas look as they do, we can do
a further decomposition that, essentially, combines (14) and (15), splitting the returns
on both asset 1 and the market into cashflow and discount-rate components. (Campbell,
Polk and Vuolteenaho (2010) carry out this completing-the-square exercise.) Doing so, we
see that cashflow betas are high for a small asset because the small asset’s discount rate
covaries strongly with the market’s cashflows (Figures 7e and 7h). The picture is more
mixed regarding a small asset’s discount-rate beta. There are two forces pulling in opposite
directions: a small asset’s cashflows covary negatively with market discount rates (Figure
7f), while its discount rate covaries positively with market discount rates (Figure 7i).

   Figure 8: A high yield spread signals high expected excess returns on a perpetuity.


   Finally, we can consider the behavior of bonds in zero net supply. Figure 8a plots the
risk premium on a real perpetuity which pays one unit of consumption good per unit time.
Bonds are risky because bad times—i.e., bad news for the larger asset, whether asset 1 or
2—are associated with the state variable moving towards s = 1/2, and hence with a rise in
the riskless rate and a fall in bond prices. Figure 8b shows how the spread in yields between
a 30-year zero-coupon bond and the instantaneous riskless rate varies with s. A high yield
spread forecasts high excess returns on long-term bonds.


2.3.2   Dividends are subject to occasional disasters

The second example briefly highlights the effect of disasters; it will be explored further in
a three-asset example below. In addition to the two Brownian motions driving dividends,
there are also jumps in dividends, representing the occurrence of disasters. Jumps arrive,
independently across assets, at rate 0.017—on average, about once every 60 years. When

                                                             22
a disaster strikes an asset, it shocks its log dividend by a Normal random variable with
mean −0.38 and standard deviation 0.25. These disaster arrival rates—and the mean and
standard deviation of the disaster sizes—are chosen to match exactly the empirical disaster
frequency estimated by Barro (2006), and to match approximately the disaster size distri-
bution documented in the same paper. I adjust the drifts µ1 and µ2 , and the Brownian
variances σ11 and σ22 , so that the mean and variance of each asset’s log dividend growth
are the same as in the previous example.

                                    Figure 9: The disaster calibration.


   Figure 9 shows that, holding γ constant, the riskless rate is lower and the risk premium
higher than in the jump-free example for most values of s. As in Rietz (1988) and Barro
(2006), incorporating rare disasters makes it easier to match observed riskless rates and
risk premia without requiring implausibly large γ. Note, though, that with power utility,
disasters lead to far more variation in the riskless rate.
   Another feature distinctive to jumps is that disasters propagate to apparently safe assets:
when the state variable jumps, interest rates and bond prices jump too. As a result the
risk premium on a perpetuity is considerably higher than before when the current riskless


                                                                      23
rate is low (for s close to 0 or 1), even though disasters do not affect its cashflows; and
relative to the previous calibration, disasters have a much larger effect on the perpetuity’s
risk premium than on asset 1’s risk premium.
       As in the previous example, the riskless rate is locally constant at s = 1/2. Nonetheless,
the perpetuity earns a negative risk premium there because it is a hedge against disasters:
when a disaster strikes one of the assets, the riskless rate jumps down and the perpetuity’s
price jumps up. In the previous example, by contrast, the perpetuity was riskless at s = 1/2
because without jumps, the state variable could only move locally.


2.4       Equilibrium pricing of a small asset

A distinctive qualitative prediction of the model is that there should exist extreme growth
assets, but not extreme value assets, as shown in Figure 2b. The extreme growth case also
represents the starkest departure from simple models in which price-dividend ratios are
constant (as in a one-tree model with power utility and i.i.d. dividend growth). Finally, it
is important to understand whether the complicated dynamics exhibited above are relevant
for assets that are small relative to the aggregate economy. This section therefore explores
the price behavior of asset 1 in the limit s → 0.4
       Consider the problem of pricing a negligibly small asset whose fundamentals are inde-
pendent of consumption growth in an environment in which the (real) riskless rate is 6%.
If the small asset has mean dividend growth rate of 4%, the following logic seems plausible.
Since the asset is negligibly small and idiosyncratic, it need not earn a risk premium, so
the appropriate discount rate is the riskless rate. Next, since dividends are i.i.d., it seems
sensible to apply the Gordon growth model to conclude that dividend yield = riskless rate
− mean dividend growth = 2%. This argument can be made formal, and I do so below.
Now consider the empirically more relevant situation in which the riskless real rate is 2%.
If the asset does not earn a risk premium, the Gordon growth model seems to suggest that
the dividend yield should be 2% − 4% = −2%, a nonsensical result.
       To investigate this issue, I return to the general setup and make a definition.

Definition 3. If the inequality
                                              ρ − c(1, −γ) > 0                                         (17)

       In this section I assume that y
                                     e 1 has uncountable essential support, so that Lemma 3 applies. This is
an extremely weak assumption. The only remotely natural case in which it fails is if log dividends follow a
pure jump process with jumps of fixed size.

holds, we are in the subcritical case, while if the inequality

holds, we are in the supercritical case.5

       The supercritical regime occurs if ρ is sufficiently small, γ sufficiently large, or if fun-
damentals are sufficiently risky, in the sense that the CGF has large curvature.6 Consider,
for example, the case in which dividend growth is independent across assets, so that the
risk in question is both small and idiosyncratic. Conditions (17) and (18) can then be given
a simple interpretation, since the CGF decomposes as c(θ1 , θ2 ) = c1 (θ1 ) + c2 (θ2 ) where
ci (θi ) ≡ log E exp {θi (e
                          yi,t+1 − yei,t )}, so

                    ρ − c(1, −γ) = ρ − [c1 (1) + c2 (−γ)] = ρ − c(0, −γ) − c(1, 0) .
                                                            |    {z    } | {z }
                                                                           Rf        G1


More generally, if the assets are not independent, conditions (17) and (18) allow for the fact
that asset 1 earns a risk premium. In the lognormal case, for example,

                            ρ − c(1, −γ) = Rf + γ cov(∆y1,t+1 , ∆ct+1 ) −G1 .
                                                |       {z           }
                                                            risk premium

Thus the subcritical case applies whenever the Gordon growth model produces a reasonable—
meaning positive—dividend yield, and the supercritical case applies when the Gordon
growth model breaks down, predicting a negative dividend yield.
       The next result gives various asymptotics in the two cases. Bars above variables indicate
limits as s → 0, so for example Rf = lims→0 Rf (s). To highlight the link with the traditional
Gordon growth formula, I write G1 ≡ c(1, 0) and G2 ≡ c(0, 1) for (log) mean dividend
growth on assets 1 and 2 respectively, and R1 and R2 for the limiting expected instantaneous
returns on assets 1 and 2. Finally, I write XS1 for the limiting excess return on asset 1.

Proposition 6. As s → 0 the Gordon growth model, D/P2 = R2 − G2 , holds for the large
   5
       There is also a knife-edge critical case in which ρ − c(1, −γ) = 0 and z ∗ = γ/2. The simple example in
Section 1 of Cochrane, Longstaff and Santa-Clara (2008) is critical. This is no coincidence: the condition
that implies criticality also ensures that the expression for the price-dividend ratio is relatively simple.
   6
     In the lognormal case with γ = 1, condition (18) reduces to a simplified version of Cochrane, Longstaff
and Santa-Clara’s (2008) condition θ ≤ 1. With log utility and lognormal dividend growth, though, the
supercritical case only occurs in rather unusual calibrations.

                           Rf    = ρ − c(0, −γ)
                         D/P2 = ρ − c(0, 1 − γ)
                          XS2 = c(0, 1) + c(0, −γ) − c(0, 1 − γ).

   In the subcritical case, the Gordon growth model also holds for the small asset: D/P1 =
R1 − G1 . We have

                          D/P1 = ρ − c(1, −γ)
                           XS1 = c(1, 0) + c(0, −γ) − c(1, −γ).

If the two assets have independent fundamentals, then 0 = XS1 < XS2 .
   In the supercritical case, the Gordon growth model fails, and we have

       D/P1 = 0
        XS1 = c(1 − γ/2 + z ∗ , γ/2 − z ∗ ) + c(0, −γ) − c(1 − γ/2 + z ∗ , −γ/2 − z ∗ )   (19)

where z ∗ is the unique positive root of φ(z) ≡ ρ − c(1 − γ/2 + z, −γ/2 − z), so

                            ρ − c(1 − γ/2 + z ∗ , −γ/2 − z ∗ ) = 0.                       (20)

If G1 ≥ G2 , then D/P1 ≥ R1 − G1 . If the assets have independent fundamentals, then
0 < XS1 < XS2 .

Sketch proof. (Here I outline the proof for the small asset, which is the more interesting
of the two. See Appendix A.5 for the full proof.) The basic idea is that the behavior of
the integrals (4), (7) and (9) in the small-asset limit u → ∞ is determined only by the
residue at the minimal pole whose imaginary part is closest to zero, because poles with
larger imaginary parts are asymptotically irrelevant due to the eiuz term. I show this by
integrating around a contour which avoids all poles except for this minimal pole.
   The key issue is the precise location of the minimal pole. In the case of the riskless
rate, the minimal pole of the integrand in (9) is at the minimal pole of Fγ (z), which lies at
(γ/2)i by standard properties of the Γ-function. In the case of the price-dividend ratio (4)
or expected return (7), the minimal pole of the integrand could occur at (γ/2)i, but there is
also the possibility that it occurs at the minimal zero of ρ−c(1−γ/2−iz, −γ/2+iz). Lemma
3 in Appendix A.3 shows that such a minimal zero must lie on the imaginary axis, at z ∗ i,

say. If there is such a zero, then z ∗ is a solution to (20), and is unique by convexity of c(·, ·).
The question is whether z ∗ , if it exists, is larger or smaller than γ/2. In the subcritical
case, z ∗ may or may not exist, but it certainly cannot be smaller than γ/2 because φ is
concave, and positive at z = 0 and at z = γ/2 by the finiteness and subcriticality conditions
respectively. So the minimal pole of the integrand occurs at (γ/2)i, and the desired result
follows on computing the residue there; this is the less interesting case. In the supercritical
case, φ(z) is now negative at z = γ/2 by the supercriticality condition (18). Therefore there
is a unique z ∗ solving (20), by the intermediate value theorem and concavity of φ, and the
location of the minimal pole is at z ∗ i.
   The two alternatives are illustrated in Figure 10, which indicates poles of Fγ (z) with
circles and marks the pole due to the zero of ρ−c(1−γ/2−iz, −γ/2+iz) with a cross. (Not
all poles are shown: for example, Fγ (z) has poles at (γ/2 + m)i for all nonnegative integer
m. There may also be other poles due to zeros of ρ − c(1 − γ/2 − iz, −γ/2 + iz); if so, they
must lie off the imaginary axis and have imaginary parts greater than z ∗ .) For the sake of
argument, consider the effect of increasing patience on the part of the representative agent,
i.e. decreasing ρ. Starting from a high value of ρ, z ∗ is large (left panel). As ρ declines, the
cross indicating the pole at z ∗ i moves smoothly down the axis. After it crosses (γ/2)i, it
becomes the minimal pole (right panel), and there is a qualitative change in the behavior
of asset 1, which becomes supercritical.
   Figures 10a and 10b also show the rectangular contours around which we integrate. As
N → ∞, the integral along the base of the rectangle tends to the integral we want, and the
contribution of the other three sides becomes negligible.

   The large asset’s valuation ratio and excess return, and the riskless rate, are determined

only by the characteristics of the large asset’s dividend process, and by formulas that are
exactly analogous to those derived in Martin (2008).
       The small asset is more interesting because there is no economic reason to impose the
constraint that its price-dividend ratio should be finite in the limit.7 If it is, in the subcritical
case, then the small asset obeys the Gordon growth formula, and earns no risk premium if
its dividends are independent of the large asset’s dividends (and hence of consumption).
       In the supercritical regime, on the other hand, the small asset has an enormous valu-
ation ratio—reminiscent of Pástor and Veronesi (2003, 2006)—and one that is sensitively
dependent on its dividend share. As a result, when the large asset has bad news, the small
asset falls down the valuation curve, hence comoves. This means that the small asset earns
a strictly positive risk premium even if its fundamentals are independent of the large asset’s
fundamentals (and hence of consumption). Moreover, the expected return on the asset is
entirely due to expected capital gains, because the asset’s dividend yield is zero in the limit.
       The next result refines the previous one by showing what happens near, not just at,
the limit. When z ∗ > γ/2 + 1, the riskless rate, price-dividend ratio and excess return of
the small asset are approximately affine functions of s. Things are more interesting in the
supercritical case and in the nearly supercritical case in which γ/2 < z ∗ < γ/2 + 1, so I now
                                                    .
restrict to these cases. The notation a = b means “a equals b plus higher order terms in s”.

Proposition 7. The riskless rate is given, to leading order in s, by

                                                        .
                                              Rf = A1 + B1 · s.

In the nearly supercritical case, the dividend yield and excess return satisfy

                                                .                       ∗ −γ/2|
                                      D/P1 = A2 + B2 · s|z
                                                .                       ∗ −γ/2|
                                       XS1 = A3 + B3 · s|z                        .

       In the supercritical case, the dividend yield and excess return are given by

                                                .                           ∗ −γ/2|
                                      D/P1 =                     B4 · s|z
                                                .                           ∗ −γ/2|
                                        XS1 = A5 + B5 · s|z
   7
       In contrast, there is an economic reason to impose a finite price-consumption ratio in the limit. Since
P1 /C = D1 /(D1 + D2 ) · P1 /D1 = s · P1 /D1 , the price-consumption ratio will tend to zero if P1 /D1 tends to
infinity more slowly than s tends to zero. Appendix A.5 shows that this holds so long as ρ − c(0, 1 − γ) > 0,
i.e., so long as the price-dividend ratio of the large asset is finite in the limit. This is one of the finiteness
assumptions in Table 1.


                                                            28
where the constants Ai were given in Proposition 6, and the constants Bi are given in
Appendix A.5.1. Dividend yields are increasing in share, B2 > 0 and B4 > 0.
   If the assets have independent fundamentals, then excess returns increase in share, too:
A3 = 0 and B3 > 0 in the nearly supercritical case, and A5 > 0 and B5 > 0 in the
supercritical case.

   This result has three immediate implications. First, the exponent |z ∗ − γ/2| is between
                                   ∗ −γ/2|
zero and one, so s|z                         is much larger than s when s ≈ 0: its derivative with respect
to s is infinite at zero. Thus near the small-asset limit, the small asset’s price-dividend
ratio and risk premium are far more sensitive to changes in s than the riskless rate is.
In particular, changes in price-dividend ratio—which, mechanically, are associated with
changes in expected returns, since dividend growth is unforecastable—can be attributed
more specifically to changes in expected excess returns as opposed to changes in interest
rates. Cochrane (2005, p. 400) emphasizes that this is a feature of the data. Second, the
small asset’s price-dividend ratio is decreasing in its share, and so comoves positively in
response to shocks to the large asset’s dividend, no matter what we assume about the
dividend processes of the two assets or the correlation between the two. Finally, in the
supercritical case, the small asset’s log price-dividend ratio follows a random walk—more
precisely, a Lévy process. For, since st ∼ e−ut in the small-asset limit, we have
                                                           .
                                             log P/D1t = − log B4 + |z ∗ − γ/2| ut .                                           (21)

                                                               constant

If log dividends follow Brownian motions, for example, then so does log P/D1,t . This is why
(19)—which can be rephrased as ER1 = c(1 − γ/2 + z ∗ , γ/2 − z ∗ )—takes the form it does:
                                                   h                      i         h        i

by (21), it is expressing the fact that ER1 = log E D1,t+1

these phenomena in the Brownian-motion-driven example considered there. This should
make it clear both that the supercritical case does not require extreme parameter values
and that the magnitudes of the effects are economically meaningful. To recap, the world
is symmetric, and the two assets are independent with 2% mean dividend growth and 10%
dividend volatility. The small asset is not nearly supercritical if γ = 1; is nearly supercritical
if γ = 2, 3 or 4; and is supercritical if γ = 5 or 6. To keep the graphs readable, I plot γ = 1, 4
and 5 as representatives of the three possibilities. As always, I adjust ρ so that the long
rate is 7%. In each case, the riskless rate is essentially constant over the range plotted.
When γ = 1, asset 1’s price-dividend ratio and excess return are effectively constant. When
γ = 4, the price-dividend ratio almost doubles (from 69 to 127) over the range plotted and
the excess return varies between about 25bp and 75bp. When γ = 5, the price-dividend
ratio explodes and the time-varying excess return remains above 1.5% even in the limit.

The basic approach is the same with N > 2 assets. The main technical difficulty lies in
calculating FγN (z) ≡ FγN (z1 , . . . , zN −1 ), the generalization of Fγ (z) to the N -tree case. It
turns out that we have

new, notation. Let ej be an N -vector with a one at the jth entry and zeros elsewhere, and
define the N -vectors y 0 ≡ (y10 , . . . , yN 0 )0 and γ ≡ (γ, . . . , γ)0 , and the (N − 1) × N matrix

    In the two-asset case, the state variable was one-dimensional. With N assets, a natural
set of state variables is {si }i=1,...,N −1 , where si = Di0 /(D10 + · · · + DN 0 ) is the dividend
share of asset i; it turns out, though, to be more convenient to work with the (N − 1)-
dimensional state vector u. The first entry of u is u2 = y20 − y10 , which corresponds to the


                                                  30
state variable u of previous sections. More generally, uk = yk0 − y10 is a measure of the size
of asset k relative to asset 1. Consistent with this notation, I write u1 ≡ y10 − y10 = 0 and
define the N -vector u+ ≡ (u1 , u2 , . . . , uN )0 = (0, u2 , . . . , uN )0 to make some formulas easier
to read.
    The following Proposition generalizes earlier integral formulas to the N -asset case. All
integrals are over RN −1 . The condition that ensures finiteness of the price of asset j is that
ρ − c(ej − γ/N ) > 0. I assume that this inequality holds for all j.

    These formulas can be expressed in terms of the dividend shares {si } by making the
substitution uk = log(sk /s1 ).

    Unfortunately, I have not been able to make any further analytical progress from these
results, so I now resort to numerical evaluation of these integral formulas in an example
with N = 3 trees. This is the largest N that can easily be represented graphically. I use
the calibration of Section 2.3.2 with independent and symmetric fundamentals, γ = 4, and
ρ set so that the long rate is 7%, as before.

   Figure 12 shows three contour plots on the unit simplex. At the each corner of the
simplex, one asset is dominant, N = 1. The top corner represents the state (s1 , s2 , s3 ) =
(1, 0, 0); the bottom left corner represents (s1 , s2 , s3 ) = (0, 1, 0); and the bottom right corner
represents (s1 , s2 , s3 ) = (0, 0, 1). Along the edges, two assets are dominant, N = 2. Light
regions represent larger values and dark regions represent smaller values.
   Figure 12a shows the riskless rate. The contours indicate riskless rates of 8%, 6%, . . . , −2%,
radiating outwards from the center. The figure is symmetric because the calibration is sym-
metric. As in the two-asset case, the riskless rate is highest in the middle, where the three
assets have the same size, and lowest in the corners, where the economy is dominated by
just one asset. Along the edges, we have copies of Figure 9a.
   Figure 12b plots asset 1’s excess return over the simplex. The contours indicate excess
returns of 1%, 2%, . . . , 8%. Since the calibration is symmetric, we can also read off the
excess returns of assets 2 and 3 from the figure, by relabelling appropriately. If asset 1 is
dominant, it has a high risk premium, and as its share declines, its risk premium declines;
this is familiar. But as asset 1 becomes small, two distinct regimes emerge. If the economy
is reasonably well balanced, in the sense that assets 2 and 3 are of roughly similar size, then
the riskless rate is fairly high. In this situation, asset 1’s risk premium tends to zero as its
share approaches zero. But towards either of the bottom corners, where the economy is
unbalanced, the riskless rate is low—lower than asset 1’s mean dividend growth rate—and
asset 1’s valuation is high and sensitively dependent on dividend news for whichever asset
dominates the economy. As a result of this endogenous positive comovement, it requires a
sizeable risk premium even though its dividend is uncorrelated with consumption growth.
This effect is enhanced because of disasters: when the large asset suffers a disaster, the
small asset also suffers a “valuation disaster”. I will refer to the two regimes as subcritical
and supercritical, respectively, by analogy with Section 2.4. A new feature that arises once
N > 2 is that an asset can be either subcritical or supercritical depending on where we are
in the state space.
   Figure 12c plots asset 1’s price-dividend ratio. The contours are at price-dividend ratios
of 14, 17, 20, . . . , 35. The price-dividend ratio is lowest between the top corner and the mid-
dle of the diagram, where the riskless rate is high because the world is well balanced and the
risk premium on asset 1 is high because it is relatively large. As asset 1 becomes dominant,
towards the top corner, the price-dividend ratio increases slightly from its minimum as the
riskless rate drops more rapidly than asset 1’s risk premium rises. When asset 1 is very
small, there are two possibilities, as noted in the previous paragraph. In the subcritical

                                                 32
regime in which assets 2 and 3 are well-balanced, asset 1’s price-dividend ratio increases
towards a finite limit as its share and risk premium tend to zero. But in the supercritical
regime in which one of assets 2 or 3 dominates the market, so that the riskless rate is low,
asset 1’s price-dividend ratio can grow unboundedly as its share approaches zero, which
is why no contours are plotted near the bottom corners. Along the bottom edge of the
simplex, therefore, asset 1’s dividend yield and excess return move in opposite directions as
it shifts from one regime to the other.

      Figure 12: The riskless rate, and asset 1’s excess return and price-dividend ratio.


    The dependence of asset 1’s price-dividend ratio on the state variable generates en-
dogenous overreaction and underreaction to own-cashflow news, and positive or negative
comovement in response to cashflow news of other assets. Figure 13a shows how asset 1’s
price responds to a 1% shock to its own dividend in different regions of the simplex. The
contours indicate price increases of 0.5%, 0.6%, . . . , 1.2%. The thick dashed contour indi-
cates points at which the price increases by exactly 1%, i.e. at which valuation ratios remain
constant. When asset 1 is large—above this contour—it overreacts to own-cashflow news.
When it is small, it underreacts to cashflow news, particularly in the supercritical regime
in which its price-dividend ratio declines rapidly as its dividend share increases.
    Figure 13b shows how comovement arises, and specifically how asset 2’s price responds
to the 1% dividend shock to asset 1 (though because the calibration is symmetric, the figure
can be used to work out how any of the three assets responds to any other). The contours
indicate price increases of −0.3%, −0.2%, . . . , 0.7%. The thick dashed contour indicates
points at which asset 2’s price does not respond to a dividend shock for asset 1. If asset 1
is sufficiently large—at points above the contour—asset 2’s price increases in response to
good news for asset 1, i.e. there is positive comovement. If asset 1 is small, though, asset 2’s
price moves in the opposite direction following a shock to asset 1’s dividend. This negative


                                                       33
comovement effect is strongest towards the bottom right corner of the simplex, where asset
2 is itself small and hence in its own supercritical regime.
   Figure 13c puts everything together, plotting the correlation between the returns of
assets 1 and 2. This is the correlation due to the Brownian component of the assets’
returns, as would be calculated during normal times. The contours indicate correlations of
0% (the thick dashed contour), 10%, 20%, . . . , 70%. If both assets 1 and 2 are very small, at
the bottom right of the simplex, they are positively correlated with one another. This is not
because they comove in response to each other’s dividend shocks—on the contrary, Figure
13b shows that they comove negatively in response to each other’s shocks—but because
they both comove strongly with the dominant asset 3. As asset 3 becomes less dominant
this second effect weakens, and we move into a region in which the correlation between
assets 1 and 2 is negative, reaching a minimum of about −7%. In the middle of the figure,
where all three assets have the same size, assets 1 and 2 have positive correlation. This is
intuitive: the riskless rate attains its maximum at the center of the figure, so is constant
near it, to first order. On the other hand, dividend shocks do have first order effects on risk
premia in the familiar way. Thus a positive dividend shock for asset 1 drives down asset 2’s
share, depressing its required risk premium and leading to an appreciation in its valuation
ratio, and hence to positive comovement. The same logic applies, mutatis mutandis, in the
middle of the left-hand edge. Finally, if either asset 1 or asset 2 is dominant, the correlation
is highest of all, rising above 70%. In this regime, the risk premium effect continues to
operate, but there are now riskless rate effects that pull in opposite directions. Without
loss of generality, suppose that asset 1 is large. Positive dividend news for asset 1 makes
the world more unbalanced, driving the riskless rate down and amplifying the positive
comovement of asset 2. On the other hand, positive dividend news for asset 2 pushes the
riskless rate up, leading to negative comovement of asset 1. The first effect is quantitatively
more important, however, so the overall result is that the correlation is highest of all when
one of the two assets is dominant.
   Using the information in Figures 13a and 13b, the simplex can be divided into three
regions: if asset 1 is sufficiently dominant, it overreacts to own-cashflow news, and other
assets comove positively with it; at the other extreme, if asset 1 is sufficiently small, it
underreacts to own-cashflow news, and other assets comove negatively; in between, asset
1 underreacts to own-cashflow news and other assets comove positively with it. This last
regime applies when all three assets are the same size, in the middle of the simplex, where
the riskless rate is constant to first order.

    It is natural to ask what happens for larger N . How large must asset 1 be for other
assets to comove with it? And how large must it be to overreact to its own cashflow
news? In the N = 2 case, the issues of comovement and overreaction are intertwined: in
a symmetric calibration, if an asset experiences overreaction when its share is larger than
s—where s is the point at which P1 /D1 (s) achieves its minimum, s = 0.608 in the present
calibration—then other assets will comove with it when its share is larger than 1 − s.

          Table 2: Regions in which (positive) comovement and overreaction occur.


    For N = 3 or larger, this tight link between overreaction and positive comovement is
broken. Table 2 shows the corresponding results for N up to 6. In each case, I assume
that asset 1 has dividend share s1 , and that all other assets are equally large, with dividend
shares (1 − s1 )/(N − 1). The column labelled “rel. size” shows the ratio of asset 1’s dividend


                                                           35
share to the dividend share of (any) one of the other assets, i.e. (N − 1)s1 /(1 − s1 ). We
have already seen that positive comovement and underreaction are the norm at the center
of the state space. Indeed, positive comovement can occur even if asset 1 is significantly
smaller than all the other assets. On the other hand, for an asset to overreact it must be
significantly larger than all the other assets, and the relative amount by which it must be
larger increases fairly rapidly with N .
   Different calibrations deliver very similar results. In the no-jump calibration the critical
values of s1 are within 0.01 of those reported in Table 2. The same is true if we introduce
correlation between dividends in such a way that that consumption volatility in the middle,
where all assets have equal share, is held constant as N increases. On the other hand, the
critical values at which comovement and overreaction take place are sensitive to γ. Lower
γ reduces the variability of the riskless rate by more than it reduces the variability of risk
premia, so underreaction and positive comovement occur over more of the simplex.

   To make things more vivid, Figure 14 shows a 20-year sample path realization in the
three-asset example, starting from a state of the world in which the assets have dividends
of 9, 3, and 1 respectively. There are three disasters of equal severity over the sample
period, one for each asset. These disasters provide a particularly clean illustration of the
mechanism, since they isolate the effect of a dividend shock to a single asset. When the small
asset experiences its dividend disaster, its own price drops sharply, though it underreacts
since its price-dividend ratio increases. The medium and large assets comove negatively,
and hence experience modest upward price jumps. When the medium-sized asset has a
disaster, the same qualitative features occur, though with more quantitative impact than
in the case of the small asset disaster. When the large asset has a disaster, all the assets
comove positively, and experience large downward price jumps.

windows. The return correlation between large and medium, and between large and small,
is on the order of 0.5 in normal times. In each case, this is because the positive comovement
associated with shocks to the larger asset’s dividend outweighs the negative comovement
associated with shocks to the smaller asset’s dividend. When the smaller asset experiences
a disaster, however, the negative comovement comes to the fore, and we see the correlation
jump down below zero. When the larger asset experiences a disaster, both the other assets
move with it, and correlations spike close to one. Finally, the correlation between the
medium and small assets is close to zero in normal times due to two offsetting effects: the
two assets experience negative comovement in response to each other’s cashflow shocks, but
comove in response to the large asset’s shocks. The former effect dominates when either
the small or medium asset experiences a disaster, so correlations jump below zero; and the
latter effect dominates when the large asset experiences a disaster, so correlations jump
up. Such spikes in correlations are a familiar feature of the data, and here they arise in an
example in which the correlation in fundamentals is constant—at zero—at all times.


4         Conclusion

This paper generalizes the model of Cochrane, Longstaff and Santa-Clara (2008) in three
directions: it allows for power utility (rather than log), for dividends to follow exponential
Lévy processes (rather than geometric Brownian motions), and for multiple assets (rather
than just two). Each of these directions introduces interesting new types of behavior. Once
risk aversion is higher than one, the CAPM fails, and the concern expressed by Cochrane,
Longstaff and Santa-Clara that “the magnitudes are small” is lessened, because many of
the quantities of interest increase faster than linearly in γ. When we allow for jumps, we
step outside the familiar framework in which the ICAPM and consumption-CAPM hold.
The riskless rate and equity premium puzzles can be avoided; more interestingly, jumps

                                                  37
spread across assets, and thereby provide a new channel for high risk premia even in assets
that are not themselves subject to jumps in fundamentals. With more than two assets,
we can untangle effects that cannot be separated when N = 2. For example, comovement
and overreaction are two sides of the same coin when N = 2, but not when N > 2. It
also becomes possible to differentiate between assets on both the size and value dimension;
I explore this possibility in the online appendix. Jumps and multiple assets also interact
in an interesting way, leading to spikes in correlations in both directions, as comovement
effects that would be blurred together in Brownian-motion-driven models are isolated at
the instant of a jump.
   The solution method presented here is very different to that of Cochrane, Longstaff and
Santa-Clara (2008). Their approach relies in part on an inspired guess-and-verify solution to
an ODE, and in part on a series of miraculous identities between integrals. An unmotivated
identity does occur at one point in this paper—in Step 3 of Appendix A.4, where I derive
the closed form for the Brownian motion case—but in other respects my approach is (in a
good sense) more mechanical and therefore more amenable to generalization. For example,
Martin (2010) allows for imperfect substitution between the goods produced by the two
trees, so that terms-of-trade effects enter the picture, and Chen and Joslin (2011) show how
to handle the case with non-i.i.d. dividend growth. In a different direction, the approach
taken here can be adapted to compute asset price behavior in an economy with two agents
with differing risk aversion and one tree that is potentially subject to jumps, generalizing
Wang (1996) and Longstaff and Wang (2008) (and closely related to Dumas (1989)); or to
solve for asset prices with two trees and two agents with differing risk aversion.
   There are two particularly obvious areas to work on. The riskless rate fluctuates signif-
icantly in the model. If the model could be generalized from power utility to Epstein-Zin
(1989) preferences then this riskless rate variation could be dampened by letting the elastic-
ity of intertemporal substitution exceed 1/γ. An alternative view—which calls for a more
ambitious extension of the model, allowing at the very least for goods to be stored over
time—is that the riskless rate is stable not for reasons related to preferences, but for rea-
sons related to technologies. In each case, it is likely that the effect of reducing riskless rate
variation would be to enlarge the region in which underreaction and positive comovement
take place. A second question is whether the N -asset integral formulas can be solved ex-
plicitly in special cases. It is desirable to try to do so because these formulas are subject to
the curse of dimensionality, so become computationally intractable as N increases.

     for general α1 , α2 , γ > 0. A word or two is in order to explain why it is natural to rearrange
     E like this. First, with power utility, valuation ratios should be unaffected if all assets are
     scaled up in size proportionally, so it is natural to look for a state variable like y20 − y10 .
     Second, a function must decline fast towards zero as it tends to plus or minus infinity in
     order to possess a Fourier transform. Thus it is natural to reshape the term inside the
     expectation into an exponential term in ye1t and ye2t , which is easy to handle with the CGF,
     and a term in [1/ cosh(·)]γ , which is well behaved under the Fourier transform. Specifically,
     1/ [2 cosh(u/2)]γ has a Fourier transform, Fγ (z), that can be found in closed form for integer

A.2       Expected returns and interest rates

Given a jump-diffusion y, with dy = µdt + AdZ + J dN , there is a simple formula for
      0
E d(ew y ), where w is a constant vector. First, define x ≡ w0 y; then dx = w0 µdt +
w0 AdZ + w0 J dN . We seek E d(ex ). By Itô’s formula for jump-diffusions, we have

from which (8) follows, and hence also (9), by l’Hôpital’s rule.
   The function ρ − c(−γ/2 − iz, −γ/2 + iz), considered as a function of z ∈ C, has a
stationary point on the imaginary axis. Call it z ∗ = is∗ , where s∗ ∈ R; then s∗ maximizes
ρ − c(−γ/2 + s, −γ/2 − s). Poles of the integrand in (8) occur at the poles of Fγ (z): that
is, at ±(γ/2)i, ±(γ/2 + 1)i, and so on. If |s∗ | < γ/2 then the contour of integration in
(8) (i.e. the real axis) can be deformed to pass through is∗ without crossing a pole, and
therefore without altering the value of the integral, by Cauchy’s theorem. It follows that
Y (∞) = ρ − c(−γ/2 + s∗ , −γ/2 − s∗ ) by the method of steepest descent.
   If |s∗ | ≥ γ/2, then deforming the contour of integration to pass through is∗ requires
a pole to be crossed, and hence a residue to be taken into account. This residue, rather
than the precise location of is∗ , turns out to dictate the behavior of the long end of the

                                                    42
yield curve. If s∗ > γ/2, for example, the integral to be evaluated picks up an extra term
proportional to e−[ρ−c(0,−γ)]T . Since ρ − c(−γ/2 + s∗ , −γ/2 − s∗ ) is larger than ρ − c(0, −γ)
                                                           ∗ ,−γ/2−s∗ )]T
by construction of s∗ , the term in e−[ρ−c(−γ/2+s                           is irrelevant in the limit, and
Y (∞) = ρ − c(0, −γ). Moreover, in this situation, concavity of ρ − c(−γ/2 + s, −γ/2 − s)
implies that ρ − c(0, −γ) > ρ − c(−γ/2 + s, −γ/2 − s) for all s < γ/2. An almost identical
argument shows that if s∗ < −γ/2, we have Y (∞) = ρ − c(−γ, 0), and that in this situation
ρ − c(−γ, 0) > ρ − c(−γ/2 + s, −γ/2 − s) for all s > −γ/2. Equation (10) follows.


A.3     Consequences of the finiteness condition

This section develops two consequences of the finiteness condition ρ−c(α1 −γ/2, α2 −γ/2) >
0, which is assumed to hold for the values of α1 and α2 discussed in Table 1.

Lemma 1. For z1 , z2 ∈ C, we have Re c(z1 , z2 ) ≤ c(Re z1 , Re z2 ). The inequality is strict
                                              e 1 has uncountable essential support.
if z1 and z2 have nonzero imaginary parts and y

Proof. For any z ∈ C, Re log z = log |z|. It follows that Re c(z1 , z2 ) = log E ez1 ye11 +z2 ye21 ≤
log E ez1 ye11 +z2 ye21 = log E eRe z1 ·ey11 +Re z2 ·ey21 = c(Re z1 , Re z2 ). The inequality is strict unless
ez1 ye11 +z2 ye21 is real almost surely or imaginary almost surely, which is not the case if z1 and
z2 have nonzero imaginary parts and y
                                    e 1 has uncountable essential support.

    For y
        e 1 to have uncountable essential support it is sufficient, but not necessary, that one
of the dividend processes has a Brownian component or is subject to jumps witih continuous
size distribution. The only remotely natural example in which the inequality in Lemma 1
is not strict is if log dividends follow a pure jump process with jumps of fixed size.

Lemma 2. For all z ∈ R, we have ρ − Re [c(α1 − γ/2 − iz, α2 − γ/2 + iz)] > 0.

Proof. From Lemma 1, Re c(α1 − γ/2 − iz, α2 − γ/2 + iz) ≤ c(α1 − γ/2, α2 − γ/2), so
ρ − Re c(α1 − γ/2 − iz, α2 − γ/2 + iz) ≥ ρ − c(α1 − γ/2, α2 − γ/2) > 0.

Definition 4. Let f be a meromorphic function. A zero (or pole) of f is minimal if it lies
in the upper half-plane and no other such zero (or pole) has smaller imaginary part.

    Lemma 2 shows that ρ − c(α1 − γ/2 − iz, α2 − γ/2 + iz) has no zeros on the real axis.
The next result documents an important property of its minimal zero.

            e 1 has uncountable essential support, then the minimal zero of ρ − c(α1 −
Lemma 3. If y
γ/2 − iz, α2 − γ/2 + iz), if it exists, is unique and lies on the imaginary axis.

                                                     43
Proof. Let p + qi be a minimal zero, and suppose (aiming for a contradiction) that p 6= 0.
Lemma 1 applies with strict inequality, so ρ−c(α1 −γ/2+q, α2 −γ/2−q) < 0. But then the
finiteness condition and the intermediate value theorem imply that there exists q2 ∈ (0, q)
such that ρ − c(α1 − γ/2 + q2 , α2 − γ/2 − q2 ) = 0. If so, q2 i is a zero with q2 < q, so p + qi
is not minimal, giving the desired contradiction.


A.4     The Brownian motion case

In the Brownian motion case, c(θ1 , θ2 ) = µ1 θ1 + µ2 θ2 + 12 σ11 θ12 + σ12 θ1 θ2 + 12 σ22 θ22 . There are
two solutions to the equation ρ−c(α1 −γ/2−iz, α2 −γ/2+iz) = 0, each of which lies on the
imaginary axis. One—call it λ1 i—lies in the upper half-plane; the other—call it λ2 i—lies in
the lower half-plane. We can rewrite ρ − c(α1 − γ/2 − iz, α2 − γ/2 + iz) = B(z − λ1 i)(z − λ2 i)
for B > 0, λ1 > 0, λ2 < 0 given in the main text. The aim, then, is to evaluate

                                   −∞ B(z − λ1 i)(z − λ2 i)

in terms of which the price-dividend ratio is P/D = [2 cosh(u/2)]γ · I.
    The proof of Proposition 4 is somewhat involved, so I have divided it into several steps.
Step 1 starts from the assumption that the state variable u is positive and shows that the
integral (28) can be calculated using the residue theorem. Steps 2 and 3 carry out these
calculations and simplify. Step 4 extends the result to negative u.
    Step 1. Let u > 0. Consider the case in which γ is even. Let Rn ≡ n + 1/2, where n
is an integer. Define the large semicircle Ωn to be the semicircle whose base lies along the
real axis from −Rn to Rn and which has a semicircular arc (ωn ) passing through the upper
half-plane from Rn through Rn i and back to −Rn . I will first show that

                                            eiuz Fγ (z)
                                   Z
                         I = lim                             dz .                                    (29)
                             n→∞ Ω B(z − λ1 i)(z − λ2 i)
                                     n


Then, from the residue theorem, it will follow that

                                               eiuz Fγ (z)

where the sum is taken over all poles zp in the upper half-plane.
    The first step is to establish that (29) holds. The right-hand side is equal to
                           Rn

    The integral In tends to I as n → ∞. The aim, then, is to establish that the second
term Jn tends to zero as n → ∞. Along the arc ωn , we have z = Rn eiθ where θ varies
between 0 and π. At this point it is convenient to work with the representation of Fγ (z)
of equation (25). Substituting from (25), we have
                  Z π
                                 eiuRn cos θ−uRn sin θ P (Rn eiθ )
            Jn =                                                                · Rn ieiθ dθ

with P (·) and Q(·) polynomials.
    To show that Jn tends to zero as n tends to infinity, I separate the range of integration
[0, π] into two parts: [π/2 − δ, π/2 + δ] and its complement in [0, π]. Here δ will be chosen
to be extremely small. First, consider
                    Z π/2+δ

                 ≤                                                                       dθ
                     π/2−δ    Q(Rn eiθ ) eπRn (cos θ+i sin θ) − e−πRn (cos θ+i sin θ)
Pick δ sufficiently small that

                            eπRn (cos θ+i sin θ) − e−πRn (cos θ+i sin θ) ≥ 2 − ε

for all θ ∈ [π/2 − δ, π/2 + δ]; ε is some very small number close to but greater than zero.
This is possible because the left-hand side is continuous, and equals 2 when θ = π/2. Then,

Since (i) we can also ensure that δ is small enough that sin θ ≥ ε for θ in the range
of integration; (ii) |P (Rn eiθ )| ≤ P2 (Rn ), where P2 is the polynomial obtained by taking
absolute values of the coefficients in P ; (iii) Q(Rn eiθ ) tends to infinity as Rn becomes large;
and (iv) decaying exponentials decay faster than polynomials grow, in the sense that for
any positive k and λ, xk e−λx → 0 as x → ∞, x ∈ R, we see, finally, that the right-hand
                             (1)

    It remains to be shown that

is zero in the limit. Since δ > 0, for all θ in the range of integration we have that | cos θ| ≥

Now,

       eπRn (cos θ+i sin θ) − e−πRn (cos θ+i sin θ)   ≥        eπRn (cos θ+i sin θ) − e−πRn (cos θ+i sin θ)

which tends to zero as n tends to infinity.
   The case of γ odd is almost identical. The only important difference is that we take
Rn = n (as opposed to n + 1/2) before allowing n to go to infinity. The reason for doing so
is that we must take care to avoid the poles of Fγ (z) on the imaginary axis.
   Step 2. From now on, I revert to the definition of Fγ (z) given in (5). The integrand is

                                       eiuz Γ(γ/2 − iz)Γ(γ/2 + iz)
                                                                          ,                                   (32)
                                     2π · B · Γ(γ) · (z − λ1 i)(z − λ2 i)

which has poles in the upper half-plane at λ1 i and at points z such that γ/2 + iz = −n for
integers n ≥ 0, since the Γ-function has poles at the negative integers and zero. Combining
the two, (32) has poles at λ1 i and at (n + γ/2)i for n ≥ 0.
   We can calculate the residue of (32) at z = λ1 i directly, using the fact that if f (z) =
g(z)/h(z) has a pole at a, and g(a) 6= 0, h(a) = 0, and h0 (a) 6= 0, then Res {f (z); a} =
g(a)/h0 (a). The residue at λ1 i is therefore

                                      e−λ1 u Γ(γ/2 + λ1 )Γ(γ/2 − λ1 )
                                                                      .                                       (33)
                                        2πi · B · Γ(γ) · (λ1 − λ2 )

   For integer n ≥ 0, Γ(z) has residue (−1)n /n! at z = −n, so the residue of (32) at
(n + γ/2)i is
                                                                           n

                                                                  n!
                                                                                                              (34)

   Substituting (33) and (34) into (30), we find

    Since | − e−u | < 1 under the assumption that u > 0, which for the time being is
still maintained, we can use the series definition of Gauss’s hypergeometric function (11),
together with the fact that Γ(γ + n)/Γ(γ) = γ(γ + 1) · · · (γ + n − 1), to obtain

thus far, however, the derivation is valid only under the assumption that u > 0.
    Step 4. Suppose, now, that u < 0. Take the complex conjugate of equation (28). Doing
so is equivalent to reframing the problem with (u, λ1 , λ2 ) replaced by (−u, −λ2 , −λ1 ). Since
−u > 0, −λ2 > 0, and −λ1 < 0, the method of steps 1–4 applies unchanged. Since the
formula (36) is invariant under (−u, −λ2 , −λ1 ) 7→ (u, λ1 , λ2 ), we can conclude that it is
valid for all u. Substituting u 7→ log(1 − s)/s delivers (12).
    Step 5. Straightforward algebra gives the values of B, λ1 , and λ2 in terms of the
fundamental parameters. Since c(θ1 , θ2 ) = µ1 θ1 + µ2 θ2 + 12 σ11 θ12 + σ12 θ1 θ2 + 12 σ22 θ22 ,
                                                        1                1

where X 2 , Y , and Z 2 are defined in the main text. I have chosen to write X 2 and Z 2
to emphasize that these two quantities are positive: the first because it is the variance of
y21 − y11 , the second because of the finiteness conditions, after setting v = 0 in (37).


A.5    Small asset asymptotics

By the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma, both the numerator and denominator on the right-hand
side of (38) tend to zero in the limit as u tends to infinity. What happens to their ratio?
This section shows how to calculate limiting price-dividend ratio, riskless rate and excess
returns in the small-asset case. For clarity, I work through the price-dividend ratio in detail;
the same approach applies to the riskless rate and to expected returns. At the end of the
section, I discuss the corresponding calculations for the large asset.
   Step 1. Consider the integral which makes up the numerator of (38),

   If log dividends are drifting Brownian motions, Appendix A.4 showed that this integral
could be approached by summing all residues in the upper half-plane. The aim here is to
show that the asymptotic behavior of this integral in the general case is determined only
by the minimal residue as discussed in the main text. To show this, I integrate around a
contour which avoids all poles except for the minimal pole. Either the minimal pole occurs
at the minimal zero of ρ−c(1−γ/2−iz, −γ/2+iz), so lies on the imaginary axis by Lemma
3, or the minimal pole occurs at the minimal pole of Fγ (z), i.e. at iγ/2. In either case, the
minimal pole occurs at some point mi, where m > 0 is real. See Figure 10.
   Let N denote the rectangle in the complex plane with corners at −N , N , N + (m + ε)i
and −N + (m + ε)i. Since the integrand is meromorphic, all poles are isolated, so ε > 0 can
be chosen to be sufficiently small that the rectangle N only contains the pole at mi. By

   I now show that J2 , J3 , and J4 tend to zero as N and u tend to infinity. Consider J2 .
Since the range of integration is a closed and bounded interval, the function |ρ − c(. . .)|
attains its maximum and minimum on the range. Since the function has no zeros on the
interval, we can write |ρ − c(. . .)| ≥ δ1 > 0 for all z in the range of integration. We have

as N tends to infinity because |Fγ (N + iz)| converges to zero uniformly over z in the range
of integration. An almost identical argument shows that |J4 | → 0 as N → ∞.
   Now consider J3 . Set δ2 = |ρ − c(1 − γ/2 + m + ε, −γ/2 − m − ε)| > 0. Using the results
of Appendix A.3, |ρ − c(. . .)| ≥ δ2 for all z in the range of integration, so

where X is the (finite) limit of the integral                −N    |Fγ (z + (m + ε)i)| dz as N tends to infinity.
(X is finite because Fγ (z + (m + ε)i) decays to zero exponentially fast as z → ±∞.)

   By the residue theorem, J1 + J2 + J3 + J4 = 2πi × residue at mi = O(e−mu ). As
N goes to infinity, J2 and J4 go to zero, J1 tends to I and J3 tends to e−u(m+ε) X; so
I + e−u(m+ε) X = 2πi × residue at mi = O(e−mu ). In the limit as u → ∞, e−u(m+ε) X is
exponentially smaller than e−mu , so

the asymptotic behavior of I is dictated by the residue closest to the real line.
   Essentially identical arguments can be made to show that the other relevant integrals
are asymptotically equivalent to 2πi times the minimal residue of the relevant integrand;
they are omitted to prevent an already complicated argument becoming totally unreadable.

   We have seen that In and Id are asymptotically equivalent to 2πi times the residue at
the pole (of the relevant integrand) with smallest imaginary part. I will refer to the pole
(or zero) with least positive imaginary part as the minimal pole (or zero).
   Consider, then, the more complicated integral In . The integrand has a pole at iγ/2 due
to a singularity in Fγ (z). The question is whether or not there is a zero of ρ − c(1 − γ/2 −
iz, −γ/2 + iz) for some z with imaginary part smaller than γ/2. If there is, then this is the
minimal pole. If not, then iγ/2 is the minimal pole. By Lemma 3, the zero in question is
of the form z ∗ i for some positive real z ∗ satisfying ρ − c(1 − γ/2 + z ∗ , −γ/2 − z ∗ ) = 0. If
z ∗ > γ/2—in the subcritical case—the minimal pole for both integrals is at iγ/2, so

This is much simpler, because the minimal pole is iγ/2 for both numerator and denominator.
It follows that r → ρ − c(−γ/2 − i(iγ/2), −γ/2 + i(iγ/2)) = ρ − c(0, −γ).

   Since instantaneous expected returns are the sum of expected capital gains and the
dividend-price ratio, expected returns in the asymptotic limit are c(1, 0) + ρ − c(1, −γ) in
the subcritical case, and c(1 − γ/2 + z ∗ , γ/2 − z ∗ ) in the supercritical case.
   Subtracting the riskless rate, excess returns are c(1, 0) + c(0, −γ) − c(1, −γ) in the
subcritical case, and c(1 − γ/2 + z ∗ , γ/2 − z ∗ ) − ρ + c(0, −γ) in the supercritical case. Since
ρ = c(1 − γ/2 + z ∗ , −γ/2 − z ∗ ) by the definition of z ∗ , the excess return in the supercritical
case can be rewritten as c(1 − γ/2 + z ∗ , γ/2 − z ∗ ) + c(0, −γ) − c(1 − γ/2 + z ∗ , −γ/2 − z ∗ ).
   Step 3. If dividends are also independent across assets then we can decompose c(θ1 , θ2 ) =
c1 (θ1 ) + c2 (θ2 ) where ci (θ) ≡ log E exp θyi1 . It follows that in the subcritical case, XS →
c(1, 0) + c(0, −γ) − c(1, −γ) = 0, and in the supercritical case,

        XS → c(1 − γ/2 + z ∗ , γ/2 − z ∗ ) + c(0, −γ) − c(1 − γ/2 + z ∗ , −γ/2 − z ∗ )
              =    c2 (γ/2 − z ∗ ) + c2 (−γ) − c2 (−γ/2 − z ∗ ) .

   Step 4. This last expression is positive because c2 (x)—as a CGF—is convex. To spell
things out, (c2 (e) − c2 (d))/(e − d) < (c2 (g) − c2 (f ))/(g − f ) whenever d < e < f < g.
In the supercritical case, we have −γ < −γ/2 − z ∗ < 0 < γ/2 − z ∗ , so [c2 (−γ/2 − z ∗ ) −
c2 (−γ)]/[(−γ/2 − z ∗ ) − (−γ)] < [c2 (γ/2 − z ∗ ) − c2 (0)]/[(γ/2 − z ∗ ) − 0] or equivalently,
because c2 (0) = 0, c2 (−γ/2 − z ∗ ) − c2 (−γ) < c2 (γ/2 − z ∗ ), as required.
   Step 5(i). Proof that R1 < R2 , assuming independence of dividends: In the subcritical
case, R1 = ρ + c(1, 0) − c(1, −γ) and R2 = ρ + c(0, 1) − c(0, 1 − γ). Since we are assuming
independence, we must show that −c2 (−γ) < c2 (1) − c2 (1 − γ), or equivalently that c2 (1 −
γ) < c2 (1) + c2 (−γ), which follows by convexity of c2 (·).
   In the supercritical case, R1 = c(1 − γ/2 + z ∗ , γ/2 − z ∗ ) and R2 = c(1 − γ/2 + z ∗ , −γ/2 −
z ∗ ) + c(0, 1) − c(0, 1 − γ) (substituting in for ρ from the definition of z ∗ ). By independence,
it remains to show that c2 (γ/2 − z ∗ ) < c2 (−γ/2 − z ∗ ) + c2 (1) − c2 (1 − γ), or equivalently
that c2 (1 − γ) + c2 (γ/2 − z ∗ ) < c2 (1) + c2 (−γ/2 − z ∗ ), which follows by convexity of c2 (·).
   Step 5(ii). Next, I show that in the supercritical case, R1 ≤ G1 if G1 ≥ G2 . We do
not need the independence assumption here. Write θ = γ/2 − z ∗ ∈ (0, 1), so that the
limiting R1 = c(1 − θ, θ). The claim is that c(1 − θ, θ) ≤ c(1, 0). This follows from the
convexity of c(·, ·), which implies that c(1 − θ, θ) ≤ (1 − θ)c(1, 0) + θc(0, 1). By assumption,
c(0, 1) ≤ c(1, 0), so c(1 − θ, θ) ≤ (1 − θ)c(1, 0) + θc(1, 0) = c(1, 0), as required.
   Limiting quantities for the large asset. In the case of the large asset, the assumed
finiteness of its price-dividend ratio excludes the possibility that the minimal pole lies below
(γ/2)i. If we run through the above logic, the analogue of φ(z) is φ2 (z) ≡ ρ−c(−γ/2+z, 1−

                                                 52
γ/2 − z). But now we must have φ2 (γ/2) > 0 by the finiteness condition. So the minimal
pole must lie at (γ/2)i, and the result follows by calculating residues there, as above.


A.5.1    Asymptotics near the small-asset limit

To prove Proposition 7, we need to consider the two closest residues to the real axis. By
assumption z ∗ ∈ (γ/2−1, γ/2+1), so for price-dividend ratio and excess-return calculations,
the closest residue is at (γ/2)i and the next closest is at z ∗ i. For the riskless rate calculation,
the two closest residues are at (γ/2)i and (γ/2 + 1)i. The residues at (γ/2)i were calculated
in the previous section, so it only remains to compute the residues at z ∗ i and at (γ/2 + 1)i
for the integrands in question. In the case of the dividend yield, we must analyze

where the second (approximate) equality follows by the residue theorem logic, as in the
previous section, B(x, y) ≡ Γ(x)Γ(y)/Γ(x + y), and ci (·, ·) indicates the partial derivative
of c(·, ·) with respect to its ith argument.
   In the subcritical case, z ∗ > γ/2, straightforward algebra gives

D .                         −B(γ/2 − z ∗ , γ/2 + z ∗ ) [ρ − c(1, −γ)]2              ∗

                                                       B2

while in the supercritical case, z ∗ < γ/2, we have
        D . c1 (1 − γ/2 + z ∗ , −γ/2 − z ∗ ) − c2 (1 − γ/2 + z ∗ , −γ/2 − z ∗ ) −u(γ/2−z ∗ )
          =                                                                     e            .
        P                        B(γ/2 − z ∗ , γ/2 + z ∗ )
            |                                {z                               }
                                             B4

   To see that B2 > 0, note first that B(γ/2 − z ∗ , γ/2 + z ∗ ) is negative: it equals Γ(γ/2 −
z ∗ )Γ(γ/2 + z ∗ )/Γ(γ), and Γ(x) is negative for x ∈ (−1, 0) and positive for x > 0. Second,
the denominator of B2 is positive, because it has the opposite sign to the derivative of
φ(z) ≡ ρ − c(1 − γ/2 + z, −γ/2 − z) with respect to z, evaluated at z ∗ . This derivative is
negative because φ(z) is (i) concave in z (because c(·, ·) is convex), (ii) positive at z = 0
by the first finiteness condition in Table 1, and (iii) zero at z = z ∗ by the definition of z ∗ .

                                                  53
To see that B4 > 0, the same logic shows that the numerator is positive. The denominator
is also positive, because γ/2 − z ∗ > 0 so now B(γ/2 − z ∗ , γ/2 + z ∗ ) > 0. Similarly,
                                                                                                                B4
B1 = γ [c(1, −1 − γ) − c(0, −γ)], B3 = B2 [ρ − c(1, −γ)] · Y , and B5 =                                      ρ−c(1,−γ)    · Y , where

      Y ≡ [c(1, 0) − c(1, −γ) + c(1 − γ/2 + z ∗ , −γ/2 − z ∗ ) − c(1 − γ/2 + z ∗ , γ/2 − z ∗ )] .

It only remains to show that if the two assets have independent fundamentals, then Y < 0
in the supercritical case and Y > 0 in the nearly supercritical case. The former follows by
the logic of Steps 3 and 4 of the previous subsection. The latter does too: the sign of the
inequality is reversed because now γ/2 < z ∗ .

Fact 2 (Matrix determinant lemma). If A is an invertible matrix, and α and β are column
vectors of length equal to the dimension of A, then det A + αβ 0 = 1 + β 0 A−1 α det A.

the ith entry along the diagonal. It follows that J = N N −2 /(t1 · · · tN ). Writing Π for the

As in the two-asset case, I assume that Re [ρ − c(α − γ/N + iQ0 z)] > 0 for all z, which
follows from the apparently weaker condition that ρ − c(α − γ/N ) > 0.

B.3     A final change of variables

These expressions can be simplified by a final change of variables. Define z

             −1         −        .                                           .

It follows that zbk = N zk − z1 − · · · − zN −1 , and that zb1 + · · · + zbN −1 = z1 + · · · + zN −1 . The
Jacobian can be calculated using the matrix determinant lemma (Fact 2 above): det B −1 =
1/N N −2 , so—since z = B −1 z                    z /N N −2 . Next, z
                             b—dz is replaced by db                 b was defined in such
a way that GγN (z), defined in equation (42), is equal to N N −2 FγN (b
                                                                      z ), defined in the main
text. Finally, noting that B −1 Q = U and u ≡ U y 0 , as defined in (22), we have Q0 z =
Q0 B −1 z
        b = U 0z                b0 U y 0 = z
               b and z 0 Qy 0 = z          b0 u = u0 z
                                                     b. Proposition 8 follows after making
these substitutions throughout the various integrals and dropping the hat on z
                                                                             b.
