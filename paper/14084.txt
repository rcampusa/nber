Increasingly, individuals are in charge of their own financial security and are confronted with ever
more complex financial instruments. However, there is evidence that many individuals are not well-equipped
to make sound saving decisions. This paper demonstrates widespread financial illiteracy among the
U.S. population, particularly among specific demographic groups. Those with low education, women,
African-Americans, and Hispanics display particularly low levels of literacy. Financial literacy impacts
financial decision-making. Failure to plan for retirement, lack of participation in the stock market,
and poor borrowing behavior can all be linked to ignorance of basic financial concepts. While financial
education programs can result in improved saving behavior and financial decision-making, much can
be done to improve these programs' effectiveness.

Introduction

       Over the past thirty years, individuals have had to become increasingly responsible for

their own financial security following retirement. The shift from defined benefit (DB) to defined

contribution (DC) plans has meant that workers today have to decide both how much they need

to save for retirement and how to allocate pension wealth. Furthermore, financial instruments

have become increasingly complex and individuals are presented with new and ever-more-

sophisticated financial products. Access to credit is easier than ever before and opportunities to

borrow are plentiful. But are individuals well equipped to make financial decisions. In other

words, do they possess adequate financial literacy to do so?

       This paper shows that most individuals cannot perform simple economic calculations and

lack knowledge of basic financial concepts, such as the working of interest compounding, the

difference between nominal and real values, and the basics of risk diversification. Knowledge of

more complex concepts, such as the difference between bonds and stocks, the working of mutual

funds, and basic asset pricing is even scarcer. Illiteracy is widespread among the general

population and particularly acute among specific demographic groups, such as women, African-

Americans, Hispanics, and those with low educational attainment.

       Financial literacy affects financial decision-making; ignorance about basic financial

concepts can be linked to lack of retirement planning, lack of participation in the stock market,

and poor borrowing behavior. Several initiatives have been undertaken to foster saving and

financial security. The evidence is, in some cases, mixed, but several programs have proven

effective in fostering saving and increasing participation in pension plans. However, much more

can be done to improve the effectiveness of these programs. Furthermore, initiatives should




                                                 2
consider a wider spectrum of financial behavior; for example not only saving, asset allocation,

and pension but also borrowing behavior.



Theoretical Framework

       The theoretical framework used to model consumption/saving decisions posits that

rational and foresighted consumers derive utility from consumption over their lifetime. In the

simplest format, the consumer has a lifetime expected utility, which is the expected value of the

sum of per-period utility discounted to the present from the consumer’s current age to his/her

oldest attainable age. Assets and consumption each period are determined endogenously by

maximizing this utility function subject to an intertemporal budget constraint, which represents

the present discounted value of future resources (which include earnings, Social Security, and

pensions). This model posits that the consumer holds expectations regarding discount rates,

investment returns, earnings, pension and Social Security benefits, and inflation. Further, it

posits that the consumer uses that information to formulate and execute optimal

consumption/saving plans. In other words, the consumer looks ahead and plans for the future

taking his/her lifetime resources into account.

       Even in this basic formulation of the saving decision, the actual requirements for making

saving decisions are demanding: Individuals have to collect information and make forecasts

about many variables, from Social Security and pensions to interest rates and projected inflation,

to name just a few. Moreover, they have to perform calculations that require, at minimum, an

understanding of compound interest and the time value of money. Decisions about how much to

accumulate and how much to borrow to be able to smooth consumption over the life-cycle also

require an understanding of the working of interest rates.




                                                  3
        Do individuals possess the level of financial knowledge and numeracy necessary to

perform the calculations mentioned above? Does saving and borrowing behavior follow the

predictions of these simple models? While financial literacy has often been overlooked in

previous studies, it can be an important predictor of financial behavior. The next section provides

an examination of the level of literacy individuals possess.



Basic and Advanced Financial Literacy

Basic Financial Literacy

        Several surveys exist that report information on financial knowledge in sub-groups or

among the whole U.S. population.2 However, these surveys rarely provide information on

variables related to economic outcomes such as saving, borrowing, or retirement planning. In an

effort to combine data on financial literacy with data on financial behavior, Lusardi and Mitchell

(2006) have pioneered inserting questions measuring financial literacy into major U.S. surveys.

They first designed a special module on financial literacy for the 2004 Health and Retirement

Study (HRS); this module has now been added to the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth

(NLSY). These and other questions measuring financial knowledge have also been added to the

Rand American Life Panel (ALP) and to other surveys covering specific sub-groups of the

population.3 The addition of these types of questions to existing surveys not only allows

researchers to evaluate levels of financial knowledge but, most importantly, makes it possible to

link financial literacy to a rich set of information about household financial behavior.


2
 See Lusardi and Mitchell (2007b) for an overview of these surveys.
3
 These questions have been added to a survey of participants to the state employees plan in the state of Nebraska
(Medill 2007). Moreover, they have been added to the 2005 Dutch DNB Household Survey (van Rooij, Lusardi and
Alessie 2007), the 2006 Italian Household Survey on Income and Wealth, a 2007 pilot survey of participants in
Mexico’s privatized Social Security plan (Hastings 2007), and a survey on entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka (de Mel,
McKenzie and Woodruff 2008)



                                                        4
         Given the limited number of questions that can effectively be added to surveys,

researchers have to assess financial literacy from only a handful of questions. But which

questions should be asked to determine whether respondents possess financial literacy?

Moreover, which data allow researchers to most accurately assess the effect of literacy on

behavior? As will be reported below, it is possible to gauge financial knowledge from a small set

of questions.

         The three questions Lusardi and Mitchell (2006) devised for the HRS measure basic but

fundamental concepts relating to financial literacy, such as the working of interest rates, the

effects of inflation, and the concept of risk diversification. The questions are as follows:

    1) Suppose you had $100 in a savings account and the interest rate was 2% per year. After

         5 years, how much do you think you would have in the account if you left the money to

         grow: more than $102, exactly $102, less than $102?

    2) Imagine that the interest rate on your savings account was 1% per year and inflation was

         2% per year. After 1 year, would you be able to buy more than, exactly the same as, or

         less than today with the money in this account?

    3) Do you think that the following statement is true or false? “Buying a single company

         stock usually provides a safer return than a stock mutual fund.”4

         The first two questions (compound and inflation) evaluate whether respondents display

knowledge of fundamental economic concepts and competence with basic financial numeracy.

The third question (stock risk) evaluates respondents’ knowledge of risk diversification, a crucial

element of any informed investment decision.




4
  In addition to the list of answers provided above, respondents can also choose that they do not know the answer to
the question (DK), or they can refuse to answer (refusal).


                                                         5
            The HRS sample covers respondents who are 50 or older, with the average age being 65.

Results from this survey module reveal an alarmingly low level of financial literacy among older

individuals in the United States. Only 50 percent of respondents in the sample were able to

correctly answer the first two questions, and only one-third of respondents were able to answer

all three questions correctly. The question that was most difficult for respondents to answer was

the one about risk diversification; more than one-third of respondents reported they did not know

the answer.5 Not only is the finding that most respondents do not grasp the concept of risk

diversification an important one, but posing difficult questions allows researchers to differentiate

among different levels of financial sophistication, even when using a limited number of

questions to measure financial literacy

           Lusardi and Mitchell (2007a) have also examined numeracy and financial literacy among

a younger segment of the population, the Early Baby Boomers, who were 51 to 56 years old in

2004. This segment of the population is particularly useful to study as respondents in this age

group should be close to the peak of their wealth accumulation and should have dealt with many

financial decisions already (mortgages, car loans, credit cards, pension contributions, etc.). The

following questions were posed to these respondents in the 2004 HRS:

           1) If the chance of getting a disease is 10 percent, how many people out of 1,000

           would be expected to get the disease?

           2) If 5 people all have the winning number in the lottery and the prize is 2 million

           dollars, how much will each of them get?

For respondents who answered either the first or the second question correctly, the following

question was asked:



5
    See Lusardi and Mitchell (2006) for details.


                                                    6
       3) Let’s say you have 200 dollars in a savings account. The account earns 10

       percent interest per year. How much would you have in the account at the end of

       two years?

       Table 1 summarizes how Early Boomers answered these questions. Again, numeracy is

found to be low among respondents; only about half could divide $2 million by 5. Moreover, the

large majority did not have a good grasp of the power of interest compounding: only 18 percent

correctly computed the compound interest question. Of those who got the interest question

wrong, 43 percent undertook a simple interest calculation, thereby ignoring the interest accruing

on both principal and interest. These are not comforting findings, especially considering that

these respondents have already dealt with many financial decisions during their lifetimes.

       These findings are confirmed in several other studies. Bernheim (1995, 1998) was one of

the first to emphasize that most individuals lack basic financial knowledge and numeracy. The

OECD report (2005), Lusardi and Mitchell (2007b) and Smith and Stewart (2008) examine the

evidence on financial literacy in the United States and in other countries and report similar

findings. Lusardi and Tufano (2008) report that the vast majority of respondents in a

representative sample of U.S. households have limited debt literacy.



Advanced Literacy

       To competently make saving and investment decisions, individuals need knowledge

beyond the fundamental financial concepts discussed above, including understanding the

relationship between risk and return; how bonds, stocks, and mutual funds work; and basic asset

pricing. To quantify how knowledgeable individuals are in this area, Lusardi devised several

additional questions for the ALP. Most of these questions had earlier been added to the Dutch




                                                 7
DNB Household Survey6 and are similar to questions used in other U.S. surveys.7 Because the

question about risk diversification had been found to be hard to answer, it was included in the set

of questions on advanced financial literacy.

        The exact wording of these questions is as follows:

        1. Function of Stock Market

        Which of the following statements describes the main function of the stock market?

        (i) The stock market helps to predict stock earnings; (ii) The stock market results in

        an increase in the price of stocks; (iii) The stock market brings people who want to

        buy stocks together with those who want to sell stocks; (iv) None of the above; (v)

        DK; (vi) Refuse.

        2. Knowledge of Mutual Funds

        Which of the following statements is correct? (i) Once one invests in a mutual fund,

        one cannot withdraw the money in the first year; (ii) Mutual funds can invest in

        several assets, for example invest in both stocks and bonds; (iii) Mutual funds pay a

        guaranteed rate of return which depends on their past performance; (iv) None of

        the above; (v) DK; (vi) Refuse.

        3. Relationship Between Interest Rates and Bond Prices

        If the interest rate falls, what should happen to bond prices? (i) Rise; (ii) Fall; (iii)

        Stay the same; (iv) None of the above; (v) DK; (vi) Refuse.

        4. Risk Diversification: Company Stock or Mutual Fund?

 See van Rooij, Lusardi, and Alessie (2007) for a detailed explanation and review of these questions.
7
 Specifically, questions were taken from the National Council of Economic Education Survey, the NASD Investor
Knowledge Quiz, the 2004 Health and Retirement Study module on financial literacy and planning, the Survey of
Financial Literacy in Washington State, and the 2001 Survey of Consumers.


                                                      8
        True or false? Buying a company stock usually provides a safer return than a stock

        mutual fund. (i) True; (ii) False; (iii) DK; (iv) Refuse.

        5. Riskier: Stocks or Bonds?

        True or false? Stocks are normally riskier than bonds. (i) True; (ii) False; (iii) DK;

        (iv) Refuse.

        6. Long Period Returns

        Considering a long time period (for example 10 or 20 years), which asset normally

        gives the highest return? (i) Savings accounts; (ii) Bonds; (iii) Stocks; (iv) DK; (vi)

        Refuse.

        7. Highest Fluctuations

        Normally, which asset displays the highest fluctuations over time? (i) Savings

        accounts; (ii) Bonds; (iii) Stocks; (iv) DK; (v) Refuse.

        8. Risk Diversification: Spreading Money Among Different Assets

        When an investor spreads his money among different assets, does the risk of losing

        money: (i) Increase; (ii) Decrease; (iii) Stay the same; (iv) DK; (v) Refuse.

         The average age of the ALP sample is about 53, and most respondents are between the

ages of 40 and 60. The sample is composed mostly of highly educated (over half have at least a

college education) and high-income (almost 30 percent earn $100,000 or more) respondents.

This sample characteristic is partly due to the fact that the survey is done online, and frequent

internet users are not a representative sample of the U.S. population. Yet it is useful to see how

these respondents fare when asked questions about financial concepts they should have dealt

with in their financial decisions.8

 See Lusardi and Mitchell (2007c) for details. These statistics are based on a preliminary release of the ALP and are
unweighted.


                                                         9
        Responses to the more complex battery of advanced financial literacy questions are

summarized in Table 2. Panel A shows that most respondents, over three-quarters, do get most of

the answers right, so they have some knowledge of how the stock market and risk diversification

work. They are also more likely to be knowledgeable about fluctuations in assets than they are

about patterns of asset returns. But only about one-third of the sample knows about the

relationship between bond pricing and interest rates, indicating striking ignorance of how assets

are priced.9 Moreover, while the large majority of respondents responded correctly to several of

the more advanced questions, only one-fifth of respondents were able to answer all of these

questions correctly (Table 2, panel B). Thus, advanced knowledge is not widespread, even

among a sample of highly educated respondents.10

        Several other surveys covering the U.S. population or specific sub-groups have also

documented low levels of advanced financial knowledge across the age spectrum. For example,

data from five surveys from the Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy spanning

from 1997 to 2006 show that only a small minority of high school students score above a passing

grade in financial literacy. Low scores are not only pervasive among high school students but

have changed little over time (Mandell 2008). These findings are confirmed by the National

Council of Economic Education (NCEE), which periodically surveys high school students and

9
  Very similar findings are provided by Moore (2003), which also reports that the fraction of correct responses to
questions measuring sophisticated knowledge is very low.
10
   When levels of literacy are low, one may wonder whether respondents even understand the meaning of the
questions they are asked. To investigate whether the wording of questions matters, two randomly chosen groups of
respondents to the ALP were posed the same questions but with different wording. This was implemented for three
questions: a rather simple question about the risk differences between bonds and stocks (a first group was asked:
“Stock are normally riskier than bonds; true or false?” while a second group was asked: “Bonds are normally riskier
than stocks; true or false?”); a more difficult question about risk diversification (a first group was asked: “Buying a
company stock usually provides a safer return than a stock mutual fund; true or false?” while a second group was
asked: “Buying a stock mutual fund usually provides a safer return than a single company stock; true or false?”); and
the most difficult question about the link between bond prices and interest rates (a first group was asked: “If the
interest rate falls, what should happen to bond prices?” and a second group was asked: “If the interest rate rises,
what should happen to bond prices?”). The wording of the question did not matter for the first two questions, but it
did matter for the third question, showing a fair amount of guessing and measurement error in the responses to
complex financial literacy questions. See Lusardi and Mitchell (2007c) for details.


                                                         10
working-age adults to measure financial and economic knowledge. The NCEE survey consists of

a 24-item questionnaire on topics including “Economics and the Consumer,” “Money, Interest

Rates, and Inflation,” and “Personal Finance.” Adults got an average score of C on these

questions, while the high school population fared even worse, with most earning an F. Hilgert,

Hogarth, and Beverly (2003) examine data from the 2001 Survey of Consumers, where some

1,000 respondents (ages 18–98) were given a 28-question true/false financial literacy quiz

covering knowledge about credit, saving patterns, mortgages, and general financial management.

Again, most respondents earned a failing score on the quiz, documenting widespread illiteracy

among the population. Similar findings are reported in smaller samples or specific groups of the

population (Agnew and Szykman 2005). Moore (2003) examines financial literacy in

Washington State and reports low levels of financial knowledge in that state.



Who Is Financially Literate?

       Financial illiteracy is not only widespread, it is particularly acute among specific

demographic groups. For example, financial literacy, as measured by the three questions in the

2004 HRS module, declines strongly with age/cohorts (Figure 1). This is an important finding as

individuals are required to make financial decisions until late in the life cycle and there is

mounting concern about the incidence of financial scams that prey upon the elderly. There are

sharp gender differences in financial literacy, with women displaying a lower level of knowledge

than men, particularly with regard to risk diversification (Figure 2). Lusardi and Mitchell (2008)

examine this issue in more detail and warn about the difficulties women may face in making

financial decisions, particularly after the death of a spouse.




                                                  11
           Financial literacy varies widely among education groups. Only half of respondents with

less than a high school correctly answer the question requiring a simple calculation of interest

rates, and close to 20 percent state they do not know the answer to this question. The large

majority of those without a college degree do not know or answer incorrectly the question about

risk diversification. Similarly, there are major differences in financial literacy across racial

groups, with African-Americans and Hispanics displaying much lower levels of financial literacy

than whites. Approximately half of African-Americans correctly answer the question about

interest rate calculations, and the proportion of correct answers is even smaller among Hispanics.

Lusardi and Mitchell (2007a) document similar findings when using different measures of

literacy among a sample of Early Baby Boomers.

           These results are not specific to the age groups covered in the HRS, but are common to

many other surveys on financial literacy.11 Moreover, the findings outlined above are already

present among young respondents. For example, Mandell (2008) focuses on a small group of

students who are defined as being financially literate (all had received a score of 75 percent or

more on a financial literacy test) in the 2006 Jump$tart Coalition survey. Note that this group

represents a tiny fraction of the whole sample: only 7 percent. The financially literate students

are overwhelmingly white, male, and the children of college graduates. Thus, the correlation

between literacy and gender, race, and education is present at early stages of the life cycle.

           Lusardi and Mitchell (2007c) show that financial literacy is highly correlated with

exposure to economics in school. Those who studied economics (in high school, college, or at

higher levels) were much more likely to display higher levels of financial literacy later in life, a

finding which is also present in data from other countries.12 They use this information to assess

                                                      12
the impact of financial literacy on financial behavior later in life. Because financial literacy can

be affected by experience with saving and investing—learning by doing—data on literacy early

in life (or on other determinants of financial literacy) is necessary to evaluate the impact of

literacy on financial behavior, as will be explained in the next section.



Does Financial Literacy Matter?

       As mentioned earlier, one of the major advantages of inserting questions about financial

literacy in major U.S. surveys is that researchers can assess whether literacy influences financial

decision-making. Table 3 displays the relationship between financial literacy and retirement

planning as measured in the 2004 HRS core data (see Lusardi and Mitchell 2007a). As shown by

Lusardi (2003), Lusardi and Beeler (2007) and Lusardi and Mitchell (2007a), retirement

planning is a powerful predictor of wealth accumulation; those who plan have more than double

the wealth of those who have not done any retirement planning.

       Financial literacy matters for planning: Those who are more financially knowledgeable

are much more likely to have planned for retirement. In terms of economic importance, both the

knowledge of interest compounding and the ability to perform simple calculations (such as a

lottery division) are the strongest predictors of planning. This is to be expected, given that any

saving plan requires some numeracy, the ability to calculate present values, and an understanding

of the advantages of starting to save early in life. Financial literacy is not simply a proxy for low

education, race, or gender; as has been noted, women, minorities, and those with low education

are disproportionately less likely to be financially literate. Even after accounting for many




                                                 13
demographic characteristics, Table 3 (column III) shows that financial literacy continues to be an

important determinant of planning.13

           One may argue that financial literacy and retirement planning are both decision variables

and that the act of planning may enhance financial knowledge. In other words, those who want to

plan for retirement may invest in acquiring financial knowledge. To evaluate the relationship

between literacy and planning, it is important to have information beyond individuals’ current

levels of financial literacy. Lusardi and Mitchell (2007c) use information on individuals’ past

financial literacy, prior to their entering the job market. They find that those who were

financially literate when young are more likely to plan for retirement, showing that it is literacy

that affects planning and not the other way around.

           Advanced financial literacy also matters for financial decision-making. Van Rooij,

Lusardi, and Alessie (2007) use questions they designed for a module on financial literacy for the

Dutch DNB Household Survey to show that financially sophisticated households are more likely

to participate in the stock market. They address the argument that participation in the stock

market or success in investing may also influence financial knowledge by relying on individuals’

financial knowledge in the past and prior to investing in the stock market. They find that those

who were literate when young are more likely to invest in stocks, again showing there is an

independent effect of literacy on stock market participation.

           Other studies have confirmed the positive association between financial knowledge and

household financial decision-making. Stango and Zinman (2007) show that those who are unable

to correctly calculate interest rates out of a stream of payments end up borrowing more and

accumulating lower amounts of wealth. Lusardi and Tufano (2008) find that those who severely

underestimate the power of interest compounding are more likely to experience difficulties
13

repaying debt. Agarwal et al. (2007) show that financial mistakes are most prevalent among the

young and the elderly—demographic groups that display the lowest levels of financial

knowledge and cognitive ability. Hilgerth, Hogarth, and Beverly (2003) also document a positive

link between financial knowledge and financial behavior. Campbell (2006) further demonstrates

that many investors failed to refinance their mortgages during a period of falling interest rates.

This finding is consistent with lack of literacy, as those who failed to refinance were

disproportionately investors with low education. Those investors also seem less likely to know

the terms of their mortgages, including the interest rates they pay (Bucks and Pence 2006 and

Moore 2003). Moore (2003) also shows that borrowers who took out high-cost mortgages

display little financial literacy.



Discussion

           As shown throughout this paper, the existence of financial literacy should not be taken

for granted. Financial illiteracy is widespread and particularly acute among specific groups,

including those with low education, women, and minorities. Given the increased complexity of

day-to-day financial transactions, the evidence of illiteracy raises important questions for policy.

           The evidence on the effectiveness of financial education programs has provided

contrasting results. On the one hand, Bernheim and Garrett (2003), Lusardi (2004), and Clark

and d’Ambrosio (2008) find that retirement seminars have an effect on savings and retirement

plans. On the other had, Duflo and Saez (2003, 2004) and Madrian and Shea (2001), among

others, find little or no effects of financial education programs on savings.14 The mixed evidence

on the effectiveness of financial education programs has led some to question whether it is worth

trying to improve financial literacy. In fact, it is not clear there is even a choice. As it was

impossible to live and operate efficiently in the past without being literate, i.e., knowing how to

read and write, so it is very hard to live and operate efficiently today without being financially

literate. Given the complexity of current financial instruments and the financial decisions

required in everyday life, from comparing credit card offerings, to choosing methods of

payments, to deciding how much to save, where to invest, and how to get the best loan,

individuals need to know how to read and write financially.

           Note that, as with reading and writing, the objective of any policy designed to promote

financial literacy should be basic knowledge. While it may not be feasible to transform

financially illiterate people into sophisticated investors, it may be possible to teach them a few

principles about the basics of saving and investing. Moreover, as illiteracy was not eradicated

with a handful of lessons or in a matter of months, so financially illiteracy cannot be eradicated

with small interventions, such as a few seminars or one benefit fair.15

           Set in this framework, it is clear that some standards for financial literacy are needed.

What do people need to know? What should the pillars of financial literacy programs be? Setting

these standards will be the backbone of devising financial education programs. There are obvious

benefits to having one institution that presides over or establishes those standards, and the U.S.

Department of Treasury seems an obvious candidate for this role.

           Technology makes it possible to use interactive methods to teach. Thus, “students of

financial literacy” do not necessarily have to attend classes at school, but can learn from courses

online (or from CDs or DVDs) from their homes. Courses can be customized and tailored to




15
     See Duflo and Saez (2003, 2004), Clark and D’Ambrosio (2008) and the discussion in Lusardi (2008).


                                                         16
various needs and levels of financial knowledge. Moreover, it is important to find ways to make

courses engaging and to stimulate interest in acquiring financial literacy.16

         New ideas also deserve consideration. For example, as discussed by Sherraden and

Boshara (2008), it is not necessarily the case that people first become financially literate and then

save and accumulate assets. It may also be that, when people begin to accumulate assets, they

become more interested in improving their literacy. Thus, providing economic incentives, such

as a small fund for children’s education or for retirement, may be one way to encourage people

to become financially literate.

         Moreover, as mentioned earlier, illiteracy can be linked to financial mistakes. A few

studies have hinted at financial illiteracy as a determinant of excessive borrowing or attaining

high-cost mortgages, but we need more research analyzing the effect of literacy on credit and

borrowing behavior. The problem of financial mistakes seems so pressing that some credit card

companies have taken the unusual step of offering financial education to new-to-credit and at-

risk consumers (Brown and Gartner 2007). Early intervention seems more promising approach

than providing counseling during or after bankruptcy, but the take-up rate has been so far low.

         If people with low literacy make mistakes, who will pay for these mistakes? The

individual, or society at large? If taxpayers will be asked to support those who have made

mistakes, there is a role for regulation and for implementing “mandatory” programs. One such

program could be to require people to obtain some basic financial knowledge (Alesina and

Lusardi 2006). In the same way people are required to have a driving license before they venture

out on the road, a “financial license” could be required before individuals contribute to their

16
  According to Mandell (2008), those students who played a stock market game in class do three to four percentage
points better than all students on financial literacy tests. However, if the winners of the stock market game are those
able to pick the highest-return stocks, there is an incentive to simply choose the riskiest stocks. This strategy may
not represent the best way to learn how to invest retirement wealth. Nonetheless, it is important to think of new ways
to engage students.

pensions, invest their pension assets, or borrow to buy a house. In this way, individuals may

learn about some basic financial concepts and may reduce their reliance on random advice and

potentially misleading tips from those around them.

        Several initiatives have been undertaken in other fields with the objective of “educating”

consumers, and they provide suggestions for financial education as well.17 For example, in the

field of health, guidelines have been offered on how to eat well. In the same way that a “food

pyramid” provides general information about how people should eat, a “saving pyramid” could

provide general guidelines on how to save and invest. Principles such as diversification of

investments, exploitation of the power of interest compounding, taking advantage of tax-favored

assets or employer matches are fundamental concepts that can benefit every investor. Clearly,

there is already a lot of information on these topics. However, as there are many books about

diets, so there are many books about how to save and invest, and it may be worthwhile to provide

a “seal of approval” from experts in the field. For example, one official website that people can

turn to may be more powerful than the many websites that are now available and for which there

are no guarantees about quality.

        Given the current low levels of financial literacy, employers and the government should

devise and encourage programs that simplify financial decision-making as well as provide

sources of reliable financial advice. One way to reduce the barriers that individuals face when

making saving decisions is to simplify their planning process.18 For example, Lusardi, Keller and

Keller (2008) used a social marketing approach to develop a planning aid to motivate and

encourage new hires at a not-for-profit institution to open and contribute to supplementary


17
   For example, Woloshin, Schwartz, and Welch (2002) also report that patients are not numerate and do not
understand statistics. They propose a way to describe statistics using simple charts.
18
   See Choi, Laibson and Madrian (2006) for the analysis of another program that relies on simplifying decision-
making.


                                                        18
retirement accounts. The planning aid they designed displays several interesting features. First, it

breaks down the process of enrollment in supplementary pensions into several small steps,

describing to participants exactly what they need to do to be able to enroll online. Moreover, the

aid provides several pieces of information to help overcome barriers to saving, such as

describing the low minimum amount of income employees can contribute (in addition to the

maximum) and indicating the default fund that the employer has chosen for them (a life-cycle

fund). Finally, the planning aid contains pictures and messages designed to motivate participants

to save.

       The planning aid was designed following thorough data collection. Lusardi, Keller and

Keller (2008) devised a survey asking explicitly about barriers to saving, sources of financial

advice, and level of financial knowledge and attractive features of a pension plan. They

conducted focus groups and in-depth interviews (with both employees and human resources

administrators) to shed more light on the impediments to saving. These data-collection methods,

common in the field of marketing, are well suited to capturing the wide heterogeneity relating to

individuals’ saving decisions. The program was very successful; contribution rates to

supplementary pensions tripled after the introduction of the planning aid.

       The results of this program have implications for financial education programs and

policies to foster saving. First, while economic incentives such as employer matches or tax

advantages may be useful, there are many more methods that can be employed to make people

save. In fact, given the massive lack of information and lack of financial knowledge that exists in

the general population, implementation of programs aimed at simplifying saving decisions may

prove to be a cost-effective strategy. Second, individuals are most prone to decision-making in

specific time periods. For example, the start of a new job pushes people to think about saving




                                                19
(often because they have to make decisions about their pensions), and it may be very important

to exploit such “teachable moments.” Third, to be effective, programs have to recognize the

many differences among individuals, not only in terms of preferences and economic

circumstances but also of their existing levels of information, financial sophistication, and ability

to carry though with plans. In other words, relying on “one-size-fits-all” principles can lead to

rather ineffective programs.

       While the problems are many and the challenges are daunting, programs can be designed

to change saving behavior. We have a wealth of information to rely on, and that information

should make effective financial education increasingly possible. In the current economic

environment it is essential to equip consumers with the necessary tools to make informed

financial choices. One of these tools is financial literacy.

Note: This table reports Probit estimates of the effects of literacy on planning; marginal effects reported.
Analysis sample consists of HRS Early Baby Boomers who responded to financial literacy questions. Being
a planner is defined as having thought a little, some, or a lot about retirement. Demographic controls
include age, education, race, sex, marital status, retirement status, number of children, and a dummy
variable for those not asked the question about interest compounding. Regressions also include dummies
for political literacy (knowing the President and Vice President of the United States). DK indicates
respondent who did not know the answer. Observations weighted using HRS household weights. The total
number of observations is 1,716. * Significant at 10% level; ** significant at 5%level ; *** significant at
1% level. Adapted from Lusardi and Mitchell (2007a).
