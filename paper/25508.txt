                                         ABSTRACT

Corporate versus pass-through status trades off benefits (perpetual identity, limited liability,
public trading, earnings retention) against tax wedges, estimated from U.S. taxes on corporate
profits, dividends, and partnership income. In regressions, C-corporate economic shares decline
with the wedge and exhibit negative trends related to legal changes for LLCs. A calibrated model,
fit to TFP and corporate shares, implies that, for 1958-2013, the declining wedge and gap
between corporate and pass-through productivity contributed 0.37% per year of a TFP growth
rate of 1.09%. From 1994 to 2004, the falling productivity gap contributed 0.77% per year to the
TFP growth of 2.00%.

       In an assessment of the 2017 U.S. tax reform, Barro and Furman (2018) focused on the

incentives of businesses to invest in capital within a given legal form of organization, which

comprised C-corporations and pass-through businesses. In addition, the analysis considered the

impact of differential taxation of C-corporations versus pass-throughs on the choice of legal

form. Reductions in the relevant tax wedge, as in the 2017 reform, raised the frequency of

C-corporate ownership. Moreover, if there are typically productivity advantages associated with

C-corporate form—as must be the case if many businesses chose this status despite the often

large tax penalty—then shifts in ownership form affect overall productivity. This paper assesses

the effects of business taxation and legal changes on choices of legal form and, thereby, on

productivity.

I. Previous Research

       A. Basic framework

       The seminal paper on choices of C-corporate versus pass-through status is Mackie-Mason

and Gordon (1997). That study emphasized tax effects on the C-corporate share of economic

activity. Other empirical research in this area includes Goolsbee (1998), Goolsbee (2004), and

Prisinzano and Pearce (2018).

       The framework, following Mackie-Mason and Gordon (1997), assumes that firm i has

output (or productivity) 𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐 (𝑖𝑖) >0 in corporate (meaning C-corporate) form and 𝑌𝑌𝑝𝑝 (𝑖𝑖) >0 in non-

corporate (pass-through) form. The respective tax rates, taken here as proportionate to output,

are 𝜏𝜏𝑐𝑐 < 1 and 𝜏𝜏𝑝𝑝 < 1. Negative tax rates, constituting subsidies, can be admitted. The tax rates

for each legal form are assumed to be the same for all firms, but a dispersion of tax rates can be

admitted. Firm i opts for corporate form if

       (1)                      (1 − 𝜏𝜏𝑐𝑐 )𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐 (𝑖𝑖) ≥ �1 − 𝜏𝜏𝑝𝑝 �𝑌𝑌𝑝𝑝 (𝑖𝑖).


                                                         2
This condition is analogous to the one used by Mackie-Mason and Gordon (1997, equations [1]

and [2]).

            We can rewrite equation (1) as

                                                       𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐 (𝑖𝑖)             1−𝜏𝜏𝑝𝑝
            (2)                       𝑦𝑦(𝑖𝑖) ≡ log �               � ≥ log ( 1−𝜏𝜏 ) ≡ 𝜏𝜏.
                                                       𝑌𝑌𝑝𝑝 (𝑖𝑖)                 𝑐𝑐


The term on the far right is the tax wedge, τ, which is the tax penalty for being corporate rather

than pass-through. Equation (2) says that if this wedge is positive, a business has to enjoy at

least the offsetting proportionate productivity advantage, y(i), in order to opt for corporate form.

If the magnitudes of 𝜏𝜏𝑐𝑐 and 𝜏𝜏𝑝𝑝 are much less than one, then τ≈𝜏𝜏𝑐𝑐 -𝜏𝜏𝑝𝑝 . Generally, τ is increasing in

𝜏𝜏𝑐𝑐 and decreasing in 𝜏𝜏𝑝𝑝 .

            If tax rates are the same for all firms, the determinant of choices of legal form is the

frequency distribution of the proportionate productivity advantage, y(i). In the overall population

of firms, the fraction opting to be corporate is one minus the cumulative density of y(i) evaluated

at the cutoff 𝜏𝜏. More generally, the distribution of τ(i) also matters.


            B. Comments on the setup

            The framework treats a firm’s potential outputs, 𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐 (𝑖𝑖) and 𝑌𝑌𝑝𝑝 (𝑖𝑖), as dependent only on the

choice of legal form of organization. We could extend the model to include variable factor

inputs, such as labor and capital chosen by corporate and pass-through businesses. 1 The tax rates

𝜏𝜏𝑐𝑐 and 𝜏𝜏𝑝𝑝 would then have the usual effects on quantities of inputs demanded. If taxes are levied

on net business income with labor payments fully expensed, then the tax rates would not directly

distort the margins associated with labor input. Similarly, if capital outlays were fully expensed




1
    See, for example, Gravelle and Kotlikoff (1989).

                                                                    3
(with loss realizations fully allowed), there would be no direct distortion on the margins

associated with capital input (as in King and Fullerton [1984]).

        In the present setup, the only distortion comes from the difference in the tax rates levied

on corporations and pass-through businesses; that is, the tax wedge, τ, given in equation (2). In

this setting, the first-best outcome corresponds to τ=0, because distortions arise only when the

two organizational forms are taxed at different rates. The levels of taxation—𝜏𝜏𝑐𝑐 and 𝜏𝜏𝑝𝑝 —are not

distorting as long as the tax rates are equal. In particular, the government can raise more revenue

in a non-distorting way by raising both tax rates while keeping the wedge, τ, unchanged. This

property means that the framework is not amenable to usual optimal-tax analysis, which requires

an extension to allow for distortions from levels of tax rates. However, that extension would

leave the distortion associated with differential taxation, and that effect is likely to be largely

separable from those involving levels of tax rates. Hence, it seems desirable to retain the

framework of Mackie-Mason and Gordon (1997), which abstracts from choices of factor inputs

and in which only differential taxation matters.

II. The Tax Wedge

        To implement equation (2) for U.S. business data, we need a time series for the tax

wedge, τ, which depends on the tax rates 𝜏𝜏𝑐𝑐 on C-corporations and 𝜏𝜏𝑝𝑝 on pass-through

businesses. Conceptually, we think of a business as choosing whether to have a block of income,

𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐 (𝑖𝑖), taxed on a C-corporate basis or else have a corresponding block, 𝑌𝑌𝑝𝑝 (𝑖𝑖), taxed on a pass-

through basis. Although this choice involves a discrete amount of income accruing in one form

or the other, the income in each case is “marginal” with respect to other forms of income that

owners have. For example, owners of a C-corporation (shareholders) typically have labor

income and other types of asset income. Similarly, in most cases, owners of a pass-through

                                                    4
business have significant income in other forms. For this reason, the relevant tax rates 𝜏𝜏𝑐𝑐 and 𝜏𝜏𝑝𝑝

correspond more closely to marginal than to average rates.

        A. C-corporate tax rate

        We consider two aspects of U.S. taxation of C-corporate income: the federal corporate

profits tax and the federal tax on dividends. 2 The rate 𝜏𝜏𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 in Figure 1 is the top federal rate on

C-corporate profits. The use of the top rate ignores the graduation in the tax schedule that

prevailed from 1937 to 2017. However, we find from IRS, Statistics of Income, Corporation

Income Tax Returns that the average marginal tax rate (AMTR) on C-corporate taxable income

(where individual marginal rates are weighted by shares in C-corporate taxable income) is close

to the top rate, at least from 1958 to 2013. For example, in 1958, when the top rate was 52%, the

AMTR was 50.6%, and in 2013, when the top rate was 35%, the AMTR was 34.7%. 3

        We also factor in the double-taxation of C-corporate income, whereby owners are taxed

in a second stage on dividends and capital gains. One familiar point is that dividend payouts

and, hence, owners’ dividend taxes can be deferred by corporate retention of earnings (an option

unavailable for pass-through businesses). This corporate retention leads to increases in stock

prices, which result in capital-gains taxes if owners choose to realize their gains. However, in a

reasonable baseline setting, retained earnings affect the timing of dividends but not their present




2
 A full analysis would also consider the deductions from corporate taxable income associated with depreciation
allowances, expensing, credits, and bond interest. These elements are considered in Barro and Furman (2018) and in
many other papers. However, because these features of the tax law have been the same for C-corporate and pass-
through businesses, they may not have major consequences for the choice of legal form.
3
 We are neglecting the taxation of corporate profits by state governments. Our analysis indicates that the average
state tax rate on C-corporate profits (after factoring in the deductibility of these levies for federal purposes) was
between 0.04 and 0.05 from 1979 to 2017, compared to the top federal rate between 0.34 and 0.46. Goolsbee (2004)
has examined corporate-profits taxes across states.

                                                         5
value. Or, to put it alternatively, the present value of capital gains and losses created by

retentions equals zero. 4 In this context, we can neglect capital-gains taxes as an approximation. 5

         Another well-known point is that double-taxation of C-corporate income can be mitigated

or eliminated by replacing dividends with stock repurchases. Despite this option, C-corporations

typically choose to pay dividends, and the tax rate on these payments should enter into the

computed C-corporate tax rate. This calculation has to consider the tax status of shareholders

with regard to dividend income. In this context, Rosenthal and Austin (2016, Figure I) document

a large and increasing share of U.S. corporate stock held by entities that have zero or low tax

rates, including retirement plans, non-profits, and foreigners, whom they treat as non-taxable.

Our analysis assumes instead that the fraction of foreign holdings held in taxable form equals

that of domestic holdings. In that case (when we also use data from Poterba [2004, Table 1]), we

get the series for the estimated fraction of U.S. corporate stock held in taxable form as the red

graph in Figure 2. This fraction declined from 88% in 1958 to 30% in 2015. We assume that

this share for ownership of corporate stock equals the share of dividends accruing to taxable

entities.

         We constructed a dividend-income-weighted average marginal federal income-tax rate on

dividends (or dividend AMTR), a concept that parallels the one used in previous research for the

labor-income-weighted average marginal tax rate (described in Barro and Sahasakul [1983] and

Barro and Redlick [2011]). Before the sharp cut in the qualified-dividend tax rate in 2003, the



4
  These results apply if a corporation’s expected rate of return on retained earnings equals the discount rate used to
price the corporation’s stock. We also need a transversality or no-Ponzi condition, which requires the discount rate,
asymptotically, to exceed the expected growth rate of dividends. This last condition parallels one needed for
Ricardian equivalence—that is, so that government borrowing does not affect the present value of taxes that have to
be collected.
5
  We are neglecting here any tax advantage from the deferral of dividend payments. However, this advantage may
not exist, because returns on funds held within a C-corporation are taxed at the rate on C-corporate profits, whereas
those held by owners are taxed at the individual income tax rate.

                                                          6
dividend AMTR, shown by the blue graph in Figure 2, 6 is higher than the labor-income-weighted

AMTR, which appears in Figure 3 (red graph).

        To measure the dividend tax rate, τdiv, we multiplied the fraction of corporate stock held

in taxable form (red graph in Figure 2) by the dividend AMTR (blue graph) to get the green

graph. 7 In the theory, the contribution of C-corporate taxation to the tax wedge, τ, in

equation (2) should enter as log(1 − 𝜏𝜏𝑐𝑐 ) = log�1 − 𝜏𝜏𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 � + log(1 − 𝜏𝜏𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 ), where 𝜏𝜏𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 is from

Figure 1 and 𝜏𝜏𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 is the green graph from Figure 2.


        B. Pass-through tax rate

        The pass-through entities that we focus on are S-corporations and partnerships. Sole

proprietorships are not covered in our main data. Incomes from S-corporations and partnerships

mostly flows through to owners and are reported by individuals on IRS form 1040, Schedule E.

By using information provided by Dan Feenberg from the National Bureau of Economic

Research’s TAXSIM program, we were able to measure the Schedule E income-weighted

average marginal tax rate (AMTR) from 1962 to 2012. This calculation first computes the

additional federal tax on a sampled return generated by a small hypothetical increment to

Schedule E income, holding constant other income and deductions. 8 The individual marginal tax

rates are then averaged using Schedule E income as weights. Note that the income reported on

Schedule E excludes portfolio income passed through to partners. To get close to the incomes



6
  The data for calculating the dividend AMTR from 1960 to 2012 were provided by Dan Feenberg, based on the
National Bureau of Economic Research’s TAXSIM program. The value for 2013 was unavailable and was assumed
to equal that for 2012. Values before 1960 were estimated by Tatjana Kleinberg, using issues of IRS, Statistics of
Income, Individual Income Tax Returns. A similar measure of the dividend AMTR (but including state income
taxes) appears in Poterba (2004, Table 1).
7
  Our assumption in this calculation is that taxable foreign stock holdings face the same marginal tax rate on
dividends as that on domestic holdings.
8
  The assumption is that the additional income is “earned income,” which matters for the top income-tax rate from
1971 to 1981. The increment to taxes includes self-employment tax.

                                                        7
derived from ownership of S-corporations and partnerships, we excluded amounts reported on

Schedule E from rents, royalties, and estates & trusts. The resulting Schedule E AMTR is shown

as the blue graph in Figure 3. 9

        Figure 3 also shows two series that serve as comparisons for the Schedule E AMTR. The

green graph is the top marginal federal income-tax-rate on earned income, which is distinguished

from ordinary income for 1971-1981. The red graph, mentioned before, is the labor-income

weighted federal AMTR. This series comes from Barro and Sahasakul (1983), Barro and

Redlick (2011), and the Tax Policy Center. Related marginal-tax-rate data have been used in

macroeconomic research by Mertens and Ravn (2013) and Mertens and Montiel Olea (2018).

        The AMTR weighted by Schedule E income (blue graph in Figure 3) is notably higher

than that weighted by labor income (red graph). From 1962 to 2012, the Schedule E AMTR

averaged 0.34, while that based on labor income averaged 0.24. This pattern arises particularly

because Schedule E income is concentrated in returns that have relatively high overall taxable

income and, therefore, face relatively high marginal tax rates. However, the Schedule E AMTR

is also markedly lower than the top marginal tax rate on earned income until the top rate fell

sharply after 1970. For example, in 1962, when the top rate was 91%, the Schedule E AMTR

was only 37%, and in 1967, when the top rate was 70%, the Schedule E AMTR was only 36%.

In recent years, the Schedule E AMTR is close to the top rate—values for 2012 were 35% for the

top rate and 32% for the Schedule E AMTR. (Note that, unlike the top-rate variable, the

Schedule E AMTR includes self-employment tax.)

        Figure 4 combines the various components to get an overall tax wedge associated with

the choice between C-corporate and pass-through legal status. The blue graph corresponds to the


9
 Because of missing data, our empirical analysis assumes that the Schedule E AMTR for 1958-61 equals the value
for 1962 and the value for 2013 equals that for 2012.

C-corporate profits tax, τprof (from Figure 1), the red graph to the dividend tax rate, τdiv

(Figure 2), and the green graph to the Schedule E tax rate, τp (Figure 3). The black graph shows

the overall tax wedge, given from equation (2) by τ = log(1- τp) - log(1-τprof) – log(1- τdiv). The

overall wedge, τ, peaked at 0.77 in 1961, then fell gradually to reach 0.090 in 2013. The average

from 1958 to 2013 was 0.37.

        C. A short U.S. legal history related to benefits of corporations and pass-throughs

        We provide a list of productivity benefits associated with corporate legal ownership. We

include historical context on how U.S. legal changes have shifted these benefits when compared

to those arising from pass-through alternatives.

                 1. A corporation is a distinct and perpetual legal entity, the structure of

        which—unlike the typical partnership—is not compromised substantially by the

        departure of its owner(s). Schwartz (2012) and Stout (2019) discuss corporate

        perpetual existence and make a strong case for its importance in preventing the

        fractionalization of capital and thereby promoting economic development. 10

                 2. C-corporations offer the potential for convenient public trading of

        shares, typically on organized markets. This public trading is important for the

        raising of capital and for gaining information from market prices. Starting in

        1981 with Apache Petroleum, public trading became available for a narrow range

        of business for limited partners in the form of master limited partnerships (MLPs)

        and publicly traded partnerships (PTPs). Subsequently, these types of ownership

        were available mostly for companies operating in the energy sector, due to rules



10
 Kuran (2004) emphasizes this feature in his analysis of why the lack of corporate law hindered economic
development in Muslim countries after the industrial revolution.

                                                        9
         on a company’s sources of income specified in a 1987 federal law. However,

         some financial firms, such as Blackstone, qualified for MLP status. (Blackstone

         recently shifted to C-corporate form, following the 2017 tax reform and the

         apparently successful transformation of KKR into a C-corporation in 2018. 11)

                  3. C-corporations provide owners with limited liability, a status that

         applies also to pass-through S-corporations, created in 1958. However,

         S-corporations have major limitations on numbers and types of shareholders—

         although the allowable number increased substantially over time from the original

         10 to the current 100. 12 As an example of restrictions, S-corporate shareholders

         have to be U.S. entities and cannot be corporations or partnerships. In addition,

         there can be only one class of stock with respect to rights to distributions and

         liquidation proceeds. The major pass-through alternative to the S-corporation is

         the partnership, which does not feature the restrictions on ownership that apply to

         S-corporations. The partnership form has a long history, but a key innovation was

         the invention of the limited liability company (LLC) in Wyoming in 1977. LLCs,

         which offer limited liability for owners, 13 are regulated at the state level and

         became popular after an IRS ruling in September 1988 that LLCs could be taxed

         as pass-through partnerships. Another landmark is the presence by 1996 of LLC

         laws in all 50 states. For a discussion of the history of LLCs, see Hamill (2005).

         Although an LLC is not formally a partnership, it effectively functions that way—



11
   See Institutional Investor, July 19, 2018.
12
   The number rose to 15 in 1976, 25 in 1981, 35 in 1983, 75 in 1997, and 100 in 2004. Additionally, the effective
number of shareholders was expanded by the treatment of some family units as constituting a single shareholder.
See Sicular (2014).
13
   In contrast, limited partnerships have limited liability for limited partners but not for the general partner(s), who
actively manage the business and have signing authority.

                                                            10
        and the IRS data on “partnerships” include most LLCs. 14 The growth in the share

        of partnerships in limited-liability form—more specifically, in LLCs—has been

        dramatic since the mid-1990s. DeBacker and Prisinzano (2015, Figure 9) report

        that, from 1996 to 2011, the share of partnerships with limited liability rose from

        30% to 80%, and the share that were LLCs went from 10% to 64%.

                 4. The retention of earnings is permissible in C-corporations. This

        retention may be useful for financing of investment and for deferring taxes on

        dividends. Partnerships and S-corporations can also retain earnings, but the

        owners are taxed as though all the earnings had been distributed.

                 5. C-corporations and pass-through businesses have numerous differences

        in regulations, filing rules, requirements to hold regular meetings, and

        government supervision.

        Overall, U.S. legal changes over recent decades have mostly favored pass-through

alternatives to C-corporations—notable here are the invention of the S-corporation in

1958, the IRS tax ruling in 1988 that allowed LLCs to be taxed as pass-through

partnerships, and the adoptions by all 50 states of LLC laws by 1996.

III. C-Corporate Shares of Economic Activity

        We have several empirical measures of the C-corporate share of businesses’ economic

activity, based on publicly available IRS data and mostly from 1958 to 2013. 15 Figures 5-7

apply to stock measures of business economic activity—net capital stocks, equity (book value),



14
   A multiple-member LLC that opts for partnership (rather than C-corporate) tax status files the usual partnership
information return, Form 1065.
15
   The data we use exclude economic activity by governments, non-profits, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and
regulated investment companies (RICs).

                                                        11
and gross assets. These variables are available for C-corporations, S-corporations, and

partnerships, but not for sole proprietorships. The partnership numbers on net capital stocks and

equity were interpolated for part of the sample, based on data available from the IRS every two

years from 1959 to 1975 and annually for 1977-1982 and 1988-2013.

       Figure 5 has shares of business net capital stocks. The C-corporate share was 0.95 in

1958 and trended downward to 0.53 in 2013. The main offsetting increase was in the partnership

share, which went from 0.04 in 1958 to 0.40 in 2013. Legal changes noted before, especially for

LLCs, likely explain much of this trend. The share for S-corporations was 0.004 in 1958 (the

first year of existence), rose to 0.025 in 1986, then jumped upward to 0.074 by 1999. This share

then fell to 0.067 in 2013, probably because of increased competition from LLCs.

       Figure 6 has shares of business equity (book value). The trends are similar to those for

net capital stocks, although the share of C-corporations in equity at 0.69 in 2013 exceeds that for

net capital stocks. Correspondingly, the partnership share of equity in 2013 was 0.29. There is

also more of an indication that S-corporations are being driven out of the market, with the share

down to 0.024 in 2013, compared to a peak of 0.038 in 1990. Eventually, the attractiveness of

the LLC may make the S-corporation obsolete.

       Figure 7 has shares for business gross assets. This concept of C-corporate share was used

by Mackie-Mason and Gordon (1997). The trend in business gross assets is similar to those for

net capital stocks and equity, but the C-corporate share of gross assets has not declined as

much—the share in 2013 was 0.75, whereas that for partnerships was 0.22. The S-corporation

share of gross assets in 2013 was 0.033, compared to 0.037 in 1990.

       Figure 8 applies to positive net income (excluding businesses with losses), which is a

flow measure of economic activity. In this case, data are available for sole proprietorships.



                                                12
Variants of these data were used by Mackie-Mason and Gordon (1997) and Prisinzano and

Pearce (2018). A serious problem with these data, noted by Prisinzano and Pearce (2018,

Section 2.1), is double-counting—arising especially because partnerships are owned partly by

corporations and other partnerships. The share numbers are also highly volatile because of

strong sensitivity of the various forms of net income to the business cycle (and the volatility is

even more pronounced when businesses with losses are included). These difficulties cause us to

discount the results for net income compared to those obtained with our other concepts.

However, it is worth noting that recent trends in Figure 8 are similar to those in Figures 5-7.

From 1979 to 2013, the C-corporate share of positive net income fell from 0.71 to 0.43, the

partnership share rose from 0.09 to 0.31, the S-corporate share increased from 0.02 to 0.15 (but

has been flat since 2001), and the sole proprietor share fell from 0.18 to 0.11.

IV. Formal Model of Choice of Business Legal Form

       We now describe our formal model of choice of business legal form. The analysis
                                                                                           𝑌𝑌
emphasizes the frequency distribution of the corporate productivity advantage, 𝑦𝑦 ≡ log(𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐 ),
                                                                                            𝑝𝑝


which appears in equation (2) (where we now drop the index i). At a point in time, the

distribution of y depends on the legal/regulatory framework, which applies to C-corporations and

pass-through alternatives. Over time, changes in laws and regulations can shift the distribution

of y. Implicitly, we are also holding constant the structure of production across sectors. Changes

in this composition can affect the distribution of y. For example, benefits from corporate form

may be more useful in some types of business—such as those with larger scale benefits or

greater dependence on credit—than in others.

       We assume that log(Yc) and log(Yp) are distributed bivariate normal with respective

means and standard deviations of μc, σc, μp, and σp and a correlation coefficient between the two

                                                 13
                                                                                      𝑌𝑌
random variables of ρ. This specification implies that 𝑦𝑦 ≡ log(𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐 ) is distributed normally with
                                                                                       𝑝𝑝


mean μ=μc- μp and variance 𝜎𝜎 2 = 𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐2 + 𝜎𝜎𝑝𝑝2 − 2𝜌𝜌𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐 𝜎𝜎𝑝𝑝 . The fraction of firms that opt to be pass-

through is the cumulative normal value for y at the cutoff τ, and the fraction corporate is one

minus this cumulative normal value. 16

            The overall level of output, Y, is given by

            (3)        𝑌𝑌 = 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝(𝑦𝑦 ≥ 𝜏𝜏) ∙ 𝐸𝐸(𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐 |𝑦𝑦 ≥ 𝜏𝜏) + 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝(𝑦𝑦 < 𝜏𝜏) ∙ 𝐸𝐸�𝑌𝑌𝑝𝑝 �𝑦𝑦 < 𝜏𝜏�,

where, on the right, the first term is the level of output in the corporate sector, and the second

term is the level of output in the pass-through sector. The corporate share of output is the ratio of

the first term on the right to Y.

            To make the calculations in equation (3), we have to derive the expectations of Yc,
                                  𝑌𝑌
conditional on 𝑦𝑦 ≡ log(𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐 ) ≥τ, and of Yp, conditional on 𝑦𝑦 <τ. The appendix shows that the
                                   𝑝𝑝


expectation of Yc, conditional on 𝑦𝑦, is given by:

                                                     1
            (4)        𝐸𝐸(𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐 |y) = exp{𝜇𝜇𝑐𝑐 + �𝜎𝜎2 � ∙ �𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐 ∙ �𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐 − 𝜌𝜌𝜎𝜎𝑝𝑝 � ∙ (𝑦𝑦 − μ) + 0.5 ∙ (1 − 𝜌𝜌2 )𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐2 𝜎𝜎𝑝𝑝2 �}.

Equation (4) says that 𝐸𝐸(𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐 |y) effectively emerges from a regression of Yc on y. Using

equation (4), the appendix shows that corporate output is given by:

            (5)        𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝(𝑦𝑦 ≥ 𝜏𝜏) ∙ 𝐸𝐸(𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐 |𝑦𝑦 ≥ 𝜏𝜏) = [exp(𝜇𝜇𝑐𝑐 + 0.5𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐2 )] ∙ [1 − 𝛷𝛷(𝜏𝜏 ′ )],

                   1
where 𝜏𝜏 ′ = �𝜎𝜎� �𝜏𝜏 − 𝜇𝜇 − 𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐 �𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐 − 𝜌𝜌𝜎𝜎𝑝𝑝 �� and 𝛷𝛷(∙) is the cumulative standard normal density.

The formula for pass-through output is analogous, except that the parameters related to c and p

are switched, and τ is replaced by –τ in the expression for 𝜏𝜏 ′ .




16
     The fraction corporate is 1-Φ[(τ-μ)/σ], where 𝛷𝛷(∙) is the cumulative standard normal density.


                                                                 14
        The quantitative results depend on the five parameters μc, σc, μp, σp, and ρ. We calibrate

the model by specifying values of these parameters. One reason for carrying out this calibration

is to construct reasonable ranges of values for coefficients that arise in the regression analysis. A

more important reason is that the calibrated model allows inferences on how productivity

responds to changes in τ or to shifts in the underlying parameters—especially μc and μp, which

reflect the average productivity of the alternative legal forms. The difference μc- μp represents

the typical advantage for corporate form. We think that the main legal changes in recent decades

reduced this advantage.

        The baseline specification assumes that the two standard deviations, σc and σp, are equal.

To pin down these standard deviations, we use data on the dispersion of U.S. plant-level

productivity. Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson (2008) use a pooled sample of data from the

U.S. Census of Manufacturers for 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, and 1997. From this broad data set,

they select information on 11 goods that are sufficiently homogeneous so that quantities (and,

hence, physical productivity) can be directly calculated across plants. 17 Based on these data,

they report (in their Table 1) a standard deviation of 0.26 for the log of physical total factor

productivity (TFPQ). Hsieh and Klenow (2009, Table II) use the same underlying data to

compute the dispersion of the log of revenue-based total factor productivity (TFPR) for a much

broader array of manufacturing plants. They find that this standard deviation was 0.49 in 1997

and slightly lower before that. 18 Since the findings from Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson’s 11

homogeneous products would not be representative even of the manufacturing sector, we use


17
   The products are boxes, bread, carbon black, coffee, concrete, flooring, gasoline, block ice, processed ice,
plywood, and sugar.
18
   The values are 0.45 in 1977 and 0.41 in 1987. They report (in their Table I) substantially higher standard
deviations for TFPQ, around 0.8. However, their TFPQ values are not actually observed—they are inferred from the
TFPR values given an assumed elasticity of substitution between alternative products in final demand. Foster,
Haltiwanger, and Syverson (2008, Table 1) calculate a TFPR value, 0.22, that is only slightly below their TFPQ
value.

                                                      15
Hsieh and Klenow’s results to set the common standard deviation at σc=σp=0.5 in the main

calibration of our model. We discuss later how our results change when we assume different

values for σc and σp.

         In the absence of direct evidence, we assume that the correlation coefficient, ρ, between

log(Yc) and log(Yp) is positive and set it to 0.25 in the main analysis. As discussed later, the

results are not very sensitive to variations in ρ.

         The remaining parameters, μc and μp, relate to the mean productivity for corporate and

pass-through status. We first use a normalization for the level of output, Y (which has arbitrary

units). We normalize so that the peak of Y, which corresponds to τ=0, equals 1.0 in an arbitrary

benchmark year, which we take to be 1978 (the first year of the regression sample). We then

determine μc and μp for 1978 so that the calibrated model matches the observed C-corporate

share of economic activity, which we base on net capital stock, shown by the blue graph in

Figure 5. In the benchmark year, 1978, the C-corporate share was 0.85, and the tax wedge, τ,

equaled 0.48. The condition that the model match the C-corporate share in 1978 (along with the

normalization for the level of Y in 1978) turns out to require μc=-0.137 and μp=-1.032. The large

gap between μc and μp allows the model’s predicted corporate share to be high, 0.85, despite the

large tax wedge, τ=0.48.

         For other years, we back out the values of μc and μp by requiring the calibrated model to

match, first, the year’s C-corporate share of net capital stock and, second, the year’s overall level

of business productivity (TFP), as given by Fernald’s (2019) data. 19 The time series for TFP is

given by the blue graph in Figure 9. The values of μc and μp are given, respectively, by the red

and green graphs in the figure. Loosely speaking, the gap between μc and μp is set to match the


19
 We use the utilization-adjusted quarterly data to gauge TFP at the end of each year. The level of the series is
normalized so that the calibrated model’s TFP in 1978 equals 1.0 when the tax wedge, τ, equals zero.

                                                         16
C-corporate share of business net capital stock (blue graph in Figure 5), given the value of the

tax wedge, τ. The overall levels of μc and μp are chosen to generate the observed TFP level,

given again the value of τ. Note that the estimated gap between μc and μp falls in most years after

1958. The gap closes especially rapidly between 1994 and 2004, likely reflecting the spread of

LLCs. By 2009, the gap is nearly closed, and thereafter remains roughly constant.

       Figures 10-13 shows the workings of the model, given the calibrated parameters. The

graphs show the effects on a designated outcome from a change in τ while holding constant these

parameters. Two graphs are displayed in each case, one corresponding to 1978 (the start date of

our regression sample) and the other to 2013 (the final date of the sample).

       Figure 10 shows that the fraction of firms opting to be corporate declines monotonically

with the tax wedge, τ. We focus on values of τ between 0.1 and 0.5—this range applies in

Figure 4 to our main regression sample, from 1978 to 2013. In this range, for the 1978

calibration, the corporate share of numbers is between 0.74 and 0.90. For the 2013 calibration,

the corresponding range is between 0.24 and 0.48. The much lower corporate share, at each τ,

for 2013 reflects the much smaller gap between μc and μp (Figure 9). Since it is unclear that the

number of firms is an empirically meaningful concept, we focus our analysis on results related to

corporate and total output.

       Figure 11 shows the relation of overall output (economy-wide productivity) to the tax

wedge, τ, again for the calibrations based on 1978 and 2013. Because the only distortion in the

model is this tax wedge, the maximum of output occurs in each year at τ=0 (with the peak for

1978 normalized to equal 1.0). The marginal effect of τ on productivity is positive when τ<0

and negative when τ>0.




                                                17
       Note that we are using the revealed preference of business owners to infer the effects of

the tax wedge, τ, on overall output and productivity. Specifically, when τ>0, a firm opts to be

corporate only if the productivity advantage associated with corporate form is sufficient to justify

the tax penalty. Moreover, a firm at the margin must have a productivity advantage that exactly

compensates for the tax penalty.

       Figure 12 shows the relation of the corporate share of output to the tax wedge, τ. At a

given τ and for either calibration (based on 1978 or 2013), the corporate output share exceeds the

corporate share of numbers, shown in Figure 10. This pattern applies because, when μc>μp, the

typical corporate firm is more productive that the typical pass-through firm. The results for the

corporate output share in Figure 12 can be matched with data on the C-corporate share of

economic activity, such as net capital stock. The calibrated model for 1978 implies that the

corporate output share is between 0.85 and 0.94 when τ is between 0.1 and 0.5, whereas that

calibrated for 2013 has a corresponding range for corporate output share between 0.31 and 0.51.

       Figure 13 shows the marginal effect of the tax wedge, τ, on the corporate share of output.

Consistent with Figure 12, this marginal effect is negative throughout. Quantitatively, for the

1978 calibration, the marginal effect in Figure 13 is between -0.16 and -0.28 when τ is between

0.1 and 0.5. For the model calibrated to 2013, the corresponding range is between -0.47

and -0.50. These marginal effects should correspond to regression coefficients in linear relations

between the C-corporate share of economic activity and τ. The calibrated model implies that

these coefficients should be in a range of roughly -0.2 to -0.5, and the magnitudes of regression

coefficients found empirically turn out to accord reasonably well with this prediction.

       The results suggest that, for a given set of underlying parameters—corresponding to a

given graph in Figure 13—the relationship between the C-corporate share and τ is roughly linear;



                                                18
that is, the slopes connecting τ to the share do not vary much with τ. However, the slopes are

higher in magnitude for the 2013 curve than for the 1978 curve; that is, the size of the slope is

larger when the average productivity of pass-through organization, represented by μp, is close to

that for corporate form, μc. In the regression analysis, we do not find clear evidence concerning

this result.

        Figures 10-13 apply when the dispersion of the underlying C-corporate and pass-through

productivities, determined by σc, σp, and ρ, take on the values assumed, but the tax wedge, τ, is

the same for all entities. Dispersion in the tax wedge would also affect the results. Specifically,

we have computed the standard deviation of the cross-section of individual marginal tax rates

that underlie the computation of the Schedule E AMTR (blue graph in Figure 3). This standard

deviation has fallen over time, from 0.18 in 1962 to 0.07 in 2012. If this variation were

independent of that in the underlying productivities, there would effectively be an addition to the

amount of dispersion. However, with the baseline values of σc=σp=0.5, the added amount of

dispersion due to the variations in τ would be minor. Moreover, the results are isomorphic to

those derived when there is no cross-sectional variation in tax rates but where the values of σc

and σp are higher than those assumed in the baseline case.

V. Regressions

        A. Regression framework

        The regression analysis relates the C-corporate shares of net capital stock (Figure 5),

equity (Figure 6), gross assets (Figure 7), and positive net income (Figure 8) to the tax wedge, τ.

In each case, we consider C-corporate amounts expressed as a ratio to the total for

C-corporations, S-corporations, and partnerships (but excluding sole proprietorships). The

overall federal tax wedge, based on equation (2), is τ = log(1-τp) - log(1-τprof) – log(1-τdiv), where


                                                  19
“p” refers to pass-through income (reported on Schedule E), “prof” to C-corporate profits, and

“div” to dividends. The main regressions separate this wedge into two parts, the first associated

with C-corporations, log(1-τc) = log(1-τprof) + log(1-τdiv), and the second with pass-throughs,

log(1-τp). We test whether the estimated coefficients on log(1-τp) and log(1-τc) are equal in

magnitude with opposite signs. We also test whether unrestricted estimates of coefficients on

log(1-τprof) and log(1-τdiv) are equal.

           Level regressions for C-corporate shares, as implemented in Mackie-Mason and Gordon

(1997, Table III), are probably not meaningful. Specifically, as is evident from Figures 5-8, the

C-corporate share measures have strong persistence and may be non-stationary. This problem

was noted by Prisinzano and Pearce (2018, Tables IV and V), who emphasized regressions with

annual first-differences (for dependent variables based on C-corporate shares of net income).

However, this specification is likely to be heavily influenced by measurement error, particularly

because the timing between changes in the tax system and changes in C-corporate shares are not

well determined.

           Given these concerns, our empirical analysis relies on long-difference estimation. We

emphasize results with 20-year changes in C-corporate shares and the tax-rate variables, but

results are similar for 15-year changes. Because this procedure creates or intensifies serial

dependence in the error terms for the overlapping data, we use the Newey-West procedure with a

bandwidth of 20 or more years to construct standard errors of the estimated coefficients. 20 Our

sample in the context of 20-year changes is 1978-2013 because the data on C-corporate shares

start in 1958.




20
     An analogous procedure was implemented by Montamat and Stock (2018, Table 1).

                                                       20
       In principle, we would like to isolate variables, such as changes in the legal/regulatory

environment and shifts in the composition of production, that influence the relative attractiveness

of C-corporate and pass-through forms. With regard to important legal changes, the one in 1958

that created the S-corporation predates the start of our sample. Otherwise, we think that the most

significant changes are the IRS ruling in late 1988 that allowed LLCs to be taxed as partnerships

and the adoption of LLC laws in all 50 states by 1996. To account for these changes, we

estimate one trend (intercept) coefficient from 1978 to 1988, another from 1989 to 1996, and a

third from 1997 to 2013.

       We have IRS data on the division of C-corporate and pass-through gross assets and

positive net income into eight sectors: agriculture, construction, finance/insurance/real estate or

FIRE, manufacturing, mining, services, trade, and transportation. The pass-through category

covers S-corporations and partnerships. Data are unavailable on the composition of net capital

stocks and equity.

       Figure 14 shows the composition of gross assets by sector at the beginning and end of the

data sample, 1958 and 2013. Figure 15 has the comparable data for positive net income. The

main pattern is the shift toward FIRE and especially away from manufacturing and

transportation. FIRE rises from 53% to 72% of gross assets and from 18% to 43% of positive

net income, while manufacturing and transportation combined fall from 33% to 17% of gross

assets and from 51% to 27% of positive net income.

       The eight sectors differ in C-corporate shares, as shown for 1958, 1985, and 2013 in

Figures 16 and 17. For example, on average for gross assets, the highest starting from the top are

manufacturing, transportation, FIRE, trade, and mining, and the lowest starting from the bottom

are agriculture, construction, and services. Given these differences, exogenous changes in the



                                                 21
composition of assets or positive net income across the sectors might explain part of the

movement in overall C-corporate shares. In practice, however, the dominant changes in shares

were toward FIRE and away from manufacturing and transportation. Because these sectors are

all comparatively high in average C-corporate shares, the compositional changes among these

sectors turn out to explain almost none of the changes in overall C-corporate shares. That is, the

changes are mainly within sectors—all eight had lower C-corporate shares in 2013 than in 1958,

as shown in Figures 16 and 17. Given these patterns, it is not surprising that compositional-

change variables lack explanatory power in the regressions for changes in overall C-corporate

shares.

          B. Regression results

          Table 1 has regressions where the dependent variable is the 20-year difference of the

C-corporate share of net business capital stocks (column 1), equity or book value (column 2),

gross assets (column 3), and positive net income (column 4). The sample period is 1978 to 2013

(dictated by the availability of data beginning in 1958). These regressions have the three

intercept terms noted before (which pick up trends in levels) and the 20-year changes in the two

tax-rate variables, log(1-τc) and log(1-τp). The compositional change variables, which turn out to

be unimportant, are excluded in these results.

          The estimated coefficients on log(1-τc) are all positive, as predicted; that is, the estimated

effects of τc on the C-corporate shares are negative. These estimated coefficients are statistically

significantly different from zero at less than the 5% level for net capital stock, equity, and gross

assets (columns 1-3) but not for positive net income (column 4). The point estimates of

coefficients in the first three cases range between 0.24 and 0.53.




                                                    22
         The estimated coefficients on log(1-τp) are all negative, as predicted; that is, the estimated

effects of τp on the C-corporate shares are positive. These estimated coefficients are again

statistically significantly different from zero at least at the 5% level for net capital stock, equity,

and gross assets (columns 1-3) but not for positive net income. The magnitudes of the estimated

coefficients range from 0.34 to 0.56.

         As noted, the C-corporate part of the tax wedge combines effects from federal taxation of

C-corporate profits and dividends: log(1-τc) = log(1-τprof) + log(1-τdiv). As shown in Table 1, the

hypothesis of equal coefficients on these two parts is accepted at a high p-value for net capital

stock, equity, and gross assets (columns 1-3) but not for positive net income. 21

         The model also implies that the coefficients of the tax variables log(1-τc) and log(1-τp)

should be of equal magnitude and opposite sign. As shown by the p-values in Table 1, this

hypothesis is rejected at less than the 1% critical level for net capital stock and gross assets and

at a p-value of 0.06 for positive net income. For equity, the hypothesis is accepted with a

p-value of 0.41. Thus, some of the econometric results deviate from the precise theoretical

restriction—possibly because the empirical measures of tax rates are imperfect.

         The magnitudes of the estimated tax-rate coefficients can be compared with those

predicted by the calibrated theoretical model. Since the results for positive net income appear

unreliable—possibly due to the data problems noted earlier—we focus on the estimates for the

first three columns of Table 1. In this case, the average of the estimated coefficients on log(1-τc)

is 0.34, whereas that on log(1-τp) is -0.46. The magnitudes of these coefficients are in the

ballpark of those predicted by the calibrated model. As noted before, the marginal tax-wedge


21
  The fits of the regressions deteriorate if we use the dividend tax rate in Figure 2 that is not adjusted for the share
accruing to taxable entities. For example, for net capital stock (Table 2, column 1), the estimated tax coefficients
become 0.148 (s.e.=0.057) on log(1-τc) and -0.357 (0.152) on log(1-τp), and the standard error of the regression rises
from 0.0158 to 0.0185.

                                                          23
effects in Figure 13 range between -0.2 and -0.5 when τ is in the range from 0.1 to 0.5 that

applies to the regression sample, 1978 to 2013.

       We checked whether the coefficients on the tax-rate variables were different in

magnitude in the former part of the sample, say up to 1996, compared to that afterwards. The

results from the model in Figure 13 suggested that the responsiveness of the corporate share to

the tax-rate variables would be larger in size in the latter period, for which the average

productivity of pass-through status was close to that for corporate status (Figure 9). The results

here are mixed. For equity and gross assets, the magnitudes of the estimated coefficients are

larger in the latter period, as expected, but for net capital stock and positive net income, the

opposite pattern applies.

       The results in Table 1 gauge the pass-through tax rate, τp, by the AMTR on Schedule E

income. However, as is clear from Figure 3, this tax-rate variable is positively correlated with

the more standard AMTR based on labor income. If we measure τp by the standard AMTR, the

fits of the regressions deteriorate but the qualitative results remain. For example, for net capital

stock in Table 1, column 1, the estimated tax coefficients become 0.175 (s.e.=0.050) on log(1-τc)

and -0.747 (0.254) on log(1-τp), and the standard error of the regression rises from 0.0158

to 0.0181.

       The regressions deteriorate more sharply if we measure τp by the top individual tax rate

on earned income (Figure 3). For example, for net capital stock in Table 1, column 1, the

estimated tax coefficients have the “wrong” signs: -0.039 (s.e.=0.059) on log(1-τc) and 0.020

(0.013) on log(1-τp), and the standard error of the regression rises from 0.0158 to 0.0205. These

results suggest that the high top individual tax rates that prevailed before 1987 did not influence

choices between C-corporate and pass-through legal form. This result makes sense because the



                                                  24
large gap between the top tax rate and the Schedule E AMTR in this period (Figure 3) indicates

that little pass-through income actually faced these high marginal tax rates.

        The intercept terms apply in Table 1 to the periods 1978-1988, 1989-1996, and

1997-2013. The estimated coefficients on these intercepts are significantly negative at the 1%

level, except for net income in the 1978-1988 period. These results accord with the patterns

shown in Figures 5-8, although the negative trend for equity seems to set in only around 1980.

Quantitatively, the estimated trends in Table 1 are around -1 percentage point per year. The

magnitude is significantly higher in all cases for the last period, 1997-2013, than for the previous

two. This result likely reflects the broad availability of the LLC legal form, which was

recognized in all 50 states by 1996.

        The tax changes from 1958 to 2013 imply a substantial overall drop in the tax wedge, τ

(Figure 4). Thus, this tax effect goes against the estimated trend coefficients (intercepts), which

imply declining C-corporate shares of economic activity, consistent with Figures 5-8. On their

own, the tax changes from 1958 to 2013 should have increased C-corporate shares of economic

activity.

        The 20-year difference estimates shown in Table 1 calculate the standard errors of the

estimated coefficients by the Newey-West procedure with a bandwidth of 20 years. The results

change little if the bandwidth is raised to 25 years (to allow for serial dependence in the error

term independently from that created by the overlapping data). For example, with a 20-year

bandwidth, the estimated standard errors on the two estimated tax coefficients in Table 1,

column 1, were 0.049 and 0.093. These values change with a 25-year bandwidth to 0.044 and

0.088, respectively.




                                                 25
       The results shown in Table 1 do not change greatly if the long differencing applies to 15

years, rather than 20. For the 15-year regressions (for samples from 1978 to 2013 with 20-year

bandwidths), the estimated coefficients on the tax variables, log(1-τc) and log(1-τp), are,

respectively: 0.241 (s.e.=0.056) and -0.404 (0.075) for net capital stock, 0.344 (0.084)

and -0.404 (0.047) for equity, 0.210 (0.027) and -0.269 (0.019) for gross assets, and 0.048

(0.086) and -0.339 (0.113) for positive net income.

       In contrast, a differencing interval much shorter than 15 years tends to generate estimated

tax coefficients that often differ insignificantly from zero and sometimes have the “wrong” signs.

For example, with 10-year differencing, a 15-year bandwidth, and a sample from 1973 to 2013,

the estimated coefficients on the tax variables, log(1-τc) and log(1-τp), are, respectively: 0.017

(s.e.=0.104) and -0.282 (0.127) for net capital stock, -0.010 (0.094) and -0.111 (0.095) for

equity, 0.031 (0.042) and -0.145 (0.045) for gross assets, and -0.407 (0.304) and 0.005 (0.335)

for positive net income. The inference is that the association between changes in the tax

variables and changes in C-corporate shares of economic activity are not well determined over

short periods. However, the long-run association—over 15 or more years—is reasonably well

pinned down.

       As a general statement, we think that the regression results support the conceptual

framework and the calibration discussed earlier. Therefore, we think it reasonable to now apply

the calibrated model to assess implications for productivity.

VI. Productivity Effects

       The calibrated model has implications for the time path of productivity. Our baseline

application uses the values of μc and μp shown in Figure 9; the parameter values σc=σp=0.5 and

ρ=0.25; the tax wedge, τ, given by the black graph in Figure 4; and the corporate share of output


                                                 26
gauged by the C-corporate share of net capital stock in Figure 5. The blue graph in Figure 18

shows the log of TFP expressed as a deviation from its value in 1958. (The level of TFP is the

blue graph in Figure 9.) The implied average TFP growth rate from 1958 to 2013 was 1.09% per

year.

        We use the calibrated model to compute three counter-factual time series. The first

scenario, corresponding to the red graph in Figure 18, gives the log of TFP (relative to that in

1958) that would have arisen if, instead of mostly falling over time, μc-μp had remained fixed at

its value in 1958 (see Figure 9). In this case, μc and τ are maintained at their values shown in

Figures 9 and 4, and μp moves along with μc.

        The second scenario, corresponding to the green graph in Figure 18, computes the log of

TFP assuming that the tax wedge, τ, instead of mostly declining over time, had remained

constant at its value in 1958 (Figure 4). In this setting, μc and μp are maintained at their values

shown in Figure 9.

        The third scenario, given by the black graph in Figure 18, assumes that μc-μp and τ are

kept fixed at their respective values in 1958. In this case, μc is maintained at the values shown in

Figure 9, and μp moves along with μc.

        The red graph in Figure 18 implies that, over the full period from 1958 to 2013, the effect

of the fall in μc-μp is a rise in TFP by 0.33% per year, compared to the total of 1.09% per year.

However, the effects are very different in the early and late parts of the sample. From 1958 to

the mid 1980s, the substantial rise in μp (Figure 9) did not contribute to rising TFP. The reason is

the tax penalty, τ, for being corporate (Figure 4), which creates a distortion in the sense that the

public return from being corporate rather than pass-through exceeds the private return. In the

years up to 1986, when τ is very high—between 0.37 and 0.77—this distortion turns out to be



                                                 27
large enough so that overall output falls slightly or rises only slightly when μp increases for given

μc and τ (despite the direct positive impact of a rise in μp on productivity). By 1987, τ had fallen

enough (below 0.30), so that increases in μp contribute to higher TFP. The effect from the

shrinking gap between μc and μp is particularly large from 1994 to 2004, when the growth rate of

TFP is unusually high—2.00% per year. In this period, the contribution from the falling μc-μp is

0.77% per year. This effect lines up reasonably well with the legal changes that made LLCs

attractive alternatives to C- or S-corporations or to existing forms of partnerships. That is, the

results suggest that the invention of the LLC was an important form of technical progress.

       The green graph in Figure 18 gives the results from the mostly falling tax wedge, τ. In

this case, the contribution to TFP growth is most important in the early period, when τ and the

gap μc-μp are particularly high. From 1958 to 1987, the average TFP growth rate was 1.24% per

year, and the contribution from the mostly declining τ was 0.41% per year. Over the full period

from 1958 to 2013, the contribution from the reductions in τ was 0.21% per year, compared to

the total of 1.09% per year.

       The black graph in Figure 18 shows the combined contribution from the declines in μc-μp

and τ. (Because of the important interactions between the two components, the effects are not

additive.) From 1958 to 2013, the combined contribution to TFP growth was 0.37% per year,

compared to the total of 1.09% per year.

VII. Alternative Parameter Values

       The results for TFP growth described in the previous section apply when the mean

parameters μc and μp are given in Figure 9 and the other parameters are set at σc=σp=0.5 and

ρ=0.25. We now assess how the results change with different settings for σc, σp, and ρ. Table 2




                                                 28
considers four cases: σc=σp=0.25, ρ=0.25; σc=0.25, σp=0.5, ρ=0.25; σc=0.5, σp=0.25, ρ=0.25;

and σc=σp=0.5, ρ=0.5.

       Among the four alternatives, the results on contributions to TFP growth from 1958 to

2013 change substantially only under the first case, where σc and σp are each lowered to 0.25.

For the setting where the gap between μc and μp and the tax wedge, τ, are both held fixed at their

values in 1958, the result is that the joint contribution to TFP growth from these two forces

averaged 0.20% per year, rather than the 0.37% per year found in the baseline. For the μc-μp gap

on its own, the contribution is now 0.13% per year, compared to 0.32% per year in the baseline;

and for τ on its own, the contribution is also 0.13% year, compared to 0.21% per year in the

baseline.

       The change in the correlation coefficient, ρ, from 0.25 to 0.5 has only a small impact on

the results. For the setting where the gap between μc and μp and the tax wedge, τ, are held fixed

at their respective values in 1958, the result (when σc=σp=0.5) is that the joint contribution to

TFP growth from the two forces averaged 0.31% per year, rather than the 0.37% per year found

in the baseline. For the μc-μp gap on its own, the contribution is now 0.26% per year, compared

to 0.32% per year in the baseline; and for τ on its own, the contribution is now 0.24% year,

compared to 0.21% per year in the baseline.

       Our conclusion is that the broad nature of the results about contributions to TFP growth is

robust to substantial changes in the underlying distribution parameters. The main change arises

when the underlying standard deviations, σc and σp, are much lower than 0.5. Recall that his

number came from the observed dispersion of productivity of U.S. manufacturing firms, as

reported by Hsieh and Klenow (2009). Since standard deviations as low as 0.25 seem




                                                 29
unrealistic, we are inclined to stick with the results on contributions to TFP growth found in our

baseline specification.

VIII. Concluding Observations

       We dealt theoretically and empirically with the relation between tax rates and the

composition of U.S. business economic activity between C-corporate and pass-through forms.

The main federal tax wedge, τ, that we measured since 1958 involves the tax rate on C-corporate

profits, the effective tax rate on dividends, and the pass-through tax rate, gauged by the average

marginal tax rate on Schedule E income. Our regression estimates from 1978 to 2013 imply that

a fall in the tax wedge raises the C-corporate share of economic activity.

       Despite the overall decline in the tax wedge, the measures of C-corporate share of

economic activity exhibit downward trends at least since the 1970s. We attributed these trends

particularly to legal changes that favored pass-through forms, notably LLCs. We gauged these

effects by aligning intercept terms in the regressions with the dates of the principal changes that

affected the legal status of the LLC form of business.

       The calibrated model provides estimates of the contribution to business TFP growth from

the mostly falling gap between underlying C-corporate and pass-through productivity (due

especially to legal changes that favored pass-throughs) and from the mostly declining tax wedge.

In our baseline analysis, the combined contribution to TFP growth from 1958 to 2013 was 0.37%

per year, compared to the total growth rate of 1.09% per year. The contribution from the

declining gap between C-corporate and pass-through productivity was negligible up to the mid

1980s but became important thereafter. The growth contribution was especially large—0.77%

per year—in the period from 1994 to 2004 when the observed TFP growth rate was unusually

high—2.00% per year.

Note: The top federal tax rate on C-corporate profits is from Figure 1, the federal dividend tax
rate is from Figure 2 (green graph), and the federal average marginal tax rate for Schedule E
income is from Figure 3 (blue graph). (In the blue graph, the values for 1958-1961 are assumed
to equal that for 1962 and the value for 2013 is assumed to equal that for 2012.) The overall
federal tax wedge for C-corporate versus pass-through status, indicated by the black graph,
equals the blue graph plus the red graph minus the green graph.

Notes: The TFP series comes from the utilization-adjusted quarterly data on total factor
productivity given in Fernald (2019). This series is used to gauge the level of output, y, in the
model developed in Section IV. The level of TFP is normalized so that the model’s implied level
of y in 1978 would equal 1.0 when the tax wedge, τ, is set to zero.
The parameters μc and μp refer in the model to the means of the logs of productivity under
corporate and non-corporate ownership, respectively. The values of μc and μp for each year are
backed out from the model, given the observed values of TFP; the tax wedge, τ, from the black
graph in Figure 4; and the C-corporate share of net capital stock from the blue graph in Figure 5
(used to gauge the corporate share of output in the model). The other distributional parameters
in the model are set at σc=σp=0.5 and ρ=0.25.

Notes: The blue graph is log(TFP)-log(TFP1958), where TFP is total factor productivity from
Figure 9. The other graphs are calculations from the model developed in Section IV. These
calculations use the parameter values σc= σp=0.5 and ρ=0.25.
For the contribution from μc-μp, the model is used to estimate the output, 𝑦𝑦�, that would have
arisen each year if μc-μp were kept at its 1958 value, 1.478 (see Figure 9). Each year’s tax
wedge, τ, is kept at that shown by the black graph in Figure 4, μc is kept at the value shown in
Figure 9, and μp is set to μc-1.478. The red graph shows log(TFP)-log(𝑦𝑦�)—the contribution to
log(TFP) from the change in μc-μp compared to its value in 1958.
For the tax-wedge calculation, the model is used to estimate the output, 𝑦𝑦�, that would have arisen
each year if τ were kept at its 1958 value, 0.7580 (see black graph in Figure 4). Each year’s μc
and μp are kept at those shown in Figure 9. The green graph shows log(TFP)-log(𝑦𝑦�)—the
contribution to log(TFP) from the change in τ compared to its value in 1958.
For the calculation for the joint contribution from the changes in μc-μp and τ, the model is used to
estimate the output, 𝑦𝑦�, that would have arisen each year if μc-μp and τ were kept at their 1958
values of 1.478 and 0.7580, respectively. Each year’s μc is kept at that shown in Figure 9, and μp
is set to μc-1.478. The black graph shows log(TFP)-log(𝑦𝑦�)—the contribution to each year’s
log(TFP) from the changes in τ and μc-μp compared to their values in 1958.

   The C-corporate tax variable is log(1-τc)= log(1-τprof)+ log(1-τdiv), where prof refers to
  C-corporate profits and div to dividends. These tests are for equal coefficients on log(1-τprof) and
  log(1-τdiv), which have unrestricted estimated coefficients of, respectively, 0.229 (s.e.=0.046) and
  0.295 (0.134) in col. 1, 0.501 (0.063) and 0.749 (0.326) in col. 2, 0.233 (0.019) and 0.267 (0.165)
  in col. 3, and 0.238 (0.103) and -0.766 (0.231) in col. 4.
  ††
   These tests are for the hypothesis that the coefficients on log(1-τc) and log(1-τp) are of equal
  magnitude with opposite signs.

Notes to Table 1: Variables in the regressions are 20-year differences. Sample periods are
1978-2013. Standard errors, shown in parentheses, are calculated from the Newey-West method
with 20-year bandwidths. Dependent variables are Col. 1: C-corporate share of business net
capital stocks (Figure 5), Col. 2: C-corporate share of business equity or book value (Figure 6),
Col. 3: C-corporate share of business gross assets (Figure 7), and Col. 4: C-corporate share of
business positive net income (Figure 8). The shares are calculated relative to business totals that
comprise C-corporations, S-corporations, and partnerships (including LLCs), but excluding sole
proprietorships. (Data on sole proprietor amounts are available only for business net income.)
The top federal tax rate on C-corporate profits, 𝜏𝜏𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 , and the federal AMTR for dividends, 𝜏𝜏𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 ,
are in Figures 1 and 2. The pass-through federal tax rate, 𝜏𝜏𝑝𝑝 , is gauged by the federal AMTR for
Schedule E income (exclusive of rents, royalties, and estates & trusts) and is in Figure 3. The tax
variables enter, as in equation (2), as log(1-𝜏𝜏𝑐𝑐 ) =log(1-𝜏𝜏𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 )+log(1-𝜏𝜏𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 ) and log(1-𝜏𝜏𝑝𝑝 ). The
constants indicate trend rates of change per year for the underlying level variables. The break
points of 1989 and 1997 correspond to key historical legal events involving the role of LLCs (see
the text). The first p-value is for a test that the coefficients on log(1-𝜏𝜏𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 ) and log(1-𝜏𝜏𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 ) are
equal—the estimated coefficients shown impose this restriction. The second p-value is for a test
that the sum of the coefficients on log(1-𝜏𝜏𝑐𝑐 ) and log(1-𝜏𝜏𝑝𝑝 ) add to zero. These restrictions are
implied by the model.

Notes to Table 2: The analysis applies to the model discussed in Section IV of the text. The
baseline specification assumes the parameter values σc=σp=0.5 and ρ=0.25, where σc and σp are
the standard deviations for the log-normal distributions of, respectively, corporate and pass-
through productivity and ρ is the correlation coefficient between the random variables. The
results in Part I for 1958 and 2013 give the values of the respective mean parameters, μc and μp,
for which the calibrated model delivers the overall TFP and corporate share of economic activity
(net capital stock) that are shown, given the observed tax wedge, τ. The other results in Part I are
comparable but correspond to four alternative specifications: σc=σp=0.25, ρ=0.25; σc=0.25,
σp=0.5, ρ=0.25; σc=0.5, σp=0.25, ρ=0.25; and σc=σp=0.5, ρ=0.5.
Parts II-IV give results for counter-factual situations where σc-σp, τ, or both are held fixed in
2013 at their values in 1958.

                 Derivation of Expectations of Corporate and Pass-Through Output


         We start with the derivation of equation (3), which gives the conditional expectation of

corporate output, Yc. The setup is that log(Yc) and log(Yp) are bivariate normal with respective

means and standard deviations of μc, σc, μp, and σp. The correlation coefficient between the two
                                                                                                𝑌𝑌
random variables is ρ. This specification implies that 𝑦𝑦 ≡ 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐 ) is distributed normally with
                                                                                                 𝑝𝑝

         The distribution of log(Yc), conditional on y, is normal with respective mean and standard

          𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃. (𝑦𝑦 ≥ τ) ∙ 𝐸𝐸(𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐 |y ≥ τ) = 𝜎𝜎√2𝜋𝜋 ∫𝜏𝜏 exp(𝜇𝜇�𝑐𝑐 + 0.5 ∙ 𝜎𝜎�𝑐𝑐2 ) ∙ exp[                             ]𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑.
                                                                                                                 2𝜎𝜎2

Using the expressions for 𝜇𝜇�c and 𝜎𝜎�𝑐𝑐2 , the result can be written as:
                                                      exp�𝜇𝜇𝑐𝑐 +0.5𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐2 �      ∞         −1
     𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃. (𝑦𝑦 ≥ τ) ∙ 𝐸𝐸(𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐 |y ≥ τ) =                 𝜎𝜎√2𝜋𝜋
                                                                              ∫𝜏𝜏 exp[(2𝜎𝜎2 ) ∙ [y − μ − 𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐 (𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐 − 𝜌𝜌𝜎𝜎𝑝𝑝 )]2 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑.

Finally, using the change of variable z=�𝑦𝑦 − 𝜇𝜇 − 𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐 �𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐 − 𝜌𝜌𝜎𝜎𝑝𝑝 ��/𝜎𝜎, the lower limit of integration

                   1
becomes 𝜏𝜏 ′ = �𝜎𝜎� ∙ [𝜏𝜏 − μ − 𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐 �𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐 − 𝜌𝜌𝜎𝜎𝑝𝑝 �]. We then get equation (4):

                  𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃. (𝑦𝑦 ≥ 𝜏𝜏) ∙ 𝐸𝐸(𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐 |𝑦𝑦 ≥ 𝜏𝜏) = [exp(𝜇𝜇𝑐𝑐 + 0.5𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐2 )] ∙ [1 − 𝛷𝛷(𝜏𝜏 ′ )],

where 𝛷𝛷(∙) is the cumulative standard normal density. We can also replace 1 − 𝛷𝛷(𝜏𝜏 ′ )

by 𝛷𝛷(−𝜏𝜏 ′ ).




                                                                           56
         The result for pass-through output, 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃. (𝑦𝑦 < 𝜏𝜏) ∙ 𝐸𝐸�𝑌𝑌𝑝𝑝 �𝑦𝑦 < 𝜏𝜏�, is analogous, with the

parameters for c and p switched (including that μ is now μp-μc) and τ replaced by -τ in the

expression for 𝜏𝜏 ′ .
