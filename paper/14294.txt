                                              ABSTRACT

Despite housing's importance to the economy and worries about recent financial and economic turmoil
traceable to housing market difficulties, little has been written on how distress in the housing market,
measured by foreclosures, affects home prices, or how these variables interact with other macroeconomic
or housing variables such as employment, housing permits or sales. Employing a panel VAR model
to examine quarterly state-level data, our paper is the first to systematically analyze these interactions.
There is substantial regional variation across states, which facilitates our ability to identify linkages
among variables. Importantly, price-foreclosure linkages work in both directions; foreclosures have
a significant, negative effect on home prices, while an increase in prices alleviates distress by lowering
foreclosures. Similarly, employment and foreclosures have mutually negative effects on each other.
The impact of foreclosures on prices, while negative and significant, is quite small in magnitude. We
demonstrate this by simulating house price changes in response to extreme foreclosure shocks. Even
under extremely pessimistic scenarios for foreclosure shocks, average U.S. house prices, as measured
by the comprehensive OFHEO house price index (which we argue is the most reliable and useful measure
of house prices to use for our purposes), likely would decline only slightly or remain essentially flat
in response to foreclosures like those predicted for the 2008-2009 period. This suggests that home
prices are quite sticky, and that fears of a major fall in house prices, with all of its attendant negative
macroeconomic consequences, typically are not warranted even in extreme foreclosure circumstances.

I. Introduction

       Midway through 2008, the US housing market was widely regarded to be in a

state of crisis. Housing permits had been in a steady and deep decline since 2006 (a year

prior to the outbreak of the subprime credit collapse). The collapse in the values of

subprime mortgages, which began in the middle of 2007, brought with it a substantial

increase in foreclosures, and unusually large declines in house prices in some states –

especially in Arizona, California, Florida, Michigan, Ohio, and Nevada. Widespread

loose mortgage credit – as exemplified by the infamous “liar” mortgages of the 2005,

2006 and 2007 cohorts – was reflected in unprecedented default and foreclosure rates for

those cohorts of mortgage originations. After the bursting of the subprime “bubble,”

many analysts feared that rising foreclosure rates would lead to deep and widespread

house price declines.

       In addition to the obvious difficulties that price declines and foreclosures create

for homeowners and participants in the housing industry, housing has been shown to have

a major impact on the economy (Leamer, 2007, Green, 1997, Coulson and Kim, 2000,

Gauger and Snyder, 2003). Indeed, Leamer (2007) titles his study “Housing IS the

Business Cycle,” to illustrate the importance that the housing sector has in U.S. income

fluctuations. Gauger and Snyder (2003) find that, while always important, the impact of

housing on the economy has become more pronounced in recent decades.

       Figure 1 illustrates the possible cause for concern about house price declines in

the wake of widespread foreclosures. Using data for the 2007 year as a whole, regressing

price change at the state level on foreclosures growth at the state level (where we use the

OFHEO sale and refinancing index to measure price, and the Mortgage Bankers




                                             1
Association quarterly delinquency surveys to measure outstanding foreclosures relative to

mortgages), we find a close fit between the two series (an R-squared of 0.72). Of course,

Figure 1’s description of the low-frequency association between price change and

foreclosures growth says nothing about the causal relationships between prices and

foreclosures, and should not be interpreted as providing an estimate of the response of

prices to foreclosure shocks. This regression line reflects a combination of three

influences: (1) the responses of prices to foreclosure shocks, (2) the responses of

foreclosures to price shocks, and (3) the responses of both foreclosures and prices to

shocks originating in other variables.

       We focus our attention in this paper on measuring the size of the effect that

shocks to housing market distress (foreclosures) have on house prices. To our knowledge,

ours is the first paper to estimate the impact of foreclosures on house prices for the U.S.

as a whole, and the first to investigate that question within a dynamic model of housing

market conditions and the local economy. To estimate the impact of foreclosures on

house prices, we develop a dynamic model of the housing market at the state level, which

is capable of disentangling the various contributing influences that explain the low-

frequency association between foreclosures and price changes, and thus allowing us to

gauge the potential housing-price and macroeconomic consequences of continuing

mortgage distress.

       Modeling the housing market at the state level is helpful for improving empirical

identification. Quarterly data on the main housing variables of interest exist for each state

going back to 1981. Although there have been only three nationwide housing cycles

since the 1980s, there have been numerous state- or regional-level cycles, which often




                                              2
have entailed significant price growth decline and foreclosures. Furthermore, even within

a given national economic cycle there is wide variation across states in employment

growth, net migration, and other factors that can affect local housing markets. As a

result, there is substantial variation in housing market experiences across states, which

can be useful for identifying empirical linkages among variables.

        Our paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews the existing literature on the

relationships among home prices, foreclosures and other housing and economic variables.

Section III presents the results of our estimation model, in which we find a negative,

significant effect of foreclosures on prices. The magnitude of this effect, however, is

small. This suggests that house prices are quite sticky even in the face of high financial

distress. In order to quantify this result in an intuitive way, Section IV develops two-

year, out-of-sample forecasts for house prices − for individual states and for the US as a

whole − using the model developed in Section III and state-level forecasts of foreclosures

for the 2008-2009 period kindly provided by Economy.com. We find that even in

response to an extreme shock in foreclosures in excess of those predicted for this period,

average U.S. home price declines would be relatively small. This suggests that home

prices are quite sticky and that fears of a major fall in house prices, with all of its

attendant negative macroeconomic consequences, typically are not justified even in the

face of extreme foreclosure shocks. Section V discusses differences in the meaning of

housing price indices, and their relative desirability for our purposes. Section VI

concludes. A detailed description of our data and a discussion of some technical aspects

of our methodology can be found in the appendix.

II. Literature Review

          Leamer (2007) notes that no macroeconomics textbook contains any lengthy

treatment of real estate, despite its role as a leading indicator of business cycle conditions.

Instead, academic studies tend to focus on aspects of the housing market and the broader

economy in isolation from each other, such as examining the interaction of house prices

and home sales, but nothing else. Despite the importance of housing to the economy,

little has been written about the interaction between prices and foreclosures at the

aggregate level, and to our knowledge nothing has been written that links prices and

foreclosures dynamically within the broader context of the macroeconomic environment

and other conditions in the housing market. This is an important omission when one

considers that the impact of financial liquidation on measures of prices and output in the

economy is sometimes quite large, as indicated, for example, by Anari, Kolari and Mason

(2005).

          Within the real estate literature, some studies have found important

interdependencies among various market indicators. DiPasquale and Wheaton (1994)

examine the impact of such variables as changes in land value, and financing and

construction costs on housing starts. Coulson and Richard (1996) investigate the impact

of severe weather events, such as extreme heat or precipitation, on starts and find an

effect, although only in the north central region of the U.S. Coulson (1999) examines the

time series properties of housing starts and completions, and finds that the two variables

are cointegrated. Moreover, the author finds that completions are not much affected by

factors such as materials costs, income, interest rates, or housing prices. This finding is




                                               4
supportive of the idea that once a housing start occurs, completion is a nearly foregone

conclusion.

       Several papers have examined the relationship between home prices and other

variables. Clayton, Miller and Peng (2008) find that home prices and turnover in the

home market predict each other, but that most of the positive co-movement between the

two variables is caused by responses to common financial, labor market and mortgage

shocks. Wheaton and Nechayev (2008) forecast home prices with population, income

and interest rate regressors. The authors find that current fundamentals substantially

under-predict the recent run-up in home prices. Neither paper examines the effect of

financial distress on price movements.

       Some papers have examined the effect of housing on aggregate economic activity

as measured by GDP. Green (1997) examines residential investment and GDP, and finds

the former Granger-causes the latter. Coulson and Kim (2000) find that residential

investment shocks are important in predicting consumption and GDP growth. Gauger and

Snyder (2003) use a vector error-correction (VECM) model and find, as did Green

(1997), that residential investment has a positive impact on GDP. Leamer (2007)

performs a series of estimations and historical decompositions and finds that residential

investment is the best predictor of future recessions in the U.S.

       There have been several papers measuring the effect of prices and sales volume

on each other. Clayton, Miller and Peng (2008) find that sales and prices have mutually

positive effects on each other. The authors find that most of the positive correlation can

be explained by co-movement of prices and sales in response to other variables.

Wheaton and Lee (2008), on the other hand, find that price increases predict lower sales,




                                             5
which is in keeping with standard demand-side stories and contradicts the results of

Clayton, Miller and Peng (2008), as well as some models of loss aversion and down

payment constraints which had been advanced to explain the positive sales-price

correlation.

       Little has been written about the empirical relationships between foreclosures, or

other measures of financial distress, and home prices at the macro-level, although some

have examined how price volatility may affect the probability of default (Foster and Van

Order, 1984).

       Recently, a number of studies have used micro data to assess the interaction of

foreclosures and prices. Willen, Gerardi and Shapiro (2008), using data from

Massachusetts, find that the recent decrease in prices was a major catalyst in pushing sub-

prime borrowers into foreclosure. Examining the opposite direction of causality, Lin,

Rosenblatt and Yao (2008) use a random sample of about twenty percent of all U.S.

mortgages, including only those which are conforming, and find that there is a clear

negative impact of foreclosures on prices of local homes. However, this effect is much

larger during a housing downturn than during a boom, indicating the importance of the

state of the housing cycle for the effects of foreclosures. Leonard and Murdoch (2008)

investigate foreclosures in the greater Dallas area, and similarly uncover a negative effect

of distress on prices, which diminishes as distance from the foreclosed property grows.

Finally, Rogers and Winter (2008) examine foreclosures in St. Louis county. They find

the expected negative impact. Interestingly, they also find that the marginal impact of

additional foreclosures actually falls as foreclosures increase, which contradicts the

proposition that rising foreclosures may have a rising marginal effect on prices.




                                             6
         Despite the recent increased interest in modeling the relationship between prices

and foreclosures, illustrated by these papers, our study is the first of which we are aware

to systematically investigate the interaction of financial distress, housing market

conditions and the local economy.



III. A Quarterly Panel VAR Model of the State-Level Housing Market, 1981-2007

         We model home prices and foreclosures at the state level, using quarterly data

since 1981, and treat the growth of home prices and the foreclosure rate as part of a five-

variable system of equations, which also includes the growth rates of employment,

single-family permits, and existing home sales. We employ a panel vector autoregressive

model (PVAR), which captures dynamic linkages among all the five variables, which are

all treated as mutually endogenous.

         The variables are defined as follows: the log difference of seasonally-adjusted

total non-farm employment, the log difference of seasonally-adjusted existing home

sales, the log difference of seasonally-adjusted single-family housing permits, the log

difference of the OFHEO home price index (inclusive of same-home sales and

refinancings; below, we also discuss results when we employ the purchase-only index),1

and the log of the ratio of outstanding foreclosures relative to total mortgages (based on

Mortgage Bankers Association surveys). A detailed description of each of the variables

used in our analysis can be found in the appendix.

         We also ran the model defining foreclosures as the log difference of the ratio of

foreclosures relative to total mortgages, which produced very similar results. We report

1
  As we discuss in more detail below, we believe that including refinancings when measuring price change
is desirable, because it reduces any bias arising from variation in the types of homes that sell over different
phases of the housing cycle.


                                                       7
results using the log foreclosure ratio because doing so seems to better capture the effects

of cumulative financial distress on house prices, as we explain further below.

        All data run from 1981 through the first quarter of 2008. Due to the forward

(Helmert) de-meaning of observations used to control for state fixed effects, we lose the

last observation, and thus our useable sample runs through the fourth quarter of 2007.2

After some experimentation with different lag lengths, we found that eight quarterly lags

encompassed quite well all the significant dynamic relationships among these five

variables. The PVAR regression results are shown in Table 1.

        In order to generate impulse responses and variance decompositions, one must

identify the sources of covariance among the residuals in each of the five equations. We

follow the existing PVAR literature by employing the Choleski decomposition, which

models the residuals matrix as a recursive, triangular system. The main advantage of that

approach is its simplicity: one selects an ordering of variables that posits the degree of

within-quarter endogeneity among each of the five endogenous variables.

        We experimented with various possible orderings among the five variables and

found that our key results regarding the relationship between home prices and

foreclosures were robust to the orderings chosen. We report only one ordering:

employment, sales, permits, prices, foreclosures. Employment appears first in our

ordering, since we assume that any correlations between within-quarter innovations in

employment and the within-quarter innovations in our four housing-sector variables

reflect the role of employment as a source of disturbance (both with respect to the labor

market and as a general macroeconomic barometer).


2
 We follow Love and Ziccino (2006) in our methodology for Helmert de-meaning. This process was first
proposed by Arellano and Bover (1995).


                                                  8
       Foreclosures are placed at the end of our ordering because foreclosure reflects the

strategic decisions of borrowers and lenders; thus we think it is appropriate to allow

foreclosure decisions to respond to other variables within the quarter. We place price

changes second to last in our system. Within-quarter price shocks are not strongly

correlated with foreclosure shocks (the correlation is -0.095, as shown in Table 2);

allowing prices to follow the other three variables and precede foreclosures maximizes

the extent to which contemporaneous price changes can reflect other influences within

the quarter, while still allowing within-quarter foreclosures to respond to all other

variables’ changes within the quarter. Allowing prices to come late in the ordering

seemed appropriate given that a primary objective of our study is to bound the potential

downward movements in home prices resulting from other shocks. If, alternatively, we

place prices at the end of the ordering, with foreclosures immediately before, our results

are similar to those reported below.

       The impulse responses (Figure 2) of the five endogenous variables to

orthogonalized shocks that are identified by the recursive orthogonalization do not

impose clear structural identifying restrictions. Still, it can be possible to connect

observed impulse responses to structural influences in an intuitive way, based on the

combination of observed patterns of response. For example, if a housing sales shock is

associated with rising initial impulse responses for prices and permits, as in our study,

that could be viewed as reflecting housing market demand-side influences. In the same

way, if a housing price shock is associated with positive sales and permits impulse

responses, as in our study, that too could be viewed as indicative of housing market

demand-side influences.




                                               9
        Our impulse responses display a number of reassuring and robust tendencies: in

particular, foreclosure shocks (increases in the quarterly log foreclosure rate that are

unforecastable on the basis of lagged values of the five variables and contemporaneous

values of the other four variables) predict declining employment and declining prices.

Foreclosure shocks, however, are associated with increases in sales and permits. These

impulse responses are somewhat puzzling, and may reflect the fact that foreclosure

shocks are more likely to occur late in the down phase of a housing cycle.

        The variance decompositions (Table 3) gauge the importance of shocks

originating in the five endogenous variables for each of the five variables. For the most

part, the variables do not contribute importantly to each other’s forecast variance,

however, there are exceptions: sales and permits shocks are important for employment

growth, employment shocks are important for foreclosures, and foreclosure shocks are

important for all other variables, especially prices (foreclosure shocks explain 26 percent

of the 20-quarter forecast variance of house price growth).



IV. Bounding the Effects of Foreclosures on House Price Decline

        In order to better illustrate and quantify the relationship between prices and

foreclosures, we use the dynamic, quarterly, state-level model developed in Section III to

generate out-of-sample forecasts of housing price changes, by state and for the country as

a whole, for 2008 and 2009 (eight quarters beyond the end of our estimation sample).3 As

Figure 3 shows, there is substantial variation across states in each of the variables in our



3
 As noted above, our model is estimated using data through the end of 2007Q4. In our simulations we use
actual 2008Q1 values (which are not in our estimation sample because of forward Helmert de-meaning)
and then forecast future values through the end of 2009.


                                                  10
model, which confirms the importance of taking account of state-level differences when

forecasting price changes.

       One approach to forecasting price changes would assume a zero-shock scenario

for all five variables and derive implied housing prices using that scenario. We label this

the “baseline” scenario. That scenario would be reasonable if one had no basis for

believing that any of the five variables was likely to experience shocks going forward.

Because our model is derived for de-meaned variables, we must add back the forecasted

long-term mean to our simulated impulse responses in order to derive forward-looking

estimates of the variables in our system; we assume that the forward-looking means are

equal to the historical sample means of the variables.

       In our PVAR model, any anticipated shocks (based on knowledge not captured by

the lagged variables in the model) that are expected to occur in 2008 and 2009 should be

incorporated into the simulation exercise for that period. Given the change to much looser

lending standards over the past decade − the credit extended with little or no

documentation, and the spreading use of sub-prime and so-called Alt-A loans − there are

legitimate reasons to believe that foreclosures could spike upwards substantially, and in

excess of levels that would be forecast based on historical experience.

       Thus, the current “foreclosure crisis” provides a natural experiment for analyzing

the broader relationship between foreclosures and home prices. We incorporate estimates

of these exogenous foreclosure shocks and allow our model to take into account feedback

effects from these shocks on the other variables in our five-variable system. To take into

account foreclosure shocks beyond those predicted by our model, we employ Mark

Zandi’s “Economy.com” forecasts for quarterly foreclosures at the state level, which



                                            11
were kindly provided to us by him.4 Note that because foreclosures appear last in the

PVAR ordering, foreclosure shocks only affect the other variables with a lag.5 After one

quarter, all variables in the system are affected by foreclosure shocks, and in subsequent

quarters, via the various channels that connect the five variables in our model.

         In our simulations, we do not incorporate shocks to the other four variables in our

system. We do this for two reasons. First, and most importantly, the primary purpose of

our paper is to isolate and highlight the impact that foreclosures have on home prices. As

a result, including additional shocks to sales or permits, for instance, would be counter

productive to this goal.

         Second, from a pure contemporaneous forecasting perspective, we do not believe

that there is a reasonable basis for assuming adverse shocks to employment, permits and

home sales (that is, declines beyond what would be forecast from the data for 2006 and

2007). In our view, recent macroeconomic trends suggest that employment may be flat

or improve in 2008-2009. Judging from a longer-term perspective based on previous

housing cycles (that is, adding information about the housing cycle not already captured

by our PVAR model in growth rates), it appears that permits have likely bottomed out,

having fallen for six quarters by a much larger amount than in previous housing cycles.

On similar grounds, it would also be difficult to argue for anticipated negative house

sales shocks going forward. Figure 4, Panel A, displays the long-term cyclical patterns of

housing permits and sales for the nation as a whole since 1980. Figure 4, Panel B, reports

residential construction relative to GDP, which is available for a much longer time frame.

4
  We were provided forecasts of the seasonally-adjusted foreclosure start rate. We used these data to
predict the log levels of the outstanding foreclosure rate. Details of this process are discussed in the
appendix.
5
  As noted above, we did run our simulations using an ordering in which foreclosures appeared before
prices and obtained virtually identical results to those reported here.


                                                     12
These graphs show that, from the standpoint of the typical longer-term reversion of the

growth of sales, permits, and residential construction, there is probably more reason to

expect positive shocks (from the perspective of our PVAR model) in sales and permits

than continuing negative shocks.

       Although we only report the results of one version of our model here – which

defines foreclosures as the log foreclosure ratio, uses the comprehensive OFHEO all-

transactions price index, and begins the estimation period in 1981 – we also experimented

with seven other versions of the model (which are available from the authors upon

request). The eight versions we ran varied according to the definition of foreclosures (log

ratio vs. log difference of the ratio), the definition of house prices (log difference of the

OFHEO all-transactions index vs. log difference of the OFHEO purchase-only index),

and the starting date chosen (1981 vs. 1988).

       Table 4 reports the cumulative simulated average US house price change from the

second quarter of 2007 through the end of 2009 for each of the versions of the model,

using the Economy.com implied foreclosure forecasts as shocks in the simulations. As

Table 4 shows, the model that employs the comprehensive OFHEO all-transactions

index, defines foreclosures as the log ratio, and begins the sample period in 1981 is the

only model that results in a cumulative average price decline from 2007 to 2009 (-2.1

percent).

       There are two reasons to prefer this model to the others. First, as we discuss

further below, using the foreclosure ratio, rather than growth rate, appears to allow us to

capture important nonlinear effects. Second, given that the thrust of our findings is the

limited effects of foreclosure shocks on house prices, it seems desirable to be




                                              13
conservative by choosing the model that implies the largest price impact of foreclosure

shocks.

          One possible concern about the simulation results reported in Table 4 is that they

are based on a linear model of the relationship between foreclosure growth and housing

price change. The impact of foreclosures on prices may reflect nonlinear (or threshold)

effects (that is, a rise in foreclosures when foreclosure rates are high may have a bigger

effect on prices than a rise in foreclosures when foreclosure rates are low). This is a

significant concern for our simulation, since the average foreclosure shock implied by the

Economy.com forecasts for the 2008-2009 period raises the log of the foreclosure ratio

by 0.22.

          While we cannot incorporate nonlinearities into our PVAR model directly, we can

estimate the model’s house price equation on a stand-alone basis as a function of all of

the variables already in our model plus the square of foreclosure growth for each of the

eight lags of foreclosures included in the model, compare the effects of foreclosure

shocks on prices in this quadratic form with the linear form already estimated (see the

notes to Table 5 for a detailed description), and make adjustments to our simulated

shocks as implied by the differences between the linear and nonlinear model.

          Table 5 reports the total effects at each lag of foreclosures on prices from the

price equation, measured as the sum of linear and quadratic coefficients at each lag for

the two foreclosure variables, evaluated at the mean of each state’s projected foreclosure

rate for 2008-2009, using the foreclosure-shock scenario. These total effects are also

graphed in Figure 5. This provides a comparison of the impact of foreclosure growth on

price growth (excluding the feedback effects that would be present in the full PVAR




                                               14
model) for the quadratic and linear functional forms. We emphasize that because this

stand-alone regression (unlike our PVAR model) does not allow feedback effects among

the variables in the system, it only provides a rough gauge of the differences in impact of

foreclosure shocks on prices under linear and nonlinear specifications.

         As Table 5 shows, the overall cumulative effects of the two functional forms are

quite different; the quadratic version implies a 53 percent larger cumulative price decline

from a foreclosure shock than the linear version. We interpret this to mean that taking

into account nonlinear functional forms would produce greater simulated price declines

than suggested by our linear model. To adjust for this nonlinear effect, we increase the

Economy.com foreclosure forecasts by 53 percent. In our tables and figures we describe

simulations derived from this assumed path of foreclosures as the “Foreclosure Shock”

scenario.

         We also construct an “extreme-shock” scenario, which raises the Economy.com

foreclosure projections by 75 percent rather than 53 percent. We regard this as a highly-

conservative scenario, since it implies actual foreclosure rates substantially greater than

those that have been forecast by informed market participants, even after taking into

account the effects of nonlinearity.

         The predicted paths of foreclosures and prices, expressed both in growth rates and

in levels, for the baseline, foreclosure-shock, and extreme-shock scenarios are presented

graphically in Figure 6 for selected states and for the country as a whole.6 The predicted

paths of house prices vary by state significantly, which reflects differences both in states’

  Because our forecasts are state-level forecasts, the nationwide figures are the weighted-averages of the
individual states, where weighting is based on the estimated number of housing units in each state (derived
from annual estimates by the Bureau of the Census); in these calculations, Alaska and New Hampshire are
excluded because of missing data for these states.


                                                    15
experiences in recent years and their expected foreclosure shocks. Overall, none of the

three scenarios predicts a severe decline in price for the nation as a whole. U.S. housing

prices peak during our sample in the second quarter of 2007. The cumulative expected

U.S. price changes between this peak and the end of 2009 under the three scenarios are

-0.44 percent, -4.67 percent, and -5.47 percent, respectively.

       As Figure 7 shows, even under the extreme-shock scenario, not only is the

average price decline likely to be low for the country as a whole, but few states are

projected to experience significant declines. Only twelve states are projected to

experience cumulative declines from 2007Q2-2009Q4 of 6 percent or more – in order of

severity according to projected decline: Nevada, Florida, California, Arizona, Michigan,

Rhode Island, Minnesota, Virginia, Massachusetts, Maryland, Hawaii and Indiana.

       Why are housing prices so robust in the face of large foreclosure shocks? Our

interpretation of these results is that foreclosure shocks do not have as large an effect on

housing prices as simple graphs (such as Figure 1 above) might suggest. Furthermore,

housing price growth is strongly mean reverting over the cycle, reflecting all the other

dynamic interrelationships captured by our model. For example, it may not be surprising

that shocks that have already produced one and a half years of low housing starts (which

has substantially reduced the pipeline of supply for housing) might help to limit the

extent of housing price decline going forward.

       We conclude that the effects of foreclosure shocks on prices may be much smaller

than people have supposed. Even in the face of an extreme foreclosure wave such as that




                                             16
experienced in 2007, our evidence indicates that foreclosure shocks have relatively small

effects on U.S. house prices.7

         Our PVAR model estimates the effect of foreclosure shocks on prices by

imposing the restriction that all states have similar vector autoregressive systems relating

the five endogenous variables dynamically. We also investigated how our conclusions

would differ if instead of imposing that restriction we estimated the relationships among

the five endogenous variables separately for each state. Specifically, using quarterly data

since 1981, and assuming eight quarterly lags for the five variables in our system, we

estimated separate VAR models for each of the states. We then calculated impulse

response functions from these VAR models, including impulse responses that examined

the price consequences of foreclosure shocks.

         We regard these alternative estimates as relatively unreliable, since the small

number of observations relative to estimated parameters results in little statistical power

for state-specific VAR estimates. In fact, the estimated cumulative impulse responses of

foreclosures on prices was positive for 16 of the 49 states for which we were able to

calculate state-level VAR estimates, including several states with the most severe

foreclosure shocks such as Florida, Michigan and Ohio. Even so, our conclusion that

foreclosure shocks have small price consequences is fairly robust to this alternative

approach, with average U.S. price declines of only 4.5 percent between 2007Q2 and

2009Q4 under our baseline scenario.8


7
  We also note that one disaggregated study of home price decline (OFHEO 2007b) found no evidence that,
on average, neighborhoods with high foreclosure rates suffered greater price declines, ceteris paribus.
8
  In the state-by-state analysis, the baseline scenario is the only reliable and directly comparable forecasting
scenario. Given that 16 of the states had a positive cumulative price response to a foreclosure shock and
another 15 had responses that were smaller in magnitude than our PVAR estimates, incorporating
foreclosure shocks would likely raise prices compared to our baseline scenario. Furthermore, it is not clear
how to consistently adjust for possible nonlinearities in the state-by-state models.


                                                      17
       It is worth emphasizing that the unprecedented levels of foreclosure rates for the

nation as a whole in early 2008 do not undermine the usefulness of our model for gauging

the effects of foreclosures on prices. Because our estimates are derived from a model

estimated at the state level, the domain of foreclosure values in our sample generally

includes current observed levels. Indeed, for many of the states in our sample, the high

2008Q1 foreclosure rate is not very different from previous peaks in that series (see

Figure 3). Moreover, Figure 8 demonstrates that while there are many states for which

recent foreclosure rates are above their own historical experience, most of these do fall

well within the range of foreclosure rates experienced over the panel as a whole (as

shown by the average U.S. data on the right-hand side of the figure). A key advantage of

estimating the foreclosure-price relationship at the state level, rather than using

nationwide time series, is the ability to estimate that relationship using a range of state-

level foreclosure experiences that include levels comparable to or greater than the high

levels currently experienced in many states. Thus, our findings cannot be dismissed as

out-of-sample estimates, despite the unprecedented high foreclosure rate for the country

as a whole.



V. Different Measures of Home Prices

       Our model uses the comprehensive OFHEO sales and refinancings (all-

transactions) index as our measure of house prices in each state in each quarter. Even a

casual observer of data on home price movements in recent quarters will have noticed

that there are several measures reported in the press, they are constructed differently and

that they offer very different pictures of the changes in U.S. home prices. The measured




                                              18
declines in housing prices based on the comprehensive OFHEO index are much smaller

from those of the Case-Shiller index and the median sales price of existing homes, and

differ somewhat from the OFHEO purchase-only index (which excludes refinancings). Is

the comprehensive OFHEO index we employ biased in some way that might affect our

results?

        As we have already noted above, using the comprehensive OFHEO index results

in a stronger price response to foreclosure shocks than using the purchase-only index. We

also believe on a priori grounds that the comprehensive OFHEO index is the least biased

concept of price to employ for the purposes of this study.9

        Conceptually, changes in the median sale price of existing homes (reported by the

National Association of REALTORS®) is far inferior to the other measures, since it does

not control for quality differences in homes over time (which introduces important

potential biases if homes of different quality have a greater or lesser probability of being

sold at different points in the cycle).

        The Case-Shiller index and the OFHEO indices are based on value comparisons

over time for the same house. That is, a house only contributes to the index if and when a

current transaction can be compared to a prior transaction. This avoids the need to try to

control for home characteristics over time using a hedonic pricing model. There is still

selectivity bias present in all the Case-Shiller and OFHEO indices, since the probability

of a home with a given set of characteristics (e.g., lower value, poor condition, distressed

seller, renovated recently) being sold may vary over time. For example, if sellers who sell

early in the cycle are selling because they are being offered prices that are very high

9
  It is noteworthy that central banks (e.g., the Fed and the Bank of Canada) also employ the OFHEO rather
than the Case-Shiller index in their macroeconomic models of the U.S. economy, perhaps for some of the
same reasons we enumerate here.


                                                   19
(higher than fair value), or if sellers that sell late in the cycle (after the boom)

systematically are eager to sell (and so underprice their homes compared to what a buyer

with average patience would demand) that will make home prices appear more volatile

than they actually are. The Case-Shiller and OFHEO purchase-only index potentially

suffer much more from selectivity bias, since using only sales substantially reduces the

number of observations used to construct the index (sales are about one third of the

observations contained in the OFHEO sales and refinancings index, according to OFHEO

2007a).

        The Case-Shiller index suffers from additional problems. Most obviously, it does

not go back as far in time, and it does not cover the entire U.S. market. Leventis (2007)

reports that the Case-Shiller index omits 13 states and has incomplete coverage of

another 29 states. According to the 2006 American Community Survey estimates of the

number of single-family, owner-occupied units in each state, the Case-Shiller national

index entirely misses states with 11.28 percent of the housing stock, has only partial

coverage in states containing 78.58 percent of the housing stock, and has full coverage

for states with only 10.13 percent of the housing stock. Furthermore, the omitted parts of

the U.S. market seem to be doing better than the included parts. As Figure 9 shows (see

also Calomiris 2007), the omitted or incompletely covered regions have had a different

and more positive experience from the complete coverage regions, according to the

OFHEO data (which are similar in coverage across regions).

        It is also worth considering how the Case-Shiller and OFHEO indexes differ from

the perspective of the macroeconomic relevance of the indexes. Some market

commentators argue for using the Case-Shiller measure rather than the OFHEO measure




                                               20
on the grounds that Case-Shiller includes more houses actually undergoing foreclosure

(since it includes homes financed by subprime mortgages). According to this argument,

excluding subprime mortgages leads to too optimistic a view of home price change.

         This argument, however, confuses the observed price changes of houses placed on

the market with changes in the housing wealth of consumers. Subprime borrowers

typically invested very little wealth in their homes; thus, housing price decline related to

subprime homes contributes little to housing wealth loss of consumers. The fact that a

foreclosure results in a “fire sale” of a subprime house, per se, may have little effect on

housing wealth of consumers. If, however, foreclosures drive down prices in the market

generally, they could affect the housing wealth of non-subprime homeowners with

substantial wealth invested in their homes. This is the wealth effect that should matter for

consumption.10

         Furthermore, both theoretical and empirical work suggest that the most important

group of homeowners from the standpoint of the elasticity of consumption to home price

change is young homeowners who have invested significant equity in their homes. This

group is better captured by the OFHEO index, which does not include either subprime

borrowers (many of whom have little wealth in their homes), or jumbo borrowers (who

tend to be wealthier, older, and whose consumption should be less affected by borrowing

constraints). The combination of including jumbo mortgages, and value-weighting

homes, implies that the Case-Shiller index attaches substantial weight to the wealthiest

homeowners.

10
   A second argument sometimes made by advocates of employing the Case-Shiller index is that it exhibits
a stronger negative correlation with foreclosures. This fact, however, even if true, is irrelevant from the
standpoint of deciding which house price measure provides a better indicator of the consequences of a
house wealth decline.



                                                    21
        From a theoretical standpoint, Buiter (2008) argues that there should be no house

price wealth effects for consumption in the absence of market imperfections related to

borrowing constraints. This implies that consumption wealth effects related to house

prices should be smaller than wealth effects of non-housing wealth, and should be

relatively large for younger individuals with substantial wealth in their homes (the group

whose house prices are best captured by the OFHEO index).

        As a result, the OFHEO index provides a better indicator of the representative

American homeowner and captures the experience of the vast majority of American

homeowners. Houses with conforming mortgages represent a large share of homes with

mortgages. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, as of 2008Q1, subprime

loans serviced represented 5.54 million of the 45.22 million mortgages serviced. Jumbo

mortgages comprise fewer than 6 million mortgages. Together these facts imply that

roughly three fourths of outstanding mortgages are conforming.11 Perhaps with this in

mind, macroeconomic modelers, including central banks, define house price wealth

effects with respect to the OFHEO index.

        The magnitudes of house wealth effects are controversial, as there have been

mixed results in the empirical literature regarding the existence and magnitude of any

house price wealth effect. A major problem with empirical studies of the wealth effect is

the use of current income, rather than hard-to-measure permanent income, alongside

housing in the consumption equation; the interpretation of the coefficient on housing



11
  Reliable data on the composition of mortgages by type are not readily available. According to OFHEO
(http://www.ofheo.gov/media/pdf/mortmarket1990to2004.pdf), 15 percent of the value of conventional
(non-subprime) mortgage originations from 1990 to 2004 consisted of jumbos. Since jumbos, by definition,
are larger than conforming loans, this implies that jumbo mortgages comprise less than 15 percent of the
number of conventional mortgages originated.


                                                  22
wealth is questionable, since house prices reflect and may serve as a proxy for anticipated

future income of homeowners.

       The functional form of the wealth effect is also controversial. Recent work by

Case, Quigley and Shiller (2005), which employs the OFHEO index to measure

consumption wealth effects of housing, suggests that such an effect does indeed exist, but

that it is asymmetric. The authors find that while an increase in housing prices raises

consumption, a decline has no significant effect. This finding is especially relevant in

light of concerns expressed over current falling house prices and consumption.

       A recent microeconomic study by Gan (2007) criticizes existing empirical studies

of the housing wealth effect in the U.S. (which she argues suffer from poor data

availability) and provides estimates of housing wealth effects on consumption based on

the household behavior of Hong Kong residents (for whom better data are available). She

finds a marginal propensity to consume from household wealth of 1.6 percent, on

average, which is much smaller than the magnitude found in many other studies, and she

finds that the wealth effect is driven entirely by the behavior of young people who

substitute between housing wealth gains and precautionary savings from income. If Gan’s

results generalize to the U.S., they imply that wealthier (older) homeowners have lower

marginal propensities to consume out of their housing wealth, which implies a smaller

prospective consumption decline per dollar of housing wealth decline in the U.S. today

than if the decline in housing wealth were broad-based.

       We performed a simple regression analysis of consumption, in which we

regressed consumption on its own lags as well as the current and past house price index,

and found no significant relationship of house prices, whether the index is defined as the




                                             23
OFHEO or the Case-Shiller. However, in terms of raw correlation, the OFHEO had a

slightly higher correspondence to consumption than the Case-Shiller.

       We conclude from these theoretical and empirical perspectives that, from the

standpoint of a macroeconomic interest in house prices, because the OFHEO index

captures better the variation in wealth of households that are likely to display significant

consumption responses to wealth, it is a better indicator of a possible consumption

response than the Case-Shiller index.

       There is one aspect of the comprehensive OFHEO index which has received

criticism. Since it employs refinancings, about two-thirds of the transactions included in

the comprehensive index measure appraised value rather than sale value. In our view, this

is not obviously an important problem. After all, banks rely on these appraisals to

approve refinancings, often at very high leverage ratios. If appraisals for the purpose of

refinancing were inaccurate, especially when leverage ratios are high, as in the U.S.,

lenders would be placed at significant risk. Furthermore, as shown in Table 4, relying on

the purchase-only index has little effect on our results, and actually reduces simulated

price effects in the wake of high foreclosures. This finding provides no support for the

view that the comprehensive OFHEO index fails to measure price changes in response to

changing market conditions.



VI. Conclusion

       Our study is the first to model the high-frequency dynamic relationships among

house prices, foreclosures, employment, house permits, and house sales. We do so using

a PVAR model at the state level for the United States for the period 1981-2007.




                                             24
       We offer the following summary of our findings:

       (1) It is important to take account of the enormous variation across states, which

facilitates identification of links among variables.

       (2) Foreclosures and prices are closely associated at low frequency, but that

reflects a combination of linkages, not just the effects of foreclosure shocks on prices.

       (3) Our PVAR model is able to identify the dynamic relations among the key

housing market variables and the macroeconomy, taking advantage of the high degree of

variation in the experiences of different states over the past two decades. The identified

relationships make sense, and the variables explain a large amount of each other’s

forecast variance.

       (4) We quantify the relatively small effect foreclosures have on house prices by

combining our PVAR model and Economy.com forecasted foreclosure rates for 2008 and

2009. After considering possible biases relating to nonlinearity in the foreclosure-price

relationship, we conservatively (over-)estimate that the national average price decline for

houses from the 2007:Q2 peak to 2009:Q4 will be roughly 5.5 percent. We conclude that

a reasonable estimate of the future path of U.S. housing market prices is that they will

remain essentially flat, on average, for the next two years, notwithstanding the large

predicted increase in foreclosures.

       (5) We argue that, from a variety of perspectives, the OFHEO comprehensive

measure of price change that we employ is the appropriate index of housing prices for our

purposes. It is important for readers of our study to recognize that our measure of house

price change (the comprehensive OFHEO index) has produced less volatile house price

changes in the past, and has declined much less than the Case-Shiller or median sales




                                             25
indices in recent times. We argue that the comprehensive OFHEO index provides a more

reliable picture of the representative house in each of the states, and a more important

picture of the housing market from the standpoint of consumption wealth effects.

       Needless to say, we do not have a crystal ball. Our estimates are based on

relationships among house prices, foreclosures, and other variables observed in the past.

It is conceivable that unusually tight consumer credit conditions, or other factors, could

weigh on the housing market and produce more price decline than we estimate. Such a

decline, however, would reflect a continuing sales shock, not the impact of foreclosures.

Our estimates provide a useful benchmark. Based on the past experience of the housing

cycle, even when one proverbially bends over backwards to inflate estimated foreclosures

and take account of possible nonlinearities in their effects on house prices, there is no

reasonable basis from past empirical relationships for believing (as many commentators

do) that the housing wealth of consumers has fallen or will fall by a substantial amount.

       * Coefficient significant at the 5% level.
       The variables used in the analysis are as follows:
       • Employment − Growth rate (log difference) of the quarterly average of seasonally-adjusted
            monthly total non-farm employment for the state.
       • Sales − Growth rate (log difference) of the seasonally-adjusted annual rate of existing home sales
            for the state in the quarter.
       • Permits − Growth rate (log difference) of the quarterly average of the seasonally-adjusted number
            of monthly single-family residential building permits for the state.
       • Prices − Growth rate (log difference) of the quarterly OFHEO house price index (all transactions)
            for the state.
       • Foreclosures − Log level of the MBA quarterly foreclosure inventory as a percent of loans serviced
            for the state.
       All regression variables were de-meaned using a Helmert transformation, while the actual values of the
       variables were used as instruments to obtain consistent estimates.

Notes: Eight different versions of the model were run based on the choice of data start point (1981 vs. 1988), price
       data used (OFHEO all-transactions index vs. purchase-only index), and foreclosure variable used (log level
       of the foreclosure rate vs. the log difference of the foreclosure rate). Table entries report the cumulative
       simulated house price changes for the U.S. as a whole between 2007Q2 and 2009Q4 resulting from
       foreclosure rate shocks implied by Economy.com forecasts.

Notes: Cumulative effects are the sum of all the lags, and represent the effect of a mean value (0.22) shock
       that persists for nine periods. These effects are graphed in Figure 5.
       Explanation of Table 5: The entries above were calculated as follows. For the second column
       (Linear Specification), fixed-effect panel regressions of the HPI growth rate on eight lags of all five
       system variables along with contemporaneous values of the four exogenous variables were run. As
       in the text, fixed effects were controlled for by Helmert de-meaning the data, while the actual
       values of the variables were used as instruments to obtain consistent estimates. The column 2
       values are then derived by taking the coefficients for each lag of the log foreclosure rate and
       multiplying them by 0.22, the mean value of the de-meaned log foreclosure rate derived from the
       Economy.Com implied foreclosure forecast. Thus, the table entries represent the total impact on
       the HPI growth rate from a mean value shock in the log level of the foreclosure rate the specified
       number of periods in the past.
       For column 3 (Quadratic Specification), a quadratic term on the log foreclosure rate is included in
       the above panel regression. The values in this column are calculated in a similar fashion, providing
       an estimate of the total price impact (both linear and quadratic) of a mean value shock to the growth
       rate of foreclosures.
       The final column is the percentage difference between the second and third column; a positive
       number indicates that a foreclosure shock has a bigger price impact under a quadratic specification
       than it does with a linear specification.
       Detailed regression results for both the Linear and Quadratic Specifications are available from the
       authors upon request.

Note: Impulse responses are based on growth rates (difference of logs) of all variables in the system except the foreclosure rate, which is modeled as a log level.
The impulse responses are derived using a Cholesky decomposition with the following ordering: employment, sales, permits, prices (HPI), and foreclosure rate.

Note: The variable graphed in this panel is the quarterly log difference of the percent of mortgages in foreclosure; the Entire U.S. forecasts are the weighted
average of the state forecasts, where weighting is based on the estimated housing stock in each state. The Foreclosure Shock scenario is based on Economy.com
forecasts, adjusted for possible non-linear effects. The Extreme Foreclosure Shock scenario assumes foreclosures are 75 percent higher than those in the
Economy.com forecasts.

Note: The variable graphed in this panel is the OFHEO HPI (all transactions index) for each state, renormalized to set 2008q1 = 100; the Entire U.S. forecasts are
the weighted average of the state forecasts, where weighting is based on the estimated housing stock in each state. The Foreclosure Shock scenario is based on
Economy.com forecasts, adjusted for possible non-linear effects. The Extreme Foreclosure Shock scenario assumes foreclosures are 75 percent higher than those
in the Economy.com forecasts.

Notes: The bars show the range of historical foreclosure rate values (1st through 99th percentiles) for each state between 1979 and 2005; the historical mean
       and 75th percentile figures are calculated using this same time frame. The red diamonds show the most recent foreclosure rate for the state. U.S.
       average values are found on the right, and represent the simple average of the states (not the U.S. aggregate figures as reported by the MBA). Note that
       many states with 2008Q1 foreclosure rates outside their own historical experiences are well within the range of the other states within the panel,
       meaning our PVAR simulations are largely in-sample events.

                         Data and Methodology Appendix

Data Sources

Prices Variant 1: OFHEO All-Transactions House Price Indices

       Our primary home price appreciation measure comes from the state-level, all-

transactions house price indices produced by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise

Oversight (OFHEO). We use the 2008Q1 release of these data, which include

observations from 1975Q1 through 2008Q1. We renormalize these indices to set 2008Q1

as the base quarter. All of our regressions measure home price appreciation as the log

difference of these indices, not seasonally adjusted.

Prices Variant 2: OFHEO Purchase Only House Price Indices

       In our robustness checks, we make use of the 2008Q1 release of the OFHEO

purchase-only indices. For regressions requiring observations prior to 1991Q1 (the

beginning point of the purchase-only indices), we join the purchase-only index with the

corresponding all-transactions index (both renormalized to 1991Q1) to provide full

coverage through the entire sample period. The resulting spliced indices are then

normalized to set 2008Q1 as the base quarter. Once again, appreciation is measured as

the log difference of this series, not seasonally adjusted.

Foreclosures: Foreclosure Rate

       Historical values of the foreclosure rate come from the Mortgage Bankers

Association (MBA) Quarterly Delinquency Survey, which provides the number of

mortgage loans in foreclosure as a percent of all loans serviced. These data run from

1979Q1 through 2008Q1 and are not seasonally adjusted.




                                              51
       We use the log level of the foreclosure rate in our primary regression

specifications, although in our robustness checks we also run specifications that use the

log difference of the foreclosure rate.

       In the “Foreclosure Shock” and “Extreme Foreclosure Shock” scenarios,

forecasted values of the foreclosure rate are derived as follows. We obtained state-level

historical (2007Q4 and earlier) and forecasted (2008Q1 and later) values of seasonally-

adjusted foreclosure starts (the percent of mortgages entering into foreclosure during the

quarter) from Economy.com. On a state-by-state basis, we regressed the log level of the

MBA foreclosure rate on four lags of itself and the contemporaneous value and four lags

of the log level of the foreclosure start rate. Using the estimated coefficients from these

regressions and the Economy.com forecasts of the foreclosure start rate, we dynamically

predicted the log level of the foreclosure rate in each state through the end of 2009.

Copies of the regression output for each state and graphs depicting actual and predicted

values from this exercise are available from the authors upon request.

       Note that because forecasts of the foreclosure start rate were not available for

Alaska, we were unable to include Alaska in any of our simulations.

Permits Variant 1: Single-family Residential Building Permits, 1988-2007 Data

       The Bureau of the Census prepares a monthly release of building permits by state

(not seasonally adjusted); these are available back to January 1988. For our 1988-2007

regressions, we seasonally adjusted each monthly state series using the Census X12

program using default settings. We then calculated the quarterly average of these figures.

All of our regressions measure the growth rate of permits as the log difference of these

quarterly averages.



                                             52
Permits Variant 2: Single-family Residential Building Permits, 1981-2007 Data

        Economy.com provided us with monthly, seasonally-adjusted, annualized rate of

single-family building permits by state dating back to January 1980. According to

Economy.com, the original raw data that underlie these series come from the Bureau of

the Census. As noted above, the raw (non-seasonally adjusted monthly figures) are

available from the Bureau of the Census dating to 1988, although these data are

incomplete in that they do not include all permitting offices that are included in the

annual series.12 For observations between 1980 and 1988, Economy.com derived the

monthly values based on the annual data reported by the Bureau of the Census.

        In our primary results, we use the quarterly average of these monthly data as our

measure of permits. All of our regressions measure the growth rate of permits as the log

difference of these quarterly averages. Because permits are zero in some states for some

quarters (most notably the District of Columbia), we added one to each of the quarterly

permit values before taking logs.

Employment: Total Non-farm Employment

        Total non-farm employment by state (not seasonally adjusted) is available from

the Bureau of Labor Statistics dating back to 1960. We seasonally adjusted each monthly

state series using the Census X12 program using default settings.13 We then calculated

the quarterly average of these figures. All of our regressions measure the growth rate of

employment as the log difference of these quarterly averages.




12
   These unadjusted data are also problematic because the permit issuing places included in the series
change over time.
13
   The BLS also provides seasonally-adjusted employment data; these data are only available back to 1990,
however.


                                                   53
Sales: Single-family Existing Home Sales

        The monthly, seasonally-adjusted annual rate of existing, single-family home

sales for each state is available from the National Association of REALTORS®. These

data are available dating back to the beginning of 1981.

        One quarter’s observation was missing for Indiana and three were missing for

Idaho. In order to keep these states in our simulation (the missing quarters occur in 2006,

within our simulation forecast window), we interpolated values based on the growth rates

of existing home sales in neighboring states. Specifically, we assumed that the growth

rate (percentage change from the prior quarter) in Indiana in the missing quarter was

equal to the average growth rate in Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan and Ohio. The missing

value is then calculated as this average growth rate applied to the prior period sales in

Indiana. Similarly, missing values in Idaho are interpolated based on the average sales

growth rate in Montana, Wyoming and Utah.14

        Finally, note that no sales are reported for New Hampshire between 2004Q1 and

2007Q4. As a result, this state was excluded from our analysis.



PVAR Methodology

        Because of the lagged dependent variables inherent in a PVAR model, we follow

Arellano and Bover (1995) and de-mean our variables using Helmert’s transformation:

                               ⎡          1                           ⎤
                    y it* = wi ⎢ y it −      ( y i (t +1) + L + y iT )⎥, t = 1, K , T − 1 ,
                               ⎣        T −t                          ⎦




14
  Washington and Oregon were excluded here because they were deemed to be “Pacific” states rather than
“Mountain” states and thus less comparable for Idaho.


                                                     54
where wt2 = (T − t ) /(T − t + 1) . In other words, each of the first T − 1 observations are

de-meaned using all future observations (with the next-to-last observation demeaned by

the final observation, which is lost from the sample). The weighting wt2 is included to

equalize the variances.

       Consistent parameter estimates then be obtained by using two-stage least squares

on these transformed variables, using the non-transformed values of the variables as

instruments. We performed out estimation in Stata, using a PVAR program provided by

Inessa Love with the World Bank.
