                                          ABSTRACT

This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of portfolios of active mutual funds, ETFs and
hedge funds through the lens of risk (anomaly) factors. We show that that these funds do not
systematically tilt their portfolios towards profitable factors, such as high book-to-market (BM)
ratios, high momentum, small size, high profitability and low investment growth. Strikingly, there
are virtually no high-BM funds in our sample while there are many low-BM ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù funds.
Portfolios of ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù funds are concentrated in low BM-stocks but ‚Äúvalue‚Äù funds hold stocks
across the entire BM spectrum In fact, most ‚Äúvalue‚Äù funds hold a higher proportion of their
portfolios in low-BM (‚Äúgrowth‚Äù) stocks than in high-BM (‚Äúvalue‚Äù) stocks. While there are some
micro/small/mid-cap funds, the vast majority of mutual funds hold very large stocks. But the
distributions of mutual fund momentum, profitability and investment growth are concentrated
around market average with little variation across funds. The characteristics distributions of ETFs
and hedge funds do not differ significantly from the those of mutual funds. We conclude that the
characteristics of mutual fund portfolios raises a number of questions about why funds do not
exploit well-known return premia and how their portfolio choices affects asset prices in
equilibrium.

    1. Introduction

       Since the seminal study by Jensen (1968) the focus of most of the literature on active mutual funds
    has been on the question about their performance and the related issue about whether fund managers
    have skill or not. Some recent examples include Fama and French (2010), Berk and van Binsbergen
    (2015), Cremers and Petajisto (2009), P√°stor, Stambaugh, and Taylor (2015), Kacperczyk, Nieuwerburgh,
    and Veldkamp (2014), and many more. The composition and characteristics of mutual funds portfolios
    have largely been ignored.1 For example, the performance literature focuses on the distribution of
    Jensen‚Äôs ùõº‚Äôs across funds but pays less attention to the distributions of ùõΩ‚Äôs of risk factors.
       The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the cross-section of portfolios of
    active mutual funds through the lens of risk (anomaly) factors.2 Following Fama and French (1992),
    the asset pricing literature has identiÔ¨Åed an ever-growing list of characteristics that are associated with
    return premia (see Harvey, Liu, and Zhu (2016) for a recent overview). According to the three ‚Äúclassic‚Äù
    size, value and momentum anomalies, small stocks, value stocks, and high momentum stocks earn
    return premia relative to large, growth and low momentum stocks. To what extent do active fund
    managers exploit these factor premia? If there are limits to arbitrage, do active funds contribute to the
    existence of these anomalies or do they overweight underpriced stocks? And, more broadly, what set
    of strategies is available to retail investors via active funds? The literature on mutual funds typically
    takes the universe of funds as given. However, the set of funds in existence is an endogenous object
    subject to demand and supply. What are the market forces that determine the set of funds that are
    available to investors?3 This paper takes a Ô¨Årst step in answering these questions by establishing a
    comprehensive set of stylized facts about the characteristics of portfolios of mutual funds, ETFs and,
    to a limited degree, hedge funds.
       We Ô¨Ånd that mutual funds do not systematically exploit return premia of well-known risk/anomaly
    factors. In fact, for some factors mutual funds target the low-return leg of long/short factor portfolios
    rather than the high-return leg. This bias is especially strong for book-to-market (BM) ratios. The BM
    premium is one of the most well-known and robust stylized facts in the asset pricing literature. Yet,
    the BM ratio of mutual funds, ETFs and hedge funds is tilted towards low BM values rather than high
    BM ratios. While there are over 1,000 mutual funds with consistently low BM ratios, there are virtually
    no high-BM funds in our sample. When we analyze fund portfolios in more detail, we Ô¨Ånd that even
    funds with an explicit ‚Äúvalue‚Äù objective hold a larger share of low BM stocks than high-BM stocks in
    their portfolios. This bias is present in other value/growth measure, such as the earnings-to-price and
    dividend-to-price ratios as well as the Morningstar value/growth index. While there are over 100 ‚Äúvalue‚Äù
    ETFs in our sample, very few have consistently high BM-ratios. Instead, ETFs mostly track indices that
    are based on the Morningstar value/growth index that is based not only on price-multiples but also on
    growth rates of fundamentals. Yet, portfolio sorts based on the Morningstar index produce a small

  teristics, in particular the optimal choice of stocks of diÔ¨Äerent size.

  There is an ongoing debate whether the factors are due to risk premia or behavioral biases. We remain agnostic about the
  underlying source of factor premia.

  that are available to investors as given.

    and insigniÔ¨Åcant return spread. We conclude that universe of active mutual funds and ETFs does not
    include high-BM investments. The BM distribution of our limited sample of hedge funds is close to that
    of mutual funds. We also Ô¨Ånds that the majority of mutual funds hold predominantly very large stocks.
    The fund-level distributions of other factor characteristics that are associated with return premia, such
    as momentum, proÔ¨Åtability and investment growth are centered around the CRSP-VW index and exhibit
    little variation across funds. This suggests that funds do not systematically target these characteristics.
    The body of the paper focuses on the presentation of empirical Ô¨Åndings. We return to the implications
    of the results in the conclusion.
        Our analysis focus primarily on holdings of mutual funds instead of factor exposures estimated from
    regressions of fund returns on factor portfolios. There are several reasons why holdings give a more
    accurate description of mutual fund strategies than factor loadings. First, factor loadings are estimated
    and thus subject to estimation error while holdings data is directly observable. Second, loadings might
    vary over time and estimates with historical data might not reÔ¨Çect high-frequency changes in fund
    portfolios. Third, regression loadings are more diÔ¨Écult to interpret than characteristics computed
    from portfolio holdings, as we will show below.
        We use data on fund holdings to construct characteristics of active mutual funds in each quarter that
    a fund is listed. The paper focuses on the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù size, value and momentum characteristics, while the
    appendix includes results on a variety of other characteristics (e.g., investment and proÔ¨Åtability). Fund-
    level characteristics are constructed by appropriately value-weighting the stocks in fund portfolios, e.g.,
    the book-to-market ratio (BM) of a mutual fund is the portfolio-weighted average of the BM ratios of all
    stocks in the fund‚Äôs portfolio. Following Daniel, Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers (1997), we use quintile
    scores based on NYSE breakpoints, so that a stock in quintile ùëó has a score of ùëó.4 The fund score is the
    value-weighted score of all stocks in its portfolio. Hence, a fund that only invests in stocks in the lowest
    BM quintile has a BM score of ‚Äú1‚Äù and a fund that only invests in stocks in the highest BM quintile has a
    BM score of ‚Äú5‚Äù. A score of ‚Äú3‚Äù corresponds to a fund that focuses on stocks in the middle BM quintile.
    In addition to BM, we also compute an alternative measure of value/growth following the methodology
    of the widely-used Morningstar index.5
        We then study the distributions of mutual fund characteristics in several ways. We analyze the
    average univariate distributions of size, value/growth, and momentum as well as joint distribution and
    time-variation in the distribution. We use two methods to frame fund characteristics. First, we use the
    components of the Fama-French factors as natural ‚Äúpseudo-fund‚Äù benchmarks. In other words, we treat
    the ‚ÄúS‚Äù and ‚ÄúB‚Äù components of SMB, ‚ÄúH‚Äù and ‚ÄúL‚Äù components of HML, and ‚ÄúU‚Äù and ‚ÄúD‚Äù of MOM as if there
    were mutual funds and compute their characteristics in the same way as we do for actual mutual funds.
    Hence we can investigate to what extent mutual fund portfolios compare to the Fama-French portfolios
    that have served as benchmarks in the academic literature. Second, we compare the characteristics
    distribution of mutual funds to that of individual stocks.
        We Ô¨Ånd that, except for a relatively small number of small-cap and mid-cap funds, mutual funds
    overwhelmingly hold very large stocks, similar in magnitudes to the CRSP-VW index and ‚ÄúB‚Äù in SMB. The

4
    Our results are robust to alternative characteristic measures. The online appendix includes a variety of robustness checks.

    The Morningstar index (MS) is an average of price-to-fundamental ratios and growth rates of fundamentals, see section 2 for
    details.


                                                                2
    distribution of book-to-market ratios of mutual funds, shown in Figure 1, is more surprising. The Ô¨Ågure,
    described in more detail below, shows the histogram of BM scores for all funds (solid black), ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù
    funds (dashed green) and ‚Äúvalue‚Äù funds (dotted blue).6 The BM ratio of funds is based on quintile scores
    where ‚Äú1‚Äù and ‚Äú5‚Äù corresponds to the extreme low and high BM quintiles, respectively. The vertical lines
    show the BM ratio of the CRSP-VW index and the ‚ÄúL‚Äù and ‚ÄúH‚Äù components of HML. Hence, funds that
    mimic ‚ÄúL‚Äù or ‚ÄúH‚Äù would have a BM scores of 1.27 and 4.6, respectively, while the overall market has a
    BM score of 2.3. The Ô¨Ågure shows that the distribution of mutual funds is heavily tilted towards low BM
    values. 40% of all mutual funds have a BM score between 1 and 2 and a further 51% between 2 and 3. On
    the other hand, 9% of funds have a moderately high BM score between 3 and 4, but only 7 out of 2,657
    funds in our sample have a BM score above 4. In this sense, high BM ‚Äúvalue‚Äù funds are missing from
    the US equity market. To put this diÔ¨Äerently, an investor can easily Ô¨Ånd ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù mutual funds that
    are similar to the ‚ÄúL‚Äù portfolio, but it is virtually impossible to use mutual funds to mimic the ‚Äúvalue‚Äù
    portfolio ‚ÄúH‚Äù. In contrast to the BM distribution of mutual funds, the BM distribution of individual S&P
    500 stocks is much more spread out. 46% of S&P 500 stocks have a BM score above 3 and 18% above 4.

                 Notes: See Figure 3.


        Figure 1 also shows that even ‚Äúvalue‚Äù funds are not necessarily high BM funds. The dotted blue
    histogram shows that the bulk of ‚Äúvalue‚Äù funds have BM scores between 2 and 3.5. In contrast, the
    majority of ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù funds have low BM scores between 1 and 2. Moreover, the BM distribution of hedge
    funds and ETFs is similar to that of mutual funds (with the caveat that our sample of hedge funds is

6
    We classify mutual funds as ‚Äúvalue‚Äù or ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù based on the fund name or on CRSP/Lipper/Wiesenberger style codes, as
    explained in more detail below.


                                                                3
very limited and not representative). These Ô¨Åndings are robust to diÔ¨Äerent measures of ‚Äúvalue‚Äù and
diÔ¨Äerent methodologies for constructing BM rankings.
   In contrast to the asymmetric distribution of BM, the distributions of other characteristics are more
symmetric and clustered around scores of 3. For example, the mean mutual fund has a momentum score
of 3.28, a proÔ¨Åtability score of 3.17 and investment score of 3.08. In each case, few funds have scores
below 2 and above 4. This suggests that funds do not systematically exploit high momentum, high
proÔ¨Åtability or high investment strategies. We estimate the relationship of mutual portfolio holdings
and characteristics more formally using a Probit-model. The estimation results conÔ¨Årm the patterns in
the histograms. One interesting Ô¨Ånding is that stocks with higher Morningstar indices are more likely
to be held by mutual funds than stocks with high book-to-market ratios.
   Next, we study portfolio compositions in more detail and compute the portfolio weights by quintiles
for each mutual fund. The average fund holds 40% of its portfolio in stocks with BM scores between
1 and 2 and only 6% in stocks in the highest BM quintile. Not surprisingly, the portfolios of ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù
funds are even more tilted towards low BM stocks. For example, 95% of all ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù funds hold over
a quarter of their portfolios in low-BM stock. But we Ô¨Ånd that ‚Äúvalue‚Äù funds hold a larger portion of
their portfolio in stocks in the lowest BM quintile (24%) than in stocks in the highest BM quintile (13%).
More than half of all ‚Äúvalue‚Äù funds hold a larger share of low-BM stocks than high-BM stocks, and only
7% hold more than 25% of their portfolio in high-BM stocks. Evidently, ‚Äúvalue‚Äù funds are not high-BM
assets and do not tilt their portfolios towards high-BM value stocks.
   We also study the joint distribution of characteristics as well as the time-variation of fund charac-
teristic scores. For instance, we Ô¨Ånd that unconditionally, there is no link between the BM and MOM
scores of mutual funds but momentum of low-BM funds varies signiÔ¨Åcantly over time while momentum
of higher BM funds is more stable.
   How do portfolio holdings compare to factor loadings, ùõΩ‚Äôs, of mutual funds? On Ô¨Årst glance, loadings
yield a very diÔ¨Äerent picture. For each 15-year window in our sample, we estimate the 4-factor model
for all mutual funds that are listed in that subsample window. The median of mutual fund SMB ùõΩ‚Äôs
distribution is (slightly positive) while the median HML ùõΩ hovers around zero. Hence, at Ô¨Årst glance,
these betas suggest that the median mutual funds is slightly tilted towards small and BM-neutral stocks.
How can this be reconciled with the results based on fund holdings that mutual funds hold very large and
low BM stocks? It turns out that the ùõΩ distributions are misleading without proper framing. We estimate
the SMB and HML ùõΩ‚Äôs of the S, B, H and L portfolios from which SMB and HML are constructed. We show
that ùõΩ‚Äôs estimated in univariate regressions depend on the relative volatilities of the components of the
long/short portfolio. The ùõΩ of the more volatile component is larger (in absolute) value than that of the
less volatile component. In multivariate regressions, the magnitudes of ùõΩ‚Äôs depend on the covariance
structure of all portfolios that make up the long/short factors and are not necessarily centered around
zero. In our sample, ùõΩH,HML = 0.72 and ùõΩL,HML = ‚àí0.28. Hence, an asset with an HML beta of -0.25 is
comparable to ‚ÄúL‚Äù while an asset with an HML beta of +0.25 is comparable to the ‚ÄúBM-neutral‚Äù portfolio
(H+L)/2. Once the distribution of mutual fund betas is framed in the context of HML betas of H and
L, the bias of mutual funds towards low-BM ratios is conÔ¨Årmed. While there are many funds with HML
betas close to L, there are (virtually) no funds with HML betas that are as high H.
   While studying mutual fund performance is not the primary goal of this paper, it is worthwhile to

                                                    4
    ask how mutual fund characteristics relate to their returns. When we compute the average return of
    stocks by characteristic quintiles, the familiar pattern emerges: Small stocks with high BM and MOM
    have higher returns than large stocks with low BM and MOM. We also Ô¨Ånd that the return spread across
    Morningstar quintiles is much smaller than that of BM quintiles, implying that one of the most popular
    measures of ‚Äúvalue/growth‚Äù is not associated with a signiÔ¨Åcant return premium. For all characteristics,
    the spread across quintiles is much smaller for mutual funds than for stocks. For example, the BM return
    spread for stocks is 2.82% per quarter while it is only 0.78% for mutual funds. Mutual fund returns across
    size, momentum and Morningstar quintiles show no pattern at all. Hence, there is no size, value and
    momentum eÔ¨Äect in mutual funds returns and investors in mutual funds are not rewarded for factor
    premia that exist for individual stocks. These results are conÔ¨Årmed in Fama-MacBeth regressions.
        The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the sample and data construction.
    Results about the characteristics distributions of mutual funds, ETFs and hedge funds are presented in
    section 3. Section 4 compares the characteristics distributions derived regression factor loading to those
    of portfolio holdings. Sections 5 and 6 provide additional details of mutual funds portfolios. Results
    about the link between mutual fund characteristics and returns are reported in section 7. Section 8
    concludes.


    2. Data Construction

        The mutual fund and ETF holdings data are from CRSP/Thompson-Reuters. Our sample is 1980Q1
    to 2016Q2 and uses standard screens. We group active mutual funds into three categories based on
    their stated investment objective: ‚ÄúGrowth‚Äù, ‚Äúvalue‚Äù and ‚Äúother‚Äù. We analyze ETFs separately. Unlike
    mutual funds, hedge funds are not required to report their portfolio holdings to the SEC. However,
    every institutional investment manager, including hedge funds, with at least $100 million in equity
    assets under management has to disclose their aggregate equity holdings using form 13F. Since only
    aggregate holdings are reported, it is not possible to obtain holdings data for individual funds for the
    majority of hedge funds. Instead, we manually identify 13F Ô¨Ålings of 114 hedge funds with only a
    single fund under management.7 For this subset of hedge funds, the 13F Ô¨Ålings of portfolio holdings
    correspond to individual funds and are thus comparable to the holdings data of individual mutual funds.
    Given that we can only identify portfolio holdings of hedge funds with only a single individual fund,
    our HF sample is very limited, not representative and biased towards small hedge funds.
        Table 1 reports descriptive statistics of the sample. Our sample of active mutual funds consists of
    2,638 funds, of which 574 are ‚Äúvalue‚Äù funds and 1,130 are ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù funds.8 Furthermore, the sample
    includes 955 ETFs and 114 hedge funds. The number of active mutual funds has grown from 185 in
    1980Q1 to 1,424 in 2016Q2 with a peak of 1,946 in 2008Q3. The number of ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù and ‚Äúvalue‚Äù funds
    has risen from 96 and 7 in 1980Q1 to 564 and 350 in 201Q2, respectively. The median fund size is $149
    mil. over the sample but the size distribution is heavily right-skewed. In 2016Q2, the net asset value of
    320 funds exceeded $1 bil. and 30 funds exceeded $10 bil.

7
    To identify hedge funds in the 13F Ô¨Ålings we follow Agarwal, Fos, and Jiang (2013) and Agarwal, Jiang, Tang, and Yang (2013).
8
    The CRSP/Thompson-Reuter database includes multiple Ô¨Çags for mutual fund styles. However, style codes often change
    without obvious reasons and are contradictory across providers. We therefore infer the ‚Äúvalue‚Äù and ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù from the fund
    name, see ?? for more details. The results are very similar when we use style Ô¨Çags from CRSP/Thompson-Reuter.


                                                                 5
        The average age of mutual funds is 11.5 years and ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù funds are slightly older on average
    than ‚Äúvalue‚Äù funds. Not surprisingly, ETFs are on average younger than mutual funds. The number of
    stocks in mutual fund portfolios varies substantially across funds. The median number of stocks is 54
    with a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 1,813. ETFs hold on average 99 stocks in their portfolios.
    Consistent with the literature on mutual fund performance, returns of mutual funds are on average
    lower than those of the S&P 500 index; however, the median ETFs has a higher return than the S&P
    index. Median 4-factor alphas are negative, including those of ETFs.

    Mutual fund characteristics
        Next, we construct characteristics of mutual funds, ETFs and hedge funds. The paper includes re-
    sults for size (market equity, ME), the book-to-market ratio (BM), momentum (MOM) characteristics as
    well as the Morningstar value/growth index (MS, deÔ¨Åned later in this section). Results for other char-
    acteristics, including other price multiples, ROE and asset growth, are reported in the online appendix.
    We consider a number of diÔ¨Äerent methods.
        The benchmark case follows Daniel, Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers (1997): In each quarter ùë° we
    sort all stocks into Ô¨Åve quintiles based on characteristic ùê∂ using NYSE breakpoints. Stock ùëñ in quintile
    ùëó is assigned a characteristic score of ùê∂ùëñ,ùë° = ùëó, ùëó ‚àà {1, 2, ‚Ä¶ , 5}. The characteristic score of fund ùëö in
    quarter ùë°, ùê∂ùëö,ùë° , is computed as the portfolio-weighted average of the characteristic scores of the stocks
    in the fund‚Äôs portfolio:
                                                   ùê∂ùëö,ùë° = ‚àë ùë§ùëö,ùëñ,ùë° ùê∂ùëñ,ùë° ,
                                                            ùëñ‚ààùëÜùë°

    where ùëÜùë° is the set of stocks listed in quarter ùë° and ùë§ùëö,ùëñ,ùë° is the weight of stock ùëñ in the portfolio of fund
    ùëö in quarter ùë°.
        This procedure has several advantages. First, it is robust to stocks with extreme values of ùê∂ùëñ,ùë° .
    Second, scores have the same units and are comparable across characteristics. On the other hand,
    quintile scores depend on the breakpoints. We follow the standard procedure and use NYSE breakpoints.
    Note that the total market capitalization of the stock quintiles varies across quintiles and, therefore, the
    value-weighted market portfolio does not necessarily have a characteristic score equal to the midpoint
    of 3 but will be biased towards the quintiles with larger market caps. For example, the top size quintile
    accounts for about 73% of the total market cap while the bottom quintile accounts for only 3%. Hence,
    the size quintile score of the value-weighted CRSP index will be strongly tilted towards the Ô¨Åfth quintile.
    In contrast, the low BM quintiles account for a larger share of the total market cap that the high BM
    quintiles. Thus the BM score of the CRSP-VW index is below the midpoint of 3.9
        As an alternative measure, we compute ‚Äúmarket-adjusted‚Äù characteristics. For example, in each
    quarter we compute the ‚Äúmarket-adjusted‚Äù BM ratio for each stock ùëñ as

                                                                     BMùëñ,ùë°

                                                                 BMMKT,ùë°

    where BMMKT,ùë° is the book-to-market ratio of the CRSP-VW index. The market-adjusted BM ratio of a

                                                                 6
     mutual fund is the portfolio-weighted average adjusted BM-ratios of the stocks in its portfolio. For
     momentum, we compute the diÔ¨Äerence of momentum of each stock and momentum of the CRSP-VW
     portfolio:
                                               ÃÉ ùëñ,ùë° = MOMùëñ,ùë° ‚àí MOMMKT,ùë° .
                                               MOM

     This method has the advantage of not relying on breakpoints. Moreover, the market-adjusted char-
                                                                           ÃÉ

     construction. On the other hand, adjusted characteristics can be sensitive to outliers. For example, the
                                 ÃÉ ùëñ is right-skewed. The minimum MOM
     distribution of stock-level MOM                                  ÃÉ ùëñ is 0.04, the median is 1.35, and

     the maximum is 14.47. Hence the mutual fund level MOM
                            ÃÉ ùëñ can be dependent on whether the mutual fund holds one of the few outlier
     age of the stock-level MOM
                           ÃÉ ùëñ . Another drawback is that the units diÔ¨Äer across characteristics making
     stocks with very high MOM
     a comparison diÔ¨Écult. Most of the results reported in the paper are based on characteristics scores.
     The online appendix includes results for adjusted characteristics and quintile score based on diÔ¨Äerent
     breakpoints. Our main results are not aÔ¨Äected by the methodology of how mutual funds characteristics
     are constructed.
         While the book-to-market ratio has become the standard metric for value/growth in academic re-
     search, there are many alternative measures. One popular measure is the Morningstar value/growth
     index that is used in Morningstar‚Äôs ‚Äústyle box‚Äù.10 The MS value/growth index is deÔ¨Åned as the diÔ¨Äer-
     ence of a multiples (MULT) index and a growth (GR) index. Both components are scaled from 0 to 100
     so that the MS index ranges from -100 to 100:

                                                  1 ùê∏(Earn)       1        ùêµ ùëÜ ùê∂ùêπ ùê∑
                                       MULT =                 +       avg ( , ,  , )
                                                  2     ùëÉ         2        ùëÉ ùëÉ ùëÉ ùëÉ
                                                  1                    1
                                          GR =        Œîùê∏(LT Earn) +        avg (ŒîEarn, ŒîùëÜ, Œîùê∂ùêπ, Œîùêµ)
                                                  2                    2

                            MS[‚àí100, 100] = scaled MULT[0, 100] ‚àí scaled GR[0, 100],

     where ùê∏(Earn) are the expected earnings, ùê∏(LT Earn) are expected long-term earnings and ùëÉ, ùêµ, ùëÜ, ùê∂ùêπ, ùê∑
     are price, book value, sales, cash Ô¨Çow, and dividend, respectively. MS has two components: (i) an average
     of multiples (MULT) and, (ii) an average of expected long-term earnings growth ùê∏(ùêøùëáŒîùê∏) and growth of
     current earnings, sales cash Ô¨Çow and book value (GR). Note that the terms with expected earnings have
     a larger weight in MULT and GR than the terms with current fundamentals. The index is constructed so
     that high MS scores correspond to ‚Äúvalue‚Äù and low MS scores correspond to ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù in line with the
     BM ratio.11 We construct the MS index for each stock in each quarter, form quintiles and compute the
     MS score for mutual funds as the portfolio-weighted average of MS scores of the stocks in the fund‚Äôs
     portfolio. More details are given in the Appendix.
         We also compute the characteristics of the components of the Fama-French portfolios, SMB, HML,
     and MOM, as benchmarks. For example, HML is deÔ¨Åned as HML = 1/2 (SH+BH) - 1/2 (SL+BL), where

10

11
     The Morningstar index used in the style box is deÔ¨Åned as scaled GR[0, 100] ‚àí scaled MULT[0, 100]. We adjust the deÔ¨Ånition
     so that low/high MS values have the same value/growth interpretation as low/high BM scores.


                                                                  7
     SL is the small/low-BM portfolio, BL is the big/low-BM portfolio, etc. The component portfolios of
     HML are based on the intersection of two size and three BM-sorted portfolios (with NYSE breakpoints).
     We treat each of the component portfolios, SL, BH, ..., as a ‚Äúpassive mutual fund‚Äù and construct its
     characteristics following the same methodology described above for mutual funds. Lastly, we compute
     the characteristics of the CRSP-VW portfolio as a proxy for the market portfolio.
         As an illustration, Figure 2 plots the characteristics of one of the oldest and largest mutual funds,
     ‚ÄúThe Investment Company of America Fund‚Äù (ticker AIVSX), over time. Panel A shows the characteristic
     scores while the market-adjusted characteristics are plotted in Panel B. Adjusted MS is divided by 10 to
     make the scales comparable. ME scores are close to the maximum of Ô¨Åve indicating that the fund only
     invests in the very largest stocks. The BM score ranges from 1.5 to 2.6 while the MS score exhibits an
     upward trend and is higher than the BM score throughout the sample. BM and MS are both value/growth
     measures, but they can diÔ¨Äer substantially. Recall that MS is a combination of price multiples and
     growth rates of fundamentals. The plot suggests that the fund targets Ô¨Årms that have high fundamental
     growth rates rather than Ô¨Årms with high BM ratios. MOM scores vary more over the sample than ME,
     BM and MS scores. This is not surprising since the persistence of momentum on the stock level is lower
     than that of the other characteristics and will be the case for most mutual funds.
         Market-adjusted characteristics show similar patterns. Recall that the adjusted ME, MS and MOM
     characteristics of the CRSP-VW portfolio are zero and one for adjusted BM. However, the scales are not
     comparable since diÔ¨Äerent characteristics have diÔ¨Äerent ‚Äúunits‚Äù. The plot shows that adjusted ME and
     MS are (mostly) positive suggesting that the fund invests in very large stocks that have higher MS values
     than the market. In contrast, adjusted BM is close to one apart from the Ô¨Årst 10 years of the sample.
     Finally, adjusted MOM hovers around zero.


     3. Mutual Fund Portfolios

     Passive benchmarks
         Before analyzing characteristics of mutual funds, we start with the characteristics of the CRSP-VW
     index and the components of the Fama-French SMB, HML and MOM factors as benchmarks for mutual
     fund characteristics. Table 2 reports the average scores as well as average adjusted characteristics of the
     CRSP-VW index, the components of HML (SL, BL, SH, BH) and the components of MOM (SD, SD, SU, BU).12
     Consider Ô¨Årst the characteristic scores of the ‚Äúmarket‚Äù CRSP-VW index. The average value-weighted size
     (ME) score is 4.50 while the average book-to-market (BM) score is 2.31. The average Morningstar (MS)
     score is slightly higher than the average BM score. The average momentum (MOM) score is 3.44. The
     reason these value-weighted averages are are not equal to the midpoint of 3 is that the total market
     capitalizations in each quintile are diÔ¨Äerent. As mentioned above, the market cap in the Ô¨Åfth size
     quintile is much larger than that of the Ô¨Årst quintile. Hence, the average ME score of the value-weighted
     CRSP index is higher than 3. For the same reason, the BM and MS scores are below the midpoint of 3
     while the MOM score is above 3. In contrast, the ‚Äúadjusted‚Äù characteristics of the CRSP-VW index are
     either 1 or 0, by construction.

     S/B are small/big, L/H are low/high book-to-market and D/U are low/high momentum portfolios. See Ken French‚Äôs website
     http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html for more details.


                                                              8
   Next, consider the passive Fama-French portfolio components. The four ‚Äúsmall‚Äù portfolios have
ME scores between 1.86 and 2.07, while the ‚Äúbig‚Äù portfolios range between 4.6 and 4.8. This pattern
is similar for the other characteristics. The ‚Äúlow BM‚Äù portfolios have a BM score of 1.28 and 1.25,
respectively, and the scores of the ‚Äúhigh BM‚Äù portfolios are 4.63 and 4.56. Note that the BM, MS and MOM
scores of ‚Äúsmall‚Äù and ‚Äúhigh‚Äù portfolios are similar, the BM score of ‚Äúsmall/high BM‚Äù is 4.63 while the
score of the ‚Äúbig/high BM‚Äù portfolios is 4.56. Hence, portfolios with high BM scores can be constructed
not just from small and potentially illiquid stocks but also from large liquid stocks. Given this similarity,
we follow Fama and French and aggregate the ‚Äúsmall‚Äù and ‚Äúhigh‚Äù portfolios into a single portfolios, e.g.
‚Äúsmall/high BM‚Äù and ‚Äúbig/high BM‚Äù are combined into ‚Äúhigh BM‚Äù, etc. These portfolios correspond to
the components of the SMB, HML and MOM factors.

Portfolio Characteristics of Mutual Funds
   Next, we study the univariate distributions of mutual fund characteristics. Results for multivariate
distributions are presented in section 6. The histograms of mutual funds scores of size (ME), book-
to-market (BM), Morningstar (MS) and momentum (MOM) are shown in Figure 3. Each panel shows the
histogram for all funds (solid black) in the sample as well as ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù (dashed green) and ‚Äúvalue‚Äù (dotted
blue) funds. The numbers at the bottom of each histogram represent the percentage of all funds with
characteristic scores between 1 and 2, 2 and 3, etc., respectively. The vertical lines show the scores of
the CRSP-VW index and the passive Fama-French benchmarks. The percentiles of the distributions are
reported in Table 3.
   The ME histogram in Panel A shows that the size score of 79% of all funds is above 3 implying that
most mutual funds invest in very large stocks. The histogram shows that 19% of funds have an ME
score between 2 and 3. The vertical lines indicate the characteristics scores of the CRSP-VW index as
well as scores of the ‚Äúsmall‚Äù and ‚Äúbig‚Äù portfolios S and B (see Table 2). The size score of 33% of all
mutual funds is higher than the size score of the H portfolios. In contrast, only 2% of all active mutual
funds have a size score comparable that of the ‚Äúsmall‚Äù S portfolio. Thus, the stocks that make up the
composition of the ‚ÄúS‚Äù component of SMB are signiÔ¨Åcantly smaller than the stocks held by all but 2%
of mutual funds, and it is thus virtually impossible to replicate a portfolio similar to ‚ÄúS‚Äù by investing
in mutual funds. Clearly, most mutual funds do not exploit the small stock premium. The Ô¨Ågure also
shows the size distribution of ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù and ‚Äúvalue‚Äù funds. The ME distribution is similar for ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù
and ‚Äúvalue‚Äù funds, although growth funds have somewhat larger ME scores than ‚Äúvalue‚Äù funds. Pastor,
Stambaugh, and Taylor (2017) argue that mutual funds tilt towards large stocks because small-stocks
a more expensive to trade. In equilibrium, funds optimally choose the tradeoÔ¨Ä of trading costs versus
potentially higher returns of small stock. Large funds have higher trading costs and therefore hold large
stocks.
   The BM histogram in Panel B is identical to that in Figure 1. As already described in the introduction,
the BM distribution is heavily skewed towards low BM scores as 91% of all funds have a BM score below
3, and virtually no funds have a BM score that exceeds 4. The histogram also shows that many funds
have a BM score that is close to that of the ‚ÄúLow BM‚Äù portfolio but no funds with a BM score that is
similar to that of the ‚ÄúHigh BM‚Äù portfolio. Only 7 of the 2,657 funds in the sample are in fact high-BM
funds with a score above 4, while 1,063 funds have a BM score below 2. While it is not surprising that

                                                     9
the distribution of ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù funds is more skewed towards low BM scores, it is noteworthy that the
BM score of the majority of ‚Äúvalue‚Äù funds is below 3. The means of BM scores, shown in Table 3, are
2.23 for all funds, 1.89 for ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù funds and 2.74 for ‚Äúvalue‚Äù funds. Thus, ‚Äúvalue‚Äù funds with high
BM scores are largely missing. This fact is not driven by the lack of large and liquid stocks in the top
quintile. Recall from Table 2 that the ‚Äúbig/high BM‚Äù portfolio is made up entirely of large stocks but
has a BM score of 4.56.
   One possible explanation is that the BM ratio does not capture the notion of ‚Äúvalue‚Äù as viewed by fund
managers and investors. To explore this possibility further, we compute the Morningstar value/growth
index (MS) that underlies the well-known Morningstar style box. As explained in section 2, the Morn-
ingstar index is an average of price multiples and growth rates of Ô¨Årm fundamentals. The histogram
of MS scores in Panel C shows that the distribution is somewhat shifted to the right compared to the
BM distribution but still skewed towards low MS scores. 33% of mutual funds have an MS score below
2 while only the MS score of only 1% is above 4.
   Finally, Panel D shows the momentum (MOM) histogram. The vast majority of mutual funds have a
MOM score between 3 and 4 and are thus somewhat tilted towards higher momentum stocks. However,
only 4% of funds have a MOM score above 4 indicating that few funds focus on momentum as a primary
strategy. We will see below that the momentum tilt is due to the fact that most funds hold low BM stocks
that on average have higher MOM scores than high BM stocks. Moreover, we will also show that there
is more time variation in the momentum scores of individual funds than in the size and growth/value
scores. Hence the distribution of fund averages is less informative for momentum than for the other
more persistent characteristics.
   Since mutual funds hold mostly large stocks, it is instructive to compare the characteristics distribu-
tion of mutual fund portfolios to that of individual large stocks. Figure 4 plots the ME, BM, MS and MOM
histograms of individual stocks (dashed black) along with the histograms for mutual funds. We include
stocks that were a constituent of the S&P 500 index for at least eight quarters during the sample pe-
riod. The size distribution in Panel A shows that ME scores of mutual funds are on average higher than
those of S&P 500 stocks conÔ¨Årming the previously mentioned result that mutual funds hold mostly very
large stocks. Panel B plots the BM score distribution. The BM scores of S&P 500 stocks is more spread
out than those of funds. While there are few funds with a BM score above 3, 39% of stocks have BM
scores that exceed 3. The average BM score of stocks is 2.62, which is signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than the mean
for mutual funds of 2.23 (Table 3). Fund managers choose portfolios that are more tilted towards low
book-to-market values than the set of stocks that are available to them. Moreover, since there are many
large liquid stocks with high BM scores, there is no obvious constraint that might preclude managers
from constructing high BM funds. The distribution of Morningstar scores in Panel C shows that fund
portfolios have lower MS scores than those of stocks conÔ¨Årming that fund managers choose portfolios
that are tilted towards growth than the market overall. Panel D shows that the momentum distribution
of mutual funds is slightly shifted to the right relative to that of individual stocks.
   Next, we take a closer look at the mutual funds with the lowest and highest BM scores. Table 4
shows the 10 funds with the highest BM score and the 10 funds with the lowest score. The scores of the
‚ÄúH‚Äù component of HML are included for comparison. In our sample of 2,657 funds, only seven funds
have a BM score above 4, and only one fund exceeds the BM score of ‚ÄúH‚Äù. Only four of the 10 funds have

                                                    10
     an AUM above $1 bil. Interestingly, three of the four large funds are Dimensional Fund Advisor (DFA)
     funds that, according to their prospectuses, speciÔ¨Åcally target stock with high price multiples but, in
     contrast to the Morningstar notion of ‚Äúvalue‚Äù, do not take fundamental growth into account.13 Note,
     however, that the BM scores of the DFA funds are signiÔ¨Åcantly below that of the ‚ÄúH‚Äù portfolio. The
     bottom panel shows the 10 funds with the lowest BM scores. Note that their BM scores are all below
     that of the low BM benchmark portfolio.
        How do mutual fund portfolios compare to those of hedge funds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)?
     Figure 5 shows the BM and MS histograms of ETFs and our limited samples of (mostly small) hedge funds.
     Panels A and B show the BM and MS distribution of hedge funds. Means and percentiles are reported in
     the bottom left panel of Table 3. The BM distribution of hedge funds is very similar to that of mutual
     funds with almost identical means of 2.29 and 2.23, respectively, as well as comparable percentiles.
     While 40% of HFs have a BM score lower than 2, there are no HFs with a BM score above 4. The MS
     distribution is shifted more towards low MS than the mutual fund distribution.
        The BM distribution of ETFs shown in Panel C is shifted towards low BM scores but slightly less
     so than the distribution of mutual funds. 26% of ETFs have a BM score above 3, compared with 9% of
     mutual funds, but the BM score of only 3% is above 4, and no ETF approaches the BM score of the ‚ÄúH‚Äù
     portfolio. However, the ETF MS distribution in Panel B diÔ¨Äers signiÔ¨Åcantly from that of the distribution
     of mutual funds shown in Figure 3. The distribution of all ETFs is centered around the midpoint of 3
     and spread out symmetrically. In other words, there are (almost) as many high MS ETFs as there are low
     MS ETFs. Furthermore, MS scores of ‚Äúvalue‚Äù ETFs are much higher than those of ‚Äúvalue‚Äù mutual funds
     and, unlike mutual funds, there are many ETFs with an MS score between 4 and 5.
        The reason for this diÔ¨Äerence is that many ‚Äúvalue‚Äù ETFs track indices that are constructed using
     a similar methodology as that of the Morningstar index, i.e., indices that are based on multiples as
     well as growth rates of Ô¨Årm fundamentals. For example, the largest ‚Äúvalue‚Äù ETF (iShares Russell 1000
     Value ETF) tracks the Russell 100 Value Index that follows the Morningstar classiÔ¨Åcation closely, as
     stated in its documentation: ‚ÄúFTSE Russell uses three variables in the determination of growth and
     value. For value, book-to-price (B/P) ratio is used, while for growth, two variables‚ÄîI/B/E/S forecast
     medium-term growth (2-year) and sales per share historical growth (5-year) are used‚Äù.14 The notion of
     ‚Äúvalue‚Äù in fund management diÔ¨Äers from that in the academic literature, which has focused on pure
     price multiples as measures of ‚Äúvalue‚Äù. The evidence of the ‚Äúvalue puzzle‚Äù in the academic literature is
     based on sorts on variables such as the book-to-market, earnings-to-price, sales-to-price, etc., but does
     not include information of fundamental growth rates. We will show in section 7 that return spreads
     based on portfolios sorted according to the Morningstar index are signiÔ¨Åcantly smaller than that for
     portfolios constructed from book-to-market sorts. The reason is that the GR component of the MS
     index produces no return premium and the premium of the MULT component is smaller than that for
     BM. In other words, the widely used value/growth MS index is not associated with a ‚Äúvalue premium‚Äù.
        Next, we perform a number of robustness checks that are reported in Figure 6. Results for additional
     robustness checks are reported in the online appendix. We consider the earnings-to-price ratio (EP) as

an alternative ‚Äúvalue‚Äù measure (Panel A), plot the histogram of fund/quarter observation instead of
fund averages (Panel B), consider the ‚Äúadjusted BM‚Äù measure instead of BM scores (Panel C), the AUM-
weighted histogram (Panel D), the distribution of a larger set of mutual funds that includes index and
sector funds (Panel E), and the BM distribution at four diÔ¨Äerent points in time (Panel F). The distribution
of EP scores is slightly shifted towards higher scores compared to the BM distribution, but there are
virtually no funds with an EP score above 4. The histogram with fund/quarter observation is similar
to the histogram with fund-average observations. Unlike the BM scores, the ‚Äúadjusted BM‚Äù ratio does
not depend on breakpoints and is scaled to the overall market has a value of one but is more sensitive
to outliers. The ‚Äúadjusted BM‚Äù ratios of ‚ÄúH‚Äù and ‚ÄúL‚Äù are 3.1 and 0.6, respectively, implying that the BM
ratio of the ‚ÄúH‚Äù portfolio is about three times as high as that of the CRSP-VW index while the BM ratio of
the ‚ÄúL‚Äù portfolio is 40% lower than that of the CRSP-VW index. The ‚Äúadjusted BM‚Äù histogram conÔ¨Årms
the pattern found for BM scores. Few funds have an ‚Äúadjusted BM‚Äù ratio above 2 and there are no funds
that have a ratio that is as high as that of ‚ÄúH‚Äù. Panel D shows the histogram when funds are weighted
according to their AUM. The only signiÔ¨Åcant diÔ¨Äerence compared to the equally-weighted histogram is
the higher mass for BM scores around 4, which is due to the large DFA value funds shown in Table 4.
Our benchmark sample of mutual funds excluded index and sector funds. In Panel E, we plot the BM
distribution for the sample that including index and sector funds. The distribution is almost identical
to that for the benchmark sample. Finally, we study the BM distribution across time. Panel F shows the
BM histograms of mutual funds in the fourth quarters of 1985, 1995, 2005, and 2015.
   Appendix B reports distributions of additional characteristics, including proÔ¨Åtability, investment
growth as well as all individual components of the Morningstar index.
   To assess more formally how stock characteristics aÔ¨Äect mutual fund portfolios, we estimate the
following Probit model:
                                            ùëÉ(ùë¶ùëñ,ùëó,ùë° ) = Œ¶(X‚Ä≤ùëñ,ùë° ùõΩ ),                                   (1)

where ùë¶ùëñ,ùë° is an indicator variable that is 1 if stock ùëñ is held by mutual fund ùëó in quarter ùë° and zero
otherwise, Xùëñ,ùë° is a vector of ME, MOM, BM and MS characteristics of stock ùëñ in period ùë° and Œ¶ is the
cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. We estimate the model for all
funds, ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù funds and ‚Äúvalue‚Äù funds. Results are reported in Table 5. The regression with all mu-
tual funds shows that larger stocks with higher momentum are more likely to be included in mutual
funds portfolios but higher BM and MS scores decrease the probability to be included in a fund portfo-
lio. All scores are measured on the same [1, 5] interval, so the magnitudes of the point estimates are
comparable. The ME coeÔ¨Écient is by far the largest showing that mutual funds mostly invest in very
large stocks. All characteristics coeÔ¨Écients are statistically signiÔ¨Åcant.
   If the Probit model is estimated for only ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù funds, the MS coeÔ¨Écient becomes larger. It is
larger by a factor of 5 than in the estimation of all funds and also larger than the BM coeÔ¨Écient. For
‚Äúvalue‚Äù funds the MS coeÔ¨Écient is positive and signiÔ¨Åcant while the BM coeÔ¨Écient is insigniÔ¨Åcant. These
estimates are consistent with the distributions of mutual fund characteristics shown above. These
results suggest that in the mutual fund industry the Morningstar index is more widely used as a measure
of ‚Äúvalue‚Äù than the book-to-market ratio.




                                                      12
Time-series variation of mutual fund characteristics
   So far, we focused on time-series averages by fund. Next, we investigate the variations of fund
characteristics over time. For each mutual fund, we compute the time-series standard deviation of
ME, BEME, MS and MOM characteristics. The mean standard deviations across all mutual funds are
as follows: ùúéME = 0.23, ùúéBM = 0.29, ùúéMS = 0.32, ùúéMOM = 0.42. ME scores vary the least over time
followed by BM and MS. Fund-level momentum has a signiÔ¨Åcantly higher standard deviation than size,
book-to-market, and Morningstar characteristics. On the stock level, momentum is less persistent than
the other characteristics. If a mutual fund invests in stocks without using information on momentum,
momentum in the mutual level will also be less persistent than the other characteristics. However, if a
fund consistently targets either high or low momentum stocks, then fund momentum is more persistent
than the momentum stocks in its portfolios. In our sample, the distribution of momentum persistence
on the mutual fund level is very similar to that on the stock-level suggesting that mutual funds do not
target either high or low momentum stocks.
   As an illustration of the time series behavior of diÔ¨Äerent characteristics, we plot the characteristics of
the largest mutual fund in our sample as well as those for the largest ‚Äúvalue fund‚Äù in Figure 7. The Ô¨Ågure
also shows plots for the characteristics of passive benchmark portfolios. The Ô¨Ågures shows that ME
and BM are stable for some funds but vary for others. The time-series variation of these characteristics
tends to be on a lower frequency as funds shift their investment objectives. In contrast, the variation
in fund-level MOM is of higher frequency. This variation is ‚Äúpassive‚Äù in the sense that it is due to
changes in momentum of the stocks in a fund portfolio rather than due to portfolio reallocations. As a
consequence, a fund can be high-momentum in one quarter and low-momentum in a diÔ¨Äerent quarter.


4. Loadings vs. Holdings

   In the literature on mutual fund performance, the magnitudes of regression factor loadings (i.e.,
betas) are less relevant since the factors serve only as controls for diversiÔ¨Åable risk. For our purposes,
the question is whether loadings estimated from time series regressions of fund returns on factors such
as SMB, HML, and MOM are informative indicators of fund strategies. Next, we argue that While factor
loadings are appropriate as a measure of exposure to diversiÔ¨Åable risk, they are not necessarily reliable
indicators of the underlying investment strategy of an active mutual fund.
   First, risk exposures are estimated using historical data and are thus subject to estimation error.
Historical data might also not reÔ¨Çect the current portfolio of an active fund. This is especially true
for Ô¨Årm characteristics that change over time, such as momentum. Unless a fund deliberately hedges
momentum, the momentum of a fund‚Äôs portfolio changes as the momentum of the stocks in its portfolio
changes over time. In contrast, measuring fund characteristics directly from portfolio holdings yields
an accurate assessment of the fund‚Äôs portfolio at each point in time.
   Second, the interpretation of the magnitudes of estimated loadings in factor regressions are not
straightforward and can easily be misinterpreted. Consider the univariate setting with two portfolios,
P and Q, that are based on sorts on some characteristic. Let PMQùë° = Pùë° ‚àí Qùë° be the corresponding




                                                    13
long/short portfolios and consider the regressions of Pùë° and Qùë° on PMQùë° :

                                ùëåùë° = ùõºY + ùõΩY,PMQ PMQùë° + ùëíY,ùë° , ùëå ‚àà {P, Q}.

Since PMQùë° = Pùë° ‚àí Qùë° , the P and Q betas have the property

                                           ùõΩP,PMQ ‚àí ùõΩQ,PMQ = 1.

However, the magnitudes of the two betas depend on the variance-covariance structure of [Pùë° , Qùë° ]:

                                                                    ùúéY
                                                 ùõΩY,PMQ = ùúåY,PMQ
                                                                   ùúéPMQ
                                    |ùõΩP,PMQ | > |ùõΩQ,PMQ | ‚ü∫ ùúéP > ùúéQ .

The last line follows from the fact that Cov(Pùë° , Pùë° ‚àí Qùë° ) = Var(Pùë° ) ‚àí Cov(Pùë° , Qùë° ), Cov(Qùë° , Pùë° ‚àí Qùë° ) =
Var(Pùë° ) ‚àí Cov(Pùë° , Qùë° ). Hence, betas are not necessarily symmetric around 0 and the more volatile port-
folio has a larger (in absolute value) beta with respect to the long/short portfolio. The Pùë° ‚àí Qùë° beta of the
‚Äúneutral‚Äù portfolio (Pùë° + Qùë° )/2 is positive if ùúéP > ùúéQ and negative otherwise. In other words, the mag-
nitudes of betas are more informative about the volatility of the portfolios that make up the long/short
portfolios than as a measure of how tilted a portfolio is towards the underlying characteristic.
    The dependence of regression loadings on the volatility of the long/short portfolios is borne out in
the data. In our sample, univariate HML betas are not centered around zero since ùúéL > ùúéH and thus
|ùõΩL,HML | > |ùõΩH,HML |. The estimated univariate betas are ùõΩL,HML = ‚àí0.75, ùõΩH,HML = 0.25. The HML beta of
the ‚ÄúBM-neutral portfolio‚Äù (H+L)/2 is -0.25. In contrast, the HML beta of a ‚Äúgrowth-tilted‚Äù portfolio of
0.75H+0.25L is 0. Hence, a comparison of HML loadings of two portfolios based only on the magnitudes
of their HML betas is misleading. Say, the HML betas of two portfolios are -0.2 and 0.2, respectively.
The portfolio with an HML beta of 0.2 is much closer to ‚ÄúH‚Äù than the portfolio with an HML beta of ‚àí0.2
is to ‚ÄúL‚Äù.
    This pattern is even more pronounced for the SMB ùõΩ‚Äôs of ‚ÄúS‚Äù and ‚ÄúB‚Äù: ùõΩS,SMB = 1.60, ùõΩB,SMB = 0.60.
The positive sign of ùõΩB,SMB is counterintuitive since SMB=S‚àíB but is due to the fact that ‚ÄúS‚Äù is much
more volatile than ‚ÄúB‚Äù and Cov(B,S) > Var(B). Hence, the SMB beta of any linear combination of ‚ÄúS‚Äù and
‚ÄúB‚Äù with non-negative weights is strictly positive. Thus univariate SMB betas of large stocks, or mutual
funds that hold large stocks, are positive. By themselves, beta coeÔ¨Écients in regressions on long/short
factors are generally not informative. Instead, betas need to be interpreted relative to the range spanned
by the betas of the components of the long/short factors.
    In multivariate regression, the patterns of betas are more complicated and depend on the joint
variance-covariance structure of the left- and right-hand side variables. Consider the 4-factor model

               ùëåùë° = ùõºY + ùõΩY,MKT MKTùë° + ùõΩY,SMB SMBùë° + ùõΩY,HML HMLùë° + ùõΩY,MOM MOMùë° + ùëíY,ùë° ,




                                                     14
     where ùëå ‚àà {S, B, H, L, U, D}. As in the univariate case, the betas have the property

                                            SMB = S ‚àí B ‚üπ ùõΩS,SMB ‚àí ùõΩB,SMB = 1,
                                           HML = H ‚àí L ‚üπ ùõΩH,HML ‚àí ùõΩL,HML = 1,
                                          MOM = U ‚àí D ‚üπ ùõΩU,MOM ‚àí ùõΩD,MOM = 1.

     However, the estimates of the individual ùõΩ‚Äôs depend on the variance-covariance of ùëçùë° = [MKTùë° , Sùë° , Bùë° ,
     , Hùë° , Lùë° , Uùë° , Dùë° ]‚Ä≤ . As with univariate betas, it is not necessarily the case that the coeÔ¨Écients are symmetric
     in the sense that ùõΩS,SMB = ‚àíùõΩB,SMB , ùõΩH,HML = ‚àíùõΩL,HML , ùõΩU,MOM = ‚àíùõΩD,MOM .
         In general, the relative magnitudes and signs can take any value. The betas of the six component
     portfolios of SMB, HML and MOM in 4-factor regressions are shown in Table 6. The SMB loading of ‚ÄúS‚Äù
     is 0.90, while the loading for ‚ÄúB‚Äù is ‚àí0.10 and thus much smaller in absolute value. The same pattern
     is true for the HML loadings of ‚ÄúH‚Äù and ‚ÄúL‚Äù: ùõΩH,HML = 0.72 and ùõΩL,HML = ‚àí0.28, while ùõΩU,MOM = 0.34 and
     ùõΩD,MOM = ‚àí0.66. While the signs of the betas are intuitive in the sense that betas of ‚Äúlong‚Äù portfolios S,
     H and U are positive and betas of ‚Äúshort‚Äù portfolios B, L and D are negative, the betas are not symmetric
     around zero.
         The eÔ¨Äect of this asymmetry is visible in the magnitudes of SMB and HML loadings of 25 ME-BM
     sorted portfolios shown in Table 7. The SMB betas of all portfolios constructed from size quintiles 1
     to 4 are positive and only the Ô¨Åve portfolios with the smallest stocks have a negative SMB beta. The
     magnitudes of the SMB betas are only interpretable in comparison to the ‚ÄúS‚Äù and ‚ÄúB‚Äù betas of 0.9 and
                        15
     -0.10 (Table 6).        The pattern of HML betas is similar. Only the portfolios with the lowest BM quintile
     have negative HML betas. As in the case of SMB betas, HML betas need to be interpreted in conjunction
     with ‚ÄúH‚Äù and ‚ÄúL‚Äù betas. Otherwise, asset betas can lead to incorrect inference. Consider for example the
     ‚Äúneutral‚Äù portfolio formed from stocks in the third ME and BM quintiles. The SMB beta of this portfolio
     is 0.51, and the HML beta is 0.42 suggesting, incorrectly, that this portfolio is tilted towards large, high
     BM stocks. However, the betas are close to the midpoints of the ‚ÄúS‚Äù and ‚ÄúB‚Äù SMB betas and the ‚ÄúH‚Äù and
     ‚ÄúL‚Äù HML betas, which is an indication that this portfolio is indeed BM-neutral and ME-neutral.
         Consider two mutual funds with ùõΩ1,HML = 0.25 and ùõΩ2,HML = ‚àí0.25, respectively. Since the HML betas
     are equal in absolute value, it might seem that both funds are comparable in terms of their respective
     value and growth strategies. However, the HML beta of fund 2 is close to the HML beta of ‚ÄúL‚Äù of ‚àí0.27
     while the HML beta of fund 1 is much smaller than the HML beta of ‚ÄúH‚Äù of 0.73. Hence, the proper
     interpretation is that fund 1 is a ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù value fund while fund 2 is an ‚Äúextreme‚Äù growth fund.
         The third issue with factor exposures estimates is that they are varying over time. Figure 8 shows
     this time-variation of factor betas for the passive benchmarks as well as the distribution of mutual fund
     SMB and HML betas. The solid lines in Panel A show ‚ÄúS‚Äù and ‚ÄúB‚Äù SMB 4-factor betas in 10-year rolling
     samples. In addition to the ‚ÄúS‚Äù and ‚ÄúB‚Äù loadings, the Ô¨Ågure also shows betas of an ME-neutral portfolio
     of SB=(S+B)/2. Panel B shows the ‚ÄúH‚Äù, ‚ÄúL‚Äù and HL=(H+L)/2 betas. The shaded areas are 95% conÔ¨Ådence
     bands. SMB betas vary slightly over the sample ranging from ‚àí0.14 to ‚àí0.04 for ‚ÄúS‚Äù and 0.87 to 1.01
     for ‚ÄúB‚Äù. The time-variation of HML betas are more pronounced. Panel B shows that ùõΩH,HML and ùõΩL,HML are

15
     The betas of the 25 ME-BM portfolios can be larger in absolute value than the ‚ÄúS‚Äù, ‚ÄúB‚Äù, ‚ÄúH‚Äù and ‚ÄúL‚Äù betas since the they are
     based on quintiles while ‚ÄúS‚Äù, ‚ÄúB‚Äù, ‚ÄúH‚Äù and ‚ÄúL‚Äù are constructed from two ME quantiles and BM terciles.


                                                                 15
both higher towards the end of the sample than in early in the sample. The variation is economically
and statistically signiÔ¨Åcant. The estimates for ùõΩH,HML range from 0.57 in 1991Q3 to 0.76 in 2012Q2 and
from ‚àí0.41 in 1991Q4 to ‚àí0.21 in 2007Q2 for ùõΩL,HML . Hence a mutual fund with a ùõΩHML of 0.5 is an
extreme-value fund similar to ‚ÄúH‚Äù in the 1980s but only a moderate-value fund in the 2000s. Similarly,
a mutual fund with a ùõΩHML of ‚àí0.2 is an extreme-growth fund in the 2000s but only a moderate-growth
fund in the 1980s.
   Next, we estimate 4-factor betas of mutual funds in rolling 10-year regressions. Each estimation
window includes all funds with at least 75% available data. Figure 9 shows violin plots of the distribution
of mutual fund HML and SMB loadings for 10-year windows ending in the second quarters of 1988, 1995,
2002, 2009, and 2016. The Ô¨Ågures also show the median and inter-quartile range of each distribution.
The solid lines are betas of ‚ÄúS‚Äù, ‚ÄúB‚Äù, ‚ÄúH‚Äù and ‚ÄúL‚Äù. The SMB-beta distribution in the top panel is stable
over time, which is intuitive since the majority of mutual funds holds almost exclusively large stocks
throughout the sample. The median of the distribution varies between 0.04 in 2009 to 0.17 in 1988.
   The majority of mutual funds have positive SMB betas, from 55% in 2009 to 78% in 1988. Without
proper context, this would incorrectly indicate that most mutual funds hold small stocks. SMB-betas
of very few mutual funds are as high as the ‚ÄúS‚Äù SMB-beta; but many funds have an SMB-beta that is
comparable to that of the ‚ÄúB‚Äù portfolio. The upper interquartile range is close to the SMB-beta of the
ME-neutral SB=(S+B)/2 portfolio and lower interquartile range is close to that of the ‚ÄúB‚Äù beta. Hence,
properly interpreted, the SMB-beta distribution conÔ¨Årms the pattern found in portfolio holdings that
most mutual funds invest in large stocks.
   The HML beta distributions are shown in Panel B. First, notice that there is time-variation in the
mutual fund HML-ùõΩ distribution. The distribution shifts up in the middle of the sample compared to
the beginning and end of the sample. The median in 1988 is ‚àí0.08, 0.14 in 2002 and ‚àí0.07 in 2016.
Thus mutual fund HML-betas follow a similar pattern as the HML-betas of the passive ‚ÄúH‚Äù, ‚ÄúHL‚Äù and ‚ÄúL‚Äù
portfolios shown in Figure 8. The medians of the distributions are around 0 and would, as in the case
of SMB-betas, incorrectly indicate that funds are on average BM-neutral. However, there are virtually no
mutual funds with an HML-beta close to the ‚ÄúH‚Äù HML-beta while most funds have an HML beta that is
lower than the beta of the BM-neutral HL=(H+L)/2 portfolio. For example, in 2016 93% of all mutual
funds had an HML beta that was lower than the HL beta conÔ¨Årming that very few mutual funds are
high-BM funds, whether the degree of ‚Äúvalue‚Äù is measured based on portfolio holdings or regression
loadings.
   In summary, magnitudes of SMB and HML loadings are diÔ¨Écult to interpret and vary over time.
Estimated portfolio or mutual fund betas should be compared to betas of the individual portfolios that
are used to construct long/short factors.
   Finally, we compare the distribution of mutual fund loadings to that of hedge funds in Figure 10.
The distributions of HML and MOM betas of hedge funds are very similar to those of mutual funds
while hedge funds have on average slightly higher SMB-betas. However, the hedge fund and mutual
funds distributions of market betas are fundamentally diÔ¨Äerent. Most mutual funds have a market beta
between 0.5 and 1.5 with a mean close to 0. Market betas if hedge funds are on average lower. The mean
market beta is close to 0.6, and about 40% of hedge funds have a market beta of less than 0.5. Since
mutual funds are restricted to only hold long positions, it is not surprising that their market betas are

                                                    16
around one. Hedge funds can take short positions and thus create portfolios with lower market betas.
However, the histograms show that hedge funds exposures to factors other than the market do not
diÔ¨Äer signiÔ¨Åcantly from those of mutual funds.


5. Portfolio Composition by Quintiles

   So far, we have focused on average portfolio characteristics of mutual funds. Next, we analyze
portfolio compositions in more detail. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, for each fund, we compute the average portfolios
shares in each of the characteristic quintiles over the lifetime of the fund. Table 8 reports average
portfolio shares in the Ô¨Åve BM quintiles for the CRSP-VW index and mutual funds, hedge funds and
ETFs, as well as for the Ô¨Åve largest ‚Äúvalue‚Äù and ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù funds in our sample. Figure 11 shows the
histograms of portfolio shares in BM quintiles across mutual funds, hedge funds and ETFs.
   Since the total market capitalization is higher in the lower BM quintiles than in the higher BM quin-
tiles, the average portfolio share of the CRSP-VW index declines from quintiles one to Ô¨Åve. The average
BM-quintile portfolios shares across all funds, shown in the second row of Panel A, are very close to the
shares of the CRSP-VW index. The portfolios of growth funds are heavily concentrated in extreme low
BM stocks. The average portfolio share of stocks in quintile one is 53% and 22% in quintile two. Only
12% of portfolios of ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù funds are invested in higher BM stocks. However, the pattern for ‚Äúvalue‚Äù
funds is very diÔ¨Äerent. The average share of stocks in the lowest BM quintiles of value fund portfolios
is 22%, and an additional 23% are invested in stocks in the second BM quintile. On the other hand, only
14% are held in high BM stocks. In other words, on average value funds hold a higher fraction of their
portfolios in low BM ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù stocks than in high BM ‚Äúvalue‚Äù stocks. Figure 11 shows the distribution
of portfolio shares across mutual funds (in black). Very few mutual funds hold more than 30% or their
portfolios in quintiles 4 and 5 stocks. This pattern is particularly stark for ‚Äúvalue‚Äù funds. Only 41 of
574 ‚Äúvalue‚Äù funds hold more than 25% of their portfolio in BM quintile-5 stocks (in comparison, 1,082
out of 1,130 ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù funds hold more than 25% of their portfolio in quintile-1 stocks). In contrast,
209 ‚Äúvalue‚Äù funds hold more than 25% of their portfolio in quintile-1 stock and 309 ‚Äúvalue‚Äù funds hold
a larger share of their portfolio in quintile-1 than in quintile-5 stocks. In other words, ‚Äúvalue‚Äù mutual
funds hold signiÔ¨Åcantly more ‚Äúlow-BM growth‚Äù stocks than ‚Äúhigh-BM value‚Äù stocks.
   Panel A of Table 8 also shows the average BM-quintile portfolios shares of hedge funds and ETFs.
The quintile shares in BM hedge fund and ETF portfolios look remarkably similar to those of mutual
funds. The histograms in Figure 11 show that not only the mean of the shares distributions across BM
quintiles are similar for mutual funds, hedge funds, and ETFs but also the overall shape.
   Panel B reports the portfolio shares across BM quintiles for the Ô¨Åve largest value funds. Four of
the Ô¨Åve largest value funds hold the highest portfolio share in stocks in the lowest BM quintile. Their
portfolio shares decline (mostly) monotonically and the lowest portfolio shares are in stocks in the
highest BM quintile (with one exception). The largest ‚Äúvalue‚Äù fund, the ‚ÄúT. Rowe Price Equity Income‚Äù
fund (with assets of $21.6 bil. as of July 2018), holds 29% of its portfolio in stocks in the lowest BM
quintile and only 13% in stocks in the highest BM quintile. Using the BM as a measure of ‚Äúvalue‚Äù, as is
done in most of the academic literature, this fund would be labeled as a ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù fund rather than a
‚Äúvalue‚Äù fund. The portfolios of the second to fourth largest ‚Äúvalue‚Äù funds have similar patterns. The


                                                   17
notable exception is the Ô¨Åfth largest ‚Äúvalue‚Äù fund, the ‚ÄúDFA US Large Cap Value‚Äù fund. This fund holds
very small fractions of stocks in the lowest two BM quintiles and holds on average 70% in stocks in the
two highest BM quintiles. In contrast, portfolios of ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù funds are more concentrated in low BM
stocks. Panel C shows the average portfolio weights for the Ô¨Åve largest ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù funds in our sample.
These funds hold at least 65% of their portfolios in BM1 and BM2 stocks and the portfolio shares are
declining in BM.


6. Joint Distribution of Mutual Fund Characteristics

   So far, we have focused on the univariate characteristics distributions. Next, we will study the joint
distribution of average BM and MOM scores of mutual funds; additional results are reported in the
online appendix. Figure 12 shows the 2-dimensional scatter plot with BM scores on the ùë•-axis and MOM
scores on the ùë¶-axis. The plots also show the scores of the CRSP-VW and S&P 500 indices as well as
the components of Fama-French portfolios (‚ÄúS‚Äù, ‚ÄúB‚Äù for small/big, ‚ÄúH‚Äù, ‚ÄúL‚Äù for high/low BM, ‚ÄúU‚Äù, ‚ÄúD‚Äù for
high/low MOM).
   Panel A shows the BM/MOM distribution for individual stocks. Each dot represents the average
BM and MOM characteristics for an individual stock. Smaller/larger dots correspond to smaller/larger
stocks. Average MOM scores for most stocks are between 2.75 and 3.75 while average BM score are more
spread out. The scatter plot also shows no strong link between BM and MOM scores for stocks. Panel B
shows the same plot for mutual funds with diÔ¨Äerent mutual funds types indicated by diÔ¨Äerent colors.
The BM/MOM distribution of mutual funds is diÔ¨Äerent from that of stocks in a number of ways. First,
it is more clustered around BM scores between 1.2 and 3 and MOM scores between 3 and 4, as already
indicated by the univariate BM and MOM histograms. Second, there is a negative correlation between a
fund‚Äôs BM and MOM scores. Funds with low BM scores have higher MOM scores than those with higher
BM scores. Hence ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù funds (in green) have on average a higher MOM score than ‚Äúvalue‚Äù funds (in
blue). The Ô¨Ågure shows that there are no funds with a portfolio that is tilted towards high BM and high
MOM.
   Panel C shows the BM/MOM distribution for fund/quarter observations instead of time series aver-
ages. Compared to the fund/averages observations shown in Panel B, the fund/quarter MOM scores are
more spread out. The bulk of the observations are the BM scores are between 1 and 3. About 60% of all
fund/quarter observations have a BM score between 1 and 3 and a MOM score between 3 and 4. It is in-
structive to compare the mutual fund distribution of S&P 500 stocks. Since stocks are assigned integer
scores between 1 and 5 in each quarter, we add some random noise around the integer values to show
the distribution. The stock/quarter distribution is superimposed in red. Since the breakpoints in the
constructions of portfolios are reset each year, the distribution of stocks is almost uniform. Hence the
BM/MOM scores of portfolios of mutual funds are more concentrated than scores of individual (large)
stocks. Panel D shows the BM/MOM distribution for hedge funds and ETFs. Both distributions are very
similar to the distribution of mutual funds.
   The scatter plots in Figure 12 show the joint BM/MOM distribution over the entire sample but there
is signiÔ¨Åcant time variation in the joint distribution. Figure 13 plots the joint distributions in 1999Q1
and 2001Q2. In 1999Q1 mutual funds with low BM scores have high MOM scores. This pattern is


                                                   18
reversed in 2001Q2 when low BM funds have lower than average MOM scores. During the stock market
boom, growth stocks were on average also high momentum stocks; hence portfolios of ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù funds,
holding primarily low BM stocks, were also high momentum. Momentum of low BM stocks was low after
the market correction in 2000, hence ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù funds were low momentum. Since portfolios of ‚Äúvalue‚Äù
funds are invested in low, mid and high BM stocks in similar proportions, this comovement of BM and
MOM scores are much less pronounced. This pattern holds throughout the sample. The time series
standard deviation of MOM scores for low BM funds is twice as high as that of higher BM funds.


7. Characteristics and Return

   Finally, we investigate how characteristics are related to returns. Table 9 reports returns of stocks in
Panel A and mutual funds in Panel B across characteristic quintiles. In addition to ME, BM, MS, and MOM
we also report results for the two components of the MS index: Fundamental growth rates (GR) and
multiples (MULT). The returns across size, book-to-market and momentum have the familiar patterns
of the size, value and momentum premia. The Morningstar value index MS produces a signiÔ¨Åcantly
smaller return spread than the book-to-market ratio. The reason is that both MS components yield rela-
tively small return spreads. There is no consistent return pattern across GR quintiles, and the index of
multiples produces a smaller return spread than the book-to-market ratio by itself. The corresponding
results for mutual funds are reported in Panel B. The mutual fund returns are after fees and overall
lower than those of individual stocks but have lower volatility. Sharpe-ratios of stock and mutual fund
returns are comparable.
   While the well-studied characteristic premia are present in stock returns, they are much smaller
on the mutual fund level. There are no consistent return patterns across ME, MOM, MS, MULT and GR
quintiles. Only the book-to-market eÔ¨Äect is present in mutual funds returns, but its magnitude is smaller
than that for stocks. The BM quintile-5 to quintile-1 spread for stocks is 2.82%, and 0.78% for mutual
funds, respectively. Hence, investors in mutual funds are not rewarded for return premia associated
with characteristics that are present in individual stock returns.
   Next, study the characteristics-return link more formally using Fama-MacBeth regressions. In each
quarter ùë° we estimate the regression

                                      ùëÖùëñ,ùë°+1 ‚àí ùëÖùëì,ùë°+1 = ùõΩ ‚Ä≤ùë° Xùëñ,ùë° + ùëíùëñ,ùë°+1 ,                               (2)

where ùëÖùëñ,ùë°+1 ‚àí ùëÖùëì,ùë°+1 is the excess return of asset ùëñ in quarter ùë° + 1 and Xùëñ,ùë° is a vector of characteristics
of asset ùëñ at time ùë°. Then, we time-average the betas and report ùõΩ = ‚àëùë° ùõΩ ùë° in Table 10. We estimate
the model for individual stocks and mutual funds. The results for the sample of individual stocks
in the top panel shows the familiar patterns. Stocks that are small size have high momentum and
high ‚Äúvalue‚Äù are associated with higher returns. The size eÔ¨Äect is statistically insigniÔ¨Åcant while the
momentum coeÔ¨Écient is signiÔ¨Åcant. The BM coeÔ¨Écient is twice as large as the MS coeÔ¨Écient and
strongly signiÔ¨Åcant while the signiÔ¨Åcance of the MS estimate is only marginal. This suggests that on the
stock level the book-to-market ratios are more powerful return predictor than the Morningstar index,
consistent with the results in Table 9.



                                                       19
   The results for the sample of mutual funds, shown in Panel B, diÔ¨Äer from those for individual stocks
in important aspects. The ME coeÔ¨Écients are slightly more negative than those for the stock sample
while the MOM point estimates are almost identical. The BM and MS coeÔ¨Écients, however, are slightly
negative and insigniÔ¨Åcant. This in sharp contrast to the estimates for individual stocks. The ‚Äúvalue‚Äù pre-
mium is present in individual stocks returns but not in returns of mutual funds, which is also consistent
with the results in Table 9.


8. Conclusion

   This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of characteristics of mutual fund portfolios. Some
facts stand out. First, the BM distribution of mutual funds is strongly skewed towards low BM ratios.
While there are many funds that have a BM ratio comparable to that of the ‚ÄúL‚Äù portfolio in HML, there very
no funds with a BM ratio close to ‚ÄúH‚Äù. Moreover, the skew towards low BM values is more pronounced
for mutual funds than for individual (large) stocks. Second, ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù funds hold almost exclusively low
BM stocks in their portfolios. In contrast, portfolios of ‚Äúvalue‚Äù funds include stocks across the entire
BM distribution. In fact, on average mutual funds hold a higher share of stocks with low BM ratios that
stocks with high BM ratios. The BM distributions of ETFs and hedge funds are similar to that of mutual
funds. Third, mutual funds are on average almost momentum-neutral. While momentum of ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù
funds varies over time, in contrast to momentum of ‚Äúvalue‚Äù funds, there are very few mutual funds with
consistently high momentum. Fourth, size, book-to-market and momentum return spreads are smaller
for mutual funds than for individual stocks and insigniÔ¨Åcant in Fama-MacBeth regressions.
   These stylized facts raise a number of questions about active mutual funds:

  1. Why is the distribution of mutual fund portfolios so strongly tilted towards low book-to-market ra-
     tios and why are there virtually no high BM funds at all even though high BM stocks are associated
     with higher returns than low BM stocks?

  2. Why do funds that label themselves as ‚Äúvalue‚Äù funds hold more low BM stocks than high BM stocks
     while ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù funds hold almost exclusively low BM stocks?

  3. Why are portfolios of active mutual funds not more tilted towards characteristics that are associ-
     ated with high returns, i.e. small, high BM and high momentum stocks?

  4. Why don‚Äôt mutual funds combine multiple strategies (e.g., high BM - high momentum) that have
     been shown to be more proÔ¨Åtable than univariate strategies (Asness, Moskowitz, and Pedersen
     (2013)).

  5. Why do mutual funds and ETFs follow strategies that emulate the Morningstar value/growth def-
     inition even though it has no return premium?

   Our results have also broader implications for equity markets. Aside from the issue of delisting of
funds and the implied survivorship bias, the literature takes the set of mutual funds as given and there
is little research about why new funds are created. In other words, what economic forces determine the
set of funds and strategies that we observe? Is the mutual fund market driven by investor‚Äôs demand for


                                                   20
certain strategies or by the supply of proÔ¨Åtable strategies? Are there so many ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù funds because
investor‚Äôs demand for ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù stocks and the absence of high-BM funds is due to low demand? How
can the stylized facts presented in this paper be reconciled with the evidence that capital Ô¨Çows react
strongly to past performance? Since returns of high-BM stocks are on average higher than returns of
low BM stocks, capital should Ô¨Çow from low-BM funds into high-BM mutual funds over the sample and
the number of high-BM funds should increase relative to the number of low-BM funds. Yet, there is no
evidence support this conjecture.
   Portfolios of active mutual funds account for about 13% of total market cap (as of 2016) and their
portfolio allocations are likely to have an eÔ¨Äect on equilibrium prices. Whether factor premia are per-
manent or diminishing over time due to higher demand for underpriced stocks is still an open question.
Our results suggest that active mutual funds do not systematically hold the stocks with characteristics
associated with high returns and thus are unlikely to contribute to any shrinking of factor premia during
the sample period. Our sample of mutual funds and ETFs is exhaustive but we only observe portfolio
holdings of a very small subset of small hedge funds, so we cannot rule out that (larger) hedge funds
tilt their portfolios towards proÔ¨Åtable characteristics.

     Appendix A. Data and Fund Selection

     Mutual Funds and ETFs
        Our sample of mutual funds and ETFs builds upon several databases. Net assets (TNA), investment
     objective codes, realized returns, expense ratios, turnover, starting dates and other fund characteris-
     tics comes from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) Survivorship Bias Free Mutual Fund
     Database. We collapse funds with diÔ¨Äerent share classes investing in the same portfolio into single
     fund-observations.16
        Holdings data comes from two diÔ¨Äerent sources. First, we take data on portfolios weights from
     CRSP, merging it with funds characteristics by portfolio codes (CRSP_PORTNO) and calendar dates.
     CRSP provides the most comprehensive data about mutual funds ETFs holdings in terms of number of
     portfolios, with the downside that it is available only since 2002. In order to cover a time period as large
     as possible, we also use data from the Thomson Reuters Mutual Fund Holdings (formerly CDA/Spectrum
     S12). Thomson Reuters tables contain data from funds holdings since 1980, when the U.S. Securities
     and Exchange Commission (SEC) made the disclosure of mutual funds portfolios mandatory. We merge
     the CRSP database with the Thomson Reuters holdings using the MFLINKS table developed by Wermers
     (2000) and available on WRDS.
        After merging all relevant tables, we apply standard Ô¨Ålters to exclude undesirable observations. First,
     we remove all funds not classiÔ¨Åed as U.S. domestic equity funds.17 Since self-reported classiÔ¨Åcations
     can be misleading, We also exclude observations of funds investing on average less than 70% of their
     total assets in U.S. stocks.

     Hedge Funds
        We use two diÔ¨Äerent samples of hedge funds in this paper. The Ô¨Årst sample comes from the Hedge
     Funds Research (HFR), with information about performance, strategy, net assets (TNA), fees and other
     fund characteristics. We include only US-based funds investing 50% or more of their assets in US stocks,
     obtaining a table with 973 hedge funds.
        The HFR data do not include portfolios holdings. We address this limitation by building a second
     hand-collected sample of hedge funds from the 13F Ô¨Ålings of institutional institutional investors man-
     aging more than $100 million in value. After restricting this universe to institutional investors that (i)
     are hedge funds, and (ii) manage a single fund, we obtained quarterly holdings of 114 hedge funds.

     Morningstar Index
        We reconstruct the Morningstar value/growth index (MS) for each stock in each quarter and then
     aggregate to the fund level. The MS index is deÔ¨Åned as the diÔ¨Äerence of a multiples (MULT) and a
     growth (GR) index, which are, by its turn, deÔ¨Åned as a combination of ten diÔ¨Äerent scores, each one
     a percentile between 1 and 100. MULR is a a weighted average of the percentiles (calculated using


16
   The aggregated observation have TNA equal to the sum of the TNAs of diÔ¨Äerent classes. Qualitative characteristics of the
   aggregated observation equals to the average of the characteristic among individual observations, weighted by their total
   assets. Qualitative characteristics of the aggregated observation equals to the characteristic of the oldest share.

   We say that an observation is a domestic equity mutual funds if its CRSP investment objective code starts with ‚ÄúED‚Äù.
all stocks) of: earnings-to-market (50%), book-to-market (12.5%), sales-to-market (12.5%), cash Ô¨Çow-to-
market (12.5%), and dividend yield (12.5%). GR is a a weighted average of the percentiles of: long term
projected earnings growth growth from I/B/E/S (50%), year-over-year lagged earnings growth (12.5%),
lagged sales growth (12.5%), lagged cash Ô¨Çow growth (12.5%), and lagged book value growth (12.5%).
If not available, the projected earnings growth was replaced by the percentile of the lagged earnings
growth in this calculation. The resulting Morningstar, calculated as the diÔ¨Äerence between MULT and
GR, ranges from -100 to 100.

            Note: This plot shows the histograms of the distribution of average size (ME), book-to-market (BM), Morningstar
            index (MS) and momentum (MOM) characteristics of mutual funds over the periods that the fund is in the sample.
            In each quarter, the fund characteristics are computed as the value-weighted averages of scores of holdings of the
            fund. The scores are computed using Fama-French quintile breakpoints. An index of ‚Äò1‚Äô indicates Ô¨Årms in the low-
            est B/M quintile and Ô¨Årms with a score of ‚Äò5‚Äô are in the highest B/M quintile. The solid black line is the histogram
            of all mutual funds, the dashed green line is for ‚Äògrowth‚Äô funds fund and the dashed blue line is for ‚Äòvalue‚Äô funds.
            The vertical lines indicate the average score of the CRSP-VW index and the corresponding ‚Äúhigh‚Äù and ‚Äùlow‚Äù portfo-
            lios of Fama-French long/short portfolios. The sample is from 1980Q1 to 2016Q2.

     Note: This table reports the distributions of mutual funds and stocks for individual characteristics. The per-
     centages correspond to the shares of funds and stocks that have characteristic scores between 1 and 2, 2 and
     3, 3 and 4, and 4 and 5, respectively. ME is size (market capitalization), BM is the book-to-market ration, MS is
     the Morningstar index, OP is operating proÔ¨Åtability, INV is investment growth, MULT and GR is the multiples
     and growth components of the Morningstar index, EP, CFP, DP and SP are the earnings, cash Ô¨Çow, dividend
     and sale to price rations, respectively, and GRB, GRE, GRLTE, GRS, and GRCF are the growth rates of the book
     value, earnings, long-term earnings, sales, and cash Ô¨Çows, respectively.
