                                              ABSTRACT

We provide evidence on how two important types of institutions -- dismissal barriers, and bonus pay
-- affect contract enforcement behavior in a market with incomplete contracts and repeated interactions.
Dismissal barriers are shown to have a strong negative impact on worker performance, and market
efficiency, by interfering with firms' use of firing threat as an incentive device. Dismissal barriers
also distort the dynamics of worker effort levels over time, cause firms to rely more on the spot market
for labor, and create a distribution of relationship lengths in the market that is more extreme, with
more very short and more very long relationships. The introduction of a bonus pay option dramatically
changes the market outcome. Firms are observed to substitute bonus pay for threat of firing as an incentive
device, almost entirely offsetting the negative incentive and efficiency effects of dismissal barriers.
Nevertheless, contract enforcement behavior remains fundamentally changed, because the option to
pay bonuses causes firms to rely less on long-term relationships. Our results show that market outcomes
are the result of a complex interplay between contract enforcement policies and the institutions in which
they are embedded.

  This paper uses experimental labor markets to study how two important, and often con-


troversial, institutions  dismissal barriers, and bonus pay  aect contract enforcement


behavior. We focus on a setting with incomplete contracts as this is a ubiquitous charac-

                                             1
teristic of employment relationships.            We also allow for repeated interactions, because a


prominent theoretical solution to the contract enforcement problem associated with incom-


pleteness involves employers and employees interacting in a repeated game. In particular,


the theory involves employers using a combination of rents and threat of dismissal to give


workers an incentive to perform (e.g., Klein and Leer (1981), Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984)


and MacLeod and Malcomson (1989)).


  Dismissal barriers are a particularly important institution to study in the context of in-


complete contracts, given the strategic importance of ring threat in such settings. Dismissal


barriers have the potential to radically change the strategic interaction of rms and workers


within relationships, as well as patterns of relationship formation in the market. Dismissal


barriers arise, for example, in the presence of employment protection legislation (EPL),


where hiring a worker beyond a probation period triggers barriers to dismissal, or in the case


of relationship-specic investments that accrue over time and raise ring costs (see Mincer


(1962)).


  The exibility of the labor contract is also a key institutional feature, in particular whether


rms are restricted to the wage contract focused on in the eciency wage literature, or


whether contractual instruments such as bonus pay or other forms of delayed compensation


are also available. Previous evidence indicates that bonus pay is a credible incentive device


in one-shot games, because rms reward performance with bonuses, and punish shirking by

withholding the bonus (Fehr, GÃ¤chter, and Kirchsteiger (1997); Fehr, Klein, and Schmidt


(2007)). The availability of bonus pay thus has the potential to fundamentally change rms'


contract enforcement policies in a repeated game setting. Furthermore, the availability of


bonus pay may be crucial for determining the impact of dismissal barriers, to the extent that


it provides rms with an alternative incentive device to threat of ring.


  We begin by establishing a baseline condition (T-Baseline) in which there are no dismissal


barriers and no bonus pay. We use as our workhorse the experimental framework of Brown,


Falk, and Fehr (2004), in which rms and workers can endogenously form long-term rela-


tionships. Firms oer contracts involving a wage and a desired eort, and after accepting a


contract workers choose their eort level, which is unenforceable.


  Despite the contract enforcement problem, eort levels in T-Baseline are on average quite


high.    High eorts are observed mainly in long-term relationships.                 This reects a policy


of rms paying rents relative to unemployment, and credibly ring poor performers. These


ndings corroborate those of Brown, Falk, and Fehr (2004), and show the central importance


of ring threat as an incentive device. This sets the stage for exploring our main research


questions.


  We implement a second treatment (T-Barrier) in which there is a dismissal institution


present in the market, such that only the worker can end a relationship once the rm chooses


to hire the worker two times in a row. The rst time a rm hires a worker thus corresponds to


a probation period, in which ring is still possible. Firms are also restricted in their ability


to lower wages once they trigger dismissal protection by engaging in the second consecutive

                                                                                2
contract, to rule out de facto dismissal by reducing wages to zero.


  We predict three main eects of the dismissal barrier institution.                  The rst is a nega-


tive incentive eect, due to removal of ring threat as an incentive.                 Consistent with this

2Most   legal jurisdictions view the reduction of wages to zero as equivalent to ring a worker.
                        INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT                                3

prediction, average eort levels in long-term relationships are far below those observed in


the baseline condition, which also leads to lower market eciency. A second prediction is


a probation period eect, such that worker eort is especially high in the probation period,


due to the added attractiveness of enticing rms into long-term relationships, and then drops


sharply once the worker is re-hired. Indeed, this pattern is pervasive in T-Barrier, whereas


in the baseline condition the opposite pattern is observed. The third prediction concerns a


set of related eects on relationship-formation: rms are predicted to be more reluctant to


enter relationships in a market with dismissal barriers, because of the incentive problem; the


prediction for turnover is ambiguous, because the tendency to engage in more one-shot inter-


actions is potentially oset by the tendency for relationships that do form not to break up;


dismissal barriers are predicted to have a systematic eect on the shape of the distribution


for relationship lengths in the market, leading to more very short and also more very long


relationships. Observed behavior is supportive of all these relationship formation eects.


  In a third treatment (T-Barrier-Bonus) we implement both dismissal barriers and the


option for rms to oer contractually non-enforceable bonuses as part of the initial contract.


After observing worker performance, rms can decide how much of a bonus to actually pay.


  The impact of dismissal barriers is dramatically altered by the presence of bonus pay.


Firms credibly reward worker performance by paying bonuses, and this additional incentive


device essentially eliminates the problem of worker shirking in long-term relationships, de-


spite the absence of ring threat. Market eciency is also substantially improved, and the


probation period eect on eort dynamics disappears. Relationship formation remains sig-


nicantly dierent from baseline, however, with rms being less prone to enter relationships,


despite the fact that worker performance in long-term relationships is no worse than in the


baseline condition. One potential explanation for this latter nding is that bonus pay causes
                        INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT                                4

rms to rely less on relational incentives in general, because bonus pay and relationships act


as substitute incentive devices. This latter explanation cannot be veried without introduc-


ing a fourth treatment, where there is bonus pay but no confounding eect of a dismissal


institution.


  We briey investigate behavior in such a treatment (T-Bonus).         Firms are much less


prone to initiate long-term relationships when bonus pay is available, compared to the case


where there is no bonus pay, indicating that bonus pay and relational incentives are in


fact substitutes. Interestingly, T-Bonus also shows that in the absence of dismissal barriers


bonus pay does not have a strong advantage over wage contracts as a way of eliciting worker


performance.   In the absence of dismissal barriers, the additional option to pay bonuses


improves market eciency only marginally compared to a case (T-Baseline) where rms


must rely on the combination of wages and ring threat.


  Taken together, the ndings shed light on how enforcement behavior interacts with the


surrounding institutional environment. The negative incentive eect of dismissal barriers de-


pends on the exibility of the contracting technology, but while introducing contractual exi-


bility reduces negative eciency consequences, in other ways contract enforcement strategies


are left fundamentally changed. Though institutions impose constraints on contract enforce-


ment strategies, agents are not passive, but respond by nding dierent avenues for solving


incentive problems.   In other words, understanding strategic interactions within rms re-


quires an appreciation of the institutions in which contractual relations are embedded, and


at the same time, understanding the impact of institutions requires an appreciation of how


they interact with details of rms' contract enforcement strategies.


  Substantial progress has been made in previous theoretical work on the interplay of con-


tract enforcement and institutions, in settings with repeated interactions. Beginning with
                           INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT                                         5

Telser (1980), there have been a number of contributions that use repeated game theory


to model the enforcement of incomplete contracts.             Klein and Leer (1981), Shapiro and


Stiglitz (1984) and Bowles (1985) show that the use of a high wage with the threat of ring


can ensure performance. Bull (1987) and MacLeod and Malcomson (1989) introduce bonus


pay to the model, and show that a similar result holds, while Levin (2003) extends these


models to allow for asymmetric information in addition to contract incompleteness. These


papers restrict attention to the case of risk neutral agents, for which bonus pay does not typ-


ically play a substantive role in ensuring eciency. Rather, in the spirit of the folk theorem


(Fudenberg and Maskin (1986)), there are many possible ecient equilibria. What bonus

                                                                                 3
pay does is aect the distribution of the surplus between the worker and the rm.


  MacLeod and Malcomson (1998) show, in contrast, how the division of surplus can have


eciency consequences, depending upon the relative supply of workers and capital. In par-


ticular, when capital is in short supply, then it is ecient to have it fully utilized, which is


possible under an eciency wage contract, but not under a bonus pay contract. Our experi-


mental market corresponds to the case of a shortage of capital, given that the number of jobs


is always less than the number of workers. Thus, the theory predicts that the equilibrium


with eciency wage contracts should be much more ecient, whereas we nd that both wage


contracts and bonus contracts yield similar performance (in the absence of barriers).


  There are a number of reasons why standard theory does not explain our results. First,


it is assumed that agents are innitely lived, while in practice and in our experiments all


relationships are necessarily of nite duration. Without additional assumptions, all of these


theories predict a dismal level of minimum eciency in all of our treatments, due to standard




3Baker, Gibbons, and Murphy (1994) show that bonus pay has an important impact on surplus when the
rm also has available objective measures of performance. Pearce and Stacchetti (1998) extend these results
to the case of risk averse agents.

backwards induction arguments. From previous experimental evidence on contract enforce-


ment behavior (e.g., Fehr, Kirchsteiger, and Riedl (1993); Fehr and Falk (1999)), however,


it is known that in practice non-minimal eciency is typically achieved even in one-shot in-


teractions with incomplete contracts. Beginning with Kreps, Milgrom, Roberts, and Wilson


(1982), it is well know that such behavior is consistent with the hypothesis that individuals


have social preferences that incorporate factors other than the pecuniary returns from a


decision.   The diculty is that we do not have an established model of these preferences,


and hence as Fehr, Klein, and Schmidt (2007) observe, it is necessary to use experimental


evidence to uncover how specic institutions will work with human subjects.


  There are previous experimental studies on contract enforcement behavior, but to our


knowledge none on the important topic of how dismissal barriers aect contract enforce-


ment, or on how the impact of dismissal barriers depends on other institutional features,


such as availability of bonus pay. This is partly because until recently experimental studies


have focused almost exclusively on static settings, whereas studying the incentive eects of

                                                                                    4
dismissal barriers requires a setting with repeated interactions by its very nature. Although


the focus of our paper is on the interaction of dismissal barriers and bonus pay, our results


also complement the experimental literature studying the question of how bonus contracts


perform relative to wage contracts. Fehr, GÃ¤chter, and Kirchsteiger (1997) and Fehr, Klein,


and Schmidt (2007) nd that bonus contracts perform much better than wage contracts in


terms of eciency, in one-shot interactions.         Our results qualify these ndings somewhat,


showing that in a repeated game setting bonus contracts perform only slightly better than


wage contracts, with the dierence narrowing over time. The key dierence is that in re-


peated game settings rms can combine wage contracts with threat of ring, whereas in



4Wu  and Roe (2007) also use the repeated-interaction framework of Brown, Falk, and Fehr (2004), but focus
on varying the degree of incompleteness in contracts.

one-shot games worker performance under a wage contract depends solely on altruistic or


reciprocal motives of the worker. On the other hand, our ndings show that bonus pay does


have large benets relative to wage contracts, even in repeated game settings, if there are


some barriers to dismissal in the market.


      The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the experiment, and Sec-


tion 3 outlines predictions for behavior. Section 4 presents results, and Section 5 concludes.




                                         2.   The Experiment
2.1. Design. The labor market operated for 18 trading periods. In each period a rm could


hire at most one worker, and a worker could have at most one job. An individual period


involved two or three phases, depending on the treatment.               The rst phase was always a


market phase, in which the rms made contract oers and workers could only accept or


reject. Firms could make as many contract oers as they wanted during the time limit of


three minutes; if one of a rm's contracts was accepted, all of the other oers by that rm

                                                   5
were immediately removed from the market.              In the case that a rm and a worker agreed on


a contract, they entered a second phase in which the worker could decide how much eort,                  e

to exert. In treatments where the contract oer could include an oered bonus, there was a


third phase in which the rm was informed about the worker's eort choice and could decide


how much of a bonus,       b,   to pay. Importantly, neither the worker's eort level or the rm's


bonus payment were restricted by the initial contract agreement, whereas a wage specied


in the agreement was binding.          After the second (third) phase, the rm and worker were


informed about their prots and earnings, respectively, and then a new period began.



5Ifall rms had contracts, there was no potential for further trades. Thus, the market phase was designed to
end automatically after three minutes, or after the last rm had a contract oer accepted, whichever came
rst.
                          INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT                                     8

  Contract oers consisted of a wage,    w,   a desired eort level,   eÌ,   and in some treatments


an oered bonus,   bÌ.   The oer also included the rm's ID number. Firms could make two


types of contract oers during the market phase: public oers or private oers. Public oers


were observed by all workers, and thus could be accepted by any worker.               Private oers


were observed only by a worker specied by the rm, and thus were available only to that


particular worker. In the case that a rm made a private oer, the rm specied a worker's ID


number, in addition to the contract terms. Worker and rm ID numbers remained constant


over the entire 18 periods, so it was possible for a rm to intentionally make a private oer


to the same worker over multiple periods, and for a worker to recognize oers coming from


a specic rm. This design made it possible for a rm and worker to endogenously form a


long-term relationship, by choosing to repeatedly engage in private-oer contracts with each


other over multiple periods. Public oers were a way for rms to engage in a spot market


for labor rather than engaging in long-term relationships. During the market phase, rms


were kept constantly informed about which workers had already accepted a contract, so as


to avoid having rms make a private oer to a worker that was no longer available.


  In treatments with the dismissal barrier institution, a rm lost the ability to re a worker


in the case that in two consecutive periods the worker had accepted a private oer from


that rm. In other words, if a worker accepted a private oer from a rm in period           t,   and


then accepted a second private oer from the same rm in period         t + 1, the dismissal barrier

took eect and only the worker could then end the relationship. In our experiment we thus


eectively set the cost of ring to innity. Disallowing ring, as opposed to introducing an


additional parameter capturing a nite cost of ring, has the advantage of simplifying an


already complex choice situation.    It also provides a particularly tough test of the ability


of bonus pay to overcome the eects of dismissal barriers.         The fact that the dismissal
                           INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT                                         9

barrier was activated only with the second consecutive contract captures a common feature


of EPL institutions, which is an initial probation period, during which the rm is still able


to re the worker. It also has an analogue in situations where there are relationship-specic


investments that increase ring costs, but where investments are made only after an initial


probation period.


  Having chosen to hire the worker again, after the initial private oer, the dismissal barrier


took eect and the rm had to make an oer to that same worker at the beginning of each


subsequent period until the end of the game or until the worker decided to reject the rm's


oer. Firms who had chosen to trigger the dismissal barrier made subsequent oers to the


same worker in a special phase before the market phase.                 Importantly, once the dismissal


barrier was activated, the wage oer had to be at least as high as in the previous period. Some


rigidity of the wage is required for a dismissal protection institution to work, otherwise a rm

                                                                    6
could eectively re a worker by reducing the wage to zero.             After rms had made their oers


required by the dismissal barrier institution, the market period began and workers protected


by the dismissal barrier could see the standing oer from their own rm, in addition to the


other market activity.      At any time, the worker could accept the standing oer, in which


case the rm was informed.         Alternatively, the worker could reject the oer by accepting


another contract in the market. As soon as the worker rejected the standing oer, the rm


was informed, and allowed to make oers during the remainder of the market phase.


  In our design the eort cost function for workers, described below, is the same across


all individuals so there are no dierences in ability. This allows us to focus on the moral


hazard problem in terms of eort and bonus payment, without the complication of adverse


selection in terms of ability. We also do not implement cyclical shocks to market conditions,

protection. See Black's Law Dictionary.

or worker redundancies (multiple workers at one rm). This simplies an already complex


inter-temporal choice environment, and makes it possible to rst understand the impact of


dismissal barriers on the strategic behavior surrounding the contract enforcement problem.


  We implemented four treatments, as summarized in Table 1.                   In a treatment called T-


Baseline, contracts consisted of a binding wage,         w,   and a desired eort level,    eÌ.   There was


no dismissal barrier institution in the market, so rms could engage in as many private oers


in a row with a worker as they wanted, while always having the option to not re-hire the

                                                                              7
worker, i.e., not make the worker a private oer in the next period.              In T-Barrier, contracts


had the same form, but we introduced our dismissal barrier institution. In T-Barrier-Bonus,


the dismissal barrier institution was in eect, but rms had the option to oer a bonus,                  bÌ,

in addition to a wage. In T-Bonus, there was no dismissal barrier, but rms had the option


to oer bonuses.

  where      c(e)   was a cost of eort function, and   5   was the unemployment benet in the case


that a worker did not engage in a trade. The wage, the oered bonus, and the bonus actually


paid,   b,   could each take on an integer value     0, 1, 2, ...100.   The desired eort level and the


actual eort level chosen by the worker,       e, could take on integer values 1, 2, ..., 10.   The eort


cost function is shown in Table 2. The cost function is increasing and convex. Because the


marginal cost of eort is at most       3,   while the marginal benet to a rm is always         10,   the


ecient eort level is      10.

  Payo functions for workers and rms, including the eort cost function, were common


knowledge.       Participants were aware that the market would last 18 periods.            Reputations


could form bi-laterally: rms learned about the eort choices of workers that they traded


with, but did not observe eort choices or bonus decisions, in interactions that they were


not a part of; workers learned about the bonus decisions of rms that they encountered, but


not about worker eort choices or rm bonus decisions in other market interactions. Firms


observed all public oers on the market during the market phase. Workers were informed not


only about private oers they had received, but also about all public oers on the market.


  The experiment was computerized using Z-Tree software (Fischbacher (2007)). There was


an unpaid practice period before the experiment began, which consisted only of a market


phase but not the subsequent eort or bonus phases, to give subjects experience with the


process of making and accepting oers. After the practice period, the rst period of the paid


experiment began. At the end of each period, a subject's period prots were summarized,
                       INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT                                  12

along with the prots of the trading partner in the case of a trade.      Subjects were also


reminded of the partner's ID number, the terms of the initial contract, the actual eort


choice, and the actual bonus paid.    Subjects could record this information on a separate


sheet of paper, ensuring that subjects were fully informed about their own trading history


over the course of the experiment. The experiment was framed neutrally, in terms of buyers


and sellers rather than workers and rms. Eort was referred to as quality. This facilitates


comparison with Brown, Falk, and Fehr (2004). who used the same neutral framing. Fehr,


Klein, and Schmidt (2007) show, however, that whether one uses framing as buyers and


sellers, or workers and rms, is irrelevant for behavior in this class of experimental market


settings. Representative instructions are provided in an appendix at the end of the paper.


  There were 408 participants in the experiment (see Table 1). We conducted six market


sessions for each of the four treatments, for a total of twenty-four sessions. Subjects were


students at the University of Bonn, from various elds of study.     No subject participated


in more than one session. On average, a session lasted roughly 100 minutes, and a subject


earned 25 Euros (approximately 32 USD).




                                      3.   Predictions
  If it is common knowledge that workers and rms are motivated only by their own material


payos, then the prediction for behavior in T-Baseline involves a very inecient outcome.


Workers will choose   e=1   in the nal period, regardless of the agreed-upon contract   {w, ee}.

Firms will nd it optimal in the nal period to oer wages that just compensate the worker


for the outside option. All seven contract oers will be accepted. By backward induction,


the same outcome will be realized in all previous periods, with the small surplus generated


by the workers' minimal eort being claimed entirely by the rms.
                        INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT                               13

  If material self-interest of rms and workers is not common knowledge, however, predic-


tions change dramatically. Brown, Falk, and Fehr (2004) show theoretically that a sucient


number of fair-minded subjects, who respond to generous wages with high eort even in the


absence of strategic incentives to do so, is sucient to sustain an equilibrium in which all


workers provide high eort levels in early market periods, and only the fair workers provide


non-minimal eort in the nal market period. The key mechanism for eliciting high eort


from selsh workers (selsh in the sense of caring only about own material payos) is the


existence of a rent in the nal period, which arises because the presence of some fair workers


makes it protable (and therefore credible) for rms to pay generous wages even when there


is no prospect for future interactions.   The possibility of a future rent, and the threat of


ring, discipline even selsh workers in the second-to-last period. Because only the future


rent matters for selsh workers' incentives, rms could be expected to pay a low or zero rent


in period 17. Given the plausible belief that the lack of a rent in the current period signals


that a rm will not pay a rent in the future, however, rms will have an incentive to pay a


rent even in this period.


  MacLeod (2007) observes that the key feature in this argument is the existence of some rent


in the last period, which may also be generated by individuals who have taste for performing


as promised. This implies that in the second to last period, regardless of one's type, there


will be a gain from continuing the relationship. MacLeod (2007) shows that a backwards


induction argument implies that one very quickly obtains performance that is close to the


rst best in earlier periods.


  These observations lead to several qualitative predictions for contract enforcement be-


havior in T-Baseline. Firms are predicted to trade repeatedly with the same worker if he


performed well in the past. For this reason rms will rely on private oers, because in the
                        INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT                                14

case of public oers rms make the oer available to all workers regardless of past perfor-


mance. In order for the possibility of future interactions to provide an incentive, the rm


will need to pay a generous wage that oers a rent relative to being unemployed, and thus


workers are predicted to gain some of the surplus from trade. Some workers are predicted


to perform well even in the nal period, in response to a generous wage, reecting fair-


ness concerns. Other workers who are concerned only with material payos will imitate fair


workers in early market periods, but will reduce eort to the minimum in the nal market


period when the threat of ring no longer has an impact. These predictions are part of a


particular equilibrium, but it is well known that in repeated games there exists a plethora


of equilibria (see, e.g., Fudenberg and Maskin (1986)). This highlights the need to perform


an experiment, in order to determine which equilibrium is selected. Brown, Falk, and Fehr


(2004) nd empirical support for these predictions, and our analysis in T-Baseline replicates


their results, setting the stage for answering our main research questions.


  The rst question is how a dismissal barrier institution aects contract enforcement be-


havior in a setting with incomplete contracts and repeated interactions. We identify three


main predictions regarding the impact of dismissal barriers. The rst prediction is a nega-


tive incentive eect: in long-term relationships, the dismissal barrier institution removes the


threat of ring as an incentive device; as a result, selsh workers are predicted to shirk in


long-term relationships in T-Barrier, leading to lower eort levels than in T-Baseline. The


second prediction is a probation period eect   :   dismissal barriers are predicted to change


eort dynamics, such that eort is especially high in the initial probation period, because


workers have a greater benet from entering long-term relationships, and then drops sharply


once the rm commits do a long-term relationship, due to the removal of ring threat as an
                        INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT                               15

incentive. The third prediction concerns relationship formation eects. Firms face a distri-


bution of worker types, some who perform in the absence of ring threat and some who do


not, but the fact that average performance declines in long-run relationships is predicted to


make rms more reluctant to enter long-term relationships in T-Barrier than in T-Baseline.


The implication for the average length of relationships is ambiguous. Relationship avoidance


creates a larger number of one-shot relationships, but dismissal barriers imply that relation-


ships that do form are likely to be long lasting, because rms are unable to re workers. The


unambiguous prediction is a change in the distribution of relationship lengths, such that the


distribution has more very short but also more long lasting relationships in T-Barrier.


  The next question is how the impact of dismissal barriers interacts with the addition of


bonus pay.   In line with evidence from one-shot settings (Fehr, GÃ¤chter, and Kirchsteiger


(1997)), rms are predicted to pay bonuses for performing workers, creating a credible in-


centive for workers to perform even in the absence of ring threat. As a result, rms are


predicted to circumvent the negative incentive eect of dismissal barriers by using bonus


pay, so that eort in long-term relations is higher in T-Barrier-Bonus than in T-Barrier.


Furthermore, because incentives are high powered even after the probation period, there


will be a less pronounced probation eect in T-Barrier-Bonus compared to T-Barrier. The


prediction for relationship formation is ambiguous. On the one hand, rms should be less


reluctant to enter relationships since the hold-up problem is mitigated. On the other hand


they have another incentive tool at their disposal, and therefore may rely less on relational


contracting in the rst place.


  This latter point raises the question how contract enforcement is aected by bonus pay in


general, i.e., in the absence of dismissal barriers. Shorter relationships in T-Barrier-Bonus
                              INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT                                      16

could reect a general tendency for bonus pay to lead rms to substitute away from rela-


tional incentives. This cannot be answered by T-Barrier-Bonus, because of the confounding


presence of dismissal barriers, and requires the fourth treatment T-Bonus. In the nal results


section we briey discuss the impact of bonus pay per se on contract enforcement, compared


to T-Baseline.




                                               4.   Results
4.1. Contract Enforcement in the Baseline Condition. To set the stage, we rst study


T-Baseline, where there is no dismissal barrier institution and no bonus pay. A rst obser-


vation is that worker eort levels in T-Baseline are quite high, despite the fact that the


sub-game perfect prediction for the stage game is an eort level of 1. The modal eort level


across all periods is   10,   the median is   7,   and the mean is    6.39   (these values are very similar


to those obtained in Brown, Falk, and Fehr (2004)). The question then is how rms elicit


relatively high worker eort levels, in spite of the contract enforcement problem.


     One clue is that high eort levels are mainly observed in private oer contracts, which


are typically part of long-term relationships. Long-term relationships arise when a rm and


worker endogenously choose to engage in sequence of two or more consecutive private oer


contracts with each other. Of all contracts,         67 percent are private oers, and of these roughly

64   percent end up being part of a relationship lasting at least 5 periods. The level of eort


in a given interaction is also strongly predictive of the ultimate length of the relationship:


the correlation between eort and ultimate length is           0.64   (Spearman;     p < 0.001)

     Figure 1 shows that high eort levels and long-lasting relationships go together, due to


the contract enforcement strategy of rms: rms continue a relationship only in the case


that the worker performed well in the previous period. For low eort levels, the probability


that the rm terminates the relationship is close to 1, and for the maximum eort level the
                               INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT                                            17

probability is close to zero.          We also estimated a Probit regression, where the dependent


variable is 1 in the case a worker is not rehired with a private oer and zero otherwise, and


nd that the estimated impact of an additional unit of eort in the previous period on the


probability of termination is          â0.104 (p < 0.001;   robust s.e., clustering on session).




     [Figure 1 about here]




     The policy of credibly punishing poor performance with termination provides a material


incentive for workers to perform, if workers nd continuing the relationship more attractive


than the alternative. The alternatives are either accepting a public oer, if one is available,


or unemployment. In fact, workers in private oer contracts earn               34.75 on average, compared

to   24.06   in public-oer interactions, or 5 from being unemployed. A similar picture emerges


when one considers the         total    rents from being hired with a private oer in a given market


period. For each period         t   we calculate a proxy for total rents by summing up current and


future earnings, from      t   to   T = 18,    for all workers who are in a private oer contract in


period     t.   We compare the average of this value for a given period, denoted                  Vpriv ,   to the


average current and future earnings of workers who are in a public oer contract in the


same period, and workers who are unemployed, denoted                    Vpub   and   Vu ,   respectively.     The


dierences      Vpriv â Vpub   and   Vpriv â Vu   are positive in every market period.           Thus, threat


of ring serves as a credible incentive device, because ring imposes a cost on workers in


the form of foregone rents.            Workers earn a sizable rent even in the nal period, which is


important for sustaining an equilibrium with high eort levels in early periods.                       Workers


earn rents, despite putting in high eort, because rms pay substantially higher (eciency)


wages in long-term relationships: median wages are              55   in private oer contracts, compared


to   30   in public oer contracts, or unemployment benets of            5.   Long-term relationships are
                                INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT                                      18

also protable for rms. Average rm prots in private oer contracts are                29.84,   compared


to   13.05   in public oer contracts.


     Underlining the importance of threat of ring,        58.33   percent of workers who are re-hired


in the nal period reduce eort relative to their eort in period 17, and           35.71 percent choose

an eort level of     1,   despite having chosen an eort of        10   in the previous period.        Firms


reduce wages somewhat in the nal period, perhaps anticipating this behavior, but there is

                                                                                                    8
a signicant drop in eort, even controlling for dierences in oered contract terms.


     A sub-sample of workers performs well in response to generous wages, even in the nal


market period. Regressing eort levels in the nal period on wages yields a positive coe-


cient on wages of     0.185,     signicant at the one percent level (interval regression; robust s.e.,

                            9
clustering on session).         This behavior is consistent with previous evidence indicating that


some individuals have reciprocal inclinations, rewarding generous wages with high eort,


even in the absence of strategic considerations (for a review see Fehr and GÃ¤chter (2000)).


Thus, although threat of ring is clearly important for motivating many of the worker sub-


jects, for a sub-population fairness concerns are also relevant. The presence of such types is


important for deriving the equilibrium described in Section 3.


     In summary, rms use a combination of rents and threat of ring to solve the contract


enforcement problem in T-Baseline, consistent with the disciplining version of eciency wage


theory (Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984)). At the same time, the ndings are also supportive of the


fairness version of eciency wage theory (Akerlof (1982), Akerlof and Yellen (1990)), in the




8This result is based on using the sample of contracts concluded in period 17 and 18, and regressing the
dierence in eort between period 18 and period 17 on a dummy variable for nal period, wages, desired
eort, and a constant. The OLS estimate for the nal-period dummy isâ3.004 (p < 0.008; robust s.e.,
clustering on session), indicating that eort drops signicantly in period 18 relative to 17, controlling for
contract oers in period 17 and 18.

sense that a sub-population responds to generous wages with high eort even without ring


threat. These results provide a baseline for investigation of our main research questions.



4.2. Contract Enforcement and Dismissal Barriers. We now turn to how dismissal


barriers aect the strategic interactions of workers and rms, in an eciency wage setting.


We compare behavior in T-Baseline to behavior in T-Barrier, exploiting the exogenous vari-


ation in the presence of a dismissal barrier institution across treatments, while the form of


the labor contract (xed wages and no bonus pay) is held constant.


  The rst way in which dismissal barriers are predicted to aect the equilibrium described


in Section 3 is by creating a negative incentive eect, such that (self-interested) workers


are more prone to shirk in long-term relationships.             Long-term relationships are dened


as interactions that involve at least two consecutive private oer contracts between the


same worker and rm.         Average eort in long-term relationships is          8.4   in T-Baseline but


only   5.5   in T-Barrier, providing initial support for the prediction. This dierence is highly


statistically signicant using each session as one independent observation (Mann-Whitney;


p < 0.01).10      Median eorts are also strikingly dierent,         10   and   5,   respectively (Mann-


Whitney;      p < 0.012).   Figure 2 shows that the eort dierences in long-term relationships


are large and stable across market periods, with eort being lower in T-Barrier than in


T-Baseline in every market period.




  [Figure 2 about here]




  Table 3 investigates this issue using regression analysis. The dependent variable in each


column is worker eort in trades occurring as part of a long-term relationship, and coecients


are marginal eects from interval regressions, to account for the fact that the dependent

robust, and are adjusted for clustering on session to account for possible correlation of error

                                   12
terms within a given session.           In Column (1), we regress eort on a dummy for T-Barrier


and a constant (omitted category is T-Baseline). The coecient on the treatment dummy is


negative and highly signicant, indicating that dismissal barriers lead to lower eort levels


in long-term relationships. The treatment eect remains negative and signicant in Column


(2) where we control for other factors that might aect eort: wages, desired eort, and a


time trend.




  [Table 3 about here]




  If the drop in eort reects the removal of ring threat as an incentive device, we should


observe less of a dierence in one-shot interactions, where the institution does not aect


ability to dismiss poor performers. Estimating similar regression to those in Table 3, but


using worker eort decisions in one-shot interactions (public oer, or private oer contracts


that are not renewed), we do not observe a decit in T-Barrier eort levels relative to T-


Baseline.    In fact, eort levels are somewhat higher in one-shot interactions in T-Barrier


than in T-Baseline.       Later in the analysis we turn to possible reasons for the even better


performance of workers in one-shot interactions in T-Barrier. The important point for the


issue at hand is that eort levels are lower in T-Barrier precisely in situations where the

treating each value as a left and right censored observation coming from an interval with known bounds. Error
terms are assumed to be normally distributed. For more information, see the STATA reference manual on
the intreg procedure listed under Tobit estimation. We nd similar results if we instead estimate regressions
using OLS.
12In this and other regressions, our conclusions are similar if we do not adjust for clustering, although
standard errors are typically smaller and eects are even more signicant.

institution makes a dierence for ring threat, consistent with the negative incentive eect


prediction.


     It is noteworthy that aggregate eciency is substantially lower in T-Barrier than in T-


Baseline, indicating that the negative incentive eect in long-term relationships dominates


any tendency for dismissal barriers to enhance performance in one-shot interactions. Figure


3 shows the total economic surplus generated by trades in a given market period (averaged

                                                                      13
across sessions), relative to the maximum possible surplus.                Whereas eciency is      63.86

percent of the maximum in T-Baseline overall, eciency is substantially lower in T-Barrier,


about   52 percent, and the dierence is growing over time.       Starting around period 6, eciency


in T-Baseline begins to climb steeply, as relationships begin to form, and leaves eciency in


T-Barrier behind. From period 10 through 17, for example, eciency in T-Baseline is about


19   percentage points, or   34   percent, higher than in T-Barrier (Mann-Whitney;          p < 0.05).



     [Figure 3 about here]




Result 1: In a market with wage contracts, dismissal barriers cause signicantly lower
worker eort levels in long-term relationships, and lower market eciency.

     The next prediction concerns the dynamics of worker eort provision.                 The dismissal


barrier institution prevents rms from using the threat of ring once a rm chooses to


extend the relationship beyond the initial private oer contract, which we refer to as the


probation period. Workers are predicted to sharply reduce eort relative to performance


in the probation period, as soon as they are oered and accept a second private oer in


a row from the same rm.           This behavior would also shed further light on the negative

incentive eect of the dismissal institution, by conrming that the lower eort levels in long-


term relationships in T-Barrier reect a within-individual moral hazard response, rather than


other potential factors, for example a dierent composition of types who end up in long-term


relationships in T-Barrier.


  The probability of an eort drop is much larger in T-Barrier than in T-Baseline, and the


size of the dierence is also larger, supporting the prediction. The unconditional probability


that a worker reduces eort in the second period of a relationship is   0.54,   compared to   0.23,

in T-Baseline.   Furthermore, the average drop is equal to     â1.57    in T-Barrier, while the


average change in eort is actually positive in T-Baseline, equal to   0.11.

  Figure 4 compares median eort, and also the distribution of eort, before and after


the probation period.   The sample is restricted to individuals who are ultimately rehired


after the probationary period, so results for probationary and all later periods are based on


the same sample of individuals. The boxes indicate the inter-quartile ranges (25th to 75th


percentile) of the eort distributions, and the circular markers indicate the median eort


levels. In T-Barrier, median eort drops sharply in later relationship periods relative to the


probation period, and there is a substantial increase in the variance of eort. The opposite


pattern is observed in T-Baseline.   Results are similar if we instead compare eort in the


probation period to eort in the second period of relationships only; the drop in eort in


T-Barrier is immediate, occurring as soon as the probation period is passed, whereas eort


increases in T-Baseline (see also Table 4, where we focus on comparing eort in the second


relationship period to eort in the probation period).     Thus, dismissal barriers lead to a


post-probation-period drop in median eort, and an increase in eort variance in long-term


relationships.

  The distribution in Figure 4 also reveals that there are still some workers in T-Barrier


who choose close to maximum eort. This is consistent with the presence of some fair types


who perform well even when dismissal barriers eliminate ring threat.




  [Figure 4 about here]




  Table 4 investigates the probation period eect on eort dynamics using regression anal-


ysis. The sample comprises all private-oer contracts taking place in the second period of a


long-term relationship. The dependent variable in each column is equal to 1 if eort dropped


relative to the rst period of the relationship, and zero otherwise. Coecients are marginal


eects. Column (1) indicates that the probability of eort dropping is signicantly larger in


T-Barrier compared to T-Baseline, and Column (2) shows that this is still true conditioning


on characteristics of the previous period interaction, and the contract terms in the current


period, as well as a time trend.




  [Table 4 about here]




  Dismissal barriers are also predicted to have an impact on the level of eort in the initial


probation period, because workers are willing to work even harder to entice the rm into


making a second private oer. This motivation comes from the fact that workers anticipate


enjoying a stronger strategic position once they get to enter a long-term relationship. Re-


turning to Figure 4, it is evident that median eort is in fact higher in the probation period


in T-Barrier, compared to the initial period of a relationship in T-Baseline.     An interval
                            INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT                                           24

regression using only initial private oer contracts that subsequently lead to long-term rela-


tionships shows that the eort level is higher by         0.629 points on average after controlling for
                                                                                                      14
wages, desired eort, and a time trend (p         < 0.017;   robust s.e., clustering on session).


  This suggests that dismissal barriers might also aect the type of workers who enter long-


term relationships. For example, workers who are strategic and motivated only by material


payos might be better at signaling to rms during the probation period that they have


an intention to work hard in long-term relationships. One way to assess the proportion of


selsh versus fair types who end up in long-term relationships is to look at the sensitivity of


eort levels to wages in the nal market period. The greater the fraction of selsh workers,


the less sensitive eort should be to high wage oers. Using all private oer contracts in the


nal period, which were part of an on-going relationship in the previous period, we regressed


eort on wages (interval regression; robust s.e. clustering on session). The impact of wages


is positive but not signicant in T-Barrier (p         < 0.124),   whereas the impact of wages on and


signicant in T-Baseline (p      < 0.001).15    Thus, there is some suggestive evidence of a type of


adverse selection, in terms of worker propensity to shirk, despite the fact that cost functions


are held constant and thus there is no scope for adverse selection in the typical sense of


worker ability dierences.




14As noted above in our analysis of the negative incentive eect, eort levels in one-shot interactions are
also higher in T-Barrier than in T-Baseline, and signicantly so. With the exception of trades occurring in
period 18, where there is no potential for being re-hired, these one-shot interactions can also be interpreted
as probation periods, albeit ones that were unsuccessful. We estimate an interval regression where the
dependent variable is worker eort levels in one-shot interactions, excluding trades in period 18, and nd
that eort is higher in T-Barrier than in T-Baseline: the dierence in eort levels is 0.879 (p < 0.044; robust
s.e., clustering on session). This behavior is consistent with the existence of a heterogeneous population of
types and the fact that individuals understand this, and therefore attempt to signal their good characteristics
with high eort during the probation period.
15It turns out that in T-Barrier and T-Baseline, the number of private-oer contracts in long-term relation-
ships in period 18 is exactly the same, so the dierence in signicance levels does not simply reect dierent
number of observations.
                         INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT                                  25

Result 2: In a market with wage contracts dismissal barriers there is a probation period
eect, such that workers reduce eort sharply as soon as the rm triggers dismissal barriers
by re-hiring the worker beyond the initial contract. The variance of eort also increases. In
the absence of dismissal barriers the opposite pattern occurs. Dismissal barriers also have
an additional, positive incentive eect, such that the level of eort in the probation period is
even higher than in a market without dismissal barriers.




  Although rms face a distribution of worker types, and thus uncertainty about the out-


come of entering a long-term relationship, the fact that on average performance suers is


predicted to make rms less likely to enter relationships in the rst place. Consistent with


the prediction of relationship avoidance we nd that 58 percent of all contracts were in one-


shot interactions in T-Barrier, compared to 48 percent in T-Baseline. Even more tellingly,


we observe 23 percent of all rms in T-Barrier pursuing a strategy of strict relationship-


avoidance, never making two private oers in a row to the same worker, during the entire


game.   This contrasts with only 9 percent of rms exhibiting this strategy in T-Baseline


where dismissal barriers are absent. Put another way, the probability that a rm has never


been in a long-term relationship as of market period    t is consistently higher in T-Barrier than

in T-Baseline. We estimate a Cox proportional hazard model, and nd that this survival


probability is higher in T-Barrier compared to T-Baseline. This dierence is only marginally


signicant overall (p   < 0.07;   robust s.e., clustering on session), reecting the fact that the


survival probabilities are close to 1 in both treatments for the rst few market periods; in


general long-term relationships do not form until after the rst few market periods, during


which rms appear to engage in a process of search. Considering market periods beyond pe-


riod 5, however, the survival probability decreases sharply in T-Baseline whereas the decline
                           INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT                                        26

is slower in T-Barrier, leading to a large dierence that is statistically signicant at the ve


percent level (p   < 0.043;   robust s.e., clustering on session).


  The barrier institution prevents rms from dismissing workers, which makes it less likely


that relationships that do form will break up. This latter tendency is reinforced by the fact


that workers essentially never quit once they are protected by dismissal barriers. Workers


opt out of a relationship protected by dismissal barriers in only       3   out of   283   such contracts,


which is understandable given that in T-Barrier worker earnings are about             48 percent higher

on average in long-term relationships than in one-shot interactions. It turns out that the


rate of turnover, measured as the average length of a relationship, is essentially the same in


T-Barrier and T-Baseline:      5.99 periods versus 5.89.   Thus, the resulting stability of long-term


relationships happens to just oset the tendency for rms to avoid relationships.


  Figure 5 shows that dismissal barriers change the distribution of relationship lengths in


the market. The fractions of relationships in the two most extreme categories, which include


one-shot interactions or long-term relationships lasting 14 periods or more, respectively, are


higher in T-Barrier than in T-Baseline.         The opposite is true for the three intermediate


categories of relationship lengths. A Probit regression shows that probability of observing a


relationship in one of the two extreme categories is signicantly higher in T-Barrier than in


T-Baseline (p   < 0.001;   robust s.e., clustering on session).




  [Figure 5 about here]




Result 3 : In a market with wage contracts, rms are more reluctant to enter long-term
relationships in the presence of the dismissal barrier institution. They also cannot terminate
relationships, and as a consequence the distribution of relationship lengths in the market
                            INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT                                         27

becomes more bi-modal at the extremes, with more one-shot interactions but also more very
long relationships.


4.3. Dismissal Barriers and Bonus Pay. In T-Barrier-Bonus, we add the option for


rms to pay bonuses.        For bonus pay to serve as an incentive device, rms must credibly


reward worker eort with bonus payments.               Figure 6 shows that bonus payments are in


fact strongly increasing in worker performance, and thus that bonus payments are credible.


We also regressed actual bonus payments in period            t   on worker eort levels in     t   (interval


regression), and found that the relationship between eort and bonus payments is positive


and highly statistically signicant, controlling for wages, desired eort, and a time trend


(p   < 0.001;   robust s.e., clustering on session).




     [Figure 6 about here]




     With bonus pay serving as a credible incentive device, rms have a way to at least partially


circumvent the negative incentive eect created by dismissal barriers. Figure 2 shows that,


indeed, worker eort levels in long-term relationships are consistently much higher in T-


Barrier-Bonus than in T-Barrier (average eort is          8.2   rather than   5.5),   and achieve a level


very close to what is observed in T-Baseline. Columns (3) and (4) of Table 3 indicate that the


dierence in eort levels is positive and statistically signicant when comparing T-Barrier-


Bonus to T-Barrier, controlling for other variables relevant for eort.                 Columns (5) and


(6) conrm that eort levels in T-Barrier-Bonus are not signicantly dierent from eort


levels in T-Baseline.      Thus, the option to pay bonuses allows rms to undo the negative


eects of dismissal barriers.      As shown in Figure 3, bonus pay also undoes much of the


negative impact of dismissal barriers on market eciency. Eciency in T-Barrier-Bonus is
                            INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT                                  28

substantially above that in T-Barrier, by about        10   percentage points, or an increase of   20

percent (Mann-Whitney;        p < 0.055).   On the other hand eciency is only about    1 percentage

point, or   2 percent,   lower than eciency in T-Baseline, and the dierence is not statistically


signicant (Mann Whitney;        p < 0.87).

  Given that the negative incentive eect of dismissal barriers is largely neutralized by bonus


pay, eort dynamics are predicted to be more similar to those observed in T-Baseline. Figure


4 supports this prediction. The median eort level increases after the probation period, and


variance decreases, similar to what is observed in T-Baseline.             The level of eort in the


initial period of relationships is also similar to that in T-Baseline, consistent with bonus pay


reducing the incentive for workers to entice rms into relationships. Columns (3) and (4) of


Table 4 reveal that the probability of a drop in eort is signicantly lower in T-Barrier-Bonus


than in T-Barrier, and Columns (5) and (6) show that the probability of a drop in eort in


T-Barrier-Bonus is not statistically dierent from in T-Baseline.


  While rms have less reason to avoid relationships in T-Barrier-bonus, because bonus pay


helps solve the incentive problem, bonus pay also provides a substitute for relational incen-


tives, and thus rms may be less interested in entering relationships for this reason. The


fraction of rms who never enter a long-term relationship in T-Barrier-Bonus is 19 percent,


somewhat lower than in T-Barrier where the fraction is 24 percent, but substantially above


the 9 percent observed in T-Baseline. The survival probability of never having entered a re-


lationship also indicates that rms in T-Barrier-Bonus are more prone to avoid relationships


than rms in T-Baseline. A Cox mixed proportional hazard model shows that the survival


probability is signicantly higher than in T-Baseline (p        < 0.026;   robust s.e., clustering on


session).   Compared to T-Barrier, the survival probability is higher but not signicantly
                           INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT                                29

dierent (p   < 0.79;   robust s.e., clustering on session). Thus, the tendency to avoid relation-


ships is similar to in T-Barrier, despite the lack of a strong negative incentive problem. This


nding is consistent with bonus pay changing the way that rms enforce contracts, such that


they substitute away from relational incentives to one-shot interactions and the use of bonus


incentives. To attribute this change to the eect of bonus pay, however, requires our fourth


treatment, T-Bonus, where we observe the impact of bonus pay without the confounding


eect of dismissal barriers. We turn to this comparison in the next section.




Result 4: The presence of bonus pay strongly aects the impact of the dismissal barrier
institution, eliminating both the negative incentive eect and probation period eect. Re-
lationship initiation, however, remains altered relative to T-Baseline, with rms being less
likely to enter long-term relationships.


4.4. Impact of Bonus Pay in the Absence of Dismissal Barriers. In T-Bonus rms


have the option to pay bonuses, but there is no dismissal institution in the market. This


allows us to isolate the impact of bonus pay per se on contract enforcement policies and


market outcomes.


  If bonus pay and relationships are substitutes in the contract enforcement policies of rms


(which would help explain the low rate of relationship formation in T-Barrier-Bonus), then


introducing bonus pay should lead to fewer and shorter long-term relationships, compared


to a market where labor contracts are restricted to xed wages. In fact,      17   percent of rms


never try to enter a long-term relationship in T-Bonus, substantially larger than the 9 percent


observed in T-Baseline. A Cox proportional hazard model tells a similar story, showing that


the survival probability for never having entered a long-run relationship is higher in T-Bonus


than in T-Baseline, with the dierence becoming statistically signicant considering periods
                             INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT                                 30

beyond 5 (p     < 0.018;   robust s.e., clustering on session). The average length of a relationship


in T-Bonus is    2.2, shorter than in T-Baseline or any of the other treatments.     Figure 5 shows


that the distribution of relationship lengths is not bi-modal in T-Bonus, as in the other


treatments, but rather has a single mode in the category of one-shot interactions and the


next highest fraction in the category of relationships lasting only 2 to 5 periods. In other


words, bonus pay leads to a leftward shift in the distribution, away from longer relationships.


For example, a Probit regression shows that the probability of observing a relationship in the


longest length category of 14 or more is signicantly lower in T-Bonus than in T-Baseline


(p   < 0.048;   robust s.e., clustering on session). These ndings indicate that bonus pay and


relational incentives are in fact substitutes, and helps explain why there is a relatively low


rate of relationship formation in T-Barrier-Bonus, despite the lack of a negative incentive


eect in long-term relationships. While the introduction of bonus pay neutralizes most of the


eects of dismissal barriers, it leaves contract enforcement policies fundamentally changed


by providing an alternative strategy for contract enforcement.


     T-Bonus also provides a useful counter-factual for T-Barrier-Bonus, helping disentangle


the impact of dismissal barriers from the eect of bonus pay on the strategic position of


workers and rms. In particular, although rms achieve a high level of worker performance


in long-term relationships in T-Barrier-Bonus, comparable to in T-Bonus (see Figure 2), the


lack of ring threat caused by dismissal barriers would seem to weaken the strategic position


of rms. Figure 6 shows that in fact rms in T-Barrier-Bonus pay higher bonuses compared


to rms in T-Bonus, to achieve the same level of performance, especially at higher eort


levels. In a regression of actual bonus payment on worker eort, the wage, desired eort,


a time trend, and a dummy variable for T-Barrier-Bonus (omitted category T-Bonus), the


treatment dummy is positive and signicant (p         < 0.046;   robust s.e., clustering on session),
                           INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT                                         31

indicating that for a given wage and eort, rms must pay a higher bonus when dismissal


barriers are present in the market. This can also be seen by looking at total rents oered


to workers in a given market period, calculated in the same way as in the initial analysis of


T-Baseline above. Workers earn larger rents in T-Barrier-Bonus than in T-Bonus, in every

                 16
market period.        Thus, although bonus pay allows rms to largely circumvent the negative


incentive eect of dismissal barriers in T-Barrier-Bonus, dismissal barriers still impose a cost


on rms. Put another way, the availability of ring threat allows rms to achieve the same


level of worker performance with lower bonuses and lower oered rents.


  Recent studies have compared the eciency of bonus versus wage contracts in one-shot in-


teractions, and found that bonus contracts are much superior (e.g., Fehr, Klein, and Schmidt


(2007)), which raises the question how bonus contracts fare relative to wage contracts in a


setting with repeated interactions. The dierence we nd is positive but relatively small: ag-


gregate eciency is     68.54   percent of maximum in T-Bonus compared to            63.86   in T-Baseline


(see also Figure 3). One explanation for the relatively good performance of wage contracts


is that in a setting with repeated interactions rms can employ ring threat as an incentive


device, whereas in one-shot settings the only reason for a worker to perform under a xed


wage contract is fairness preferences.




Result 5: Bonus pay causes rms to substitute away from relational incentives in their
contract enforcement policies. Although bonus pay allows rms to oset negative incentive
eects of dismissal barriers, dismissal barriers still impose a cost on rms by requiring rms
to pay a higher bonus and oer higher rents for a given level of eort. The benets of bonus
pay per se for market eciency, relative to eciency wage contracts, is decreasing over time.
16Taking the average worker rent from being employed in a given session as one independent observation,
rents oered by rms in sessions for the T-Barrier-Bonus treatment are signicantly higher than those oered
by rms in the T-Bonus treatment (Mann-Whitney; p<0.007). Detailed results available upon request.

  This paper explores how the complex interplay between contract enforcement behaviors


and embedding institutions determines market outcomes.              With incomplete contracts and


repeated interactions, ring threat is crucial for market eciency, and dismissal barriers


worsen performance by hindering this mechanism and by discouraging relationship formation


in the rst place.     Allowing for greater exibility in contractual instruments, in the form


of bonus pay, undoes the eects of dismissal barriers, while leaving contract enforcement


strategies fundamentally changed.


  Our paper is also complementary to the empirical literature that studies dismissal barriers


in the form of employment protection legislation (EPL). Our results show that the impact


of dismissal barriers depends crucially on details of the institutional environment. This is


consistent with the empirical literature, which sometimes nds zero and other times nds


moderate eects of EPL on various types of outcomes (e.g., Lazear (1990), Nickell (1997),


Autor, Donohue, and Schwab (2006), MacLeod and Nakavachara (2007)). Furthermore, our


ndings highlight a specic institutional feature that is relevant for whether dismissal barriers


have a strong or weak eect on market performance, namely exibility of the labor contract.


In the spirit of the Coasian intuition articulated by Lazear (1990), we nd that giving parties


additional contractual instruments allows them to contract around the negative eects of


dismissal barriers. As noted by Krueger (1991), a key challenge for assessing the impact of


EPL in the eld is that the law change itself might be correlated with other factors that are

                                       17
related to economic performance.            In this regard our experimental approach is also useful,


because variation in institutions is clearly exogenous. Finally, our results are supportive of


other eld evidence on specic impacts of EPL. Although measuring shirking in the eld is

absenteeism sharply increases when workers are re-hired beyond the probation period for

the strength of employment protection legislation and rms' usage of temp agency workers


as opposed to long-term contracts (see, e.g., Autor (2003), and Cahuc and Postel-Vinay


(2002)), which is in line with the strategic behavior we observe among rms.

APPENDIX: INSTRUCTIONS

In the following we present representative instructions, in this case for a worker (seller)
from the treatment T-Barrier. Instructions for firms (buyers) and for participants in other
treatments are exactly the same, except for including explanation of the option for firms
to pay bonuses in the case of T-Barrier-Bonus and T-Bonus, or excluding the final
section explaining the dismissal barrier institution in the case of T-Bonus and T-Baseline.


                                 Instructions for Sellers



You are now taking part in an economic experiment. Please read the following
instructions carefully. Everything that you need to know to participate in this experiment
is explained below. Should you have any difficulties in understanding these instructions
please notify us. We will answer your questions at your cubicle.


At the beginning of the experiment you will receive an initial sum of 8 Euro. During the
course of the experiment you can earn a further amount of money by gaining points. The
amount of points that you gain during the experiment depends on your decisions and the
decisions of other participants.

All points that you gain during the course of the experiment will be exchanged into Euro
at the end of the experiment. The exchange rate will be:

                                    1 point = 4 Cents

At the end of the experiment you will receive the sum of money that you earned
during the experiment in addition to your 8 Euro initial sum.

The experiment is divided into periods. In each period you have to make decisions which
you will enter in a computer. There are 18 periods in all.

Please note that communication between participants is strictly prohibited during the
experiment. In addition we would like to point out that you may only use the computer
functions which are required for the experiment. Communication between participants
and unnecessary interference with computers will lead to exclusion from the experiment.
In case you have any questions we shall be glad to assist you.

Prior to the experiment the 17 participants were divided into 2 groups: buyers and sellers.
In this experiment there are 10 sellers and 7 buyers.
You shall be a seller for the entire course of the experiment. All participants have
received an identification number, which they will keep for the entire experiment. Your
identification number is stated on the documentation sheet in front of you.



An Overview of the Experiment Procedures

In each period of the experiment every buyer can trade a product with one seller. The
seller earns a profit through the trade when he sells the product at a price that exceeds his
production costs. The buyer earns a profit through the trade when the price he pays for
the product is less than what it is worth to him. How high the production costs are for the
traded product, and how much it is worth to the buyer, depends on the quality of the
product.

The experiment lasts 18 periods. In each period the procedures are as follows:

1. Each period commences with a trading phase, which lasts 150 seconds. During this
   phase buyers can submit trade offers, which can be accepted by sellers.
   When submitting an offer a buyer has to specify three things:
   â¢ which price he offers to pay,
   â¢ which product quality he desires,
   â¢ and finally, which seller he wants to submit the offer to. Hereby, buyers can
      submit two types of offers; private offers and public offers. Private offers are
      submitted to one seller only and can only be accepted by that seller. Public
      offers are submitted to all sellers and can be accepted by any seller.

   Buyers can submit as many offers as they like in each period. Submitted offers can be
   accepted constantly. Each buyer and each seller can only enter one trade
   agreement in each period. As there are 10 sellers and 7 buyers, several sellers will
   not trade in each period.


2. Following the trading phase each seller who has entered a trade agreement determines
   which quality of product he will supply to his buyer. Hereby, the seller is not obliged
   to supply the product quality desired by his buyer.


Please note: If the same buyer has made private offer to the same seller in two
consecutive periods, and if the seller has accepted these two offers, the seller enjoys the
âright to get an offerâ. This means that the buyer has to make this seller an offer in the
next period. If the seller accepts, this âright to get an offerâ continues to exist. If he
rejects, the buyer is free to make an offer to any seller.

Once every seller has chosen which product quality to supply, incomes gained by each
participant in that period are determined and reported on the screen. After this the next
period commences. The points gained from all 18 periods will be summed up at the end
of the experiment, exchanged into Euros and paid together with your initial sum of
money in cash.


                                   Procedures in Detail

There are 7 buyers and 10 sellers in the experiment. You are a seller for the entire course
of the experiment. During the experiment you will enter your decisions on the computer.
In the following we describe in detail how you can make your decisions in each period.


1. The Trading Phase

Each period commences with a trading phase. During the trading phase each buyer can
enter into a trading agreement with one seller. In order to do this the buyers can submit
trade offers to the sellers. As a seller you can accept one of the offers submitted to you in
each period. During the trading phase you will see the following screen:


                                    Seller trading screen

â¢   In the top left corner of the screen you will see the current period of the experiment.
    In the top right corner of the screen you will see the time remaining in this trading
    phase, displayed in seconds. The trading phase in each period lasts 150 seconds.
    When this time is up the trading phase is over. Hereafter, no further offers can be
    submitted or accepted for this period.

â¢   Once you see the above screen displayed the trading phase commences. As a seller
    you can now accept offers, which buyers have submitted to you. There are two types
    of offers which you can accept:

        â¢ Private offers to you
    Each buyer has the opportunity to submit private offers to you. You alone will be
    informed of these offers and you alone can accept them. No other seller or buyer
    is informed of these offers. If you receive private offers, they will appear on the left
    side of your screen, below the title âprivate offers to youâ. The offer of a buyer will
    contain the following information: the identification number of the buyer who
    submitted the offer, the price which he offers for the product, and which product
    quality he desires. If you want to accept a private offer, you click first on the
    respective row in which the offer is displayed. When you do this, the offer will be
    highlighted. If you are sure you want to accept the offer you then click on the button
    âacceptâ which is situated in the bottom left corner of the screen. As long as you do
    not click âacceptâ you can alter your choice.
       â¢ Public offers
    Each buyer also has the possibility to submit public offers. All sellers are informed of
    these offers and any seller can accept them. If a buyer submits a public offer it will
    appear on the right side of your screen, below the title âpublic offersâ. The offer of a
    buyer again contains the identification number of the buyer who submitted the offer,
    the price which he offers for the product and which product quality he desires. This
    information is also displayed to all other sellers and all buyers. If you want to accept
    a public offer you follow the same procedures as with private offers. You first click
    on the respective row in which the offer is displayed. When you are sure that you
    want to accept the offer you then click on the button âacceptâ which is situated in the
    bottom right corner of the screen. As long as you do not click âacceptâ you can alter
    your choice.


â¢   As soon as you have pressed the âacceptâ button you will see which offer you have
    accepted in the bottom row of your screen.

â¢   Each seller can enter only one trade agreement in each period. Once you have
    accepted one offer you cannot accept any further offers.


All buyers have to observe the following rules when submitting trade offers:

    â¢   The price offered by the buyer may not be lower than 0 or higher than 100:

                                     0 â¤ price â¤ 100


    â¢   The desired quality of the buyer may not be below 1 or higher than 10:

                                1 â¤ desired quality â¤ 10


â¢   As long as no offer has been accepted by a seller, the buyer can make as many
    public and private offers as he wishes. Each offer submitted by a buyer can be
    accepted at any time during the trading phase.

â¢   Each buyer can enter only one trade agreement in each period. Once an offer of a
    buyer has been accepted he will be notified which seller accepted it. As each buyer
    can enter only one trade agreement in each period all other offers of the buyer will be
    automatically cancelled. Also, he will not be able to submit any further offers.

â¢   Once all 7 buyers have entered a trade agreement or after 150 seconds have elapsed,
    the trading phase is over.
â¢   No buyer is obliged to submit trade offers, and no seller is obliged to accept a trade
    offer.



2. Determination of the Product Quality

â¢   Following the trading phase, all sellers who have entered a trade-agreement then
    determine which product quality they will supply to their respective buyers. The
    product quality desired by your buyer is not binding for you as a seller. You can
    choose the exact quality desired by your buyer, but also a higher or lower product
    quality. If you have entered a trade agreement during a trading phase, the following
    screen will appear for you to enter the product quality:

                                Seller quality choice screen

In order to choose the actual product quality, you enter the value for the quality in the
field âDetermine the actual product qualityâ and press the âokâ button to confirm your
choice. As long as you have not pressed âokâ you can alter your choice.

â¢   The product quality that you choose must be an integer between 1 and 10.

                             1 â¤ actual product quality â¤ 10




                            How are the incomes calculated?


Your income:

â¢   If you have not entered a trade agreement during a trading phase you gain an
    income of 5 points for that period.

â¢   If you have accepted a trade offer your income depends on the price you accepted and
    the product quality you chose to deliver. Your income will be calculated as follows:

                        Your income = Price - production costs

â¢   Your production costs are higher, the higher the quality of the product you chose to
    deliver. The production costs for each product quality are displayed in the table
    below:
Quality             1       2       3        4       5        6       7        8       9      10

Production-         0       1       2        4       6        8       10      12       15     18
cost

â¢   Your income is therefore higher, the lower your chosen product quality. Furthermore,
    your income is higher the higher is the price offered by the buyer.



The income of your buyer:

â¢   If a buyer does not enter a trade agreement during a trading phase he gains an income
    of 0 points for that period.

â¢   If one of his trade offers is accepted, his income depends on which price he offered
    and which product quality was supplied to him. The income of your buyer will be
    determined as follows:

                 Income of your buyer = 10 * product quality - price

â¢   As you can see from the above formula the income of your buyer is higher, the higher
    is the product quality actually supplied by you. At the same time his income is higher,
    the lower the price he paid for the product.


The income of all buyers and sellers are determined in the same way. Each buyer can
therefore calculate the income of his seller and each seller can calculate the income
of his buyer. Furthermore, each buyer and seller is informed of the identification number
of his trading partner in each period.

Please note that buyers and sellers can incur losses in each period. These losses have to
be paid from your initial sum of money or from earnings in other periods.

You will be informed of your income and the income of your buyer on an âincome
screenâ. On the screen (see below) the following will be displayed:
â¢ Which buyer you traded with
â¢ Which price he offered
â¢ The desired quality of your buyer
â¢ The product quality supplied by you
â¢ The income of your buyer in this period
â¢ Your income in this period.

                                   Seller income screen
Please enter all the information in the documentation sheet supplied to you. After the
income screen has been displayed, the respective period is concluded. Thereafter the
trading phase of the following period commences. Once you have finished studying the
income screen please click on the ânextâ button.

The buyers also view an income screen, which displays the above information. They see
the ID of their trading partner, the price, desired and supplied product quality as well as
both incomes.



âRight to get an offerâ-Rule

There is one more rule to consider. If the same buyer has made two private offers to the
same seller in two consecutive periods, and both offers were accepted so that they each
lead to a trade agreement, the seller enjoys the âright to get an offerâ in the next period.
This is the case, e.g., if buyer 1 makes seller 2 private offers, one in period 3 and one in
period 4, which are both accepted by seller 2. Starting from period 5, seller 2 then enjoys
the âright to get an offerâ.

The right to get an offer is thus established when a buyer has traded at least twice with
the same seller, and if these trades came about through private offers. If trade comes
about based on a public offer, the right to get an offer is not established. Thus the buyer
himself can decide whether he wants to enter a relationship with or without the right to
get an offer.

In other words the âright to get an offerâ means that in the next period the buyer
must make the seller an offer that is available as soon as soon as the trading phase
begins. This offer consists of a price and desired quality. The price must be at least as
high as in the previous period.

If the same buyer has offered you two times in a row a private offer, which you accepted,
you enjoy the right to get an offer. This means âyourâ buyer must make you an offer in
the next period. In this case the trading phase begins with the following screen.

                              Modified trading phase screen

This is the same screen as on page 3 with the only difference that on the upper right
corner you now see the offer of your buyer. In addition you also see the other public and
private offers, which have been offered to you and the other sellers. You can accept the
offer of âyourâ buyer or any other offer that has been made (private or public) by
other buyers.

As long as you have not yet decided, âyourâ buyer cannot make another offer to you
or another seller. This means that you can accept the offer of âyourâ buyer as long as
you have not declined it (and trading time has not yet elapsed).
Your buyer will be informed about your decision. If you reject his offer or if you accept
another buyerâs offer, âyourâ buyer is free to make offers to other sellers. As long as you
have not yet decided, all âyourâ buyer can do is wait and observe the market.

If you accept the offer of âyourâ buyer, he will also make you an offer in the next period.
Only if you reject his offer or if you accept the offer of another buyer, the right to get an
offer expires. This means that the right to get an offer can only be terminated by
yourself.

An example concerning the right to get an offer: Suppose buyer 1 and seller 2 have traded
in periods three and four, based on two private offers. Starting from period 5 seller 2
then enjoys the right to get an offer. This means that buyer 1 has to make seller 2 an offer
in the fifth period before the trading period begins. If seller 2 accepts, the relation
remains and buyer 1 will make seller 2 an offer also in period 6. If seller 2 rejects, the
relation is terminated and buyer 1 can thereafter make offers to all sellers (public and
private).


The experiment will not commence until all participants are completely familiar with all
procedures. In order to secure that this is the case we kindly ask you to solve the
exercises below.

In addition we will conduct a training trial of the trading phase, so that you can get
accustomed to the computer. This trial phase will not be added to the result of the
experiment and therefore not remunerated. Following the trial phase we will begin the
experiment, which will last for 18 periods.




                                     Exercises
