                              Inflation and Growth


                                    ABSTRACT



     Models of inflation and growth in the sixties emphasized the

portfolio substitution mechanism by which higher inflation made capital

more attractive to hold relative to money, leading to higher capital

intensity, and in the transition period to higher growth.    The empirical

evidence, however, is that growth and inflation are negatively correlated.

Reasons for this negative correlation are investigated, and then embodied

in a simple monetary maximizing model. Higher inflation is associated

with lower growth because lower real balances reduce the efficiency of

factors of production, and because there may be a link between government

purchases and the use of the inflation tax. Comparative steady states

and comparative dynamics is analyzed and the generally negative association

between inflation and growth, both in steady states and in transition

processes, is demonstrated.

                                   Stanley Fischer*

      Much of Miguel Sidrauski's research focussed on the relationship between

inflation and economic growth. Two of his contributions stand out. The first is
                                                          Sidrauski model-—in which
the famous intertemporal optimizing model (1967a)——the

the basic result is that changes in the growth rate of money have no effect on

the capital stock in the long run. The second is his paper (1967b) developing

Tobin's (1965) money and growth model, with constant savings rate, in which the

equilibrium capital intensity increases with the inflation rate. In the short

run   in   this model, though, an increase in the growth rate of money reduces the

growth rate of output while increasing the inflation rate.

       Sidrauski's approach to the money, inflation, and growth question emphasized

portfolio substitution as the basic driving force in determining the relationship

between inflation and growth. For instance, in his descriptive model (Sidrausici

(1967b)), an increase in the growth rate of money leads to an increase in the

expected rate of inflation, thereby reducing the demand for real balances. With

the savings rate given, more of savings takes the form of physical capital and

less is in (high—powered) money. Equilibrium capital intensity is thereby

increased. Fiscal factors enter in the background, since in both these papers

the money stock is changed through lump sum transfer payments.

    In his work with Duncan Foley (1970 and 1971), Sidrauski was able both to

use a more sophisticated definition of monetary policy and to take a step away

from the treatment of money growth as exogenous to the economy. There are three

assets in the Foley-Sidrauski model, money, bonds, and capital. The three assets

are imperfect portfolio substitutes. Monetary policy is now defined by changes

in the ratio of money to bonds, caused for instance by an open market operation.

Because money and bonds are imperfect substitutes, open market operations have

real effects.1 In this work the government is viewed as having desired paths for

the inflation rate and other endogenous variables and as using its policy

variables——including the composition of the debt, and the growth rate of the

nominal stock of debt—-to achieve those paths.

     In the Foley-Sidrauski model, changes in the actual and expected inflation

rates typically increase the steady state capital stock.2 The change in the

capital stock is again the consequence of the portfolio shift away from money

towards capital that accompanies a reduction in the expected real return on

money, combined with the specification of the consumption function.   If the

change in the inflation rate occurs as a result of a change in the rate of growth

of the nominal stock of debt, with the composition of the debt being adjusted


1The importance of assumptions about asset substitutability was emphasized by
Tobin (1961). It is clear that the Foloy—Sidrauski model owes part of its
structure to the Yale tradition in which Foley was trained. This is evident not
only in the asset menu but also in the key role played in the model by the
relative price of capital, which in this two—sector model is equivalent to
Tobin's "q" in a one—sector model.

2The analysis is presented in Chapter 12 of Foley—Sidrauski (1971). It is
interesting to note that in this chapter, the authors take great care that jumps
in the price—level are prevented through appropriate monetary and fiscal policy
when the inflation rate changes. This is so that the government does not
"dissappoint private expectations" (p.190). However, in the exercises presented
in Chapter 12, a change in the expected rate of inflation may change the relative
price of capital unanicipatedly, so that the analysis cannot be taken as
assuming perfect foresight.
                                      -3-



through monetary policy to prevent a jump in the price level when the inflation

rate changes, there is no effect on the capital stock of a change in the

inflation rate.

     Despite the ambiguities of the relationship between inflation and capital

intensity in Sidrauski's work, the overall results suggest that higher inflation

will be associated with higher capital intensity. This has no implications for

the inflation—growth relationship since in steady state the the rate of growth is

determined by population and productivity increase. But the steady state capital

inten8it3r-iflflatiofl relationship implies a relationship between inflation and

growth in the adjustment process. If a higher inflation rate is associated with

higher capital intensity, then in the transition from one steady state to another

the growth rate of output has on average to be above the growth rate of

population and productivity. Thus if higher inflation is associated with greater

capital intensity, we should expect that on average higher inflaton rates will be

associated with higher growth rates of output. Further, even in the Sidrauski

optimizing model, increases in the inflation rate that do not affect the steady

state capital stock may increase the growth rate of output in the short run.

 (Fischer, i979).

     Sidrauski wrote his papers on inflation and growth in the second half of the

 1960's. After the stagflationary decade of the 1970's, we would be surprised to

 find any systematic relationship between the growth rate of output and the

 inflation rate. Equations (Ri) and (R2) present the results of cross—section


31n Sidrauski (1967b) an increase in the growth rate of money in the short run is
associated with a lower growth rate of output, despite the positive relationship
between steady state inflation and capital intensity. This result depends on the
assumption of adaptive expectations; it disappears if expectations are formed
rationally and the price level is allowed to jump when the growth rate of money
 changes.

 and         is the inflation rate. The time period and country specific

 coefficients, at and a are not presented.

        Both regressions show the same pattern: a negative contemporaneous

 relationship between growth and the inflation rate, and a positive lagged

 relationship. The coefficients of the inflation variables are strongly

 significant in all cases. Taking averages across the 54 countries for the two

 time periods, we obtain the data presented in Table 1. As we would have

 expected, there is no sign of a positive relationship between inflation and

 growth between the two periods. And even within each sub-period, the regressions

 show a predominately negative rather than positive relationship between inflation

• and growth.


 £The sample is not random, since it is the higher income countries that typically
 maintain more complete data. The countries are listed in appendix 1.

        The facts thus disagree with the implication that inflation and growth are

positively correlated: there is a significant negative contemporaneous

correlation. In the next section I review hypotheses about the links among

inflation, output, and growth. Then in the remainder of the paper I present a

simple Sidrauski type optimizing model based on some of these links that suggests

why we might observe a negative relationship between inflation and growth.



1. The Mechanisms Linking Inflation, Output, and Growth.

        There are several economic mechanisms linking inflation, output, and

growth. (i) The first is the portfolio link emphasized by Sidrauski. An

 increase in the expected rate of inflation causes a shift from money to capital

 in the portfolio. In a two sector model this increases the relative price of

 installed capital, leading to higher rates of investment and growth, and

 ultimately to higher capital intensity in production. However, savings behavior

 may sever the link. For instance, if savings drives the real interest rate to

 equality with the rate of time preference (adjusted for growth), changes in the

 inflation rate may leave the steady state capital intensity unaffected, as in
                                        —6—




Sidrau ski (1 967a) .5

          (ii) Non-adjustment of the tax system for inflation may make the after-

tax real return to capital a decreasing function of the inflation rate, even if

the pre-tax rate of return is independent of the inflation rte. This is the

mechanism emphasized by Feldstein (1976). This mechanism tends to reduce steady

state capital intensity as the inflation rate rises.

          (iii) If the growth rate of the money stock is given, an inrrease in the

growth rate of output tends to reduce the inflation rate because the demand for

real balances increases more rapidly. Equivalently, an adverse supply shock will

lead to an increase in the inflation rate at the same time as the level of output

or, in the short run, the growth rate of output, declines.

          (iv) If government spending is financed in part through the printing of

money, then a reduction in the growth rate of output, reducing the demand for

real balances, may require the government to increase the growth rate of money.

This is a special case of "passive money", the approach emphasized by Olivera

(1970).

            (v) Increases in the inflation rate lead to lower real balances and the

diversion of real resources to the makingof transactions. This reduces output.

More generally, it appears that higher rates of inflation—-anticipated as well as

unanticipated-—reduce the efficiency of the price system, and reduce factor

productivity.


5Dornbusch and Frenkel (1973) show that the relationship between inflation and
equilibrium capital intensity depends on the reduced form effect of an increase
in the inflation rate on consumption.
                                      -7—




        (iv)   The short—run Phillips curve implies that increases in output and

the inflation rate (perhaps the unanticipated inflation rate) are positively

associated.

     In this lecture I use a variant of the Sidrauski optimizing model to study

the relationships among inflation, output, and growth under the assumptions that

money enters the production function, and that the printing of money is used to

finance government spending. I thus embody in the model two of the potential

links between inflation and growth that were outlined above: reductions in real

balances reduce the productivity of factors of production (point (v)); and that

changes in the inflation rate may be a result of changes in government spending

(point (iv)). I shall also examine the effects of supply shocks, thus allowing

also for the impact of autonomous changes in ouput on the inflation rate (point

(iii)). The general results to be expected are that inflation and growth will be

negatively related.



 2. An Optimizing Model with Money in the Production Function.

      I start with a simple model in which the growth rate of money is exogeneous

but money enters the production function rather than the utility function. As

 noted by Sidrauski in his thesis (1967c, p.53), the inclusion of money in the

 production function removes the superneutrality of money that is the best known

 result of his monetary optimizing model. Money is included in the production

 function to represent the notion that higher levels of real balances free labor

 and other resources for productive use. The practice can be rigorously

 justified. (Fischer, 1974).

      The representative family maximizes the additively separable utility

 functional

       From the definition of the per capita money stock m

The Steady State: In steady state k, m, c, and it                   are constant. From (ii) we

obtain that in steady state:

         (12) i = e - n            =   ,t(k,m)
where it     is   the steady state rate of inflation. From (7) we obtain:

         (13) r* = 8 + n =             fk(k,m)
 implying that the real interest rate is invariant to the steady state inflation

 rate.

         However, money is not superneutral in this model. Using (12) and (13) and

 making the assumption that                      > 0 we show in Figure 1 the loci in (k,m) space
                     .

 on which c and m are zero: these are equations (13) and (12) respectively.
                                                                                    .

 can be shown      that    the (c =        0)    locus is steeper than the (in =          0)   schedule.




 6[t is more intuitive to think of (8) and (9) as giving demand functions for the
 factors of production as functions of r and it. Equation (10) then merely inverts
 the relationship. For simplicity I henceforth assume f > 0.

        Now, using (12), an increase in the growth rate of money (which increases
                                                       S                         S

the steady state inflation rate) shifts the (in =            0)   locus down to (in =   0)'.    Both

                                                                                               is to
k and in fall, and equilibrium output per capita therefore falls. Thus, as

be expected in this case, higher inflation reduces output. In the transition

between steady states, higher inflation is accompanied by lower output growth.

        Similarly, in Figure 2 e analyze the effects of an increase in the rate of
                                         S             S

population growth, n. Both the (in = 0) and (c               0) loci shift back as shown, to
 S

(in =   0)'   and (c =   0)'   respectively. It can be shown that the shifts are such as

to reduce both k* and m. The economy thus moves from a position like E to one

like B'. Per capita steady state output is thus reduced.                 Since an increase in n

reduces the steady state inflation rate we once again have a negative

relationship between inflation and output, this time across steady states. By

the same token, we should expect a negative relationship in the transition

between steady states.

The Steady State with Productivity Growth. Assume next that there is labor

augmenting technical progress at rate p., and that the utility function is of the

form:
                              I -R
                          C                          R > 0
         (14) iJ(c) =

where R is the coefficient of relative risk aversion and also the elasticity of

marginal utility.

         In this case there exists a steady state in which ratios of variables to

 effective labor units are constant. The steady state real interest rate is given

 by

         (15) r* = 8 + n + R p.

 and the steady state inflation rate is
                                                     —11—



     (16) i* = e      —    (   +


    The growth rate and the inflation rate are inversely related in this case

too. Further, it appears likely, though not certain, that the short run

relationship between output growth and inflation is also negative. The ambiguity

arises because there may be a phase of capital decumulation and perhaps lower

growth immediately after the increase in the rate of productivity growth.7

The Adjustment Path. I assume there is perfect foresight so that actual and

expected inflation rates are the same. In that case the dynamic equations of the

model are (17), (ii) and (7):


     (17) kt =     f(kt,mt)
                                   -
                                       c   -
                                               nkt
               =          La + n -
      (7)


     (ii)   in = Le   —    (it(m,k)    + n)Jm

Equation (17) is not an explicit constraint on the behavior of any individual

agent in the model, but has to be satisfied in perfect foresight equilbrium.

     It is shown in Appendix 2 that there is a unique stable root for the dynamic

system (17), (7) and (ii), linearized around the steady state. The solution for

the optimal path of the capital stock can be written as

     (18) kt -     k = (k0_k*)eZt
where z is the unique stable root of the system, k* is the steady state capital

stock, and k0 is the initial capital stock.

     The behavior of the inflation rate in the adjustment process can be derived

from (10), given the dynamics of in and k. In particular, we obtain


7Because k and in are now ratios of capital and real balances respectively to
effective and not actual labor, it is difficult to compare the pre— and post—
productivity increase situations.
                                      —12—




     (19) n =
                z+lt2rn
Both numerator and denominator of the ratio in (19) are negative, so that the

ratio itself is positive. This means that the rate of inflation is increasing so

long as capital is being accumulated. This result may appear paradoxical until

we realize that on the adjustment path the growth rate of the capital stock is

falling as capital is accumulated. Thus we find a negative relationship between

the rate of inflation and the rate of growth on the adjustment path.

A Supply Shock: Suppose that the economy is in a steady state, and that there is

a Hicks-neutral supply shock. We represent this by rewriting the production

function (4) as

     4'         =
                    Af(k,m)
The supply shock is represented by a fall in A from 1 to a lower level.

     We can analyze the consequences of a fall in A by considering its effects on

the equilibrium capital stock. Using equations (12) and (13), it can be shown

that an adverse Hicks—neutral supply shock reduces both the equilibrium capital

stock and the equilibrium stock of real balances. Dynamic adjustment thus takes

the form of a gradual reduction of the capital stock, accompanied by a falling

inflation rate.

     Since the steady state inflation rate after the permanent supply shock is

back to the level at which it started, the transition period is marked by higher

than steady state inflation, along with lower than steady state growth as capital

is being decumulated. Again, there is a negative relationship between the rate

of growth of ouput and the inflation rate in the adju3trnent process.
                                      —13—



     In the model of this section in which the rate of growth of the money stock

is exogenous, the predominant relationship between the inflation rate on one hand

and the growth rate or the level of ouput on the other hand is negative. In

every case we have examined, we have found such a negative relationship. The

primary difference between the structure of the present model and that of

Sidrauski (1967a) is that money is treated in this section as a factor of

production, rather than an argument of the utility function. This-—as noted by

Sidrauski-—makes for non-neutrality of the inflation rate.

     Beyond this, the theory also suggests that the inflation rate and the growth

rate of output should in general be negatively correlated. Such a result also

obtains in Sidrauski's model for certain of the exercises we have examined. For

instance, given the growth rate of the money stock, an increase in the rate of

productivity growth will reduce the steady state inflation rate in both this

model and Sidrauski's. Thus there is no implication even in the original

Sidrauski model that there can be only a one—directional relationship between

inflation and growth.



3. Money Financing of Government Spending.

     The final possible link we examine between inflation and output arises from

the use of the inflation tax to finance government spending.8 The set-up changes

very little. In equation (2), the consumer's flow budget constraint, the term v

disappears since the government no longer makes transfer payments. First order

conditions for both households and firms are unchanged, as is the inflation

equation (10).


8See Dornbusch (1977) for an earlier analysis of endogenous money.
                                                      -14-




     The changes come in the description of the dynamic system, equations (7),

(11) and (17). Assume that government purchases each period are equal to yc.

The ratio of government purchases to consumption is now constant.9 The dynamic

equations are:
            .
     (20)   k =   f(k,m)   — c(1 +      y)   —   nk

     (21) c =     ii-(8 + '' — fk(k,m))

     (22)   in = yc   —   [t(m,k)   +   n]m

     The following results can be demonstrated, for small values of y. First,

with constant y there is a unique perfect foresight path for the economy, with

the same dynamic behavior as that in Section 2. Second, there are the expected

comparative steady state results. An increase in y-—an increase in government

spending financed through the inflation tax——reduces steady state real balances

and capital stock, and increases the steady state inflation rate.

     It was to be expected, given that real balances enter the production

function, that we would find here as in the previous model a negative steady—

state relationship between inflation and output. However, the result is not

dependent on the inclusion of real balances in the production function, for even

if money were a consumer good as in the original Sidrauski maximizing model, we

would find a similar relationship.



4.   Concluding   Comments.

     Ye have shown, using essentially the model introduced by Sidrauski, that

several economic factors can each account for the observed negative relationship

between inflation and growth or between inflation and output-—even overlooking


91n a more complete analysis with a maximizing government, this ratio could be
endogenous.
                                      —15—



the possibly significant tax effects. It is only the Phillips curve that

suggests we might find an opposite relationship between inflation and growth, at

least in the short run. But the present model, in which there is full

information and full flexibility of prices, is not well—suited to the analysis of

the Phillips curve.

    Of course, the contrast between the results in this paper and those in

Sidrauski (1967a) suggest a warning that is conveyed also by considering the

history of the Phillips curve: there is unlikely to be a unique correlation

between two endogenous variables that is independent of the disturbances—-policy

induced or otherwise-—that cause them to change. Typically someone examining a

relationship like that between inflation and growth has a policy question in

mind: for instance, does money financing of a deficit result in a higher capital

stock than debt financing? It is preferable to address the policy question

directly than to ask about the general relationship between inflation and

growth.

     Many of the results presented in this lecture are derived from comparative

steady state analysis. But it is noteworthy that it is also possible to use the

models to examine impact effects of policy changes and to study the adjustment

process. The only innovation here is the use of perfect foresight, for in his

thesis Sidrauski examined adjustment processes in his maximizing model, using

adaptive expectations. Sidrauski of course did not use rational expectations

assumptions in his work. But in his building of a complete macro model with

maximizing agents, he was thoroughly in the spirit that is dominant in much of

macroeconomics today.

       1. The model discussed in Section 2 is described by equations (17), (7),

and (ii). Linearizing those equations around the steady state we obtain:


          k                      6                 -1          f       dk

       2. The determinant of the above system is

(A2)      =                      -   f2]     < 0

Since the determinant is the product of the roots, there are either one or three

negative roots.



       3. The trace of the above matrix is

(A3) Tr5 -it2in>0
The trace is the sum of the roots. Since the sum of the roots is positive, not

all roots can be negative. Accordingly there is only one negative root.
