Financial Incentives and Educational Investment: The Impact of Performance-Based Scholarships
on Student Time Use

                                              ABSTRACT

Using survey data from a field experiment in the U.S., we test whether and how financial incentives
change student behavior. We find that providing post-secondary scholarships with incentives to meet
performance, enrollment, and/or attendance benchmarks induced students to devote more time to educational
activities and to increase the quality of effort toward, and engagement with, their studies; students
also allocated less time to other activities such as work and leisure. While the incentives did not generate
impacts after eligibility had ended, they also did not decrease students’ inherent interest or enjoyment
in learning. Finally, we present evidence suggesting that students were motivated more by the incentives
provided than simply the effect of giving additional money, and that students who were arguably less
time-constrained were more responsive to the incentives as were those who were plausibly more myopic.
Overall these results indicate that well-designed incentives can induce post-secondary students to
increase investments in educational attainment.

I.      Introduction

        Educators have long been worried about relatively low levels of educational performance

among U.S. students. 1 Elementary and secondary school students in the U.S. perform poorly on

academic tests compared to their peers in other developed countries (Baldi et al., 2007), and at

the post-secondary level there is increasing concern that while the U.S. has one of the highest

rates of college attendance in the world, rates of college completion lag those of other countries

(OECD Indicators, 2011). In response, educators have implemented many policies aimed at

changing curricula, class size, teacher effectiveness, and other resources at all levels of

schooling. More recently, there has been interest in targeting another key component: the effort

exerted by students themselves towards their studies.

        One approach to motivating students to work harder in school has been to offer them

rewards for achieving prescribed benchmarks. Related to the conditional cash transfer strategies

that have been growing in popularity in developing countries (see, e.g., Das et al., 2005 and

Rawlings and Rubio, 2005), U.S. educators have implemented programs in which students are

paid for achieving benchmarks such as a minimum grade-point average (GPA) or for reading a

minimum number of books. These strategies are based on the belief that current pay-offs to

education are too far in the future (and potentially too “diffuse”) to motivate students to work

hard in school. As such, by implementing more immediate pay-offs, these incentive-based

strategies are designed to provide students with a bigger incentive to work hard.

        Unfortunately, the evidence to date of such efforts has yielded somewhat mixed, and

often small, impacts on student achievement. For example, Jackson (2010a and 2010b) find

some evidence that the Advanced Placement Incentive Program (APIP) in Texas—which


1
 For example, the 1983 report on American education, “A Nation at Risk” spurred a wave of concern regarding
poor academic performance at nearly every level among U.S. students.
                                                                                                                2


rewards high school students (and teachers) for AP courses and exam scores—increased scores

on the SAT and ACT Tests, increased rates of college matriculation and persistence (students

were more likely to remain in school beyond their first year of college), and improved post-

secondary school grades. These results are similar to those reported by Angrist and Lavy (2009)

from a high school incentive program in Israel. Somewhat in contrast, Fryer (2011) reports

suggestive evidence that rewarding elementary and secondary school students for effort focused

on education inputs, such as reading books, may increase test score achievement while rewarding

them for education outcomes, such as grades and test scores, does not. At the post-secondary

level, estimated impacts of incentives have also been modest. For example, Angrist, Lang, and

Oreopoulos (2009) and Angrist, Oreopoulos, and Williams (2012) report small impacts at a four-

year college in Canada on grades, although impacts may be larger for some subgroups. 2 Barrow,

et al. (2012) report positive impacts on enrollment and credits earned for a program aimed at

low-income adults attending community college in the U.S., and early results from MDRC’s

Performance-based Scholarship Demonstration (described below) suggest modest impacts on

some academic outcomes (such as enrollment and credits earned) but little impact on the total

number of semesters enrolled (see Richburg-Hayes et al., 2011; Cha and Patel, 2010; and Miller

et al., 2011).

        The fact that impacts of incentives on academic outcomes have been small, at best, raises

the question of whether educational investments can be effectively influenced through the use of

incentives in the sense that they actually change student behavior. Alternatively it is also

possible that these small positive results arise from statistical anomaly, reflect the provision of

additional income rather than the incentive structure, or represent changes along other

2
  Specifically, Angrist, Lang, and Oreopoulos (2009) report larger impacts for women, although the subgroup result
is not replicated in Angrist, Oreopoulos, and Williams (2012). Angrist, Oreopoulos, and Williams (2012) report
larger effects among those aware of the program rules.

dimensions such as taking easier classes.        In this paper, we evaluate the effect of two

performance-based scholarship programs for post-secondary students on a variety of outcomes,

but especially on student effort as reflected in time use in order to understand whether incentives

indeed induce students to increase effort toward their education.         Students were randomly

assigned to treatment and control groups where the treatments (the incentive payments) varied in

length and magnitude and were tied to meeting performance, enrollment, and/or attendance

benchmarks. To measure the impact of performance-based scholarships on student educational

effort, we asked respondents about time use over the prior week and implemented a time diary

survey. Further, variation in the incentive structure of the scholarships allows us to test a variety

of hypotheses about the impacts of incentive payments. For example, we can test whether

incentive payments are “habit forming” or otherwise change the achievement production

function and examine whether incentive payments negatively impact “intrinsic” motivation, i.e.,

students’ inherent interest in and enjoyment of learning.

       We find that students eligible for a performance-based scholarship (PBS) devoted more

time to educational activities, increased the quality of effort toward, and engagement with, their

studies, and allocated less time to other activities such as work and leisure. Additional evidence

indicates that incentives did not affect student behavior—either positively or negatively—after

incentive payments were removed and suggests that students were motivated by the incentives

provided by the scholarships rather than simply the additional money. Finally, other analyses

imply that students who were arguably less time-constrained were more responsive to the

performance-based scholarships as were those who were plausibly more myopic. Overall our

findings indicate that well-designed incentives can induce post-secondary students to increase

investments in educational attainment. One remaining puzzle, however, is that larger incentive
                                                                                                                      4


payments did not seem to induce students to increase effort more than smaller incentive

payments.

         We next discuss a theoretical framework for thinking about effort devoted to schooling

and the role of incentive scholarships (Section II). We describe the two interventions studied, the

data, and sample characteristics of program participants in Section III. The estimation strategy

and results are presented in Section IV, and Section V concludes.



II.      Theoretical framework

          We adopt the framework introduced by Becker (1967) in which students invest in their

education until the marginal cost of doing so equals the marginal benefit. Assuming linearity for

ease of exposition, suppose that student i’s GPA, gi, depends on ability (and/or preparation) ai,

effort ei, and some random noise εi as follows:

                                          𝒈𝒊 = 𝜹𝟎 + 𝜹𝟏 𝒆𝒊 + 𝜹𝟐 𝒂𝒊 + 𝜺𝒊            ,                                 (1)


where δ0, δ1, and δ2 are all positive parameters of the GPA production function. Let ε be

distributed F(ε), with density f(ε), and let c(e) reflect the cost of effort. Assume c(e) is an

increasing, concave, and twice differentiable function. Further assume there is a payoff W for

achieving a minimum GPA, gmin, with a payoff of zero otherwise. 3 In our application, W can be

thought of as the present discounted value of the earnings increase associated with additional

college credits (net of tuition and other costs) plus incentive payments for eligible students.

Basically, college only pays a return in terms of higher future earnings if one earns the college

credits at a minimum level of proficiency (as reflected in GPA).


3
 In fact, the payoff could be negative for students paying tuition but failing to pass any classes. One could also think
about there being a payoff to each course completed with a minimum grade level, and higher payoffs to achieving
grades above the minimum threshold.
                                                                                                   5


           Assuming students maximize utility by maximizing the net expected benefit of effort, the

student’s maximization problem is as follows:



                         𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑒 ��1 − 𝐹�𝑔𝑚𝑖𝑛 − 𝛿0 − 𝛿1 𝑒𝑖 − 𝛿2 𝑎𝑖 �� ∙ 𝑊 − 𝑐(𝑒𝑖 )� s.t. 𝑒𝑖 ≥ 0.     (2)



The optimal value of effort, ei*, is characterized by the following conditions:



                                      𝑐 ′ (𝑒𝑖∗ ) ≥ 𝑓�𝑔𝑚𝑖𝑛 − 𝛿0 − 𝛿1 𝑒𝑖∗ − 𝛿2 𝑎𝑖 � ∙ 𝛿1 𝑊,

                                                        𝑒𝑖∗ ≥ 0, and

                                  𝑒𝑖∗ �𝑓�𝑔𝑚𝑖𝑛 − 𝛿0 − 𝛿1 𝑒𝑖∗ − 𝛿2 𝑎𝑖 � ∙ 𝛿1 𝑊 − 𝑐 ′ (𝑒𝑖∗ )� = 0.   (3)



If the marginal benefit is relatively low or the marginal costs are relatively high a student may

not enroll or continue in college, setting ei* = 0. For a student who does enroll, an increase in the

payoff to meeting the benchmark (a rise in W) will lead to an increase in effort toward her

studies. Likewise a fall in W will lead to a decrease in effort. 4

           While we have written down a simple static model of optimal choice of effort, there are

potential dynamic effects which we will consider and test in addition to potential roles for

heterogeneity and possible unintended consequences. For example, traditional need-based and

merit-based scholarships provide an incentive to enroll in college by effectively lowering the

costs of enrolling in college regardless of whether the student passes her classes once she gets

there. In the theoretical framework above, these types of scholarships have no impact on the

marginal value or cost of effort conditional on enrolling in school. However, in a dynamic


4
    Of course, a change in the payoff may also affect enrollment decisions for some students.
                                                                                                               6


version of the model, future scholarship receipt may depend on meeting the gmin benchmark in

the current semester. Pell Grants, for example, stipulate that future grant receipt depends on

meeting satisfactory academic progress, but within-semester grant receipt is unaffected by

performance. Performance-based scholarships, on the other hand, increase the marginal benefit

of effort towards schoolwork in the current semester by increasing W. For example, payments

may be contingent on meeting benchmark performance goals such as a minimum GPA. Because

a PBS increases the short-run financial rewards to effort, we would expect PBS-eligible students

to allocate more time to educationally-productive activities, such as studying, which should in

turn translate into greater educational attainment, on average.

        We may expect the effectiveness of PBS programs to depend on both the size of the

scholarship as well as the impact of the program on a student’s GPA production function. In the

basic theoretical model above, the direct effect of increasing the size of the incentive payment in

the current semester is a contemporaneous increase in effort but no impact on effort in future

semesters. However, there may also be indirect effects leading to impacts in future semesters.

For example, an increase in effort in the current semester may reduce the marginal cost of effort

in the future (suppose increased studying today is “habit-forming”), leading PBS eligibility to

have a positive impact on student effort after eligibility has expired. 5 Similarly, if increased

effort today teaches students how to study more effectively (by increasing the marginal benefit of

effort through an increase in δ1), then PBS eligibility could also have a lasting positive impact by

increasing effort after eligibility has expired.

        At the same time, cognitive psychologists worry that while incentive payments may

motivate students to do better in the short term, the students may be motivated for the “wrong”

5
  This is similar to the behaviorist theory in psychology described by Gneezy and Rustichini (2000) that suggests
incentive payments tied to studying (which requires effort) will lead to a positive (or at least less negative)
association with studying in the future.
                                                                                                  7


reasons. They distinguish between internal (or intrinsic) motivation in which a student is

motivated to work hard because he or she finds hard work inherently enjoyable or interesting and

external (or extrinsic) motivation in which a student is motivated to work because it leads to a

separable outcome (such as a performance-based scholarship incentive payment) (see, e.g., Deci

(1975) and Deci and Ryan (1985)).         A literature in psychology documents more positive

educational outcomes the greater the level of “internalization” of the motivation (e.g., Pintrich

and De Groot, 1990). As such, one potential concern regarding performance-based rewards in

education is that while such scholarships may increase external motivation, they may decrease

internal motivation (e.g., Deci, Koestner, and Ryan, 1999). In the model above, a reduction in

intrinsic motivation could be viewed as raising students’ cost of effort. Assuming this effect is

permanent, we would expect to see a negative impact of PBS eligibility on effort in future

semesters after PBS eligibility has expired (Huffman and Bognanno, 2012; and Benabou and

Tirole, 2008). Some even hypothesize that the reduction in intrinsic motivation may more than

offset the external motivation provided by the incentive. This would lead to a negative impact of

PBS eligibility even during semesters in which incentive payments were provided (Gneezy and

Rustichini, 2000).

        There may also be some heterogeneity in responsiveness across students. Whether and

by how much a performance incentive changes an individual student’s effort will depend on

ability and the marginal cost of effort. Suppose the density f() in equation (3) is roughly normally

distributed with small values in the tails. For a high-ability student, increasing the payoff W will

have little effect on her effort because she will essentially be able to meet the minimum GPA

requirement on ability with no increased effort. The reason is her prior ability alone made it

likely she would achieve the GPA benchmark. For students with lower ability or who are less
                                                                                                                  8


well prepared, the performance incentive will induce them to increase effort in order to increase

the probability of meeting the minimum GPA requirement. 6 We also expect that the performance

incentive will have bigger impacts on effort for students who heavily discount future benefits as

the returns to schooling in terms of future earnings should already motivate less-myopic students

but may be too far in the future to have an impact on more present-oriented students; effectively,

myopic students perceive a lower W.                 On the cost side (all else equal), there may be

heterogeneity in cost functions, and we would expect to see students facing a higher marginal

cost of effort (such as those with young children) to have a smaller change in effort in response

to changes in the payoff W than students facing a lower marginal cost of effort.

        Finally, while the intention of a performance-based scholarship is to increase student

effort in educationally productive ways, it may unintentionally increase student attempts to raise

their performance in ways that are not educationally productive. For example, Cornwell, Lee,

and Mustard (2005) find that the Georgia HOPE scholarship which had grade incentives but not

credit incentives reduced the likelihood that students registered for a full credit load and

increased the likelihood that students withdrew from courses presumably to increase the

probability that they met the minimum GPA benchmark. Other unintended consequences could

include cheating on exams, asking professors to regrade tests and/or papers, or taking easier

classes.



III.    The Scholarship Programs and the Time-Use Survey

        The data we analyze were collected as part of the Performance-Based Scholarship

Demonstration conducted by MDRC at 8 institutions and at a state-wide organization in

  If the benchmark is set too high, however, students with a low probability of meeting the benchmark are unlikely
to increase effort because the probability of meeting the GPA benchmark, even with high levels of effort, is too low
and effort is costly.

California. The structure of the scholarship programs as well as the populations being studied

vary across the sites; this study presents results from a supplementary “Time Use” module we

implemented at sites in New York City (NYC) and California (CA). 7 In both demonstrations

analyzed, the scholarships supplemented any other financial aid for which the students qualified

(such as federal Pell Grants and state aid), although institutions may have adjusted aid awards in

response to scholarship eligibility for some students. 8



A.       The Scholarship Programs

         The New York City Program

         The intervention in New York City was implemented at two campuses of the City

University of New York System (CUNY) − the Borough of Manhattan Community College

(BMCC) and Hostos. Students were recruited on campus in three cohorts (Fall 2008, Spring

2009, and Fall 2009). Eligible students were aged 22-35, had tested into (and not yet passed) at

least one developmental course, were eligible for a federal Pell Grant, enrolled in at least 6 credit

or contact hours (at the time of “intake”), and lived away from their parents. Once program staff

determined eligibility for the study, students who agreed to participate provided baseline

demographic information and were randomly assigned by MDRC to the program or control

groups. Everyone who attended an orientation session (at which they were introduced to the

study) and signed up to participate in the study received a $25 metro card.




7
  See Richburg-Hayes (2009) for more details on the programs in each site in the larger demonstration.
8
  Institutions are required to reduce aid awards when the financial aid award plus the outside scholarship exceeds
financial need by more than $300. In practice, institutions generally treat outside scholarship earnings favorably by
reducing students’ financial aid in the form of loans or work study or applying the scholarship to unmet financial
need. (See www.finaid.org/scholarships/outside.phtml.) Other MDRC studies have found that PBS-eligible
participants received net increases in aid and/or reductions in student loans relative to their control group. See Cha
and Patel (2010), Miller et al. (2011), and Patel and Rudd (2012).
                                                                                                                  10


         Students randomly assigned to a program (treatment) group were eligible to receive a

performance-based scholarship worth up to $1,300 each semester for two semesters (for a total

of $2,600). 9 As the goal of this scholarship was to reward attendance (an input to academic

success) as well as performance at the end of the semester, the incentive payments were

structured as follows: After registering for at least six credits (meaning tuition had been paid or

a payment plan had been established) the student received $200; with “continued enrollment at

mid-semester” he or she received $450; and with a final grade of “C” or better (or having passed

developmental education) in at least 6 credits (or equated credits), he or she received $650. 10 So

as not to discourage students mid-semester, if a student missed the mid-semester payment it

could be recouped at the end of the semester if the final requirement was met. The students were

also eligible for the entire incentive a second semester, independent of having met any of the first

semester benchmarks. 11



         The California Program

         The California program is unique in the PBS demonstration in that random assignment

took place in the spring of the participants’ senior year of high school and students could use the

scholarship at any accredited institution.12               Individuals in the study were selected from

participants in “Cash for College” workshops at which attendees were given assistance in
9
  In reality in NYC some students were randomly assigned to a second treatment group that was eligible to receive
the performance-based scholarship during the regular semesters plus a performance-based scholarship for one
consecutive summer worth up to $1,300 (for a total of $3,900). Because we focus on regular semester outcomes
during which the incentive structures for the two treatment groups are identical, we do not present results separately
for the two treatment groups.
10
   “Continued enrollment at mid-semester” was determined by whether the student attended class at least once in the
first three weeks of the semester and at least once during the fourth or fifth weeks of the semester. Equated credits
are given in developmental education classes and do not count towards a degree or certificate.
11
    See Richburg-Hayes, Sommo, and Welbeck (2011) for more background on the New York demonstration.
12
    At the other sites, the scholarships were tied to enrollment at the institution at which the student was initially
randomly assigned. In addition, all of the other study participants were at least “on campus” to learn about the
demonstration suggesting a relatively high level of interest in, and commitment to, attending college. See Ware and
Patel (2012) for more background on the California program.
                                                                                             11


completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). In order to be eligible for the

study, they also had to complete the FAFSA by March 2 of the year in question. Study

participants were selected from sites in the Los Angeles and Far North regions in 2009 and 2010

and from the Kern County and Capitol regions in 2010. Randomization occurred within each

workshop in each year. Because the students were high school seniors at the time of random

assignment, this demonstration allows us to determine the impact of these scholarships not only

on persistence among college students, but also on initial college enrollment.

       To be eligible for this study, participants had to have attended a Cash for College

workshop in one of the participating regions; been a high school senior at the time of the

workshop; submitted a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and Cal Grant GPA

Verification Form by the Cal Grant deadline (early March); met the low-income eligibility

standards based on the Cal Grant income thresholds; and signed an informed consent form or had

a parent provide consent for participation.

       The incentive varied in length (as short as one semester and as long as four semesters),

size of scholarship (as little as $1,000 and as much as $4,000), and whether there was a

performance requirement attached to it. Also, the performance-based scholarships were paid

directly to the students whereas the non-PBS was paid to the institution. Table 1, below, shows

the structure of the demonstration for the Fall 2009 cohort more specifically; the structure was

similar for the Fall 2010 cohort. There were six treatment groups labeled 1 to 6 in Table 1.

Group 1 was randomly selected to receive a California Cash for College scholarship worth

$1,000 which is a typical grant that has no performance component and is paid directly to the

student’s institution. Groups 2 through 6 had a performance-based component with payments

made directly to the student. Group 2 was randomly assigned to receive $1,000 over one
                                                                                                                 12


academic term (a semester or quarter); group 3 was randomly selected to receive $500 per

semester for two semesters (or $333 per quarter over three quarters); group 4 was selected to

receive $1,000 per semester for two semesters (or $667 per quarter over three quarters); group 5

was to receive $500 per semester for four semesters (or $333 per quarter over six quarters); and

group 6 was to receive $1,000 per semester for four semesters (or $667 per quarter over six

quarters). During fall semesters of eligibility, one-half of the PBS was paid conditional on

enrolling for six or more credits at an accredited, degree-granting institution in the U.S., and one-

half was paid if the student met the end-of-semester benchmark (a final average grade of “C” or

better in at least 6 credits). During spring semesters of eligibility, the entire scholarship payment

was based on meeting the end-of-semester benchmark.

          In addition, aside from the institution being accredited, there were no restrictions on

where the participants enrolled in college. That said, according to data from the Cash for College

workshops, among the two-thirds of students who enroll in college the following fall over 90%

attend a public college or university within California, about one-half in a two-year college and

the other half in a four-year institution.



B.      Numbers of Participants

        In Table 2 we present information on the number of students in each cohort in each

demonstration. In total 6,662 individuals were recruited to be part of the PBS study; 2,474 were

randomly assigned to the program-eligible group and 4,188 were assigned to the control group. 13

We also surveyed an additional 1,500 individuals in California as part of the control group; they

were randomly selected from non-study group individuals who were not selected to be in either

the program or control group for the MDRC study. Appendix Tables A1a and A1b show means

of background characteristics (at baseline) by treatment/control status. While there are one or

two characteristics that appear to differ between treatment and control groups, an omnibus f-test

yielded a p-value of 0.68 in Appendix Table A1a for NYC and 0.48 in Appendix Table A1b for

CA suggesting that randomization successfully balanced the two groups, on average.

        According to Richburg-Hayes and Patel (forthcoming) nearly all (99%) of the treatment

students in NYC received the initial payment the first semester and 97% received the midterm

payment (that required continued enrollment, as defined above); 72% received the performance-

based payment at the end of the term. Scholarship receipt was lower in the second semester with

only 83% receiving the first payment, 80% receiving the second, and 58% receiving the final

payment. In CA, initial results for cohort 1 reported in Ware and Patel (2012) indicate that 85

percent of the scholarship eligible participants received an enrollment payment and of those, 60

percent earned the performance-based payment at the end of the fall 2009 semester.


13
   We did not receive contact information for one individual in New York so the total number of individuals we
attempted to survey in New York and California combined is 8,161.
                                                                                                              14




C.       Time-Use Survey14

         To better understand the impact of performance-based scholarships on student

educational effort, we implemented an independent (web-based) survey of participants. We

asked respondents general questions about educational attainment and work (roughly based on

the Current Population Survey). The centerpiece included two types of questions designed to

better understand how respondents allocated their time to different activities. To understand

more “granular” time allocation we implemented a time diary for which we used the American

Time Use Survey (ATUS) as a template. Accounting for an entire 24-hour time period, the

ATUS asks the respondent to list his or her activities, describe where the activities took place,

and with whom. In addition we included questions about time use over the last 7 days to

accommodate those activities that are particularly relevant to students and for which it would be

valuable to measure over longer periods (such as time spent studying per day over the past

week). Participants were offered an incentive to participate.

        In addition to the questions regarding time use over the previous 24 hours or 7 days (that

reflect the “quantity” of time allocated to activities), the survey also included questions to

measure the quality of educational efforts. To capture these other dimensions of effort, we

included questions on learning strategies, academic self-efficacy, and motivation. To measure

learning strategies that should help students perform better in class, we included questions from

the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) (Pintrich et al. 1991). The scale

consists of five questions on a seven-point scale with questions such as: “When I become

confused about something I’m reading, I go back and try to figure it out” (responses range from


14
  We only briefly describe the survey in this section. See Barrow and Rouse (2013) for more details on the survey
design and implementation.
                                                                                                                    15


not at all true (1) to very true (7)). In addition, researchers have documented a link between

perceived self-efficacy (e.g., an individual’s expectations regarding success or assessment of his

or her ability to master material) and academic performance (see, e.g., Pintrich and De Groot

1990). Therefore we included five questions that form a scale to capture perceived academic

efficacy (the Patterns of Adaptive Learning Scales (PALS) by Midgley et al. 2000). These

questions are of the form, “I’m certain I can master the skills taught in this class this year.” with

responses on a similar seven-point scale.

         Finally, we attempted to assess whether the incentives also induced unintended

consequences such as cheating, taking easier classes, or attending classes simply to receive the

reward not because of an inherent interest in the academics (which some psychologists argue can

ultimately adversely affect academic achievement, as discussed earlier). As such, on the survey

we asked participants about life satisfaction, whether they had taken “challenging classes,” if

they had ever asked for a regrade, and if they had ever felt it necessary to cheat. To capture

external and internal motivation, we asked questions of both current students and those not

currently enrolled along the lines of, “If I do my class assignments, it’s because I would feel

guilty if I did not” (also on a seven-point scale). 15

         We focus this analysis on time use and effort in the first semester after random

assignment as the majority of both program and control students were enrolled in a post-

secondary institution such that an analysis of time use is most compelling as one of the factors

that determine educational success. 16 That said, we also surveyed each cohort in the second



15
   Specifically, “external motivation” is the mean of two questions: “If I attend class regularly it’s because I want to
get a good grade” and “If I raise my hand in class it’s because I want to receive a good participation grade.”
“Internal motivation” is the mean two questions: “If I turn in a class assignment on time it’s because it makes me
happy to be on time” and “If I attend class often it’s because I enjoy learning.”
16
   Because we focus on the first semester after random assignment, we do not include data from the first cohort in
New York City as we were only able to first survey them in the second semester after random assignment.
                                                                                                           16


semester after random assignment to gauge the extent to which time use changed and whether

differences between the program and control group members persisted. Overall we achieved an

average response rate of about 73% in New York City and about 57% in California in terms of

the percentage of participants who ever responded to a survey.

        Table 3 presents selected mean baseline characteristics for study participants at the time

of random assignment and compares them to nationally-representative samples of students from

the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) of 2008 designed to be comparable to the

participants in the study. 17 In both sites there were slightly more women than men. Further, the

proportion of Hispanics and blacks was much higher in the study sites than nationally. For

example, in NYC 80% of the participants were black or Hispanic compared to 40% nationally; in

CA 63% of participants were Hispanic compared to 15% nationally, and only 4% were black.

Similarly, in both sites a language other than English is likely to be spoken. That said, aside

from the racial/ethnic composition, the baseline characteristics of the study participants resemble

those of other post-secondary students nationally.



IV.     Estimation and Results


A.      Empirical Approach and Sample

        Below we present estimates of the effect of program eligibility on a variety of outcomes.

We model each outcome Y for individual i as follows:



                                       𝑌𝑖 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑇𝑖 + 𝑿𝑖 Θ + 𝒑𝒊 𝛾 + 𝜈𝑖 ,                                  (4)


17
  The baseline data were collected by MDRC at the time participants were enrolled in the study and before they
were randomly assigned to a program, control, or non-study group. The samples from the NPSAS have the same
age ranges as the two sites. See the notes to the tables for other sample restrictions.
                                                                                                                 17




where Ti is a treatment status indicator for individual i being eligible for a program scholarship,

Xi is a vector of baseline characteristics (which may or may not be included), pi is a vector of

indicators for the student’s randomization pool, νi is the error term, and α, β, Θ, and γ are

parameters to be estimated; β represents the average effect on outcome Y of being randomly

assigned to be eligible for the scholarship. In some specifications, we allow for a vector of

treatment indicators depending on the type of scholarship for which the individual was eligible.

        To facilitate interpretation and to improve statistical power, we group impacts on

individual time use into two “domains” of most interest for this study: academic activities and

non-academic activities. 18 Further, we also summarize impacts of measures that reflect the

quality of educational effort and those that capture potential “unintended consequences.”

        To see how we analyze the effect of eligibility to receive a PBS on a “domain,” we note

that we can rewrite equation (4) to obtain an effect of the treatment on each individual outcome,

where k refers to the kth outcome:



                                𝑌𝑘 = 𝛼𝑘 + 𝛽𝑘 𝑇 + 𝑿Θ𝑘 + 𝒑𝛾𝑘 + 𝜈𝑘 = 𝑨Φ𝑘 + 𝜈𝑘 .                                    (5)



We can then summarize the individual estimates using a seemingly-unrelated regression (SUR)

approach (Kling and Liebman, 2004). This approach is similar to simply averaging the estimated

effect of being randomly assigned to be eligible for a PBS, if there are no missing values and no

covariates.


18
   As an alternative mechanism of grouping outcomes we conducted a factor analysis to identify empirically-
determined principal components. The results roughly suggested that variables reflecting academic effort should be
grouped together and those reflecting time spent on non-academic time should be grouped together. That said, we
prefer our approach because it is more intuitive and it is possible to identify exactly which outcomes contribute to
each domain.
                                                                                                18


       More specifically, we first estimate equation (5) (or variants) and obtain an item-by-item

estimate of β (i.e., βk). We then standardize the estimates of βk by the standard deviation of the

outcome using the responses from the control group of participants (σk). The estimate of the

impact of eligibility on time use and individual behavior is then the average of the standardized

β’s within each domain,



                                           1       𝛽𝑘�
                                   𝛽𝐴𝑉𝐺 = 𝐾 ∑𝐾
                                             𝑘=1      𝜎𝑘 .                                     (6)


We estimate the standard errors for βAVG using the following seemingly-unrelated regression

system that allows us to account for the covariance between the estimates of βk within each

domain:



                          𝑌 = (𝐼𝑘 ⊗ 𝑨)Φ + 𝝂         𝑌 = (𝑌1′ , … , 𝑌𝐾′ )′                      (7)



where IK is a K by K identity matrix and A is defined as in equation (5). We calculate the

standard error of the resulting summary measure as the square root of the weighted sum of the

variances and covariances among the individual effect estimates. One potential advantage of the

SUR is that while estimates of each βk may be statistically insignificant, the estimate of βAVG may

be statistically significant due to covariation among the outcomes. We present estimates of the

original underlying regressions as well as those using the summary measure (i.e. the outcomes

grouped together within a domain).

       From our data, we focus on respondents to the first survey administered in the first

semester after random assignment although we also report some results based on second
                                                                                                               19


semester surveys. After dropping individuals who did not complete the time diary (or who had

more than four “non-categorized” hours in the 24-hour time period) and those for whom we did

not have data in the first part of the survey (due to an error by the survey contractor), we have

data from 2,874 complete surveys in CA and 613 surveys in NYC. These complete surveys

represent 92% and 93% (respectively) of the total number of survey respondents. Appendix

Tables A2a and A2b show means of background characteristics (at baseline) by treatment/control

status for our analysis sample. Again, while there are one or two characteristics that appear to

differ between treatment and control groups, omnibus f-tests suggest that the two groups remain

balanced, on average.



B.      Basic Program Impacts on Educational and Other Outcomes

        In Table 4a we present estimates of the effect of program eligibility on individual

measures of time use based on our survey; in this table we do not distinguish between the types

of performance-based scholarships offered in each of the two sites. In column (1) we provide

outcome means for the control group participants in New York City, and in column (4) we

provide outcome means for the control group participants in California.                        Program effect

estimates with standard errors in parentheses are presented in column (2) for New York and

columns (5) and (6) for California. Note that the estimates in column (5) reflect the impact of

being eligible for a PBS while the estimates in column (6) reflect the impact of being eligible for

a non-PBS. The p-value corresponding to the test that the PBS program impact equals the non-

PBS program impact is presented in column (7).                  Program effects are estimated including

controls for “randomization pool” fixed effects but no other baseline characteristics. 19


19
   For NYC, randomization pool fixed effects reflect the community college and cohort in which the participant was
recruited. For CA, these fixed effects reflect the workshop region—Los Angeles, Far North, Kern County, or
                                                                                                        20


        In New York City we find that program-eligible students are no more likely to report ever

enrolling in a post-secondary institution since random assignment than those in the control

group. This result is not particularly surprising given that students were on campus when they

were recruited for the program and needed to have registered for at least 6 credits (or equated

credits) in order to be eligible to participate in the study. As evidence, 92% of NYC control-

group students report ever attending a post-secondary institution since random assignment. In

contrast there are larger differences in outcomes reflecting student effort. For example, the

results suggest that eligibility for a performance-based scholarship induced participants to devote

about 30 more minutes to educational activities in the prior 24-hour period than those assigned to

the control group, although the difference is not statistically significant. And while control group

students report spending about 2.8 hours per day studying in the last seven days, the PBS-eligible

students report devoting 8 percent (or 13 minutes) more time to studying per day, although the

difference is not statistically significant at conventional levels. Further, 78 percent of control

group students report having attended most or all of their classes in the last seven days compared

with 84 percent of students eligible for a performance-based scholarship, a difference that is

statistically significant at the 10 percent level.

        Results in the remaining columns of the table are from the California demonstration.

Recall that a key difference between the CA program and that in NYC is the students in CA were

randomly assigned in the spring of their senior year in high school while we surveyed them in

the fall of what would be their first year attending a post-secondary institution. Focusing on the

coefficients reported in column (5) of the table, we find that PBS-eligible students were 5.2

percentage points more likely than the control group to report ever enrolling at a post-secondary


Capital—and cohort in which the participant was recruited. Estimates are similar if we control for baseline
characteristics such as age, sex, race, and parental education.
                                                                                                  21


institution, a difference that is statistically significant at the 1 percent level. Further, the PBS-

eligible students reported studying about 9 minutes more per day than those in the control group,

were 7.3 percentage points more likely to have been prepared for class in the last 7 days, and

were 6.7 percentage points more likely to report attending all or most of their classes in the last 7

days.

        An important dimension to the demonstration in CA was the inclusion of a treatment

group that was eligible for a “regular” scholarship that did not require meeting performance

benchmarks. In particular, as discussed earlier, this non-PBS does not affect the marginal value

of effort because payment is not tied to meeting benchmarks and is only valid for one semester.

We generally find that the impacts are larger for those eligible for a PBS than for those offered a

non-PBS; however, in most cases we are unable to detect a statistically significant difference.

Tests of the difference in impact between the PBS and the non-PBS also potentially provide

insight into whether students are responding to the incentives in the PBS or the additional

income. We discuss this implication, below.

        Before turning to how participants allocated their time to other activities, we consider two

measures that may indicate ways of increasing academic effort without necessarily spending

more time studying, namely, learning strategies and academic self-efficacy. As discussed above,

PBS eligibility may induce participants to concentrate more on their studies by encouraging them

to employ more effective study strategies making the time devoted to educational activities more

productive. Similarly, by raising their academic self-efficacy the scholarships may also induce

students to be more engaged with their studies. Results using scales based on the MSLQ

Learning Strategies index and the PALS academic self-efficacy index are presented in the last

two rows of Table 4a. We have standardized the variables using their respective control group
                                                                                                              22


means and standard deviations; the coefficients therefore reflect impacts in standard deviation

units. For both NYC and CA we estimate that eligibility for a PBS had positive and statistically

significant impacts on these dimensions that range from 14 to 23 percent of a standard deviation.

Note as well, the impacts on learning strategies and academic self-efficacy for those in CA

selected for a non-PBS were substantially smaller than those selected for a PBS, consistent with

increased academic effort on the part of PBS-eligible individuals.

        Results presented thus far generally suggest that participants selected for a PBS devoted

more time and effort to educational activities. Given there are only 24 hours in the day, a key

question is what did PBS-eligible participants spend less time doing? Table 4b presents results

from three other broad time categories based on the 24-hour time diary: work, household

production, and leisure and other activities. 20 In NYC we estimate that the typical participant (as

represented by the control group) works about 2.5 hours per day, devotes nearly 12 hours to

home production (which includes sleeping), and devotes about 5 hours to “leisure.” We find that

PBS-eligible participants accommodated spending about 30 more minutes in the last 24 hours on

educational activities by devoting about 41 fewer minutes to leisure activities, an impact that is

statistically significant at the 5 percent level. The typical participant in CA spends less time

working and correspondingly more time in leisure activities than the NYC participants.

However, we still find that participants in CA accommodated increased time spent on

educational activities by spending (statistically) significantly less time on leisure activities,

including reducing the number of nights out for fun during the past week. We find no evidence

that PBS (or non-PBS) eligibility induced participants to reduce time spent on work or home


20
   “Home production” includes time spent on personal care, sleeping, eating and drinking, performing household
tasks, and caring for others. “Leisure activities” include participating in a cultural activity, watching
TV/movies/listening to music, using the computer, spending time with friends, sports, talking on the phone, other
leisure, volunteering, and religious activities.
                                                                                                    23


production; for both sites the estimated PBS impacts are small, (mostly) positive, and not

statistically different from zero.

        Finally, concerns about using incentives for academic achievement include the possibility

of unintended consequences of the programs, such as cheating or taking easier classes to get

good grades, or reducing students’ internal motivation to pursue more education. In the bottom

rows of Table 4b we present impacts on several potential unintended consequences for the

participants in both the NYC and CA sites. In NYC we find little systematic evidence that

eligibility for a PBS resulted in adverse outcomes. For example, those randomly selected for a

PBS were more likely to report being satisfied with life and having taken challenging classes and

were less likely to report having asked for a re-grade or having felt they had to cheat (only the

impact on life satisfaction is statistically significant (at the 10 percent level)). Further, they were

significantly more likely to report behavior consistent with increased internal motivation. In

other words, the incentive payments did not seem to reduce their internal motivation.

        In contrast, the results regarding unintended consequences are more mixed in CA. For

example, on the one hand those in CA who were eligible for a PBS were more satisfied with life

and more likely to take challenging classes compared to the control group (a difference that is

statistically significant at the 1 percent level). On the other hand, PBS-eligible participants

reported an increase in behavior that is consistent with external motivation compared to both

control group participants and those randomly selected for a non-PBS.

        Overall, the results in Tables 4a and 4b suggest that eligibility for a scholarship that

requires achieving benchmarks results in an increase in time and effort devoted to educational

activities with a decrease in time devoted to leisure. Further, there is at best mixed evidence that

the same incentives result in adverse outcomes, such as cheating, “grade grubbing,” or taking
                                                                                                                   24


easier classes. However, for many of the outcomes the impacts are not statistically different

from zero.

         To improve precision, in Table 5 we combine the individual outcomes into four

“domains” using the SUR approach described above. Specifically we focus on academic

activities, quality of educational input, non-academic activities, and unintended consequences. 21

The impacts reported in Tables 5 and subsequent tables have been standardized such that they

represent average impacts as a percentage of the control group standard deviation.                         Note that

now we estimate a positive impact on academic activities of about 10 percent of a standard

deviation in both NYC and CA and that both impacts are statistically significant at the 5 percent

level. We also continue to estimate a positive and statistically significant impact on the quality

of educational effort. In addition, we estimate a reduction in non-academic activities although

the coefficient estimate is not significantly different from zero in NYC and is only significant at

the 10 percent level in CA. Further, in both NYC and CA we estimate that, overall, there is not

an increase in “unintended consequences” as a result of the academic financial incentive. In

sum, these results suggest that scholarship incentives change student time allocation in the sense

that they spend more time and effort on academic activities and less time on other activities. 22


21
   “Educational activities” includes: “Hours spent on all academics in the last 24 hours,” “Hours studied in past 7
days,” “Prepared for last class in last 7 days,” and “Attended most/all classes in last 7 days.” “Quality of
educational input” includes “Academic self-efficacy” and “MSLQ index.” “Non-academic activities” includes
“Hours on household production,” “Hours on leisure,” “Nights out for fun in the past 7 days,” “Hours worked in
last 24 hours,” and “Hours worked in the past 7 days.” And “Unintended consequences” includes “Strongly
agree/agree have taken challenging classes,” “Ever felt had to cheat,” “indices of external motivation and internal
motivation,” “Ever asked for a re-grade,” and “Very satisfied/satisfied with life.” We do not include whether an
individual had “ever enrolled” in a post-secondary institution in the “all academic activities” index as it represents
an academic decision on the extensive margin rather than the intensive margin, and NYC participants were recruited
on campus after they had made the decision to enroll.
22
   To explore the possibility that results (particularly in CA) are driven by an incentive effect only on the extensive
margin, we have re-estimated the impacts limiting the samples to those students who enrolled in school. We find
that estimated impacts on academic activities are somewhat smaller but still statistically different from zero
suggesting that PBS eligibility affects both the extensive and intensive margins. Of course this relies on the
assumption that those who are induced by the scholarship to enroll in school would not have otherwise put forth
more effort toward their studies.

C.      Impacts by Size, Duration, and Incentive Structure of the Scholarship

        Three key questions are whether the size of the potential scholarship affects the impact on

student behavior, whether scholarship eligibility impacts student behavior even after incentives

are removed, and whether it is the incentive structure or the additional income that generates

changes in student behavior. Prior studies of performance-based scholarships have tended to

focus on one type of scholarship of a particular duration with variation in other types of

resources available to students (such as student support services or a counselor). In CA students

eligible for a performance-based scholarship were also randomly assigned to scholarships of

differing durations and/or sizes as well as a non-performance-based scholarship. As noted in

Table 1, CA students selected for scholarship eligibility were assigned to one non-incentive

scholarship worth $1,000 for one term or to one of five types of incentive scholarships that

ranged from $1,000 for one term to $1,000 for each of four terms or $500 for each of two terms

to $500 for each of four terms. We exploit this aspect of the design of the demonstration in CA

to study the impact of scholarship characteristics on student behavior. 23 We present results using

SUR in Table 6. 24



        Impacts by Size of the Scholarship

        Theoretically one would expect that the larger-sized scholarships would induce increased

effort compared to smaller-sized scholarships during the semesters for which the students were

eligible. As such, in the first semester after random assignment, we might expect to see a

23
   While we are able to test for some dimensions over which we would expect to see impacts by the characteristics
of the scholarship, we also note that we only followed the students for at most two semesters after random
assignment and therefore cannot test all dimensions on which the scholarship structure might matter.

available from the authors on request.
                                                                                                26


difference between scholarships worth $1,000 and those worth $500 per term. In Panel A of

Table 6 we begin by examining whether larger scholarships generated larger impacts than

smaller scholarships. Using results from the first academic term after random assignment (fall),

impact estimates of the $500/term scholarships are presented in column (1) and the $1,000/term

scholarships in column (2). P-values for the test of equality of the coefficient estimates in

columns (1) and (2) are presented in column (4). Interestingly, we do not find large differences

in the effect of PBS eligibility related to the size of the scholarship. Students who were eligible

for a $500 per semester scholarship responded similarly on most outcomes to students who were

eligible for a $1,000 per semester scholarship suggesting that larger incentive payment amounts

did not lead to larger impacts on student effort. While this result is familiar in the context of

survey implementation where experimental evidence suggests that larger incentives do not

increase response rates (see, e.g., James and Bolstein (1992)), other laboratory and field

experiments have found that paying a larger incentive improves performance relative to a smaller

incentive (e.g., Gneezy and Rustichini (2000) and Lau (2013)). This finding remains a puzzle,

although we offer some potential explanations for further consideration in the conclusion.



       Impacts by Duration of the Scholarship

       If incentives have no effect on the GPA production function (i.e. δ1 and δ2 in equations

(2) and (3) are fixed), then one would expect that only the longer-duration scholarships would

affect effort during the additional semesters of eligibility. As we note above, however, some of

the literature on incentives and motivation predicts that we might observe reductions in effort

after incentives are removed if the PBS has a negative effect on intrinsic motivation (Huffman

and Bognanno, 2012; Benabou and Tirole, 2003). Alternatively, one might expect that increased
                                                                                                27


effort in the first semester might be habit-forming or make students more efficient at

transforming study time into GPA in the second semester. In the latter case, PBSs may continue

to have positive impacts on student outcomes in semesters after eligibility has expired. In Panel

B of Table 6, we look at results for outcomes measured in the second semester after random

assignment and consider impacts for the one-term scholarships that have expired (PBS and non-

PBS) and the four PBSs for which eligibility continued two or more terms.

       To begin, the results reported in column (1) examine the impacts of PBS eligibility on

second semester student outcomes for participants who are no longer eligible for PBS payments.

We find that the impacts of PBSs are largely contemporaneous. We find no difference in

enrollment probabilities or the index of all academic activities between one-term PBS eligible

participants and the control group during the second program semester. However, there is

suggestive evidence of a lasting positive impact on the quality of educational inputs. Namely,

one-term PBS eligible students have higher quality of effort than the control group in the

semester after eligibility has expired, but the result is only statistically significant at the 10

percent level.

       The results in column (2) represent the impacts of PBS eligibility in the second semester

after random assignment for those who continue to be eligible for PBS payments. Here we

continue to find positive impacts of PBS eligibility on academic effort and quality of effort

relative to control group participants, and we find negative impacts of PBS eligibility on non-

academic activities and unintended consequences. As such, we find that a performance-based

scholarship primarily affects student behavior in the semester in which the student is eligible for

the scholarship. In contrast to predictions from some dynamic models, we do not detect a

negative impact of incentive eligibility on educationally-productive behavior once the incentive
                                                                                                              28


is removed nor do we find strong evidence of a lasting change in student behavior as a result of

prior eligibility for an incentive.



        Incentives versus Additional Income

        Finally an important question regarding any results with performance-based scholarships

is whether the impacts are driven by the additional income or by the incentive structure of the

scholarship. In other words, does it matter that the PBS comes with an incentive structure or

would a simple monetary award with no incentives generate the same impacts? In our study, a

comparison of the (fall term) impacts of the non-PBS (worth $1,000 in one term) and the PBS of

$1,000 per term potentially provides a test of the impact of the incentive structure in the

performance-based scholarship compared with just awarding additional money. This test can be

made in Panel A of Table 6 by comparing the impacts of the $1,000 PBSs (column 2) to those of

the $1,000 per term non-PBS in the first term (column 3) (the p-values of the tests of equality are

in column (5)). With the exception of the coefficient on “unintended consequences,” we find

that the magnitudes of the PBS coefficient estimates are larger in absolute value than those for

the non-PBS, although the differences cannot be detected at conventional levels of statistical

significance. 25 These results are consistent with the incentive structure in the scholarships, rather

than primarily the additional income inducing the changes in behavior.

        However, there was a critical difference in how the two types of scholarships were

awarded that might also explain the larger impacts for the incentive scholarships: the incentive-

based scholarships were paid directly to the students whereas the non-PBS was paid to the

institutions. As such, the non-PBS may not have been as salient to the student; there is also the


25
  The results are similar if we compare the one-term, non-PBS scholarship impacts to the one-term, $1,000 PBS and
are available from the authors on request.
                                                                                                  29


possibility that institutions at least partly off-set the non-PBS with reductions in other forms of

financial aid. Further, one might interpret the fact that the PBS (column (2) of Table 6, Panel A)

had a larger impact on enrollment than the non-PBS (columns (3) of Table 6, Panel A) as

providing support for these alternative interpretations since one would expect the non-PBS to

have a larger impact on ever enrolling in an institution than the PBS since the non-PBS was a

guaranteed payment. The fact that the non-PBS does not appear to have affected enrollment may

suggest the students were simply unaware of the award or that institutions off-set the award with

reductions in other financial aid.

       While we cannot completely rule out these alternative explanations, we suspect they do

not explain the results for two reasons. First, the point estimate in column (3) suggests that the

non-PBS had no impact on enrollment. Given the literature on the effect of college subsidies on

enrollment this would only occur if the institutions completely off-set the non-PBS with

reductions in other financial aid, which is unlikely given that institutions most often treat outside

scholarship aid favorably, as detailed in footnote 8. Second, Deming and Dynarski (2010)

conclude that the best estimates of the impact of educational subsidies on enrollment suggest that

eligibility for $1,000 in subsidy increases enrollment by about four percentage points, and the

coefficient estimate for the impact of the non-PBS is not statistically different from this impact.

In contrast, the estimated impact of the PBS scholarships on enrollment, when scaled by how

much students actually received, is larger.

       Taken together, we believe the evidence suggests an interpretation that incentives played

a key role in changing student behavior. We note that this finding is also consistent with Scott-

Clayton (2011) who studies the West Virginia PROMISE scholarship which is a merit

scholarship with continuing eligibility that depends on meeting minimum credit and GPA
                                                                                                   30


benchmarks and that had relatively large impacts on student educational attainment. As credit

completion tended to be concentrated around the renewal thresholds, she concludes that the

scholarship incentive was a key component for the success of the program.



D.     Impacts by Type of Participant

       Finally, we consider whether the impact of the incentive scholarships differs by type of

participant. In particular, we hypothesize that the scholarships should have a larger impact for

participants who have a lower marginal cost of time and those who are relatively more myopic.

Because we do not directly observe these individual characteristics, we infer them based on

background characteristics. Further, we rely on data from NYC because CA participants were

not asked detailed background characteristics at baseline. The results are presented in Table 7.

       In Panel A of Table 7, we estimate whether the incentive scholarships had a greater

impact on those participants who did not have young children under the age of six on the

assumption that parents of young children have less flexibility with their time given their

parenting responsibilities which, in turn, raises the marginal cost of their study time. The

coefficient estimates in column (1) represent the main effect of PBS eligibility; those in column

(2) represent the interaction effect; the p-value on the interaction term is presented in column (3).

       The estimated coefficient on the interaction term for all academic activities is positive in

column (2) of Panel A in Table 7 indicating that the impact of the PBS was larger for those

without children, as expected. Specifically, those without young children increased their time on

academic activities by substantially more than those with young children. Notably, however,

eligibility for a PBS generated a larger impact for those with young children compared to those

without on the quality of educational input. This may not be surprising as one might expect that
                                                                                                                31


those who find it costly to increase the quantity of their effort will try, instead, to increase the

quality of that effort in order to reach the scholarship benchmark(s). In all cases the interaction

term is not statistically significant at conventional levels due to large standard errors, but the

pattern of coefficients is suggestive.

        As a second exercise, we examine if the scholarships had a differential impact on a

subgroup of students with whom policymakers are quite concerned – those who had completed

11 or fewer years of schooling before completing a GED or enrolling in (community) college.

On the one hand, these individuals are arguably less well prepared for college because they did

not complete their high school education. On the other hand, they are a reasonably large group,

and they are getting a “second” chance at schooling. These results are reported in Panel B of

Table 7.

        Indeed, we find that incentives matter more for these second-chance students.                         For

example, the program impact on time spent on educational activities was significantly larger for

participants who dropped out of high school before 12th grade than for those who had completed

more schooling; program impacts for non-academic activities and the quality of educational

inputs were also larger. These differences are statistically significant at traditional levels. One

possible explanation for this differential response is that those individuals who had dropped out

of high school before enrolling in a community college are “myopic” in their time preferences as

hypothesized by researchers such as Oreopoulos (2007). That is, the incentive may matter more

for those who discount the future the greatest. 26



26
   We have also estimated differential impacts by an indicator of ex ante likelihood that a student will meet the
benchmark (high school GPA or predicted probability using baseline characteristics) under the hypothesis that
students predicted to be somewhat below the benchmark will have a larger response to the incentive than students
who are highly likely to meet the benchmark. We find suggestive evidence that this is the case; however, the choice
of the cut-off is not well-defined and the results are sensitive to this choice.
                                                                                                  32


          While we do not have direct measures of the marginal cost of time for participants or the

rates at which they discount the future, we find evidence that the performance-based scholarships

had larger impacts for some subgroups that could be explained by the incentive mechanisms

largely working through hypothesized channels.



V.     Conclusion

       Although education policymakers have become increasingly interested in using

incentives to improve educational outcomes, the evidence continues to generate, at best, small

impacts, leading to the question of whether such incentives can actually change student effort

toward their educational attainment as suggested by Becker’s model of individual decision-

making.     As a whole, we find evidence consistent with this model: students eligible for

performance-based scholarships increased effort in terms of the amount and quality of time spent

on educational activities and decreased time spent on other activities. Further, it appears that

such changes in behavior do not persist beyond eligibility for the performance-based scholarship

suggesting that such incentives do not permanently change their cost of effort or their ability to

transform effort into educational outcomes. And, students expected to be most responsive to the

incentive – such as those with fewer time constraints and those who may be more myopic in their

time preferences – likely were.

       An important question arising from this study is why the larger incentive payments did

not generate larger increases in effort. We offer a few potential explanations worthy of further

consideration. First, the result may suggest that students need just a small prompt to encourage

them to put more effort into their studies but that larger incentives are unnecessary. Further, it is

possible that as the value of the incentive payment (external motivation) increases, students’
                                                                                                                 33


internal motivation declines at a faster rate such that negative impacts on intrinsic motivation

increasingly moderate any positive impacts of the incentive on educational effort. 27 It may also

be that students face constraints in their ability to change their effort level such that they are

unable to change their behavior further, as suggested by the smaller impact on time on academic

activities for participants who were also parents. Finally, these results could also be consistent

with students not fully understanding their own “education production function,” i.e. how their

own effort and ability will be transformed into academic outcomes like grades. While the

students seem to understand that increases in effort are necessary to improve outcomes, they may

overestimate their likelihood of meeting the benchmark and underestimate the marginal impact

of effort on the probability of meeting the benchmark leading to suboptimal levels of effort.28

While our data do not allow us to thoroughly understand why larger incentive payments did not

generate larger changes in behavior, understanding why they did not would be important for the

optimal design of incentive schemes to improve educational attainment.

        More generally, this study highlights the potential benefits of better understanding

student behavior in response to interventions to provide insights for future policy development.

For example, if further study confirms that, indeed, those most likely to be constrained by time

(such as parents) are less able to change the amount of time devoted to studies, then effective

strategies to improve educational attainment among nontraditional students must recognize this

reality among these students. Specifically, any efforts to improve their educational outcomes

must also address constraints on their time, allowing them the ability to respond to the

intervention or program, such as strategic scheduling and bundling of classes or more condensed

27
   The evidence available in our study on this last point does not suggest this is a promising explanation, but such
evidence is far from conclusive.
28
   While this interpretation is appealing and we believe worthy of further consideration, it does suggest that we
would expect larger scholarships to induce larger responses in the second semester after students have learned more
about their own abilities and effectiveness at transforming effort into grades, which we do not find.
                                                                                            34


curricula. And, if this intervention was more effective for high school drop outs because of a

difference in time preference, strategies for helping this population of students would be more

effective if combined with systems that made rewards to increased academic effort more

immediate.

       Finally, while the evidence from this study of performance-based scholarships suggests

modest impacts, such grants may nonetheless be a useful tool in postsecondary education policy

as they appear to induce positive behavioral changes, and evidence from other similar studies,

such as Barrow et al. (2014), suggests that even with small impacts on educational attainment,

such relatively low-cost interventions may nonetheless be cost effective.

Notes: Based on authors' calculations from MDRC data and data from the U.S. Department of
Education's 2008 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) of 2008. We limit the NPSAS data
to first-time students, enrolled at any point from July 1 through December 31, 2007. For comparability
with the PBS New York sample, in column (2) we limit the sample to students aged 22 to 36 attending
public two-year colleges. For comparability with the PBS California sample, we include students aged
16-20 who are attending any type of institution in column (4). The NPSAS means and number of
observations are weighted by the 2008 study weight.

Notes: Estimates are indexed estimates obtained via the SUR strategy discussed in the paper.
Regressions also include an indicator for parental status/low educational attainment and cohort-
location fixed effects. In the "Unintended Consequences" Index, Internal Motivation, Agree to Take
Challenging Classes, and Satisfied with Life are adjusted so that a negative indicates a "good" outcome.
* indicates statistical significance at the 10% level; ** indicates statistical significance at the 5% level;
