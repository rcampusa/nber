World Shocks, World Prices, and Business Cycles: An Empirical Investigation

JEL No. F41

                                         ABSTRACT

Most existing studies of the macroeconomic effects of global shocks assume that they are
mediated by a single intratemporal relative price such as the terms of trade and possibly an
intertemporal price such as the world interest rate. This paper presents an empirical framework in
which multiple commodity prices and the world interest rate transmit world disturbances.
Estimates on a panel of 138 countries over the period 1960-2015 indicate that world shocks
explain on average 33 percent of aggregate fluctuations in individual economies. This figure
doubles when the model is estimated on post 2000 data. The increase is attributable mainly to a
change in the domestic transmission mechanism as opposed to changes in the world commodity
price process as argued in the literature on the financialization of world commodity markets.

1    Introduction
The conventional wisdom is that world shocks mediated by the terms of trade represent a
major source of aggregate fluctuations in both developed and developing countries. This view
is to a large extent based on the predictions of calibrated open economy real business-cycle
models (Mendoza, 1995; Kose, 2002). However, recent empirical work based on structural
vector autoregression models suggests that world shocks mediated by the terms of trade alone
explain on average only 10 percent of variations in output and other indicators of aggregate
activity in poor and emerging countries (Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2015). These authors
argue that the terms of trade may be a poor mediator of world shocks because being a single
summary measure of world prices they may fail to capture the role of individual prices in
transmitting global disturbances. Indeed in model economies with multiple goods, a single
world price is in general insufficient to capture the transmission mechanism of world shocks
to the domestic economy.
    This paper presents an empirical model in which multiple world prices mediate the effects
of global shocks on domestic business cycles. Specifically, it estimates the joint contribution
of agricultural, metal, and fuel commodity prices and the world interest rate to aggregate
fluctuations in a panel of 138 countries over the period 1960 to 2015. The empirical model
consists of a foreign bloc and a domestic bloc. The foreign bloc is common to all countries
and includes the three commodity prices and the world interest rate. The domestic bloc is
country specific and includes four domestic macroeconomic indicators, output, consumption,
investment, and the trade balance, and the four world prices featured in the foreign bloc.
    We find that world shocks account for about one third of movements in aggregate activity
in the median country. This number is three times as large as those obtained in single world
price specifications. An additional contribution of the present paper is to correct for a small-
sample bias in the variance decomposition. We find that the small sample bias is large,
about twelve percentage points of the share of the variance of domestic macroeconomic
indicators explained by world shocks. Thus the uncorrected measure of the contribution of
world shocks, which is the appropriate statistic for comparison with the existing literature,
is 45 percent.
    A natural question is whether for each individual country a single commodity price trans-
mits the majority of the effects of world shocks. For example, is the price of metals the
primary transmitter of world shocks to Chile, or the price of fuel the primary transmitter
of world shocks to Norway? We find that this is not the case. For the typical country one
commodity price is important for transmitting world shocks to one macroeconomic indicator
but not to other indicators. For example, for a given country metal prices can be impor-


                                               1
tant for transmitting world shocks to domestic output whereas agricultural prices might be
important for transmitting world shocks to domestic consumption. An implication of this
finding is that a multiple price specification is needed to capture the transmission of world
shocks even if the exports or imports of a country are highly concentrated in a particular
commodity.
   The period elapsed since the turn of the century has been special as far as world shocks
are concerned for two reasons. First, the period witnessed the greatest global contraction
since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Second, world commodity markets have experienced
enormous financial innovation, a phenomenon that has come to be known as financialization.
With this motivation in mind, we ask whether during this period world shocks were partic-
ularly important in driving domestic business cycles, and if so, how much of the difference
is due to the financialization of commodity markets. To this end, we begin by estimating
the model post 2000. We find that during this period world shocks explain on average 79
percent of the variance of output. This is 46 percentage points more than in the 1960 to
2015 sample. This finding is consistent with Fernández, González, and Rodrı́guez (2015),
who estimate that a country-specific commodity price measure explains about 50 percent of
aggregate fluctuations in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Peru over the period 2000 to 2014.
It is also consistent with the findings of Shousha (2015), who documents that in a group
of advanced and emerging commodity exporters world price shocks played a major role in
driving short-run fluctuations since the mid 1990s.
    To investigate how much of the increased importance of world shocks may be accounted
for by the financialization of commodity markets, we conduct a counterfactual exercise in
which the stochastic process for world prices (the foreign bloc) is fit to the post 2000 period
but the domestic bloc of the empirical model is fit over the whole sample. We find that only
ten percentage points of the estimated 45 percentage points increase in the importance of
global shocks since the 2000s is due to a change in the stochastic process of world prices. We
interpret this result as suggesting that financialization has not played a major role in the
observed increased importance of world disturbances in domestic business cycles post 2000.
   The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data set.
Section 3 presents summary statistics of the commodity price data. Sections 4 and 5
introduce the foreign and domestic blocs of the empirical model, respectively. Section 6
describes the small-sample bias correction procedure. Section 7 shows estimation results for
the case in which world shocks are mediated by commodity prices, and section 8 for the case
in which they are mediated in addition by world interest rate shocks. Section 9 considers
the case in which world output enters the foreign bloc either by itself or in conjunction
with world commodity prices. Section 10 compares the results of the baseline estimation to


                                              2
the case in which the foreign bloc consists of a single world price. Section 11 analyzes the
robustness of the main findings. Section 12 investigates the financialization hypothesis and
section 13 concludes. An online appendix presents some additional robustness results.


2     The Data
We use a panel of three world commodity-prices and five country-specific macroeconomic
indicators. The sample is annual and covers the period 1960-2014 for 138 countries.
    Data on commodity prices come from the World Bank’s Pink Sheet. This is a publicly
available dataset that contains monthly series on dollar-denominated nominal commodity
price indices (see http://www.worldbank.org/en/research/commodity-markets). We focus
on three aggregate commodity price indices: Fuel, Agriculture, and Metals and Minerals.
The fuel index is a weighted average of spot prices of coal, crude oil and natural gas. The
agricultural index is a weighted average of prices of beverages (cocoa, coffee and tea), food
(fats and oils, grains, and other foods), and agricultural raw materials (timber and other raw
materials). The price index of metals and minerals is based on the spot prices of aluminum,
copper, iron ore, lead, nickel, steel, tin, and zinc. We interpret all other goods as a composite,
whose price is proxied by the U.S. consumer price index. We use this composite good as
the numeraire. Accordingly, we deflate the three commodity-price indices by the monthly
U.S. Consumer Price Index. To obtain annual time series, we take simple averages over the
twelve months of the year.
    The five country-specific series are real GDP (denoted Y ), real consumption (denoted
C), real investment (denoted I), the trade balance-to-output ratio (denoted T BY ), and the
terms of trade (denoted T OT ). The terms of trade are the ratio of trade-weighted export
and import unit-value indices. We use the terms of trade to compare multiple-world-price
models with single-world-price models. The series Y , C, and I are in constant local currency
units. The sources for Y , C, I, T BY , and T OT are the World Bank’s World Development
Indicators (WDI) database and the IMF’s World Economic Outlook (WEO) database. We
do not mix WDI and WEO data at the country level. Instead, for each country, we use
data from the data set that contains the longest balanced panel for the five country-specific
indicators. If the range happens to be identical in the two, we use WDI as the default. The
WDI database is publicly available on the web at http://data.worldbank.org. The WEO
database is also publicly available but not for all time series. To complete the WEO data
we use an appendix of the WEO that the IMF shares with other multilateral organizations.
We discard countries for which no balanced panel can be formed of a minimum of 25 annual
observations. This delivers a sample of 138 countries. The mean country sample spans 38

                                                3
years from 1977 to 2014. The longest sample contains 55 years from 1960 to 2014 and occurs
in 5 countries. The shortest sample contains 25 years and occurs in 7 countries.
    The data used in this paper is available online with the rest of the replication materials.
Table 1 in the online appendix provides country-by-country information about data ranges
and sources.


3    Commodity Prices: Some Empirical Regularities
The left panel of figure 1 displays the level of the real price of three groups of commodities,
agricultural, fuels, and metals. All prices are deflated using the U.S. CPI index, and nor-
malized to 1960=1. The three commodity price indices share some common characteristics.
In the early 1970s agricultural and fuel prices increased dramatically, with fuel prices rising
eightfold. Metal prices, however, remained more or less stable. In the 1980s and 1990s, the
prices of all three commodities were in a gradual decline. Both agricultural and fuel prices
fell by a factor of 4 and metals by a factor of about 3. Then, in the early 2000s all three
prices recovered vigorously until the Great Contraction of 2008, which was accompanied by
widespread declines in commodity prices.
   The right panel of figure 1 displays the cyclical component of the natural logarithm of
commodity prices as captured by the HP filter with a smoothing parameter of 100. Two
characteristics stand out. First, the cyclical components of real commodity prices are highly
volatile, especially those of fuels, with deviations from trend of up to 50 percent. Second, the
cyclical components display positive comovement. These features are confirmed in table 1,
which shows second moments of the detrended commodity prices. The standard deviation
of prices ranges from 12 to 21 percent making commodity prices between 3 and 5 times as
volatile as output in the average country in our sample of 138 countries. Positive comovement
between the three price indices is reflected in high and positive contemporaneous correlations
of 0.35 to 0.59. Finally, cyclical movements in commodity prices are moderately persistent,
with a serial correlation of about 0.5.


4    The Foreign Bloc
We assume that world commodity prices are exogenous to each individual country. We
therefore formulate a VAR specification for the joint evolution of agricultural, fuel, and metal
commodity prices that is independent of domestic macroeconomic indicators in individual

first-order autoregressive system:
                                        pt = Apt−1 + µt ,                                       (1)

where A denotes a matrix of coefficients and µt is an i.i.d. mean-zero random vector with
variance-covariance matrix Σµ .
   We interpret the vector µt as representing a combination of world shocks affecting com-
modity prices. The present investigation is not concerned with the identification of spe-
cific world shocks (such as, for example, shocks to the world supply or demand of oil, or
shocks to world total factor productivity). Instead, our focus is to ascertain what fraction of
business-cycle fluctuations in individual countries is due to world shocks and is mediated by
fluctuations in the three world commodity prices included in the vector pt . That is, we are
interested in estimating the joint contribution of µt to domestic business cycles in individual

countries. For this purpose, no further identification assumptions on the above system are
required. In particular, the order in which the three commodity prices appear in the vector
pt is immaterial. Any other ordering would deliver identical contributions of world shocks
to domestic business cycles.

5         The Domestic Bloc
Let Yti denote a vector of domestic macroeconomic indicators in country i. We assume that
Yti evolves according to the expression

                                     Yti = B i pt−1 + C i Yt−1
                                                            i
                                                               + Di pt + it,                (2)

where it is an innovation with mean 0 and variance-covariance matrix Σi . Note that because
pt appears contemporaneously on the right-hand side of this expression, the innovation it is
independent of the innovation µt . We interpret it as a vector of country-specific shocks. This
interpretation is based on the fact that the typical country in our sample of 138 countries
is a small economy. As such, world shocks can affect the small open economy only through
changes in world prices, such as changes in commodity prices or changes in the world interest
rate. For now, we leave the world interest rate out of the system, but will consider it in
section 8 below.
   We estimate the domestic bloc, equation (2), by OLS for each of the 138 countries in
the sample. We consider four domestic macroeconomic indicators, output, consumption,
investment, and the trade-balance-to-output ratio. All variables are detrended using the

HP filter with a smoothing parameter of 100. Output, consumption and investment are
expressed in natural logarithms before detrending. We denote by yti, cit , iit , and tbyti the
cyclical components of output, consumption, investment, and the trade-balance-to-output
ratio in country i as defined above.
    Combining equations (1) and (2) and dropping for expositional purposes the superscript
i, we obtain the following autoregressive representation for the joint behavior of pt and Yt

Given country-specific estimates of B, C, D, and Σ , one can use this representation to obtain
an estimate of the contribution of world shocks (µt ) to movements in domestic macroeco-
nomic indicators (Yt ) in a specific country by performing a variance decomposition.
   Given the heterogeneity in the lengths of the balanced samples, not all country specific
regressions display the same number of degrees of freedom. Specifically, when all four domes-
tic macroeconomic indicators (yt , ct , it, and tbyt) are included in the vector Yt , each equation
of the domestic bloc contains 11 regressors, namely, 3 contemporaneous commodity prices,
3 lagged commodity prices, 4 lagged domestic indicators, and a constant (not shown in the
derivations above). Since the number of observations for the domestic bloc ranges from 25 to
55 across the 138 countries, we have that for some countries including 11 regressors results
in a relatively small number of degrees of freedom.
    For this reason, we estimate the domestic bloc in two ways. One is to include all four
indicators in the vector Yt , which imposes the maximum strain on the degrees of freedom.
The other is to include in Yt only one domestic indicator at the time and estimate the
domestic bloc four times per country, once for each indicator. We refer to the first approach
as joint estimation and to the second as sequential estimation.


6     Small-Sample Bias Correction
A second issue that must be taken into account in the estimation of the SVAR system (3) is
the possibility of a small-sample upward bias in the estimation of the contribution of world
shocks to the variance of domestic macroeconomic indicators. The fact that the variance is by


                                                            8
definition a positive statistic means that any correlation between the vector of commodity
prices pt and the vector of macroeconomic indicators Yt results in some participation of
world shocks in the variance of Yt . In particular, even if pt and Yt were independent random
variables, any spurious correlation (positive or negative) in finite sample would result in a
positive share of world shocks in the variance of Yt , creating an upward bias that exaggerates
the importance of world shocks mediated by commodity prices.
   In addition, as is well known, OLS estimates of SVAR coefficients are typically biased
in short sample, which can cause a bias in the estimated contribution of world shocks to
domestic business cycles. This bias can be increasing in the number of commodities entering
pt and decreasing in the sample size. Correcting this source of bias is therefore particularly
important when one compares one-price SVAR specifications (e.g., specifications including
only one world price), which we study in a later section, with multiple-price specifications,
like the one studied thus far.
   We apply a Monte Carlo procedure to correct for the aforementioned small-sample biases.
The procedure consists of the following steps:

  1. For a given country, let F̂ , Ĝ, and Σ̂ denote the estimates of F , G, and Σ obtained
     using actual data. Let σ̂ denote the associated estimate of the share of the variance of
     Yt explained by µt . Use F̂ , Ĝ, and Σ̂ to generate artificial time series for Yt and pt of
     a desired length from the SVAR model given in equation (3). We use 250 years.

  2. Let T p denote the sample size of commodity prices. We set T p = 55, which is the
     sample size of commodity prices in our data set. Let T y denote the sample size of Yt .
     We set T y equal to the number of observations of Yt in our dataset for the particular
     country considered. Then use the last T p observations of the artificial time series to
     reestimate the foreign bloc of the SVAR (i.e., the matrices A and Σµ ). Use the last
     T y observations of the artificial time series to reestimate the domestic bloc (i.e., the
     matrices B, C, D, and Σ ).

  3. Steps 1 and 2 yield an estimate of the matrices F , G, and Σ from the simulated data.
     Use this estimate to compute the share of the variance of Yt explained by µt shocks,
     which is denoted by σ.

  4. Repeat steps 1-3 N times. We set N = 1, 000. Then compute averages of the resulting
     estimate of σ and denote it by σ̄.

  5. Define the small-sample bias as σ̄ − σ̂. The corrected estimate of the share of the
     variance of Yt explained by µt is then given by 2σ̂ − σ̄.

7     World Shocks Mediated By Commodity Prices
In this section we perform variance decompositions country by country using the estimated
SVAR system, equation (3), to assess the importance of world shocks as a driver of domestic
business cycles. We present results for the sequential and joint estimation approach and
variance decompositions with and without the small-sample bias correction.
   Table 2 contains the main results. It displays cross-country median shares of the vari-
ances of output, consumption, investment, and the trade-balance-to-output ratio explained
by world shocks mediated by commodity prices. Both the sequential and joint estimation ap-
proaches deliver the same message. Before correcting for small-sample bias, across countries
on average world shocks are estimated to explain 44 percent of business cycle fluctuations
in domestic output. For all four domestic indicators the small-sample bias in the variance


                                                  10
decomposition is on average about 12 percentage points. After correcting for the small-
sample bias, we find that world shocks explain about 34 percent of variance of output, 21
percent of the variances of consumption and investment, and 15 percent of the variance of
the trade-balance-to-output ratio.
   The estimated contribution of world shocks, however, is far from homogeneous across
countries. Table 2 shows that the cross-country median absolute deviation of the share of
the variance of output explained by world shocks is 20 percentage points. This means that
across countries most of the estimated variance shares lie in an interval ranging from 14 to
54 percent. This interval includes the high and low values found in the related literature
cited in the introduction.


8    World Shocks Mediated By The World Interest Rate
     and Commodity Prices
The world interest rate represents another channel through which world shocks are transmit-
ted to open economies. Unlike real commodity prices, which represent the relative price of
goods dated in the same period, the real interest rate is the relative price of goods dated in
different periods. World shocks that change the global availability of goods across time will
cause movements in the world real interest rate. In turn, movements in the world interest
rate affect incentives to consume, save, and work at the individual-country level. This argu-
ment motivates adding the real interest rate to the set of world prices that mediate world
shocks to individual countries.
   Accordingly, we expand the foreign bloc of the SVAR system, equation (1), by including
the world interest rate in the vector of world prices. Formally, we now let
                                                      

where rt denotes the real world interest rate in period t. The domestic bloc of the SVAR is
unchanged.
  We proxy rt by the real three-month U.S. Treasury bill rate. Specifically, we compute
monthly real interest rates by subtracting from the annualized Treasury bill rate the U.S.
CPI inflation rate over the previous twelve months. We then compute the annual real interest
rate as the arithmetic average of the monthly rates for each year. The sample period for this


                                             11
variable is the same as that of world commodity prices, namely, 1960 to 2014. We extract the
cyclical component of the world real interest rate by applying the HP filter with parameter
100 to the logarithm of the gross world real interest rate. Table 1 shows that the world
interest rate is mildly persistent (serial correlation of 0.36), uncorrelated with agricultural
prices (-0.01), mildly positively correlated with metal prices (0.16), and negatively correlated
with fuel prices (-0.24).

The interest rate adds little explanatory power to the commodity price sub-bloc, as indicated
by the insignificant increase in the R2 statistics associated with the first three equations after
adding rt as a regressor. Furthermore, much of the variation in the real interest rate is driven
by contemporaneous disturbances, with the autoregressive part explaining only 24 percent
of the variance of the interest rate (the R2 of the fourth equation).
    Table 3 presents the shares of the variances of domestic macroeconomic indicators ex-
plained by world shocks mediated by the world interest rate and commodity prices. Including
the interest rate as an additional transmission channel increases the share of world shocks
in the variance of domestic variables by about 10 percentage points. This finding holds for
both the sequential and joint estimation. Thus, overall world shocks explain more than 40
percent of the variance of output and more than 30 percent of the variances of consumption,
investment, and the trade-balance-to-output ratio.


9         World Shocks Transmitted Via World Output
In some specifications of theoretical open economy models, it is assumed that the country
faces a world demand for a domestically produced tradable good. The foreign demand
function is typically ad-hoc and incorporates as arguments the relative price of the good and
global output. This assumption presupposes that the country has some market power in the
production of the tradable good in question. In most cases, a foreign demand function of
this type is introduced to facilitate the modeling of price stickiness in tradable goods. Under

this specification, world shocks can affect the domestic economy directly through variations
in global output. Here, we entertain this possibility by adding global output to the baseline
specification of the foreign bloc of the SVAR model. That is, we now consider a four variable
foreign bloc that includes the three commodity prices (agriculture, fuel, and metal) and
global output.
   We construct global GDP as the sum of GDP in current U.S. dollars of the 29 largest
economies in the panel deflated by the U.S. consumer price index. We then estimate the
domestic block sequentially for each of the remaining 109 countries in the panel and correct
for small sample bias.
    The results of adding global output are shown in table 4. As in the case of the world
interest rate, adding one more global variable to the foreign bloc increases the share of
variances of domestic macro indicators explained by world shocks by about 10 percentage
points (panels A, B, and C). Notably, the inclusion of global output does not alter the effect
of global shocks on the domestic economy mediated by world commodity prices. This follows
from the fact that adding global output to the baseline specification increases the variance
explained by world shocks by the same amount as the fraction of variance explained by world
shocks in a specification of the foreign bloc that includes only global output (compare panels
C and D).

10      One-World-Price Specifications
Often, open economy models, empirical or theoretical, include just one world price, typically
the terms of trade. In a recent study, Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2015) emphasize that
SVAR models that include only the terms of trade in the foreign bloc predict that the terms
of trade have a limited ability to transmit world shocks and recommend the use of more
disaggregated world price measures. In this section, we extend this result by considering a
host of single-price measures of world prices and ask whether empirically the inclusion of
only one world price suffices to transmit the bulk of the effects of world shocks to domestic
economies. Our findings suggest that the answer to this question is no. Thus, the result that
a single world price measure is insufficient to transmit world shocks holds not only when the
single price is taken to be the terms of trade but also for a variety of other single world price
measures.
  The results presented in this section are based on a sequential estimation of the domestic
bloc and are corrected for small-sample bias. We begin by including, one at a time, each
of the four world prices that appear in the foreign bloc estimated in section 8, namely,
agricultural, metal, and fuel commodity prices, and the world interest rate. Lines 2 to 5
of table 5 show that when only one world price is included in the SVAR, world shocks are
estimated to explain on average across countries less than 10 percent of the variances of


                                                15
output, consumption, investment, and the trade-balance-to-output ratio.
    It might come as a surprise that fuel prices, which are often regarded as a major source
of aggregate fluctuations, transmit only 9 percent of the effects of world shocks on domestic
activity. This finding, however, is consistent with other SVAR-based studies that have
analyzed the importance of, for instance, oil price shocks. For example, Blanchard and Galı́
(2010) report using U.S. data over the periods 1960 to 1983 and 1984 to 2007 that the ratio of
the standard deviation of output conditional on oil price shocks relative to its unconditional
counterpart is 0.33 on average, which implies a variance share of around 10 percent.
   The finding that single-world-price specifications are inadequate to capture the trans-
mission of world shocks to the domestic economy is intuitive, for it is not reasonable to
expect that the same world price will be equally effective in transmitting world shocks to all
economies. For instance, an economy in which metals do not play an important role either
in production or in absorption is unlikely to be affected by world shocks that are mostly
mediated through metal prices.
    One might therefore think that a more reasonable specification of a one-world-price em-
pirical model would be one that picks for each country the single world price that transmits
world shocks explaining the largest fraction of output fluctuations at business-cycle fre-
quency. Line 6 of table 5 shows that when the best transmitter of world shocks is picked
for each country, the estimated share of the variance of output explained by world shocks is
27 percent, still lower than but much closer to 44 percent, the fraction transmitted jointly
by all four world prices (see Line 1, reproduced from table 3). However, the best trans-
mitter of world shocks to output is not the best transmitter of world shocks to the other
macroeconomic indicators. The fraction of the variances of consumption, investment, and
the trade-balance-to-output ratio explained by the world shocks transmitted by the best
transmitter to output is still below 10 percent on average across countries (line 6). This
means that not all world prices affect all macroeconomic indicators in the same way. This is
reasonable. For instance, in an economy that produces fuels and imports agricultural goods,
the world shocks that affect mostly oil prices are likely to have a larger effect on output
than on consumption. This result suggests that a multiple world-price SVAR specification
conveys much more information than models that include only one world price.
   The result that one-world-price specifications do not capture well the transmission mech-
anism of world shocks to individual economies extends to one-world-price measures that are
combinations of multiple world prices. Lines 7, 8, and 9 of table 5 show that the estimated
share of the variances of all four macroeconomic indicators considered (output, consump-
tion, investment, and the trade-balance-to-output ratio) is below 10 percent when the single
world-price measure takes the form of the first principal component of the four world prices


                                             16
considered (pa , pf , pm , and r), the terms of trade, or a commodity terms of trade measure.
The terms of trade and the commodity terms of trade are country-specific relative price
indicators. The terms of trade is the ratio of trade weighted export to import price indices.
The commodity terms of trade is the ratio of commodity export prices to commodity import
prices. In turn, commodity export prices are defined as a trade weighted average of the three
commodity prices considered in this paper (agricultural, metal, and fuel) with the weights
given by the respective country specific commodity export shares. A similar definition ap-
plies to commodity import prices. The result that terms of trade mediate a small fraction of
world shocks is in line with that emphasized by Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2015), who find
that terms of trade shocks explain about 10 percent of the variances of output, consumption,
investment, and the trade balance across 38 poor and emerging countries. Here, we extend
this result to 138 countries, including rich, emerging, and poor.


11     Robustness
In this section, we extend the analysis to control for a number of factors that may affect the
importance of world prices as transmitters of world disturbances. In particular, we control for
the level of development, country size, whether the country is a large commodity exporter,
whether the country is an oil exporter, whether the country is a commodity exporter or
importer, geographic location, and detrending method. All of the extensions are based on
the baseline SVAR specification that includes three world prices, namely, agricultural, fuel,
and metal commodity prices. The estimation of the domestic bloc is performed sequentially,
and variance decompositions are corrected for small sample bias.


11.1     Level of Development
A priori it is not clear how the level of development should affect the importance of world
shocks as drivers of domestic business cycles. On the one hand, one may expect that de-
veloped countries, by having more service oriented economies, and hence a larger share of
nontradables, are less exposed to world shocks. On the other hand, developed countries, es-
pecially small ones, tend to be more integrated to the rest of the world, which would suggest
a larger exposure to world shocks.
    To gauge the role of world shocks as a source of business cycles at different levels of
economic development, panel A of Table 6 displays results for four income levels: low (22
countries), lower middle (33 countries), upper middle (31 countries), and high (52 coun-
tries). The categorization is taken from the WDI and is based on per capita gross national


                                              17
incomes observed in 2015.3 The results are fairly robust across income groups. There are
no clear differences in the share of output variance explained by world shocks across income
groups and no single group is radically different from the baseline median results, which are
reproduced for convenience in the top line of table 6. In particular, there is no systematic
relation between income levels and the share of the variances of output or the trade bal-
ance explained by world shocks. For consumption and investment, there is some positive
relationship between the level of development and the share of variance accounted for by
world shocks. The strongest relationship is for investment. The share of the variance of this
variable explained by world shocks increases from 14 percent in low income countries to 30
percent in high income countries.


11.2        Country Size
The identifying assumption in the baseline SVAR specification is that world prices are ex-
ogenous to the domestic economy. This assumption is reasonable for most countries, but
may be problematic for some. One example is large economies. In these countries, domestic
shocks may affect world prices. For this reason, it is of interest to examine the predictions of
the model after controlling for country size. To this end, we divide the 138 countries in the
panel into quintiles according to their GDP in 2013 measured in U.S. dollars. This yields
five groups of about 27 countries each.4 The results are displayed in panel B of table 6.
    The results are fairly robust across groups other than the top quintile. For these four
groups, the shares of variance of output, consumption, investment, and the trade balance
explained by world shocks are close to the unconditional medians reported at the top of the
table. However, as conjectured above, we find a sizable difference for the group of largest
economies. Within this group, world shocks are found to be more important than for the
median country in the panel of 138 countries. For the median largest country world shocks
explain 42 percent of the variance of output and investment, 29 percent of the variance of
consumption, and 26 percent of the variance of the trade-balance-to-output ratio. Thus
the contribution of world shocks to the variance of domestic variables increases by about 10
percentage points in the group of largest countries relative to the unconditional contribution.
As stressed above, however, this result should not be interpreted as indicating that world
shocks are more important for large economies, because the exogeneity assumption upon
which the SVAR model relies does not apply for countries that can affect world prices.
   In the online appendix, we also consider a demographic definition of country size. Again,
we divide countries into quintiles. As in the output-based definition of size, the contribution

of world shocks is not sensitive to country size, except at the top quintile.


11.3       Excluding Large Commodity Exporters
Another often suggested way to address the possibility of market power, which would violate
our identification assumption of exogeneity of commodity prices at the country level, is to
exclude large commodity exporters. To this end, for each of the three commodity groups we
identify the top 20 percent largest exporters. We then exclude the union of these countries
from the panel. This criterion yields 39 large commodity exporters, and therefore 99 countries
used in the SVAR estimation. Panel C of table 6 shows that excluding large commodity
exporters does not affect the share of the variances of domestic macroeconomic indicators
explained by world shocks and mediated by commodity prices.
   Taken together, the result of the present robustness test and those performed in the
previous subsection suggest that market power in commodities might stem more from country
size (as measured by total output or population size) than from the size of commodity
exports. This makes economic sense, since market power should be related to a country’s
share in worldwide production or absorption of a certain commodity rather than to its share
in worldwide exports thereof.


11.4       Oil Exporters and Oil Importers
In panel D of table 6 we consider categorizing countries according to their net trade in fuel oil.
We do so by computing the country-specific median of net exports of fuels since 1960, using
annual information on exports and imports of fuel commodities from WDI. We categorize a
country as an oil exporter (importer) if the median net fuel export share in GDP is positive
(negative). According to this criterion we identify 27 oil exporters and 107 importers.5
      Results do not differ much between net oil exporters and importers. For the trade balance
share, however, the share of its variance explained by world shocks is almost twice as large
for oil exporters than it is for oil importers.


11.5       Net Commodity Trader
World shocks appear to be more important for explaining business cycles in countries that are
net commodity importers than in countries that are net commodity exporters (see panel E of
table 6). We define a country as a commodity exporter if it has a positive trade balance in the
  5
   We drop Angola, Haiti, Myanmar, and Taiwan due to lack of information on the trade shares on com-
modities.

group of three commodities considered (agricultural, fuel, and metals) on average since 1960.
This classification yields 51 net commodity exporters and 83 net commodity importers.6 On
average the contribution of world shocks to the variances of output and investment is 10
percentage points higher for net commodity importers than for net commodity exporters.
No significant differences are observed for consumption and the trade balance. This result
might be linked to the fact that investment goods contain a larger share of traded goods
than consumption goods.


11.6      Other Robustness Checks: Geographic Location and Quadratic
          Detrending
Table 6 presents two additional robustness checks. Panel F classifies countries by geographic
region. The results do not vary much across the different quarters of the world, although
world shocks appear to be somewhat more important in explaining output movements in
Latin America and South Asia. Panel G shows that using a quadratic time trend or the
HP(6.25)filter instead of the HP(100) filter to detrend the data does not result in significant
differences, except for the variance of output for which the contribution of world shocks falls
by 10 percentage points.


12        Financialization
Some researchers have pointed to the fact that, since the early 2000s, commodity futures
have become a popular asset class for portfolio investors, just like stocks and bonds. This
process is sometimes referred to as “financialization” of commodity markets (see Cheng and
Xiong, 2014 and the references cited therein). A distinctive characteristic of this process is a
large inflow of investment capital to commodity futures markets, generating a debate about
whether this distorts commodity prices. We now explore the extent to which financialization
of commodity markets has impacted the importance of world shocks for domestic business
cycles.


12.1      The Importance of World Shocks In Quarterly Data
The analysis of financialization relies heavily on a comparison of data before and after 2004,
which makes the use of annual data ill suited, as it would imply estimating the SVAR

quarterly data. This comes at a cost. On the bright side, quarterly data on commodity
prices and interest rates is readily available since 1960. However, quarterly data typically
covers a much shorter sample period especially for macroeconomic aggregates other than
output. For this reason, we limit attention to SVAR specifications that include output as
the sole domestic variable. For a country to be included in our panel, we require at least 100
consecutive quarterly observations. This criterion yields a panel of 38 countries.7
   Before plunging into the issue of financialization, we examine the robustness of our results
to the use of quarterly data. The foreign bloc of the SVAR system includes four world
prices, namely, the three world commodity prices (agriculture, fuels, and metals) and the
world interest rate. The domestic bloc consists of output. The data are detrended using the
HP(1600) filter. Table 7 shows that when estimated on quarterly data the contribution of
world shocks to the variance of output is 33 percent. This estimate is sizable and comparable
to but lower than its annual counterpart. The annual estimate using the same 38 countries
as in the quarterly panel yields an output variance share of world shocks of 42 percent (which
in turn is similar to the value obtained using all 138 countries in the annual panel).


12.2        Commodity Prices Pre- and Post-Financialization
Existing accounts date commodity financialization around 2004. As a first diagnostic, we
examine the comovement and volatility of the cyclical component of commodity prices be-
fore and after 2004. The results are shown in table 8. Commodity prices display higher
comovement since 2004, especially for commodity price pairs that include fuels prices. The

correlation of fuels with both agricultural and metal prices doubles after 2004. Standard
deviations increase after 2004 but the change is not as pronounced as that observed for cor-
relations. In particular, the standard deviations of agricultural and fuel prices change little,
while that of metal prices increases by 50 percent.
   We interpret these results as lending some support to the hypothesis of financialization.
The central question for the purpose of the present investigation is whether financialization
changed the importance of world shocks in explaining domestic business cycles. We turn to
this issue next.


12.3     Financialization or Change In The Domestic Transmission
         Mechanism?
In the context of the SVAR model studied in this paper, we interpret financialization as a
change after 2004 in the stochastic process defining the foreign bloc. Specifically, we take
financialization to mean that the matrices A and Σµ in equation (1) changed after 2004. We
gauge how the importance of world shocks in driving domestic business cycles changed with
financialization by estimating the variance of domestic output explained by world shocks
using estimates of the foreign bloc on post 2004 data, while keeping the estimates of the
domestic bloc, defined by the matrices B, C, D, and Σ in equation (2), on data over the
whole sample, which includes the pre- and post-financialization periods. The results of this
analysis is presented in table 9. Comparing the first two rows of this table shows that
financialization led to a modest increase in the importance of world shocks for domestic

business cycles. The cross-country median of the share of the variance of output explained
by world shocks increases from 33 percent to 42 percent in the financialization period.
   We also explore the possibility that in recent years the domestic bloc changed either
because of a change in the domestic transmission mechanism (matrices B, C, and D) or
because of the amplitude and correlation of domestic disturbances (the matrix Σ ). To
evaluate this alternative hypothesis, we estimate both the foreign and the domestic blocs on
the post 2003 sample. The results, shown in line 3 of table 9 are striking. World shocks
explain on average 79 percent of the variance of domestic output in the post 2003 period.
This represents 46 percentage points more than in the baseline case (line 1). We conclude
that world shocks appear to play a major role in recent years. However, this preponderance
is not due to the phenomenon of financialization of commodity markets, but to a change
in the domestic transition mechanism or in the relative importance of domestic sources of
uncertainty or in both.
   In closing, a cautionary word is in order. Before concluding that 2004 represents a
structural break, as suggested by the dramatic increase in the importance of world shocks
for domestic business cycles after 2003, it is important to keep in mind that this result is
derived using a short sample, spanning just twelve years. As a result, the conclusions drawn
from the present analysis should be interpreted as preliminary pending more incoming data.


13     Conclusion
The starting point of this investigation are two observations. First, in theoretical models
of small open economies transmission of world shocks must be mediated via variations in
world prices, which can be intratemporal relative prices of different types of traded goods
or intertemporal prices, such as interest rates. Second, world prices are independent of
domestic conditions in the small open economy. These two observations motivate the use of


                                             24
an empirical model composed of a foreign bloc and a domestic bloc. The foreign bloc includes
only world prices whereas the domestic bloc includes domestic macroeconomic indicators and
world prices.
   We construct an annual panel of 138 poor, emerging, and rich countries spanning the
period 1960 to 2015. The panel includes observations on three world commodity prices
(agricultural, fuels, and metals), a proxy for the world interest rate and four country specific
macroeconomic indicators (output, consumption, investment, and the trade balance).
   The main finding reported in this paper is that global shocks explain a sizable fraction of
business cycles. On average across countries more than one third of the variances of output,
consumption, investment, and the trade balance are accounted for by world disturbances.
This result is robust to using quarterly data.
   When the model is estimated using post 2000 data, the importance of world shocks in
accounting for domestic business cycles doubles. We consider two alternative hypotheses
as potential explanations of this significant increase. One is that the financialization of
commodity markets, which took hold in the early 2000s, changed the joint stochastic process
of world commodity prices. The second hypothesis is that post 2000 there was a change in
the domestic transmission mechanism. We find that the second hypothesis is more consistent
with the data.
