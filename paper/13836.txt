                                              ABSTRACT

The U.S. Constitution removed real and monetary trade barriers between the states. By contrast, these
states when they were British colonies exercised considerable real and monetary autonomy over their
borders. Purchasing power parity is used to measure how much economic integration between the
states was gained in the decades after the Constitution’s adoption compared with what existed among
the same locations during the late colonial period. The U.S. Constitution’s net contribution to the economic
integration of the nation is found, using this method, to be not as large as is commonly supposed.

  Testing for the Economic Impact of the U.S. Constitution:
    Purchasing Power Parity across the Colonies versus
                 Across the States, 1748-1811
       The U.S. Constitution removed real and monetary trade barriers between the states. By
       contrast, these states when they were British colonies exercised considerable real and
       monetary autonomy over their borders. Purchasing power parity is used to measure how
       much economic integration between the states was gained in the decades after the
       Constitution’s adoption compared with what existed among the same locations during the
       late colonial period. The U.S. Constitution’s net contribution to the economic integration
       of the nation is found, using this method, to be not as large as is commonly supposed.

       No idea is more firmly planted in American history than the idea that one of the most
       difficult problems during the Confederation was that of barriers to trade between state
       and state. There had been such barriers in colonial times…
                                            Merrill Jensen, New Nation, p. 337

       The ‘secret’ of American economic growth, English legal scholar Sir Henry Maine wrote
       in 1886, lay in ‘the [constitutional] prohibition against levying duties on commodities
       passing from State to State…. It secures to the producer the command of a free market
       over an enormous territory of vast natural wealth…’
                                              Charles W. McCurdy, “American Law,” p. 631

       In 1787, three years after the Treaty of Paris ended the Revolution, the founding fathers

crafted a new constitution. This U.S. Constitution, ratified by the states and then adopted by

Congress in 1789, united the states into one country both politically and economically to a

greater extent than what had existed under the preceding Articles of Confederation or under

British rule prior to 1776. It required state governments to relinquish their sovereign power to

place revenue duties on commerce with other states and foreign nations, as well as relinquish

their sovereign power to emit fiat paper monies and determine what could be legal tender within

their jurisdictions. The Constitution also required national tariffs on imports from outside the

U.S. to be uniform across the states and prohibited export tariffs (Article 1, Sections 8, 9, and

10). In short, it swept away trade barriers, both real and monetary, between the states and did so

with constitutional force and certainty. It made the United States a common market.
                                                                                                       2

       Today we enjoy the fruits of integrated national markets and look back to the

Constitution as the watershed institutional change that created those markets.1 But did it really?

How much extra economic integration was gained by adopting the Constitution—a lot, a little, or

next to nothing? Did it represent a discrete break in the economic integration of the nation? To

answer such questions, the economic integration among the states soon after the adoption of the

Constitution should be measured against the economic integration that would have occurred

under the next best institutional alternative to the Constitution regarding interstate trade rules.2

                        FINDING A BENCHMARK FOR COMPARISON

       If the U.S. had not adopted the Constitution exactly as written, what would have been the

alternative? Some Federalist rhetoric of the day and some current scholars presume that it would

have been chaos and Armageddon or at best, the Articles of Confederation which by some

accounts was the same thing as chaos and Armageddon. But is that the next best viable or likely

alternative? It is abundantly clear in the writings of the day that something was going to be

changed in the 1780s; either the Articles of Confederation would be amended or some new

constitution adopted. One significant impediment to the ratification of the Constitution was the

degree by which it restricted state economic sovereignty.3 Thus, if the founding fathers had

offered a constitution in 1787 in all other respects exactly like the one actually written but with

fewer restrictions on state economic sovereignty, it would have likely been ratified as well.

Because such was considered at the Constitutional Convention in the summer of 1787, the prior

drafts that offered different interstate trade rules can serve as an approximate identifier of a likely

alternative constitution with respect to such rules and their effect on economic integration.4

       Regarding interstate trade rules, how did these early drafts differ from that eventually

adopted? The first complete working draft of a constitution incorporating the Convention’s
                                                                                                        3

deliberations from May 25th (the start of the Convention) through July 26th was presented to the

Convention by the Committee of Detail on August 6th. It stated, “No State, without the consent

of the Legislature of the United States, shall…lay imposts or duties on imports…” No other

restrictions on state trade powers were stated. In other words, states could impose revenue-

generating export duties and other non-tariff regulations at will and, as long as Congress did not

disallow them, they could also impose revenue-generating import duties.5 Only near the end of

the Convention on August 28th was the Constitution amended to restrict states from imposing

export duties without congressional consent and, more importantly, amended to absolutely stop

states from keeping any revenue from state duties on imports and exports. At the Convention,

James Madison considered this last restriction as effectively eliminating all state tariffs.6 By

contrast, the prior drafts of the Constitution basically replicated the colonial system with

Congress replacing the British Board of Trade. While Congress, like the British Board of Trade,

was given oversight power—the right of consent to state tariff legislation, states under these

prior drafts enjoyed considerable latitude over their own revenue-generating tariff polices just as

their colonial antecedents had—certainly more than the Constitution as adopted gave to them.

       With regard to state monetary powers, in the initial deliberations and drafts in the

Committee of Detail (July 17th through August 4th), they came close to adopting the colonial

monetary system—replacing British with congressional oversight.7 State legislatures could issue

fiat paper money as long as Congress did not disallow such actions—much like what the British

Board of Trade could do during the colonial period. States could determine legal tender within

their jurisdictions at least for public debts, but could not determine legal tender in their dealings

with the national government or in cross-state trade—again much like what the British Currency

Acts in the late colonial period achieved. It was only near the end of the Convention that this
                                                                                                   4

position was completely overturned and a no-exceptions ban on anything resembling the colonial

monetary system was adopted. Supporters argued that this change would increase interstate

economic integration. For example, during the ratification debates Madison argued, “Had every

State a right to regulate the value of its coin, there might be as many different currencies as

States; and thus the intercourse among them would be impeded…”8

       In conclusion, with regard to aspects of the Constitution that affected the nation’s internal

economic integration among the states the next viable and likely alternative was a constitution

exactly like the one adopted in 1789 but with the restrictions on state economic sovereignty, both

real and monetary, being less absolute and more akin to that experienced by the colonies prior to

the Revolution—with Congress replacing the British Board of Trade with regard to oversight

powers on these matters. This observation is critical. While the actual economic integration of

the nation in the decades soon after the adoption of the Constitution can be measured, what that

integration would have been in those decades under the next most likely alternative constitution

cannot be directly measured because such is a hypothetical counterfactual world. A real world

alternative that can be measured needs to be found that can be taken as a close proxy to that

counterfactual world. The degree of market integration observed among the colonies in the

decades prior to the Revolution is not only the closest proxy that can be found, but their

institutional constraints closely match what the early drafts of the Constitution at the

Constitutional Convention would have created with respect to interstate trade rules. Finally,

setting counterfactual assessments aside, simply knowing how the economic integration of the

U.S. in the decades soon after the adoption of the Constitution compares with that in the decades

preceding the Revolution is interesting in its own right, particularly in terms of identifying

contributors to long-run economic growth.

The Exercise of Colonial Economic Sovereignty over Their Borders

       The colonies were more-or-less free to pass laws regulating their own trade including

placing revenue-generating tariffs on imports and exports that crossed their borders. They were

also free to create inside fiat paper monies that could be, only within their jurisdictions, accepted

as a legal tender for various subsets of transactions, such as paying local taxes. To varying

degrees many enacted and carried out such laws. They faced oversight by the British Board of

Trade, but nothing near the absolute restrictions imposed on the states by the U.S. Constitution.

       At various times various colonies had import tariffs on finished goods, slaves, servants,

convicts, immigrants, pitch, tar, turpentine, rum, wine, beer, other liquors, tea, horses, cattle,

sheep, swine, beef, pork, butter, cheese, rice, hops, flax, sugar, molasses, vessels, empty casks,

tobacco, salt, cacao, dry goods, bar iron, wood products, animal skins, biscuits, foodstuffs, soap,

and non-British European and East Indian goods. Similarly, at various times various colonies had

export tariffs on tobacco, meat, fish, board lumber, animal skins, tanned leather, bread and flour,

timber, and barrel staves. Differential tonnage duties were imposed by various colonies at

various times as well. Colonies did not impose the same tariff duties on the same products, and

colonies altered their duties from year to year on some products. Some colonies were able to pass

laws imposing duties on goods imported from neighboring colonies. For some colonies import

and export duties represented a substantial portion of that colonial government’s revenue

whereas in other colonies they represented next to nothing or were not even used. In addition,

some colonies had excise taxes on products such as tobacco, tea, wine, liquors, lemons, oranges,

and limes. Excise taxes on products not produced in that colony would be functionally equivalent

to placing an import tariff on said goods. Finally, some colonies at various times also imposed
                                                                                                   6

non-tariff trade regulations, such as inspection rules, restrictions on when and where markets

could operate, and institutionalized price controls of varying degrees.9

       The exercise of sovereign power by individual colonies over the trade that crossed their

borders had some constraints. First, colonial laws had to be approved by the British Crown—in

the late colonial period via the Board of Trade—with the exception of Connecticut and Rhode

Island whose laws were not subject to Crown review. The Board typically let colonial trade laws

stand except for a few of the most egregiously disruptive, vis-à-vis their effect on neighboring

colonies or on important traders within the Empire. For example, when the colony of New York

tried to impose a 10 percent tariff upon goods imported from neighboring colonies the Crown

disallowed it. Oliver Dickerson concluded that “The policy of the Board on the subject of inter-

colonial commerce is…clear…, although there are fewer instances of its use. The few instances

of action, however, were effective in preventing the growth of discriminating trade laws” within

the Empire. Yet, a number of direct revenue-generating interfering duties between colonies can

be documented to have been not disallowed by the Board or not disallowed in a timely fashion.10

       Second, import and export duties affecting neighboring colonies faced retaliatory actions

that often led to their removal or alteration. For example, New Hampshire’s export duty on

lumber prompted Massachusetts to retaliate by imposing duties on the importation of New

Hampshire merchandise which in turn led New Hampshire to repeal its export duty on lumber.

Pennsylvania imposed reciprocal duties on goods imported from New York and Maryland that

would remain in force until its neighboring colonies removed their comparable duties. To what

extent these two constraints mitigated trade-barrier creation between colonies and stopped

markets from being poorly integrated is an empirical matter that will be estimated below. 11
                                                                                                    7

       The colonies also exercised considerable sovereign power over their own monetary

policies. They were allowed to issue their own fiat paper currencies, which at various times some

did and some did not. The amounts issued, the timing of emissions, and their backing or

redemption structures, along with their exchange rates to sterling, were allowed to and did vary

considerably from colony to colony. There was little coordination of monetary policy across the

colonies and no ability by colonies to enforce a fixed exchange rate between fiat currencies and

specie by directly exchanging it for specie on demand. Colonial treasuries could not and did not

function like banks in the 19th century sense. The British Parliament’s Currency Acts of 1751,

1764, 1770, and 1773 constrained the colonies’ monetary behavior but only in limiting the

maximum duration between emission and redemption in some colonies and, in all colonies,

limiting the extent to which paper money could be made a legal tender for debts. Considerable

flexibility in the exercise of monetary policy remained across the colonies—certainly far more

than the absolute ban on such activities written into the U.S. Constitution.12

        The exercise of sovereign power by individual colonies over the real and monetary trade

barriers at their borders, and the frequent and uncertain changes in these barriers, could create

large and varying cost wedges between colonial markets thus thwarting market integration

among the colonies. Because the Constitution removed these sovereign powers from the states,

the expectation is that markets should be less integrated among the colonies than among the

same post-Constitution states. The early drafts of the Constitution at the Constitutional

Convention with respects to interstate trade rules replicated this colonial world with Congress

playing the role of the British Board of Trade. As such, the difference between the market

integration among the post-Constitution states and that among the same locations when they
                                                                                                         8

were colonies—used here as a proxy for the relevant counterfactual—measures the net

contribution to the economic integration of the nation attributable to the U.S. Constitution.13

                  PURCHASING POWER PARITY AND MARKET INTEGRATION

       What can be used as a comparable method of estimating economic integration that also is

feasible given the current data? One such measure is purchasing power parity (PPP hereafter)—

which measures how well the prices of goods in two markets approximate the law-of-one-price

after accounting for exchange rates between the markets. Full purchasing power parity in

absolute terms would imply that at any point in time

       EXab = Pa/Pb,

where EXab is the exchange rate between places a and b, Pa is the price index of goods in place

a in terms of currency in place a and Pb is the price index of goods in place b in terms of

currency in place b. In the absence of barriers to trade, both tariff and non-tariff, profit arbitrage

among merchants should drive the PPP equation toward holding with equality. Because

transportation costs act as a wedge between markets and because shocks are not always fully

anticipated, the PPP equation is not expected to hold instantly and absolutely, but only relatively

and with some equilibrating time needed.14 As such, the PPP equation is typically estimated in

terms of rates of change over time.

       lnyt = lnEXabt + lnPbt – lnPat

where t is time in years, and y is the yearly deviations from PPP.

       Given integrated markets, deviations from PPP should be arbitraged away. Thus, a

standard test of PPP, and hence of market integration, is to determine if the deviations from PPP

(the lnyt’s) are stationary over time, i.e. whether the presence of unit roots can be rejected. Non-

stationary deviations (unit roots) indicate the presence of tax, transaction, information,
                                                                                                       9

transportation, and/or institutional costs between these markets that are thwarting the profitability

of arbitrage and the free flow of goods. More importantly, even if deviations from PPP are

stationary, the time it takes them to mean-revert when shocks push them off their stationary

path—the half-life—can be used as a relative measure of the magnitude of the arbitrage costs

and trade barriers that are preventing these markets from being instantly integrated. As such,

whether or not deviations from long-run PPP are permanent and how long it takes shocks to

mean-revert can be considered one measure of how well two market locations are integrated.15

       PPP can also be cast in the counterfactual terms needed to assess the magnitude of

institutional change. Across the states, does PPP hold to a greater degree, or to what degree do

shocks to PPP mean-revert faster, in the years shortly after the adoption of the Constitution

compared with across these same locations when they were British colonies? While PPP isn’t the

only test of the economic impact of the U.S. Constitution, it is an instructive place to start. PPP

gets directly at the economic integration question, and it requires little evidence, i.e. only price

indices and exchange rates. Other approaches are more data constrained, less direct, and not as

easily cast in clear counterfactual terms.16

                       DATA, TIME SPANS, AND EMPIRICAL DESIGN

Empirical Design

       A four-way empirical comparison is used to isolate the source of change in market

integration—a difference-in-difference setup.17 First, PPP among six post-Constitution states—

Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and South Carolina—is estimated

and compared with PPP among their colonial antecedents. This comparison is the main

counterfactual assessment to the questions posed above, namely what is the net contribution of

the U.S. Constitution to increasing market integration within the nation.
                                                                                                   10

       Second, PPP between Canadian locations—Montreal and Quebec—post-U.S.

independence is estimated and compared with PPP between these locations pre-1776. This is

done to determine whether changes in market integration over time are unique to the U.S.

experience. The U.S. went through major institutional changes that supposedly affected market

integration. Canadian locations did not. If Canadian locations experienced improvements to

market integration over time similar to that experienced by U.S. locations, it would be difficult to

attribute the improvements in U.S. market integration solely to the adoption of the U.S.

Constitution.

       Third, PPP is estimated between Canadian locations and non-Canadian (future U.S.)

locations prior to 1776. This is done to determine whether PPP among the colonies was more-or-

less uniform—a member of the British Empire effect—or was unique to just future U.S. states. In

other words, how successful as a general system was oversight by the British Board of Trade and

potential retaliatory behavior among the colonies at maintaining market integration? This

comparison helps determine whether an alternative U.S. Constitution where states exercised

sovereignty over the trade that crossed their borders conditional on congressional oversight

similar to that exercised by the British Board of Trade over the colonies could have been a viable

system for achieving market integration within the United States.

       Fourth, PPP is estimated between U.S. states and Canadian locations during the post-U.S.

Constitution period. This result, in conjunction with the second and third comparison, determines

whether the first comparison is unique to the U.S. or merely part of some global change

overtime. It also provides a relative comparison for determining whether the sovereign-border-

effect on market integration was more potent at the colony/state level or at the national level.
                                                                                                   11

         PPP comparisons require data on prices and exchange rates per location as well as the

selection of a time span for estimating PPP. Surviving data constrain what can be done.

Prices

         Separate continuous price indices per year, one for each colony/state market location, are

needed to measure market integration via PPP. The long-established price indices for

Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New York, and South Carolina and the price indices recently

created for Montreal and Quebec are used here. Added to these, are price indices constructed by

the author for Maryland and Virginia from raw individual price series. These price indices from

1748 through 1811 are presented in Figure 1 and 2.18 They are heavily weighted toward tradable

goods, thus the possibility of PPP failure due to the presence of non-tradable goods is largely

removed.19 While the available price data constrain the PPP tests to measuring market

integration between only eight locations across British North America, the six locations (states)

that would become united politically and monetarily under the U.S. Constitution after 1789

comprised two-thirds of the U.S. population and an even higher share of U.S. output and exports

in this era. These six locations also represent an equal number of northern and southern states.

                                   [Places Figures 1 and 2 Here]

Exchange Rates

         For the colonial period, each price index reported above was expressed in a different

currency, either that colony’s unit-of-account currency or its paper currency if it had issued such

in this period. Thus, to estimate PPP between the eight locations above for which price indices

exist, separate and continuous exchange rates per year between the currencies of each location

are needed. Such direct exchange rates between these locations do not exist. However, they can

be indirectly calculated using the long-established exchange rates between each location’s
                                                                                                    12

currency and pounds sterling, presented here in Figure 3.20 The indirect exchange rate between

two locations [EXab] can be estimated by taking the ratio of each location’s exchange rate to

pounds sterling [EXab = EXa£/Exb£].21

                                        [Place Figure 3 Here]

       The exchange rates between any two U.S. states in the post-Constitution period is

assumed to be one [EXab = 1]. Being a specie coin, a U.S. dollar is a U.S. dollar regardless of

location. And while the medium of exchange in the U.S. was comprised of a plethora of U.S.

dollar-denominated private banknotes, foreign specie coinage, and U.S. dollar specie coins, all

price indices in the U.S. data used here after 1795 were recorded in U.S. specie dollars. As such,

the test of PPP across U.S. states is also a test of whether the assumption of a unitary exchange

rate in U.S. dollars across states is a reasonable approximation once market participants had

converted whatever other monies were in use into the U.S. specie dollar unit of account.

       In the post-Constitution period direct exchange rates between Canada and U.S. states do

not exist. The Canadian locations used a unit-of-account currency called the Halifax pound. An

indirect exchange rate between U.S. dollars and Halifax pounds can be estimated in the same

manner as was done above for the colonial period. The Halifax pound to pounds sterling

exchange rate divided by the U.S. dollar to pounds sterling exchange rate equals the Halifax

pound to U.S. dollar exchange rate.22

Time Span Selection

       PPP is a time series analysis and so requires a span of continuous data. Because the goal

is to compare market integration among a group of locations post-Constitution with that among

the same group in the colonial era, panel time series techniques that group the locations together

in each period are the most appropriate. Such techniques can be sensitive to nuisance events
                                                                                                  13

which could bias the outcome, such as crossing different regimes or random occurrences of

historically unique events.23 For example, the trauma produced after 1811 by the War of 1812

and the lapse of the charter of the First Bank of the U.S. should not be confused with the

Constitution’s failure to yield integrated markets. As such, selecting periods, both post-

Constitution and pre-Revolution, that are relatively regime-homogenous is preferred.

       For the post-Constitution period the time span selected for estimation is from 1796

through 1811. The Constitution was not adopted by Congress until 1789 and its effects on market

integration were likely not instantaneous. For example, it took a few years to get related

monetary institutions up and running. The First Bank of the U.S. was not established until 1791,

with its various branches taking several years to open, and the U.S. mint was not established

until 1792. In addition, vestiges of pre-Constitution state institutions took a few years to be

displaced in the marketplace. For example, as late as 1795 some of the newspaper price currents

used to construct the price indices used here quoted their prices in pounds, shillings, and pence—

the old state currencies—rather than in U.S. dollars. Thus, 1796 is the earliest date when it seems

clear that post-Constitution behavior is not tainted by hold-over vestiges of pre-Constitution

pricing and institutions. Figures 1 and 2 also show a large non-stationary price spike occurring in

the early 1790s. Thus, if an earlier date is picked it would likely diminish the magnitude of

market integration estimated for the post-Constitution period. As such, 1796 is taken as the

starting point for testing PPP in the post-Constitution era.24

       The year 1811 is taken as the end testing point because the War of 1812 produced a

substantial liquidity crisis and one of the largest price inflations between the Revolution and the

Civil War. The charter for the First Bank of the U.S. was also allowed to lapse in 1811, and so

1811 marks a monetary institutional transition point and thus an appropriate data end point.25 In
                                                                                                    14

addition, the Constitution’s effect on interstate market integration cannot be disentangled from

that of the transportation revolution post-1815 using PPP methodologies. A time span that runs

significantly past 1815 would lack relevance. In short, the period 1796 to 1811 was selected

because it represents, as best as can be selected, a relatively homogenous institutional regime

across U.S. states for the post-Constitution period. It provides the best pure case and biggest

effect possible for increased market integration among the states attributable to the Constitution.

       For the colonial period, the time span ends in 1775 and is extended back as far as either

the data allow for each location or until a major regime change is encountered. Lower Canada

(Montreal and Quebec) did not fall under British administration until after 1760—and price

indices and exchange rates are not available before then.26 The price indices used for

Massachusetts and Maryland go back to 1750 and 1756, respectively, and Virginia did not start

to issue paper money until after 1755 with Virginia prices and exchange rates not reflecting said

until about 1757, which explains the beginning dates for these five locations. The New York

price index does not go back before 1748, thus explaining the start date for that location. While

the Pennsylvania and South Carolina data go back even further, being only two locations,

starting before 1748 for Pennsylvania and South Carolina would not be that informative.

       For the colonial period the end of King George’s War (1748) is also a good starting point

because 1748 is arguably a turning point in colonial monetary behavior. The wartime inflation

prior to 1748 caused Massachusetts to go off paper money after 1749 and led the British

Parliament to pass the Currency Act of 1751 which allowed colonies to issue paper money if two

conditions were met: (1) that it not be legal tender for all debts, and (2) that ample provisions

(taxes) be put in place to redeem each issue “within as short and reasonable a time as may be, not

exceeding five years as the farthest”. While this Act only applied to New England—the legal
                                                                                                    15

tender prohibition was extended to non-New England colonies by the Currency Act of 1764—

Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New York had followed similar policies on their own accord well

before 1760. For the spans of data used in the colonial period Massachusetts, Montreal, and

Quebec used a non-paper-money unit-of-account currency, the Massachusetts pound and Halifax

pound, respectively. The other five colonies were on their own individual paper currency

standards. Prices in each colony were typically quoted in their respective fiat paper monies when

they had one or in their unit-of-account currency when they did not issue paper money.27 In

short, the period 1775 back to 1748 (or as close to 1748 as possible) was selected because it

represents, as best as can be selected, a relatively homogeneous institutional regime within each

colony and so between the colonies prior to the American Revolution.

Preliminary Data Evaluation

       Before proceeding to test PPP between colonies and between states, i.e. before testing the

combined movement of price indices and exchange rates between locations, it is important to

note the properties of each price index and exchange rate for each separate location on its own.28

For the price indices displayed in Figures 1 and 2 for the colonial period, the New York series is

non-stationary while the rest are trend stationary, but with different trends among the locations.

In addition, the half-lives to shocks vary among these series. For the exchange rates displayed in

Figure 3, the Massachusetts and Virginia series are non-stationary while the rest are stationary,

but with half-lives to shocks that vary among these series. For the price indices in the post-

Constitution period, 1796-1811, Montreal is non-stationary, Quebec and South Carolina are trend

stationary, but with very different trends, and the rest are stationary with only minor differences

in their half-lives to shocks. The exchange rate to pounds sterling in this period for Montreal and

Quebec is non-stationary, whereas the U.S. dollar to pounds sterling exchange rate is stationary.
                                                                                                    16

       In summary, the vast majority of individual time-series used here are either stationary or

trend stationary. Thus, combining series via co-integration techniques is unnecessary (co-

integration being used to see if individual non-stationary series when combined become

stationary). Conversely, PPP holding across locations simply cannot be deduced from the fact

that the individual series that make up the PPP equation are stationary. The fact that the trends

and half-lives to shocks vary substantially among the various individual series, plus the fact that

a few of the series are non-stationary or only marginally stationary, leaves PPP holding, let alone

the magnitude by which it might hold, an open question. Simply eyeballing the separate series in

Figures 1, 2, and 3 does not produce a confident feel for how integrated these locations may be in

terms of PPP.29 As such, econometric estimation of the properties of the lnyt’s from the PPP

equation is still required. If nothing else estimation is necessary to produce a measure of the half-

lives to shocks. The magnitude of these half-lives is the key to comparing colonial versus post-

Constitution market integration.

                           PPP TEST PROCEDURES AND RESULTS

       Table 1 presents several panel tests as well as the full complement of univariate

augmented Dickey-Fuller tests for unit roots (non-stationarity) in the PPP equation residuals

among the eight locations described above for the late colonial period (1748-1775) and the early

U.S. national period (1796-1811). To compare market integration among a group of locations

post-Constitution with market integration among the same group in the colonial era, panel time-

series techniques that group the locations together in each period are the most appropriate. Panel

techniques are also recommended as a way to mitigate the low-powered problem inherent in

univariate tests when using short spans of data, i.e. the difficulty univariate tests have

distinguishing between non-stationarity and stationarity with slow convergence.30
                                                                                                    17

                                         [Place Table 1 Here]

        Because panel tests vary in terms of how individuals in the panel are combined, how they

perform in finite samples, and how the alternative to the null hypothesis of non-stationarity is

constructed, it is important for robustness purposes to report a variety of panel tests. As such, all

the panel tests currently available in STATA are reported here. The workhorse is the Levin-Lin-

Chu test in part because it is recommended for smaller panels and because it generates a

coefficient (a1) from which a half-life to shocks can be calculated. It tests the null that all

individuals in the panel have a unit root against the alternative that all are stationary. It has

moderate ability to reject the null when the truth is a mixed panel in which some individuals

have unit-root processes while others do not. The second panel test reported, the Im-Pesaran-

Shin test, relaxes the homogeneity restriction in the alternative hypothesis of the Levin-Lin-Chu

test, replacing it with the union of stationarity outcomes among the individuals in the panel.

        Both the Levin-Lin-Chu and the Im-Pesaran-Shin test must be used on balanced panels.

This is not an issue for the post-Constitution period where all individuals have the same time

span. For the colonial period the panels must be estimated anew for a different span of years each

time another colony enters the data set. Results from these two panel tests are also reported for

different groupings in each period, such as for including Lower Canada versus not including

Lower Canada. This, along with the univariate tests, helps identify where the relative strengths of

market integration lay within each panel grouping. Finally, two variants of the Fisher panel test

for unbalanced panels are reported, one using augmented Dickey-Fuller methods and one using

Phillip-Perron methods. These last two tests can be thought of as pooled univariate tests.31

        Panel unit-root tests have some drawbacks. First, they do not reveal where within the

panel the strengths and weakness in market integration lay, i.e. whether all individuals are
                                                                                                        18

equally integrated or whether some individuals suffer from unit-root processes while others do

not. Because of this, it is important to report the full complement of univariate tests between

individual location pairings in the panel as a diagnostic tool and robustness check. These

univariate tests are presented in Table 1 after the panel tests. Second, cross-sectional

independence in the regression error terms is a regular assumption of panel tests. While the time

spans are too short to definitively test for this, the fact that the price indices used for the eight

locations do not have a single good in common and often have a number of non-overlapping

goods in their index compositions, mitigates against the possibility that global shocks to common

goods might be imparting some non-independence across regression residuals.32

Results for the Colonial Period

        A unit-root process is rejected (PPP holds) in all panel tests for the colonial period

regardless of test, time span, or location grouping. The half-lives to shocks in the panel tests are

relatively short, being about half a year, except when Virginia is included and Lower Canada is

excluded. Then it rises to about one year, which is still reasonably short. Given this data and

using these methods, colonial markets appear well integrated. Despite a fair degree of practical

sovereignty over their borders with respect to real and monetary trade barriers, the colonies did

not exercise this sovereignty in a way to seriously inhibit the profitability of arbitrage and the

free flow of goods. Weak British oversight and the threat of retaliatory action between colonies

may have been enough to maintain market integration.33

        The univariate tests support the panel results and show that the results are spread evenly

across the panel. A unit root can be rejected (PPP holds) for 27 of the 28 pairings.34 In addition,

the half-lives to shocks are uniform across pairings, ranging between one-third and two-thirds of

a year for most—only exceeding one year in three of the 28 pairings. Only Virginia exhibits
                                                                                                     19

some structural break issues. For all colonies paired with Virginia in a univariate setting a unit

root cannot be rejected (results not shown). However, once a structural break is added so that

1757-1765 is different from 1766-1775, then a unit root is rejected. This makes sense for

Virginia because unlike the other colonies Virginia had no experience issuing paper money

before 1755 and engaged in poor money management early on. Complaints about Virginia were,

in part, responsible for the passage of the 1764 Currency Act which supposedly corrected

Virginia’s behavior.35 Nevertheless, the panel results, which do not incorporate the structural

break in Virginia’s behavior, show that this weakness in Virginia’s PPP is minor.

Results for the Post-Constitution U.S. States

       The panel tests are mixed regarding PPP holding among the post-Constitution U.S. states.

The Im-Pesaran-Shin test fails to reject a unit root (PPP does not hold) except when South

Carolina is excluded from the sample space and then only barely rejecting a unit root. By

contrast, the Levin-Lin-Chu test rejects a unit-root process (PPP holds) for all groupings.

However, the half-lives to shocks in these tests are relatively long at 1.5 years for the six U.S.

states. This is between one-third and one-half longer than what is estimated among the panel

tests in the colonial period. Only when South Carolina is dropped from the post-Constitution

panel does the half-life to shocks improve into the range estimated for the colonial period.

       The univariate tests support the panel results and show that the primary problem lies with

South Carolina. PPP among U.S. states holds for 10 of the 15 pairings. PPP fails to hold for the

Maryland-Pennsylvania pairing (just missing the 10 percent significance level) and for 4 of the 5

South Carolina pairings. The half-lives to shocks, excluding the South Carolina pairings, is

comparable to that in the colonial period, confirming that it is something about South Carolina

that is making market integration among the U.S. states look worse than among the colonies.
                                                                                                    20

       Given the totality of estimates in Table 1, the general impression is that when applying

the same methods and test criteria PPP holds marginally better across the six colonies that would

be future U.S. states than it does across the same locations post-Constitution. At best, the

colonial and early national periods are indistinguishable in terms of PPP. Relatively short half-

lives to shocks are found, which explains why a unit root can be rejected in most cases in both

periods even when using short data spans and univariate tests. These relatively short half-lives

are consistent with colonial and early national markets being reasonably well integrated with the

exception of post-Constitution South Carolina.

       Quantitatively, the net contribution of the Constitution to increasing market integration

among the states can be measured as minus the difference in the half-life to shocks post-

Constitution versus pre-Revolution.36 Comparing the panel estimate for the six states in the post-

Constitution period (S1) with the worst result in the panel estimates for these same six locations

in the colonial period (S3) yields a net gain in market integration of [minus (S1 – S3)] = –0.38.

Thus, even when selecting results biased in favor of the Constitution causing increased market

integration among the states, a marked deterioration is found instead. Only if South Carolina is

dropped from the post-Constitution panel can a case be made for improved market integration

post-Constitution, i.e. the best case in Table 1 being [minus (S1* – S3)] = +0.62.

       Market integration as measured by PPP across U.S. states was not improved by the U.S.

Constitution compared with what it was in the late colonial period. The key economic clauses in

the Constitution that removed real and monetary trade barriers between the states had little effect

compared with its likely and almost-adopted alternative, namely a constitution just like the one

adopted in 1789 but with restrictions on state economic sovereignty over the trade that crossed

their borders, both real and monetary, being less absolute and more akin to that experienced by
                                                                                                   21

the colonies prior to the Revolution but with the U.S. Congress replacing the British Board of

Trade with regard to oversight powers on these matters.

Robustness Checks: The South Carolina Anomaly Post-Constitution

       The failure of PPP to hold for most South Carolina pairings with other U.S. states in the

early national period compared with PPP holding for all South Carolina pairings in the colonial

period might be due to changes in the composition of goods in the South Carolina price index.

Between 1748 and 1775 the South Carolina price index is heavily weighted toward rice and

indigo, 51 and 22 percent, respectively. Cotton received zero weight. Between 1796 and 1811 the

South Carolina price index is heavily weighted toward cotton, i.e. 32 percent of the index. The

patenting of Eli Whitney’s cotton gin in 1794 and the explosion in cotton production after 1795

drove cotton prices down.37 When the South Carolina price index is separated into its

subcomponents, it shows that indeed cotton prices declined precipitously between 1796 and

1811, more so than for other goods, see Appendix Figure A. Given cotton’s weight in the index,

South Carolina’s price index was dragged down relative to the price indices of other states.

       Removing cotton from the South Carolina price index might improve PPP for South

Carolina pairings in the early national period. Table 2 reports univariate augmented Dickey-

Fuller tests for PPP between South Carolina and the other U.S. states and with Lower Canada for

when the South Carolina price index is restricted to its reported subcomponents. The results

show that export staple prices, in particular cotton prices, are a substantial contributor to the PPP

failure of South Carolina pairings. However, removing export staples or just using rice prices

from the South Carolina index, while moving the estimate toward PPP holding, does not improve

the estimates enough in any pairing to statistically reject PPP failure at the 10 percent level.

                                        [Place Table 2 Here]
                                                                                                    22

       When restricting the Pennsylvania index to be as close to South Carolina’s cotton-only

index and to South Carolina’s rice-only index in terms of measuring the same products, the

Pennsylvania Textile Fiber Price Only Index and the Pennsylvania Grain Price Only Index,

respectively, PPP failure still cannot be statistically rejected. The failure of PPP to hold for most

South Carolina pairings in the post-Constitution period would appear to be relatively robust.

Difference-In-Difference Controls and Sovereign Border Effects: The Results for Lower Canada

       The deterioration of market integration among U.S. states post-Constitution compared

with pre-Revolution [minus (S1 – S3) in Table 1] might simply reflect some general deterioration

of market integration among North Atlantic economies over this period. In other words, the

Constitution might still be seen as improving market integration among the states if market

integration in nearby locations that did not experience U.S. style institutional changes suffered

even more deterioration. The difference in market integration in terms of the half-life to shocks

between Montreal and Quebec after 1795 (C1) compared with before 1776 (C3) will be used to

net out such a possibility using a difference-in-difference assessment, i.e. minus [(S1 – S3) – (C1

– C3)] in Table 1.38 Even when biasing the outcome in favor of the Constitution having an

improving effect on economic integration among the states by the selection of (S1 – S3) and by

assuming C3 = 0, the results, while less negative than when Lower Canada is not used as a

control, are still negative (–0.04). Again, only if South Carolina is dropped from the panel of

U.S. states (replacing S1 with S1*) can a positive effect be generated.

       The Canadian results can also be used to assess changes in market integration when

national sovereign borders change. American independence and the economic integrating effects

of adopting the U.S. Constitution manifested itself among U.S. states as a group, i.e. not as an

improvement in PPP or market integration among U.S. states but as an inside versus outside the
                                                                                                   23

British Empire effect. Table 1 tests PPP between Lower Canada and the U.S. states both before

U.S. independence (1761-1775) and after the adoption of the Constitution (1796-1811). The PPP

estimates reveal an erosion of market integration between Lower Canada and U.S. locations after

the U.S. left the British Empire.

       In both the panel and univariate tests involving Lower Canada during the colonial period

PPP failure can be rejected with confidence. The half-life to shocks between Lower Canada and

non-Lower Canada are similar to those among the non-Lower Canada colonies. Lower Canada

cannot be distinguished from non-Lower Canada before the American Revolution.

       Post-U.S. Constitution, the univariate tests show that PPP continues to hold between

Montreal and Quebec but now fails to hold between Montreal and all other U.S. states and

between Quebec and all other U.S. states. The panel tests show a similar result in that they are

weak and mixed on PPP holding when Lower Canada is included in the sample space. The half-

life to shocks—two to three years—is much longer when Lower Canada is included in the panel

compared with the 0.5 to 1.5 years when excluded.

       Market integration between Lower Canada and the U.S. parted ways post-Constitution.

The Constitution allowed U.S. states as a group to chart a course separate from that of Lower

Canada, e.g. the Jefferson embargo. Lower Canada was tied to the British economy. It remained

part of the British Empire which maintained substantial trade barriers against nations outside the

Empire which now included the United States. Britain also went to war with France, suffered

inflation, and went off the gold standard in 1797. The U.S. states were able to decouple their

economies from Britain, not go to war, not go off a specie monetary standard, and not suffer as

much inflation relative to the British and Canadian economies.39 As such, these results are
                                                                                                     24

consistent with the relative importance of international sovereign borders as an impediment to

PPP found in studies of the modern era.40

    WHY DID THE CONSTITUTION FAIL TO IMPROVE PPP AMONG U.S. STATES?

       Part of the answer may be that market integration was so good among the colonies,

despite their exercise of real and monetary sovereignty over their borders, that there was little

room for improvement.41 Still, as good as colonial market integration was, why did adopting the

Constitution not yield even more improvement? Several possible reasons exist. First, the

Constitution did not restrict states from enacting excise taxes, taxes familiar to most colonists.

An excise tax placed on a product not produced within the state is equivalent to an import duty

placed on that product.42 However, when the Constitution eliminated the ability of the states to

raise revenue through imposing import and export duties at their borders, states did not shift to

excise taxes to replace the lost revenue. Before the adoption of the Constitution, states relied on

poll and property taxes and land sales as their primary revenue sources. After the adoption of the

Constitution, states continued to rely almost exclusively on these sources. They simply dropped

the revenue earned on import and export duties without replacing it with other taxes. Federal

assumption of state war debts in 1790 significantly reduced state expenses and so made this

possible.43 State excise taxes that inhibited interstate market integration would not reappear until

later in the 19th century. They were unimportant pre-1812.44

       New York was an exception. From 1784 through 1811 it maintained a tax on the auction

of “merchandise and effects of foreign production imported into the state” and after 1801 an

additional charge of one percent per value sold when auctioned in New York City. Auction

duties may have served as a surrogate for a tariff on foreign imports depending on what portion

of these imports were sold at auction versus through other means. New York’s revenue from
                                                                                                       25

auction duties was not trivial. For example, in 1799 the state collected $47,908 in auction duties

which represented 19 percent of total revenue for that year. While not directly affecting the

movement of U.S. produced goods into New York from other states, except wine and spirits for

which auction duties applied regardless of origin, these auction duties could have produced some

price wedges between foreign goods in New York and the same foreign goods in other states and

so inhibited better interstate market integration.45

        Second, the constitutional clause restricting state power to erect tariffs had an exception,

namely states could place duties on imports or exports without congressional consent if they

were “absolutely necessary for executing its [the states’] inspection laws…”—Article 1, section

10, clause 2.46 States could erect trade barriers against other states in the guise of inspection

laws, though they could not retain any revenue from such duties beyond the fees needed to

defray the cost of inspection. While these fees were typically small relative to the price of the

good, the total time, effort, money, and resources expended on inspection was nontrivial. States

made extensive use of inspection laws placing them on many important trade goods.

        Only a few state inspection laws targeted imports, such as gunpowder imported into

Pennsylvania. Most targeted goods produced within their respective states that were to be

exported. For example, Pennsylvania required inspection of flour, bread, beef, pork, flaxseed,

butter, biscuits, shingles, staves, Indian corn, hog-lard, and black-oak bark produced in

Pennsylvania that were to be exported from the state; Maryland required said for tobacco, potash,

bacon, beef, pork, fish, flour, and bread; Virginia required said for tobacco, flour, bread, fish,

pork, beef, tar, pitch, turpentine, and ship ballast; and South Carolina required said for tobacco,

beef, pork, rice, pitch, tar, rosin, turpentine, shingles, staves, cotton, bread, flour, corn, peas,

potatoes, oats, wheat, and rye. These inspection laws applied to goods exported to other states as
                                                                                                    26

well as to foreign countries, but not to goods consumed within state. This fact is illustrated by

Virginia who altered its law in 1802 to exempt flour shipped to the District of Columbia from

inspection. This change turned the District of Columbia from an outside to an inside market

vis-à-vis Virginia with respect to flour prices. In general, inspection laws were not uniformly

enforced and they were changed from time to time.47 They created varying price differentials

between goods sold within-state versus when the same goods were sold out-of-state thereby

inhibiting better interstate market integration. It took most of the 19th and some of the 20th

century to eliminate such behaviors via Federal and Supreme Court action.48

       Third, because “deviations from PPP are always and everywhere a monetary

phenomenon,” constitutional changes in monetary institutions need to be reevaluated.49 The U.S.

Constitution eliminated competing state-issued monies and led to a common national currency-

of-account (the U.S. Dollar) under a fixed specie exchange rate regime. This shift should have

increased national market integration.50 That it did not as measured by PPP here suggests that

some countervailing forces may have been at work. For example, the Constitution did not create

a common paper medium of exchange and, in fact, occasioned a greater number of paper

currencies (different banknotes) than what had existed during the late colonial era. Post-

Constitution, there was a rapid increase in the number of privately run banks chartered by state

governments, from only 3 in 1787 to 76 by 1805. These banks issued banknotes backed by

fractional reserves of specie. A wide range of banknotes entered cross-state trade. The notes

facilitated trade but at the cost of banknotes trading at varying discounts off their face value,

depending on distance to the issuing bank and that bank’s reputation. This may have increased

the transactions costs of cross-state arbitrage to a level comparable with what existed in the late

colonial era of floating exchange rates between the fiat paper currencies issued by each colonial
                                                                                                       27

legislature (a maximum of 13 separate currencies). Monetary union did not mean financial union.

Financial market integration by some measures would take another century or more to achieve.

Even a common national paper currency exchangeable at par throughout the country would take

another 75 years to achieve.51 As such, better interstate market integration post-Constitution

may have been inhibited because a common unit-of-account currency and so unitary exchange

rates between states, as assumed in the price indices reported post-1795 and used here in Table 1

to estimate PPP, was not yet completely achieved.

       This last inhibiting factor to better interstate market integration may have been

particularly acute for South Carolina. As shown above, market integration among the states was

comparable with that among their colonial antecedents as long as South Carolina is excluded

from the post-Constitution sample. The poor PPP performance of post-Constitution South

Carolina stands out as anomalous. Besides creating interstate trade barriers via inspection laws

and local banknote currencies, actions undertaken in most states, South Carolina went further

than other states in subverting the constitutional restriction on states issuing bills of credit and

making them a legal tender for paying state obligations.52

       In 1786 South Carolina issued 100,000 South Carolina pounds as loan-office bills of

credit—paper money the state government loaned to its citizens who mortgaged their lands as

security. These bills were receivable at par with specie for repaying said loans and for state taxes.

Initially these bills were to be called out of circulation by 1791, but every year thereafter through

1811 the state legislature extended the period of their acceptance, at par with specie, for

repayment of the loans made in these bills that were still due. The South Carolina legislature also

explicitly made, by law, paper vouchers paid to legislators in this period a legal tender for paying

state taxes. Both these actions gave a nominal anchor to these old state paper bills of credit and
                                                                                                       28

current legislator pay vouchers and so may have maintained these instruments as credible inside-

monies within South Carolina.53 The maintenance of non-specie-linked inside monies competing

with specie-linked outside monies in South Carolina between 1790 and 1811 may have inhibited

better interstate market integration.

                                            PAST AND PRESENT

        In the modern era it has been difficult not to reject PPP using standard univariate tests,

both in inter-national comparisons—especially for floating exchange rate regimes—and in intra-

national comparisons, such as across U.S. cities where tariff barriers and exchange rate volatility

do not exist. While panel data approaches have made it easier not to reject PPP, the mean-

reversion process has often remained long. Shocks appear to be stubbornly persistent in ways

that are difficult to explain in terms of the cost of arbitrage, i.e. half-lives of typically 3 to 5

years, and in some cases, such as between major U.S. cities from 1918 to 1995, a half-life of

almost 9 years.54

        How does the past compare with this? In other words, was it always like this or when did

such complications in PPP arise? If we take the late colonial and early national periods in

America as the past, then the past appears very different indeed. In the colonial and early

national periods, even when using low-powered univariate tests and short spans of data, for the

most part PPP holds and the shocks to PPP have low persistence, i.e. half-lives of 1 or less years,

see Table 1. Yet in these early periods transactions, information, and transportation costs were

higher compared with the modern era—working against the finding here. That implies that the

difference in present versus past PPP measures must be attributable to other differences. For

example, in these earlier periods the complexity of goods was on average lower and market-

institutional price-stickiness was lower, monetary institutions were simpler, and technical change
                                                                                                   29

or differential non-transferable real productivity shocks were lower than during the modern era.

Thus, if PPP holds less easily in the modern era, then it may be the rise in these latter factors that

complicated trade cost and measurement accuracy and made it difficult to find that PPP holds

and/or causes shock-persistence to be relatively high.55

       For the modern era, scholars have also found that the degree to which PPP holds is

affected by sovereign borders and by exchange rate regimes. Typically, PPP is more difficult not

to reject and the persistence of deviations to PPP are higher under floating exchange rates and

where national borders intrude.56 The results in Table 1 go in the opposite direction of these

modern era findings in terms of exchange rate regimes and in terms of colonial versus state

sovereign borders (though in the same direction regarding international sovereign borders—the

U.S. versus Lower Canada). This comparison again points to the increasing complexity of

modern monetary institutions, informal non-tariff trade barriers, and modern goods, and the rise

of differential non-transferable real productivity shocks, as the culprits behind the relative failure

of PPP and higher persistence of deviations from PPP in the modern era rather than just

sovereign borders and exchange rate regimes per se.

       Finally, a few long-run tests of PPP using pre-modern European data, such as for wheat

prices between England and France from 1630 to 1789, have also rejected unit roots using

standard univariate tests and found low persistence to deviations to PPP, i.e. half-lives of about

one year.57 As such, the modern era versus pre-modern era comparisons offered here, being

before versus after the industrial revolution, might also be seen as broadly consistent with the

interpretation of PPP failure (or the high persistence of shocks) in the modern era as being

possibly due to the rise in the complexity of modern goods, modern monetary institutions, and

non-easily transferable real productivity shocks.

                                         CONCLUSIONS

       Institutional change may matter, but sometimes not by much, and sometimes not in ways

obvious to us or foreseen by their creators. The U.S. Constitution gives the appearance of

sweeping away both real and monetary trade barriers between the states thus enhancing national

market integration. But in fact it may not have done so, at least not over the lifetimes of its

creators, relative to a next best alternative—a looser confederation similar to that within the

British Empire where individual colonies (states) exercised considerable real and monetary

sovereignty over their borders, but with the U.S. Congress substituted into the oversight role

played by the British Board of Trade vis-à-vis the states. As such, adopting the Constitution was

not a watershed institutional change or a discrete break with the past with regard to national

market integration. Long-run economic growth predicated on increasing market integration

within the nation brought on by institutional change cannot be sustained using the methods and

evidence here. Market integration during 1796-1811 was not superior to that during 1748-1775.

       While the net contribution of the Constitution to U.S. interstate market integration in the

first decades of the Republic may be nil, the Constitution might still be credited with

constraining future market disintegration that might have arisen in its absence, and it allowed

future generations via judicial re-interpretation and Federal action to sweep away state trade

barriers centuries later. In addition, while constitutionally changing the economic sovereignty of

state borders may have mattered little, changing the economic sovereignty of national borders

mattered a lot. After 1795 a gap in market integration opened up between the U.S. and what

remained of the British Empire in America, a gap that did not exist before 1776.

       I realize that there are an army of scholars with strong priors regarding the Constitution’s

triumph in creating a common market within the United States soon after its adoption, along with
                                                                                                     31

the benefits that flowed from that creation. I was one of them. Such priors, however, come from

a priori logic and not systematic measurement done within a counterfactual framework. While

the results here attempt to bridge this gap between logic and empirics, they are based on PPP

methodologies using the currently available data—methods and data that are not perfect. While

there may be other approaches to testing the economic impact of the Constitution, using relative

PPP performance is the obvious and direct approach. Given that it indicates that the Constitution

added little to U.S. national market integration in the early decades of the Republic, we can no

longer just assume that it is a priori obvious that the Constitution produced substantial gains in

national economic integration soon after its adoption.

            A unit root can be rejected if statistically insignificant lags (k = 3) are added to the

specification. In all cases, just the first lag (k = 1) is statistically insignificant at the 0.1 level, and

when adding up to three lags (k = 3) the last lag remains statistically insignificant. These

specifications also generated coefficients on the ln(yt-1)s that are less than –1.0, suggesting the

presence of oscillatory overshooting or excess volatility in the mean reversion process.

The data are yearly. Standard errors are in parentheses. P-values for the univariate regressions

are MacKinnon approximate p-values generated by Phillips-Perron univariate tests when

structural breaks are not present. Half-life calculations are bias-adjusted following Mark,

International Macroeconomics, pp. 32, 44. When this bias-adjusted coefficient is too near to -1 a

meaningful half-life different from zero cannot be calculated and is so indicated by a dash. Half-

life estimates in brackets represents what the half-life would be if a unit root would have been

rejected. Regarding S1, S3, C1, and C3 see note 17. The panel tests for the pre-U.S. Constitution

period do not incorporate the structural break in the Virginia series as was done for the univariate

tests. While Period refers to the years spanned by the yt values, the existence and use of a yt-1

value is also implied for the initial year listed. y for the colonial period equals [(Colony A’s

sterling exchange rate X Colony B’s Price Index) / (Colony B’s sterling exchange rate X Colony

A’s Price Index)] for each colony-to-colony pairing, respectively. All cross-colonial exchange

rates are derived by combining the respective colony’s exchange rates with England, i.e. the

number of each colony’s pounds per 100 pounds sterling, see Appendix Table A. y for the U.S.-

dollar national period between U.S. states equals [State A’s Price Index / State B’s Price Index]

for each state-to-state pairing, respectively. All cross-state exchange rates are assumed to be 1 (a
                                                                                                        47

U.S. dollar is a U.S. dollar). y for the U.S.-dollar national period (1796-1811) for comparison

with Canadian locations (MT and QU) equals [Canadian Colony A’s Price Index / Canadian

Colony B’s Price Index] for each Canadian colony-to-Canadian colony comparison (a Halifax

pound is a Halifax pound, so exchange rates equal 1), and equals [(Canadian Colony A’s Halifax

pound to pounds sterling exchange rate times the U. S. State B’s Price Index) / (the U.S. dollar to

pounds sterling exchange rate times the Canadian Colony A’s Price Index)] for each Canadian

colony-to-U.S. state pairing, respectively. Lags of the dependent variable were added to the

specification until the k+1 lag was statistically insignificant at the 0.1 level. D for Virginia in the

univariate regressions is a structural break dummy variable coded as one for the years 1766-75

and zero otherwise (see text for the explanation). For the 1757-75 MD-to-NY univariate

regression a unit root can be rejected at the 0.1 level if a k = 1 lag—which in itself is statistically

insignificant—is added to the regression. For the 1797-1811 MD-to-PA univariate regression, a

unit root is just barely rejected at the 0.1 level (t = 2.58).

        The Massachusetts price index is an annual weighted 15-commodity arithmetic index of

rural prices on tradable farm goods with these goods being corn, English hay, meadow hay,

potatoes, rye, oats, butter, cheese, milk, fresh beef, salt beef, fresh pork, salt pork, water cider,

and clear cider. The Pennsylvania (Philadelphia) price index is a 20-commodity unweighted

geometric wholesale price index with the 20 commodities being beef, bread, corn, cotton, flour,

gunpowder, indigo, molasses, pitch, pork, rice, rum, salt, staves, sugar, tar, tobacco, turpentine,

wheat, and wine. The New York (New York City) price index from 1748 through 1787 is a 15-

commodity arithmetic wholesale price index and from 1788 through 1811 is a 71-commodity

arithmetic wholesale price index. Both use variable group weighting. The 15 commodities are

corn, wheat, superfine flour, bread, beef, mess pork, chocolate, coffee, salt, loaf sugar, bohea tea,
                                                                                                    48

molasses, rum, beeswax, and wood. The 71 commodities include the 15 commodities from 1748-

1787 (sans wood) and oats, rye, tobacco, flaxseed, cotton, butter, cheese, herring, mackerel,

common flour, rye flour, saltpeter, cargo pork, pepper, pimento, nutmeg, lump sugar, muscovado

sugar, hyson tea, sperm candles, mold candles, dipped candles, whale oil, pig iron, county bar

iron, Russian iron, Swedish iron, shot, German steel, nails, nail rods, lead bar, hogshead staves,

pipe staves, linseed oil, white lead, white oil lead, glass, tar, pitch, turpentine, brandy, gin,

Jamaica spirits, port wine, Madeira wine, castile soap, common soap, pearl ash, pot ash, French

indigo, Carolina indigo, beaver, otter, muskrat, marten, and feathers. The South Carolina

(Charleston) price index from 1748 through 1775 is a weighted 17-commodity arithmetic

wholesale price index with the commodities being rice, indigo, deerskins, pork, corn, pitch, beef,

peas, beaver skins, butter, flour, hemp, leather, staves, tallow, tar, and turpentine. From 1780

through 1811 it is a weighted 44-commodity arithmetic wholesale price index which includes the

17 commodities from 1748-1775 (sans beaver skins, hemp, leather, and staves), and short cotton,

long cotton, lumber, rosin, tobacco, bacon, beeswax, candles, hams, hay, lard, mackerel,

domestic molasses, oats, rope, rum, soap, whiskey, bagging, coffee, brandy, iron bar, foreign

molasses, nails, pepper, rum, salt, loaf sugar, muscovado sugar, tea, and Madeira wine. The

colonial Maryland price index is an unweighted nine-commodity geometric price index with the

nine commodities being corn, wheat, oats, rye, salt, beef, pork, sugar, and rum. The Virginia and

post-colonial Maryland price indices are both unweighted three-commodity geometric price

indices with the three commodities being corn, wheat, and tobacco. The Montreal and Quebec

price indices are both unweighted 10-commodity indices using prices for oats, butter, wood,

wheat, beef, flour, hay, eggs, peas, and chickens.

        Notes: CA equals the Canadian locations of Montreal and Quebec where the Halifax

pound was used as the unit of account money. Indirect exchange rates between colonies can be

constructed as follows: the desired (but unknown) exchange rate [EXab] between Colony A and

Colony B equals the number of Colony A pounds needed to buy a given amount of Colony B

pounds, namely EXab = (#Colony A pounds / #Colony B pounds). The known exchange rates
                                                                                                 54

between pounds sterling and Colony A pounds and between pounds sterling and Colony B

pounds equals the number of Colony A pounds and the number of Colony B pounds needed to

buy a given amount of pounds sterling, namely EXsa = (#pounds sterling / #Colony A pounds)

and EXsb = (#pounds sterling / #Colony B pounds), respectively. It follows from simple algebra

that the unknown exchange rate between Colony A and Colony B [EXab] equals the ratio of the

two known sterling exchange rates [EXsb/EXsa], namely [EXsb/EXsa] = [(#pound sterling /

#Colony B pounds) / (#pounds sterling / #Colony A Pounds)] = (#Colony A pounds / #Colony B

pounds) = EXab. These indirectly calculated exchange rates between each pair of colonies are

what are used in the PPP tests in Tables 1 and 2. In other words, indirect exchange rates between

colonies are calculated as [(Exchange rate of Colony A to pounds sterling) / (Exchange rate of

Colony B to pounds sterling)] for each colony-to-colony pairing. Rates are reported only for the

years used for the PPP estimates reported in Table 1.

       Notes: In the “All Commodity Index,” the export staple cotton was weighted 32.5 percent

and rice 7.5 percent (out of 100 percent). Among the non-export stables in the “All Commodity

Index,” the seven most heavily weighted goods, out of 100 percent, were sugar (9 percent), corn

(8 percent), flour (7.5 percent), American Rum (7 percent), Liverpool Salt (5 percent), foreign

molasses (3.5 percent), and pork (3.5 percent).

      Recently, scholars have examined anew the design and adoption of the U.S. Constitution

with an eye on identifying the determinants and motivations of the founding fathers in adopting

specific clauses into the Constitution, e.g. see Grubb, “US Constitution and Monetary Powers”;

Heckelman and Dougherty, “An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution”; McGuire, To

Form a More Perfect Union. This scholarship, including the prior research from which it was

derived, has not examined the actual impact on the economy of the specific constitutional clauses

so adopted. By contrast, the emphasis here is on measuring economic outcomes rather than

inferring motives or identifying behavioral determinants of the founding fathers.

Congress, v. 26-34; Tindall, America, pp. 262-93. After the Revolution, the U.S. operated only

five full years under the Articles of Confederation, 1784-1788, most of which were severe

recessionary years. The quantity and quality of data during these five years are not good enough

to support time series analysis. Thus, besides being an inappropriate counterfactual, this period in

practice cannot serve in a time-series capacity as a proxy for what market integration would have

been under the next best alternative to the Constitution.
  4
      Whether the almost-adopted interstate trade rules in the prior drafts of the Constitution at the

1787 Convention can be considered the next best institutional alternative with respect to those

rules is hard to say. These alternative rules may not represent the full opportunity cost to the
                                                                                                     57



Constitution regarding economic integration among the states. Thus, measuring interstate

economic integration achieved under the Constitution against that achieved under these

alternative rules will likely overstate the net gains in integration attributable to the Constitution.

      How congressional consent would work was not discussed at the Constitutional Convention.

Most likely Congress could only review and consent to an actual bill passed by a state

legislature. As such, Congress would have to actively disallow a particular bill passed by a state

legislature to stop its operation. If Congress did not actively disallow the bill but instead

remained silent, that would be consent because, in law, silence is consent. This was the same

procedure followed by the British Board of Trade regarding colonial legislation. The Board had

the right of review and consent which was operationally the right to actively disallow a particular

act passed by a colonial legislature or let it stand by inaction and silence on the matter.

      See Rabushka, Taxation, pp. 482, 510. Jensen, New Nation, pp. 337-42, 423, argues that

states under the Articles of Confederation did not construct trade barriers between themselves

due to the threat of retaliation and thus “Reciprocity and equal treatment of all United States

citizens was the rule in the tonnage and tariff acts of the states [pre-1789], not trade barriers.”

State tariff laws passed between 1782 and 1789 did in fact explicitly exempt goods that were

locally grown or manufactured in other states from paying said duties when transported across

state borders, see Cooper, Statutes at Large of South Carolina, v. 5, pp. 8-11; Hill, “First Stages

of the Tariff Policy,” pp. 598-9, 602; Pennsylvania [State of], Statutes at Large of Pennsylvania,

      This may also be a biased high measure of the impact of the Constitution on increasing

market integration among the states in the early national period because unsynchronized real

trade shocks between individual colonies and states that might directly disrupt market integrating
                                                                                                      59



arbitrage would appear to have been greater during the late colonial era (1748-1775) than during

the early national era (1796-1811). The disruptions to cross-colony trade caused by the Seven

Years’ War, and the commercial protests against the Stamp Act, the Townsend Duties, the 1769

importation boycotts, the Boston Massacre, the Tea Act, and the closing of Boston harbor, make

the period from 1796 to 1811 look comparatively uneventful in terms of unsynchronized real

shocks to cross-state trade. Real trade shocks during the early national period (1796-1811), e.g.

trade disruptions due to the Napoleonic Wars, treaty changes, Jefferson’s trade embargo, and so

forth, were mostly international events that affected all U.S. states more-or-less equally vis-à-vis

market integration between the states. Based solely on internal real trade shocks, market

integration should have been better in the early national era than in the late colonial era.
 14
       Prices are dominated by monetary factors and money is neutral in the long run. Thus, PPP

should hold in the long run. See Froot and Rogoff, “Perspectives on PPP,” pp. 1650-1.
  15
       The half-life to shocks is an issue of the magnitude of the estimated coefficient in the PPP

regression (a1 in the tables below), whereas whether a unit root can be rejected and so PPP holds

is an issue of the statistical significance or p-value of that coefficient. See Cecchetti, et. al.,

“Price Index Convergence,” p. 1082; Enders, Applied Econometric Time Series, pp. 234-5; Engel

and Rogers, “How Wide is the Border?,” pp. 1113-4; Froot and Rogoff, “Perspectives on PPP,”

pp. 1649-51; Mark, International Macroeconomics, pp. 32-3, 62-5, 170-7; Rogoff, “Purchasing

Power Parity Puzzle,” pp. 647-56; Taylor and Taylor, “Purchasing Power Parity Debate.”
  16
       For example, see North, Economic Growth, pp. 32-5, 57.
  17
       The difference-in-difference design can be explained as follows: Let S1 equal the PPP

actually measured between U.S. states post-Constitution (as say the half-life to shocks in Table 1

below). Let S2 equal the PPP between U.S. states post-Constitution under the next best
                                                                                                    60



alternative Constitution with respect to interstate trade rules. The net contribution of the U.S.

Constitution to national market integration would then be minus [S1 – S2] (“minus” because a

smaller half-life implies better market integration). S2, however, is not measureable. Let S3 equal

the PPP actually measured among the colonies that would become future U.S. states. As argued

above, the institutional structure underlying S2 and S3 are similar and thus S3 can be a proxy for

S2. The net contribution of the Constitution to national market integration thus becomes minus

[S1 – S3]. However, because S1 and S3 are from different time periods [S1 – S3] does not control

for time-varying shocks from outside the system. Thus, a difference-in-difference approach is

needed. Let C1 equal the PPP actually measured among Canadian locations post-U.S.

Constitution, and C3 equal the PPP actually measured among Canadian locations pre-1776.

Minus [C1 – C3] can serve as a control for time varying shocks from outside the system. Thus,

the net contribution of the U.S. Constitution to U.S. national market integration becomes (minus

[S1 – S3] – [C1 – C3]). Such a comparison, however, conflates colonial/state borders and national

borders. Thus, an alternative difference-in-difference comparison needs to be examined, namely

(minus [S1 – C1] – [S3 – C3]), i.e. the difference in the contemporaneous difference in PPP

between Canada and the U.S. post-U.S. Constitution (when British Canada and the U.S. are

separate nations) versus pre-1776 (when all are part of one British Empire). This is the point of

including all four comparisons together in Table 1 below. The last comparison is an alternative

way of measuring the same net contribution of the U.S. Constitution to U.S. national market

integration. The last two comparisons yield the same outcome, namely minus [S1 – S3 – C1 + C3].

      See Tables 1 and 2 below for details on indices construction and data sources. While the

span of time used is relatively short and so the number of yearly observations small, e.g. only 16

years for the post-Constitution period (1796-1811) and at most 28 years for the colonial era
                                                                                                     61



(1748-1775), the number of individual observations of prices and exchange rates aggregated to

get the yearly data is quite large. For example, for Pennsylvania alone this amounts to

approximately 11,088 separate data observations in the 44 years covered (20 commodity prices

and one exchange rate observed every month for 44 years). Many of the monthly observations

are aggregated up from a number of weekly observations as well. As such, the yearly data points

are more precisely estimated than may be supposed at first glance.

      See Bordo and Marcotte, “Purchasing Power Parity.” The transition from colonies to states

was not accompanied by major changes in real productivity shocks—preceding as it were the

industrial revolution—or in real information, transportation, and transaction costs, see Shepherd

and Walton, Shipping, p. 159. As such, the possibility of non-stationary PPP movements via

Balassa-Samuelson productivity shocks affecting the relative tradable to non-tradable

components in the price indices are mitigated, see Mark, International Macroeconomics, pp.

168-70. Cecchetti, et al., “Price Index Convergence,” pp. 1091-3, and Parsley and Wei,

“Convergence,” pp. 1219-20, also show that the distinction between tradable and non-tradable

goods in PPP tests for 20th century U.S. cities is not strong. In addition, the colonial and early

national economies were primarily agriculture. Unexpected non-wartime shocks were more

climatological than technological. Harvest short-falls in one location could be easily made up by

imports from another location. As long as shipping costs and other standard trade barriers were

not too high, PPP should hold relatively easily in such economies compared with modern

economies where shocks were relatively more technologically based—given that technological

transfer is more complex than the shipping of agricultural goods and given that modern goods

are more assembled and processed in a manufactured as opposed to a harvested sense. The year-

to-year or seasonal nature of the agricultural cycle may make the use of yearly data for the
                                                                                                      62



colonial and early national periods more appropriate than the use of yearly data in modern era

studies of PPP, see Taylor, “Potential Pitfalls.”

Louisiana was not one of the original British colonies that became a U.S. state, it came under

American authority after 1802, and price indices for New Orleans exist for 1800-1811 and 1804-

1811 (Cole, Wholesale Commodity Prices, pp. 65-70, 170-1). The 1800-1811 index is based on

few commodities and relies more heavily on price evidence derived from “up-stream” sources

compared with the 1804-1811 index. PPP between New Orleans and all the other U.S. states,

including the subcomponents of the South Carolina price index, as well as for Lower Canada,

including the domestic versus foreign subcomponents of the New Orleans price index, were

estimated for the two separate periods of 1800-1811 and 1804-1811. Given that the data span is
                                                                                                   63



very short, not too much should be expected from these estimates. If the results show that PPP

could not be rejected for New Orleans in reference to the other U.S. states, this would be strong

evidence of market integration within the U.S. under the auspices of the integrating effect of the

U.S. Constitution. If the results show that PPP failure cannot be statistically rejected, then it may

likely be that the result is just an outcome of too short a data span given the low-powered nature

of PPP tests, and so not much can be concluded from this statistical exercise. The results (not

reported) show that either PPP failure cannot be statistically rejected in most cases, or in the few

cases where PPP failure can be rejected the coefficient magnitudes suggest that the process is

highly volatile and unstable. As such, the data span is probably too short to support any

conclusion regarding PPP between New Orleans and the other U.S. states in this period.

“Creating the U.S. Dollar Currency Union,” pp. 1784-6, 1792-5; Grubb, “State ‘Currencies’,” p.

and exchange rate for each separate location alone in order to infer the likely behavior of each

location’s individual monetary management behavior—the focus being on the effect that

adopting Article 1, Section 10, Paragraph 1 into the U.S. Constitution had on individual

monetary behavior per colony/state. This is a different question and use of this data than the

question asked here, which addresses whether these locations were well integrated trade-wise

and whether that level of integration was affected by institutional change in terms of adopting the
                                                                                                     64

      PPP is used here in a two-way comparative approach with each approach having four

possible outcomes. The first approach is to compare PPP across British North American colonies

with PPP across the same locations after they become U.S. states under the U.S. Constitution.

Four outcomes are possible. 1) PPP is not rejected and the half-life to shocks mean-revert faster

across the states after the adoption of the U.S. Constitution, but is rejected and/or the half-life to

shocks mean-revert slower across these same locations when they were colonies. This outcome

can be thought of as the conventional wisdom or what most expect the outcome to be. Such a

finding would be a trivial contribution for it only confirms what scholars claim to already know.

2) PPP is rejected across all or most locations in both periods. In this case, given the short spans

of data and low-powered tests endemic to PPP econometric procedures, the data simply are not

good enough to support any conclusion. 3) PPP is not rejected in either period with the half-life

to shocks mean-reverting at similar rates, or 4) PPP is not rejected and the half-life to shocks

mean-revert faster across colonial locations, but is rejected and/or the half-life to shocks mean-

revert slower across the same locations after the adoption of the U.S. Constitution. The last two

possible outcomes would be revolutionary findings—smashing our conventional wisdom and

opening the door to substantial revision of how we understand the U.S. Constitution as an

institutional change to the national economy. This will be shown to be the case below.

         The second approach comes from the fact that not all British North American colonies

joined the United States. This allows for an alternative perspective on the economic impact of the
                                                                                                   65



U.S. Constitution regarding market integration. This perspective compares PPP between the

British colonies that became U.S. states with that of nearby British colonies that did not become

U.S. states, e.g. Lower Canada (Montreal and Quebec). As measured by PPP, did American

independence and the adoption of the U.S. Constitution reduce market integration with other

nearby markets that chose to stay within the British Empire? Do we see the rise of two

identifiable market zones as measured by PPP—the U.S. states and what remained of the British

Empire in America? In other words, as measured by PPP, do changes to international sovereign

borders matter to market integration in early America?

       As with the first approach above, four outcomes are possible. 1) PPP between Canada

and the other colonies and states is rejected in both periods. In this case, given the short spans of

data and low-powered tests, the data simply are not good enough to support any conclusion. 2)

PPP between Canada and the other colonies and states is not rejected and the half-life to shocks

mean-revert at similar rates in both periods. Such a finding would be revolutionary in that it

would indicate that the U.S. Constitution had no relative impact on market integration and that

international sovereign borders do not matter to PPP here. 3) PPP between Canada and the other

colonies is rejected, but between Canada and the U.S. states is not rejected. Such a finding would

be revolutionary in that it would indicate that the U.S. Constitution produced nothing unique

regarding market integration across the states, even if PPP held better post versus pre-

Constitution across U.S. locations. Such a possible outcome provides a check on the first

approach-first outcome listed above (the difference-in-difference approach, see footnote 16). It

would indicate that this outcome (first approach-first outcome) is not a sufficient condition by

itself to warrant concluding that the U.S. Constitution was the underlying cause for any

subsequent increase in market integration within the U.S. Finally, 4) PPP between Canada and
                                                                                                  66



the other colonies is not rejected, but between Canada and the post-U.S. Constitution states is

rejected. Such a finding would indicate that adopting the U.S. Constitution had an international

sovereign border effect in a mega-border sense—an inside versus outside the British Empire

effect. This last possibility will be shown to be the case below. Since most scholars do not

directly address the inside/outside effect on economic integration of adopting the U.S.

Constitution, this result is an important new contribution to understanding the economic

development of the early Republic.

         Combining the results from the two comparative approaches provides rich insight into

market integration and institutional change at the constitutional divide. What will be shown is

that market integration, as measured by PPP, among the states soon after adopting the U.S.

Constitution was not superior to that before 1776. The constitutional clauses eliminating both

real and monetary trade barriers between states seem irrelevant, of no import or impact compared

with a far looser confederation such as what existed within the British Empire. However, after

1795 a significant gap in market integration, as measured by PPP, does open up between the

states as a group (the United States) and the rest of the British Empire in America, a gap that did

not exist before 1776. The U.S. Constitution affected market integration at the international level

not at the national level. Changing the sovereignty of state borders did not matter (our modern

impressions to the contrary), but changing the sovereignty of international borders—the U.S.

versus British Canada—did.

 33
      The results for the colonial period are consistent with what seems to be the magnitude of

inter-colony trade. While data on the volume of inter-colony trade do not exist, the amount of

registered ship tonnage entering and clearing colonial regional ports by the ships’ origins and

destinations between 1768 and 1772 provides a sense of the extent of direct inter-colony trade,

see Walton, “New Evidence on Colonial Commerce,” p. 366. This measure shows that a

substantial amount of ship tonnage went directly between the colonies—often exceeding that

going directly to and from Britain and Ireland. Shipping time between colonial ports was under

half a year, and ports often published newspapers with local price information which were

carried between ports. While the data are not good enough to formally test for it using PPP

methodology, the same mechanism (threat of retaliatory action) and so perhaps the same

outcome (market integration) may have held for the states under the Articles of Confederation,

see Dougherty, Collective Action, p. 73; note 11 above.
 34
      It is not clearly rejected only for the Maryland-New York pairing. But if one lag of the

dependent variable is added to the specification—which lag in itself is statistically insignificant

at the 0.1 level—a unit root can then be rejected.

      Fear that states, post-Revolution, would enact substantial trade barriers and be embroiled in

interstate trade disputes were central concerns at the 1785 Mount Vernon Conference and the

1786 Annapolis Convention, precursors to the 1787 Constitutional Convention. However, prior

to 1787 no substantive barriers to interstate commerce had developed. Tariffs enacted by states

between 1782 and 1789 explicitly exempted goods that were locally produced in other states.

Federalist rhetoric portrayed the eminent collapse of the Confederation as being due, in part, to

escalating and unmediated trade disputes amongst the states. This rhetoric may have been used,

in part, to win ratification of a new constitution that emasculated state powers. See Dougherty,

Collective Action, pp. 73, 140-6; Farrand, Records, v. 3, pp. 544-5, 559; Holton, Unruly

analysis, Jensen, New Nation, pp. 339-40, 422, reached a similar conclusion and warned that

Federalist “partisan propaganda is not history but is only historical evidence.”

      Between 1782 and 1811 many states had taxes on luxury imported items, such as billiard

tables and fancy carriages for human travel, see note 43. These taxes, however, were property

taxes. They taxed ownership not sale. As such, they only reduced local demand without creating

any further differential between in-state and out-of-state prices of these goods. Only if such

goods, being consumer durables, are measured in terms of implicit rental rates would these

property taxes create a further differential between in-state and out-of-state rental rates and so

show up as inhibiting interstate market integration. Because the price indices used here do not

include such goods and because they are not measured in terms of rental rates, such property

taxes do affect the PPP measures used here. For an example of the return of state excise taxes

later in the 19th century, see Hood, State Laws of New Jersey, p. 437.
 45
      See Sowers, Financial History of New York State, pp. 133, 324-5. From 1804 through at

least 1807 Virginia had a merchant’s tax that required a license “to sell merchandize of foreign

growth or manufacture, by wholesale or retail.” This may have had a similar effect as New

York’s auction duties on inhibiting better interstate market integration. See Shepherd, Statutes at

Large of Virginia, v. 3, pp. 23, 114, 205, 354.

      At the 1787 Constitutional Convention, George Mason near the end of the Convention on

powers, namely that no state shall be restrained from imposing duties for the sole purpose of

executing its inspection laws and defraying the costs thereof. Madison saw this change as

harmless in that it would restrict states only to bona fide duties in his view. The motion was

accepted by an explicit vote of 7 states to 3 states. See Farrand, Records, v. 2, pp. 588-9, 605-7.
