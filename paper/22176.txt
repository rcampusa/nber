                                          ABSTRACT

Technical change, even if it is limited in scope, can have employment, output, price and wage
effects that ripple through the whole economy. This paper uses a flexible and tractable
framework, with heterogeneous workers and technologies, and many tasks/goods, to analyze the
general equilibrium effects of technical change for a limited set of tasks. Output increases and
price falls for tasks that are directly affected. The effects on employment depend on the elasticity
of substitution across tasks/goods. For high elasticities, employment expands to a group of more
skilled workers. Hence for tasks farther up the technology ladder, employment falls, output
declines, and prices and wages rise. For low elasticities, employment at affected tasks contracts
among less skilled workers, as they shift to complementary tasks with unchanged technologies. In
all cases, the output, price and wage changes are damped for more distant tasks, both above and
below the affected group.

  Technical change, even if it is limited in scope, can have employment, output, price
and wage eﬀects that ripple through the whole economy. This paper uses a flexible
and tractable framework, with heterogeneous workers and technologies, and many
tasks/goods, to analyze in detail the general equilibrium eﬀects of technical change
for a limited set of tasks. Technology and human capital are assumed to be comple-
ments in production, so the labor market, which is competitive, produces positively
assortative matching between technologies and skills: tasks/goods with better tech-
nologies are produced by workers with more human capital. But the quantitative
allocation of workers to technologies is endogenous, determined by demands for the
tasks that are produced. Hence technical change for a limited set of tasks can pro-
duce substantial changes in employment, output levels, prices and wages, for tasks
and workers not directly aﬀected.
  Why is a model of this type useful? Wage inequality in the U.S. and elsewhere
has grown markedly over the last three decades, and technical change seems clearly
involved in the trend. Empirical studies have documented two broad patterns. One is
the polarization of labor markets, the growth in both employment and relative wages
at the top and bottom of the job distribution, accompanied by declines in both in the
middle. A second is that increases in between-firm wage inequality account for most
or all of the overall change, with changes in within-firm inequality playing a distinctly
minor role. The canonical model of skill-biased technical change, which features two
types of labor and labor-augmenting technical change for each type, is inadequate to
explain these trends.1

importance of the between-firm component in the U.S. See Acemoglu (2002) and Acemoglu and

                                                 1
  The model here has many tasks/goods, which are combined to produce a single fi-
nal good. Tasks diﬀer in terms of their technology level, so there is a one-dimensional
technology ladder, and workers diﬀer in their human capital, so there is also a one-
dimensional skill ladder. All production functions display constant returns to scale,
and all markets are perfectly competitive, so firms, as such, play no role. A competi-
tive equilibrium consists of an allocation of skill types to tasks, and a supporting set
of prices and wage rates. Complementarity between skill and technology implies that
the equilibrium features positively assortative matching, as in Becker’s (1973) classic
model of partnership formation.
  After an improvement in one technology, aﬀecting a limited set of tasks, labor
is reallocated across all tasks, and all prices and wage rates change. In the model
here, those eﬀects can be sharply characterized analytically and easily computed
numerically.
  The results are intuitively appealing. First, and unsurprisingly, output increases
and price falls for tasks that are directly aﬀected by the technical change. General
equilibrium eﬀects are never strong enough to oﬀset the direct eﬀect of the shock.
  The eﬀects on employment depend on the elasticity of substitution across tasks/goods.
For elasticities that exceed unity, employment at the aﬀected tasks expands to a group
of more skilled workers. Hence employment falls at tasks farther up the technology
ladder, so outputs decline, and prices and wages rise. The eﬀects are stronger for
tasks with technologies closer to the one enjoying the technical change, and damped
for tasks farther up the ladder.
  At the other end, employment at directly aﬀected tasks can expand to less skilled
workers, or it can contract. If it expands, employment falls at tasks farther down the
ladder, so outputs decline, and prices and wages rise. If it contracts, outputs farther
down the ladder increase. In either case the changes are damped for more distant
tasks.


                                           2
  For elasticities of substitution across tasks below unity, these results are mirrored
and reversed. At directly aﬀected tasks, employment contracts among less skilled
workers. Hence employment expands for tasks farther down the ladder, and outputs
rise, with damped changes for more distant tasks. Prices and wages may fall for some
tasks and workers closest to those aﬀected by the technical change.
  At the top end, employment at directly aﬀected tasks can expand or contract.
If it expands, employment falls at tasks farther up the ladder, so outputs decline,
and prices and wages rise. If it contracts, employment and output increase for tasks
farther up the ladder. In either case the changes are damped for more distant tasks.
  In the cases where the sign of the eﬀect is ambiguous, two model features determine
which pattern occurs: the size of the elasticity of substitution across tasks and the
range of skill levels employed at the tasks enjoying the technical change. For elas-
ticities that are not too close to unity and narrow skill ranges, the eﬀects are rather
symmetric up and down the ladder from the tasks aﬀected by the technical change.
For elasticities that are close to unity, the signs are ambiguous, but the magnitude of
the change is likely to be small.
  As noted above, firms play no role in the analysis, and even the word is (mostly)
avoided. Each worker chooses how to use his labor endowment, combining it with
any of the available technologies. The worker’s decision can be viewed as a choice
about an occupation, with his output–called a task or a good–used in production
of the single final good.
  In some contexts the distinction between human capital and technology is blurred.
Here, human capital is an asset that belongs to a single worker, who is the only one
able to employ it in production. Technology is a nonrival input, used by all workers
producing a particular good. Framed in terms of competitive firms, the technology
for producing a particular good is available to all. However, as will be shown below,
the equilibrium can readily be re-interpreted as one with monopolistically competitive


                                          3
firms, and the technology as intangible capital that is the property of the producer.
In either case, the fact that it is a nonrival input distinguishes it from both human
and physical capital.
  The vast literature on vintage capital models suggests that the distinction between
new technologies and new capital is also blurred. If a new technology requires new
investment for its implementation, giving it one label or the other is largely a matter
of taste. Here, physical capital is ignored, so implementing improved technologies
requires no investment.
  The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the related liter-
ature. Section 3 presents the basic model and characterizes the competitive equilib-
rium. It also looks at the eﬀect of eliminating technology diﬀerences, showing how
the wage distribution would change if all tasks had a common technology level.
  The main results are contained in section 4, where the model is used to study the
eﬀect of technical change for one set of tasks. In particular, we ask how the labor
allocation, output and price levels, and wage rates change, for all tasks and workers.
A suﬃcient condition is provided for the conclusion that “a rising tide lifts all boats,”
that the improvement raises wages for all workers, even those paired with technologies
that are unaﬀected.
  Section 5 looks at a multi-sector version of the model. Here, tasks in each sector
are used as inputs in producing a sector aggregate, and these sector aggregates are in
turn used to produce final goods. The goals here are twofold. First, an assumption is
provided under which the equilibrium in the multi-sector model is isomorphic to that
in the simpler model. With this assumption, the conclusions in section 4 carry over
unchanged. This fact is interesting because it allows a more flexible interpretation
of the elasticities across tasks. Without that assumption, the multi-sector model is a
framework to re-visit the “rising tide” question, and the answer is more nuanced. For
example, technological improvement for higher-skill producers in a basically low-tech


                                           4
sector can reduce wages for the low-skill workers employed there.
  Section 6 contains simulations that highlight some of the results, and section 7
concludes. Mathematical arguments and proofs are gathered in the Appendix.

                          2. RELATED LITERATURE

  The model here is related to three literatures. One is the extensive theoretical
literature on skill-biased technical change. A second is the literature that studies the
role of search frictions in settings with heterogeneous firms and workers. The third is
the literature examining recent trends in wage inequality in the U.S. and elsewhere.
  The first models of skill-biased technical change had two types of workers, perform-
ing distinct and imperfectly substitutable tasks, with separate technology shocks for
each type. Acemoglu (2002) provides an elegant treatment of this model, and studies
its ability to account for the major trends in employment, wages, and skill premia
in the U.S. Acemoglu and Autor (2016), who call it the ‘canonical’ model, provide a
complementary treatment.
  Subsequent contributions to this literature add physical capital as a third factor of
production, and use the strong decline in capital (equipment) prices observed in the
data as the technology shock. These models posit an aggregate production function
that displays capital-skill complementarity, and the falling price of capital induces
persistent capital deepening. Thus, even with realistic growth in the share of high-
skill workers in the labor force, the skill premium increases. Papers in this group
include Krusell, et. al (2000) and Autor and Dorn (2013).
  A third strand looks at models where technical change can produce ex post hetero-
geneity among ex ante identical workers, because of the opportunities for investment
in human capital or learning-by-doing that the new technologies oﬀer. Examples here
include Jovanovic (1998), Caselli (1999), and Violante (2002).
  A fourth strand consists of models with heterogeneity in jobs as well as in labor.

                                           5
Sattinger (1975) is the earliest in this group. Kurtzon (2015) analyzes a model in
which jobs are distinguished by entry (skill acquisition) costs, and workers with higher
ability have a comparative advantage in learning more complex tasks. The model is
used to study the eﬀects of immigration on the slope of the wage function.
  The model here is closest to the one in Costinot and Vogel (2010), of which it is
a special case. Their production function is assumed to be supermodular in its two
inputs, while here a CES structure with a low substitution elasticity used. The addi-
tional structure is important because it allows a much more complete characterization
of the eﬀects of technology shifts. While the more general setup delivers straightfor-
ward results about the slope of the labor allocation and wage functions, and hence
about inequality, it is diﬃcult to obtain results about levels: who wins and who loses
in absolute terms, as well as the eﬀects on output levels and prices.
  The model here is also related to those used to study the role of search frictions
in labor markets with heterogeneous firms and workers. Examples include Sattinger
(1995), Mortensen and Pissarides (1999), Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002), Menzio and
Shi (2011), and Lise and Robin (2013).
  The model here is closest to those in Bagger and Lentz (2015) and Lise, Meghir, and
Robin (2016). Both use frameworks with heterogeneous workers and technologies, and
a CES production function to combine the two inputs. Relative to those models, the
one here drops search frictions, but endogenizes the prices of outputs across worker-
technology pairs. Here there is a downward sloping demand curve for each task,
and its position depends on final good production. This fact produces interactions
between the wages of diﬀerent workers employed at the same task and at diﬀerent
tasks. Closing the model in this way provides a micro-foundation for the match
surplus function, a function that frictional search models take as exogenous. As a
consequence, the model here produces a non-degenerate distribution of workers across
technologies/tasks, even in the absence of search frictions. Thus, it oﬀers a richer


                                           6
framework for asking how important frictions are in generating wage diﬀerentials
across workers.
  Finally, the model is related to work documenting two broad patterns in the recent
increase in wage inequality. One pattern looks at wages across occupations, the other
at wages across firms.
  Autor and Dorn (2013) document what they call the polarization of the U.S. labor
market. They rank occupations according their mean wage in 1980, and examine
subsequent changes in employment and wages. Over the period 1980-2005, there was
rapid employment growth at the top and bottom of the distribution, a large decline in
the second quartile, and a small increase in third. At the same time, there was rapid
wage growth at the top, substantial wage growth at the bottom, and slow growth in
the middle. Their paper oﬀers an explanation for the shift from jobs in the middle
towards those at the bottom, but has little to say about growth at the top. The
model here oﬀers a potential explanation.
  Other studies look at wage patterns across firms, in the U.S. and elsewhere. They
find that the increase in between-firm wage inequality accounts for most or all of the
change, with changes in within-firm inequality playing a distinctly minor role. For the
U.S. over the period 1982-2012, across the whole economy, Song, et al. (2015) find that
the between-firm component accounts for virtually all of the increase, while within-
firm inequality is almost unchanged. In addition, they report that this conclusion
is robust across industries, geographic regions, and firm size groups. Looking at
U.K. data for a broad set of firms over the period 1984-2001, Faggio, Salvanes, and
Van Reenen (2007) report a similar conclusion: virtually all of the increase in wage
dispersion is between-firm rather than within-firm, and the vast majority of it is
within industries. Helpman, et al. (2012) find the same pattern in the manufacturing
sector in Brazil over the period 1986-98.
  Two more studies find patterns that are similar, if more muted. For West Germany


                                            7
over the period 1985-2009, Card, Heining, and Kline (2012) find that an increase
in the variation in wage premia across establishments explains about a quarter of
the overall increase in wage inequality, with the rest coming from increases in labor
heterogeneity and more strongly assortative matching. And for the Swedish man-
ufacturing sector over the period 2001-2007, Akerman, et al. (2013) find that the
between-firm component, while much smaller, does display a modest increase, while
Häkanson, Lindqvist, and Vlachos (2015) find an increase in complementarities and
more assortative matching.
  In addition, several studies suggest that the increase in between-firm wage inequal-
ity is related to increased inequality in productivity. One of these includes a broad set
of industries: for the U.K., Faggio, Salvanes, and Van Reenen (2007) find a substantial
increase in the dispersion in labor productivity across firms. Other studies find simi-
lar patterns for more limited groups of firms or for specific technologies. For the U.S.
manufacturing sector over the period 1975-92, Dunne, et al. (2004) find that wage
and productivity dispersion increased, and that much of this increase was between
plants. They also find that much of the between-plant change is within industries,
and that a significant fraction is related to investment in computer equipment. For
Norway, Akerman, Gaarder and Mogstad (2015) study a broadband internet rollout.
Using geographic variation in the timing of the rollout, they find that better internet
access improved the productivity and labor outcomes of skilled workers, and had the
reverse eﬀect on the unskilled.
  Taken together, these studies suggests that technology diﬀerences across firms have
increased over time and have played a major role in increasing in wage inequality.

  In this section the technologies for final goods and tasks are described, and the
competitive equilibrium is characterized.

A. Final good technology

  The final good is produced by competitive firms using tasks/diﬀerentiated goods
as inputs. A task is characterized by its technology level   0 There are  such
levels, indexed by  = 1   ordered so 0  1  2      Let  be the share
of tasks with technology level   The total number (mass) of tasks is normalized to
unity.
  All inputs enter symmetrically into final good production, but demands for them
diﬀer if their prices diﬀer. In equilibrium, price  is the same for all tasks with tech-
nology level  . Hence demand is the same for such tasks. Let  denote the (common)
quantity for those tasks. The final good is produced with the CRS technology

                                       =1

where   0 is the substitution elasticity. For  = 1 the technology is Cobb-Douglas.
  The final goods sector takes the prices  as given. As usual, input demands are

and the price of the final good is

                                         =1

We will take the final good as numeraire throughout, indexing prices so  = 1 Input
costs exhaust revenue, so there are no profits.
  The analysis could be extended to include weights on tasks. Let { }=1 be a set of
values for the weights, and let  be the share of tasks with the (technology, weight)
pair (   )  Then output of the final good is
                                Ã                        !(−1)

                                  =1 =1


                                                9
where e is the input of a task with characteristics (   )  It is straightforward to
show that in this setting prices  do not depend on  and demand for each task is

                                  e =           all  

where {   }=1 and the aggregates    are as above, and

                                       X
                                       

                                       =1

Output and employment vary with  across tasks with the same technology   but
the wage structure in the economy depends only on the  ’s.

B. Diﬀerentiated good technology

  Tasks/diﬀerentiated goods are produced using heterogeneous labor, characterized
by its skill level  as the only inputs. Assume that  has a continuous distribution.
Let () with density () on  ≡ (min  max )  with 0  min  max ≤ ∞ denote
the distribution of skill across workers. The total size (mass) of the workforce is
normalized to unity, and labor supply is inelastic: each worker supplies one unit.
  The total output of a task depends on the size and quality of the workforce pro-
ducing it, as well as its technology level  . In particular, if a task with technology 
employs workers of various human capital levels, with  () ≥ 0 denoting the number
(density) of each type, then total output is
                               Z
                           =  ()(  )                   all 

where ( ) is the CES function
                    £                             ¤(−1)
           ( ) ≡ (−1) + (1 − ) (−1)                             ∈ (0 1)    (4)

The elasticity of substitution  between technology and human capital is assumed to
be less than unity, and  is the relative weight on human capital.

                                               10
C. Equilibrium

  An equilibrium consists of a final output level   output levels and prices {   }=1
for all types of tasks/diﬀerentiated goods, a wage function ()  ∈  and an
allocation of labor across technologies, that satisfy the usual optimization and market
clearing conditions.
  The model allows two interpretations about market structure. One is that each
task is produced by competitive firms, with each firm choosing to employ skill types
that minimize unit cost. In this case competition insures that each worker is paid his
marginal revenue product.2 Alternatively, one can suppose that workers simply choose
which task to produce, with each worker choosing a task–a job–that maximizes
his income. In either interpretation, task prices are taken as given by the decision
maker–the firm or the worker.
  In principle, the allocation of labor could be quite complicated, with any technology
level  employing workers with skill  in various disjoint intervals, and with workers
of a given human capital level  producing goods with diﬀerent technologies  . This
does not occur in equilibrium, and it is straightforward to see why not.
  Since labor markets are competitive, the allocation of labor across technologies
is eﬃcient. And since the elasticity of the CES function  is less than unity, it is
log supermodular. Hence eﬃciency requires positively assortative matching: workers
with higher skill  work with higher technologies  (Costinot, 2009). Consequently
the equilibrium labor allocation is characterized by thresholds min = 0  1   
−1   = max  where technology  employs workers with skill  ∈ (−1   )  We
will refer to the interval (−1   ) as skill bin  An individual with human capital  =
   2
       If   1 profit-making firms could be introduced by assuming that each task/diﬀerentiated
good is supplied by a unique producer. Under this assumption, the allocation of labor, output of
each task, and prices would be unchanged, but wages would reduced by the factor ( − 1)  with
the residual revenue going to profits.


                                                11
 is indiﬀerent between working with technologies  and +1  Since the distribution
function  is continuous, the set of such workers has measure zero, and they can be
allocated to either bin.
  Equilibrium also requires market clearing for goods and labor. Thus, the equilib-
rium conditions are:
  a. income maximization by all types of labor,

               () ≥  (  )       all  w/ eq. if  ∈ [−1   ]       all ;     (5)

  b. market clearing for tasks: {   }=1 satisfy (2), with  as in (1);
  c. labor market clearing,
                        Z 
                                     (  )() =          all                    (6)
                              −1

The first condition implies that each task is priced at unit cost, and the last says
that the total productive capacity of labor with skill  ∈ (−1   ) is suﬃcient for
production of tasks with technology  .
  The allocation of labor within any skill bin (−1   ) across tasks with technology
 is, to some extent, indeterminate. Equilibrium determines only the output level
 , which is the same across tasks with technology level  . For concreteness we can
suppose that each task is produced by skill types in the interval (−1   ) in proportion
to their representation in the population, but this is not required.3
  To characterize the thresholds { }−1
                                      =1  note that (5) implies

                         0 ()    (  )
                                =                      ∈ (−1   )  all               (7)
                         ()     (  )
Hence the equilibrium wage function is piecewise continuously diﬀerentiable, with
kinks at the points { }−1
                         =1 

   3
       Since  has constant returns to scale, the number of firms producing any task–if firm are
introduced into the narrative–is indeterminate. Only the total (productivity-weighted) labor input
and total output are determined in equilibrium.


                                                  12
  Since workers with skill  are indiﬀerent between working with technologies  and
+1  it follows immediately from (5) and (2) that

                        +1    (   )

Unit cost and price are strictly decreasing in  and output is strictly increasing: goods

Since   1 the ratio (  +1 )(   ) is strictly increasing in   Therefore, since
0 = min is given, for any conjectured 1  the sequence { }=2 defined recursively by
using (10) is increasing in 1  Equilibrium requires  = max  Thus a solution exists
and it is unique.
  Define Ψ to be ‘total productivity’ of labor in the  th skill bin,
                                     Z   

Then use (6) to write output of each type of good as

D. Skill allocation

  To see more clearly how workers and technologies are matched, it is useful to look
at potential wage functions, like those in Neal and Rosen (2000, Figure 3.1). Let
 (  ) denote the wage a worker with skill  would earn producing a task with
technology  
                         (  ) =  (  )   all  all 

Figure 1 displays potential wages as a function of  for  = 4 technology levels.
  For fixed   the potential wage  (  ) is strictly increasing in  so each curve
is upward sloping. As a function of   there are two eﬀects. First, the price 
is decreasing in   so the intercept decreases with   In addition, since  is log
supermodular, higher  implies a steeper slope for  as a function of . Thus, plotted
against  for various  values, the potential wage functions cross. A worker’s actual
wage is the maximum of his potential wages, as in (5). Hence the wage function ()
is defined by the upper envelop of the four curves, and the crossing points along the
upper envelop are the thresholds  that divide the skill range into bins.
  The four small circles show the choices available to a worker with skill   The
potential wage for that worker increases moving from 1 to 2 and from 2 to 3  But
it falls moving from 3 to 4 , so that worker chooses 3 
  In a model with search frictions, these points would represent rungs on a job ladder
for a worker with skill   This worker’s first job might come from an employer of any
type. That firm would pay him his reservation wage, not his marginal revenue prod-
uct, so his initial wage would lie below all of the displayed values. But subsequently,
outside oﬀers from other firms would raise his wage, for two reasons. If the outside
firm was a better match, he would change jobs and receive a wage increase. But even
if the outside firm was an equivalent (or possibly worse) match, his wage might be
bid up by competition. In this case he would not change jobs.


                                             14
E. Homogeneous technologies

  To assess the eﬀect of technology heterogeneity on the wage distribution, we can
compare the solution above with one in an economy with the same distribution of
skill across workers, but a single technology level. To focus on wage inequality, we will
choose the common technology level so that output of the final good is the same in
both economies. Then the total wage bill is also the same, and only the distribution
of wages across workers changes.
  To keep output of the final good  unchanged, output of each task in the homo-
geneous technology (HT) economy must be

                                              =  

To back out the technology level  in the HT economy, note that one competitive
equilibrium allocation is for workers with a pro rata share of all skill levels, to produce
each task. Hence  satisfies
                                            Z
                                   
                                       =       (  )()

  It then follows from (2) and (5) that a worker with human capital  ∈ (−1   ) 
who is in skill bin  if technologies are heterogeneous, gains or loses as
                           ()
                   1 S
                           ()
                                        µ          ¶−1
                        (  )           
                      =                                        ∈ (−1   )      (14)
                         (  )           
There are two forces, pushing in opposite directions.
  With heterogeneous technologies, workers with lower skill are matched with worse
technologies. Hence workers who would be in skill bin  with     become
individually more productive. This eﬀect tends to raise their wages, the first term in
(14). This own-productivity eﬀect, which is reversed for workers in skill bins  with
    tends to compress the wage distribution.

                                                   15
  But task prices also change. With heterogeneous technologies, output  is increas-
ing in  and price  is decreasing. Hence workers who would be in skill bin  with
output     and price     suﬀer a cut in the price of their product, the
second term in (14). Output can rise because the technology improves, because the
average skill of their co-workers rises, because employment rises, or any combination.
This price eﬀect, which is reversed for workers in skill bins  with      tends to
expand the wage distribution.
  The relative strength of the two forces depends on the distributions for technology
and skill. A second-order approximation allows a quantitative assessment. For each
 let  ≡ ( ) − (−1 ) denote the share of the workforce in skill bin , and let
 ∈ (−1   ) denote the skill level that satisfies
                                            
                                      =      (   )    all 
                                            
If all workers in skill bin  have skill   then total output for that bin is unchanged.
For any worker, the wage change from moving to the HT economy is the sum of the
own-productivity and price eﬀects in (14). Thus, for a worker with skill   it is
                      £    ¡        ¢       ¡      ¢¤ 1 £                ¤
         ∆ ln ( ) = ln     − ln     − ln   − ln  
                                                        
  For a certain family of economies, the quadratic approximation to this expression
takes a simple form. Suppose that   1 and that  has a fine grid, with distribution
function  () ≈ ( ) all  where
                                  µ         ¶(−1)
                                        1−
                            = ( − 1)              
                                         
Then in equilibrium4  ≈      ≈ 1 and  ≈  (  1) all  Define

                           ∆ ≡ ln  − ln       all 
                                   1©             £          ¤ª
                            0 ≡ − ln   − ln  (  1) 
                                   

       This solution is exactly correct if  has a continuous distribution. The associated wage function
is () = 0 1−1 .


                                                    16
As shown in the Appendix, the wage change is approximately

                                                1−11− 2
                           ∆ ln ( ) ≈ 0 −          ∆                               (15)
                                                2 2 

For   1 the coeﬃcient on the quadratic term in (15) is negative, and by construction
                                    £           ¤
the total wage bill unchanged, so E ∆ ln ( ) ≈ 0 Hence taking the expectation
in (15) gives 0  0 so the constant term is positive. Thus workers with skill near
the mean enjoy a wage gain, and those that are suﬃciently diﬀerent from the mean
experience losses.

                             4. TECHNICAL CHANGE

  This section looks at the eﬀects of technical change that improves one technology
by a small increment, with all others unchanged. Specifically, it characterizes the
eﬀect on the labor allocation, described by the thresholds { }−1
                                                                =1  on the output

levels and prices {   }=1 for all tasks, and on the wage function ()
  The main forces can be previewed in Figure 1. Suppose technology  gets the
improvement. The direct eﬀect is to increase labor productivity for workers in skill bin
 raising  (·  ) and making it slightly steeper. But the higher labor productivity
increases   which depresses the price  , and tends to raise all other prices,    6= 
These price changes lower  (·  ) partway back toward its original level and raise
all the other curves,  (·  )  6=  The thresholds defining the employment bins
shift, changing employment patterns and wages for all workers.
  The rest of this section analyzes these changes in detail. Throughout we will use
‘hats’ to denote proportionate changes induced by the perturbation, ̂ ≡  −1 
for any variable  All derivations and proofs are in the Appendix.

A. Final output

  Suppose that technical change increases technology  by a small increment   0
with all others unchanged. Note that the change in output of the final good  is a
weighted average of the output changes for tasks,

  Consider first the short run eﬀects, with labor immobile. Recall the definition of
Ψ  all  in (11), and let Ψ̂ be the direct eﬀect of the technology improvement on
total labor productivity in skill bin . Output increases for tasks produced with

The next proposition shows that, to a first-order approximation, the change in the
labor allocation has no impact on output of the final good: the long-run increase is
the same as the short-run increase.

  Proposition 1: In the long run, with labor mobile, the change in output of the
final good is, to a first-order approximation, the same as in the short run, ̂ = ̂ 

This result is not surprising. The potential additional eﬀect in the long run arises
only from the reallocation of labor, changes in the thresholds { }−1
                                                                    =1 defining the skill

bins. Since labor markets are competitive, the baseline allocation of labor maximizes
  Hence to a first order approximation, small changes in those thresholds have no
eﬀect on final output. An increase (decrease) in  raises (lowers) the output of tasks
with technology   but the eﬀect on final output is exactly oﬀset by the decrease
(increase) in the output of tasks with technology +1 

B. Labor allocation

  The changes in the labor allocation do, however, aﬀect task-level outputs and prices,
as well as wages. The rest of this section describes these changes. To determine the
eﬀect on the labor allocation, diﬀerentiate (13) and use (11) to get a system of  − 1
linear equations for the changes in the thresholds,

                                         () = ()                               (21)

where the superscript denotes which technology has been perturbed, and for any 

Since () has at most two non-zero elements–and only one if  = 1 or  =  for
                                                 ()       ()
fixed  the solution to (21) involves only −1    and the columns ·−1 and · 
In particular,

where the first term drops out if  = 1 and the second drops out if  = 
   is the inverse of a tridiagonal matrix, so it has a recursive structure. Lemma 2
shows that it has strictly positive elements, and that successive row elements above
and below the diagonal have ratios that depend only on the row 

  Lemma 2: All elements of  are positive, and the elements in each column ·
satisfy

                             +1 = +1                   ≥                (24)

                             −1 = −1                   ≤ 

where {+1 }−2            −1
             =1 and {−1 }=2 are positive constants.

  Lemma 2 can be used as follows. Fix  and use the first line in (24) to compare
successive rows  +1   ≥  in (21). Similarly, use the second line in (24) to compare
successive rows  − 1   ≤  − 1 concluding that

                              ()              ()
                            +1 = +1                  ≥                      (25)

Thus, all thresholds at and above the th move in the same direction, and all those
at and below the ( − 1)th move in the same direction. It remains to determine the

signs of            and −1  For this we need to characterize the two nonzero elements of
() 

        ii. if   1 then   0 and −1 can have either sign; and

        iii. if   1 then −1  0 and  can have either sign.

The intuition for Lemma 3 is straightforward from (22). The term ̂ (  ) is the
proportionate change in labor productivity for a worker with skill  Since   1,
it is strictly increasing in  The term Ψ̂ is the average value of these changes in
skill bin  If  ≥ 1 then for a worker with skill   at the upper threshold of the
                                                            ()
bin, Ψ̂  ̂ (   ) ≤ ̂ (   ) so                  0 If   1 the sign is ambiguous.
Similarly, if  ≤ 1 then for a worker with skill −1  at the lower threshold of skill bin
                                                            ()
 ̂ (−1   ) ≤ ̂ (−1   )  Ψ̂  so −1  0 If   1 the sign is ambiguous.
  Can anything more be said about the terms with ambiguous signs? The answer
depends, to a large extent, on how the technology levels are chosen/defined. If the
technology grid is fine, then the skill bins are narrow, so −1 is close to   and
  ()             ()
−1 ≈ − . For  = 1 both are close to zero.
          ()             ()
  If −1 and                  are both positive, then it follows immediately from (23) and
Lemma 2 that all thresholds shift upward. But even if one term in (23) is negative,
the sign of the sum can sometimes be determined. Proposition 4 characterize the
                ()        ()
signs of  and −1 to the extent that it is possible.

th shift upward, while those at and below the ( − 1)th can shift either way. For

above the th can shift either way.

C. Task/good output levels

  From (6) and (11), the change in output for a task of type  6=  depends on the
sum of the productivity-weighted employment changes at the two thresholds,

             ()

damped–whatever their sign–for more distant technology types.

D. Prices and wages

  Next consider prices and wages. The price of a task rises or falls as its output change
is less than or greater than the output change for the final good. In particular, from
(18) and Proposition 1,

                            ()     1³           ()

                                    
Proposition 7 describes price changes. For tasks of type  price falls. For types
 6= , price rises if output falls, and the size of the increase is damped for types
more distant from  The sign of the price change is ambiguous if output rises, but
the price changes are nevertheless ordered, even if there is a sign change somewhere
along the chain. Price decreases, if they occur, are clustered among types near 

and some or all of the latter price changes can be negative.

  Next consider wage changes. It follows immediately from (5) that

                                   ()
               ̂() = ̂ + ̂ (  )                   ∈ (−1   ) ;
                                   ()
               ̂() = ̂                                  ∈ (−1   )      6= 

For workers in skill bins  6=  wages change only because the price of their output
changes. Hence the direction and size of the wage change is the same as the price
change, and is equal for all workers in a skill bin. Workers in skill bin  also experience
a direct productivity eﬀect, which is increasing in the worker’s own human capital .
  Proposition 8 describes the one case where a technology improvement necessarily
raises all wages.

  Proposition 8: If   1 then for any  −1  0 implies ̂()  0 all 
                    ()
If  ≤ 1 then −1  0 leaving open the possibility that −1 falls, so wages fall for
skill bin  − 1
                             ()
  More generally, if   0, then workers in skill bins    get wage increases, as
                                                                                            ()
do workers with human capital near the upper threshold of skill bin  If                        0
wages can fall for some workers at the top of skill bin  In this case prices can fall
for some or all tasks of type    so that wages fall for workers in these skill bins.
The wage declines are clustered near skill bin  and are damped for more distant
skill bins. Indeed, wages can rise for workers suﬃciently far up the skill ladder.

  If −1  0 then workers in skill bins    get wage increases, as do workers
                                                                   ()

fall for some workers at the bottom of skill bin  In this case prices fall for some or

wage declines are clustered near skill bin  and are damped for more distant skill
bins. Indeed, wages can rise for workers suﬃciently far down the skill ladder. The
Appendix provides an example where wages decline for some workers.

                          5. MULTI-SECTOR MODEL

  In this section the model is extended to include multiple sectors, each producing an
intermediate that is used in final goods production. There are two goals. The first is
to show that the patterns for wage diﬀerentials and for technology-based changes in
wage inequality in the one-sector model can carry over to a many-sector model. The
second goal is to show that a multi-sector model provides more scope for technological
improvements for a subset of tasks to reduce wages for workers at closely substitutable
tasks that have unchanged technologies.

A. Final good and intermediate technologies

  The final good is produced by competitive firms using sector intermediates as in-
puts, and sector intermediates are produced by competitive firms using tasks/diﬀerentiated
goods as inputs. Both technologies are CES, but the sector technologies have a higher
(common) elasticity of substitution.
  There are  sectors. Output and price for the final good are

In either case, demands for sector intermediates are

  Within each sector, tasks/diﬀerentiated goods are produced, potentially, with any
or all of the technologies levels { }=1  But the number of tasks, and the distribu-
tion of technology levels across them, may diﬀer. Thus, the technologies for sector
intermediates, the demands for tasks, and the prices of sector intermediates are

where  is the share of firms in sector  and { }=1 are the shares for each tech-
nology within the sector. The substitution elasticity  is common across sectors
but  and { }=1 may diﬀer. It will be assumed throughout that    so
tasks/diﬀerentiated goods within a sector are more substitutable than sector inter-
mediates.
  As before, each task has the CES technology ( ) in (4), where  and  are the
same across sectors.

                                                      26
  Notice from (32) that for any task in sector , demand is proportional to    so it
is increasing in both its sector intermediate  and its sector price  . But  and 
are linked through demand by final goods producers, in (30), where  is proportional
    −1                                              1−
to        Hence   is proportional to                 Since    this fact implies that a
change in sector output  has a stronger eﬀect on demand for tasks in that sector
through the price channel than through the direct channel. That is, an increase in 
reduces price  so sharply that demand falls for a task  with unchanged price  

B. Equilibrium

  The conditions for the equilibrium labor allocation and output levels for tasks are
similar to those in the one-sector model. Let   be as before. Assume labor is
mobile across sectors and let () denote the wage function. The labor allocation is
described, as before by thresholds { }=0  that partition the skill distribution into
bins. Workers in skill bin  those with  ∈ (−1   )  work with technology   Since
labor is mobile across sectors, the thresholds do not depend on  and price  does
not vary by sector. The wage function satisfies (5) and (7), as before, and (8) still
holds, and needs no sector subscripts

  The demands for tasks in (32) do vary by sector, however, so output levels can be
written as
                                 =  −

The constants { }=1 act as weights on the sectors.

to equal the sum of demand from all sectors, so (6) becomes

Use (37) and (38) in (34), to find that the thresholds { }−1
                                                            =1 satisfy

                            +1                  

By the same reasoning as for (13), a solution exists and is unique. The thresholds
determine the Ψ ’s, and using (37) and (38) in (35) gives the quantities

                                               Ψ

                                               

Then use (31) to get { }=1  and (29) to get  . For an equilibrium, (36) must
hold. For a computational method, use (36) to calculate updated weights {0 }=1
and iterate.
  Two examples illustrate some of the possibilities.

C. Example: identical technology distributions across sectors

  If the technology distributions are the same in all sectors, then the equilibrium skill
bins are exactly as in the one-sector model. Hence the eﬀects of a technology change
are also the same.
                                                                                P

output of tasks/goods of type  changes in proportion to the change in Ψ  Hence all

D. Example: two sectors, low-tech and high-tech

  At the other extreme, consider an example with two sectors, with very diﬀerent
technology distributions. For clarity, label the sectors  =   Half of the firms are
in each sector,  =  = 12 the upper-level elasticity is  = 1 and the factor
shares are  ∈ (0 1) and  = 1 −  
  There are three technology levels, 1  2  3  In the low-tech sector,  =  the
fraction (1 − ̂) have 1  the fraction ̂ ∈ (0 1) have 2  and none have 3  In the
high-tech sector,  =  all firms have have technology 3  For simplicity the skill
distribution is also discrete, with three levels, 1  2  3  and with total numbers
1 = (1 − ̂) 2 2 = ̂2 3 = 12
  Suppose that in equilibrium all labor with skill  produces with technology   so

  The main idea in this example is that if the elasticity  across sectors is low, and the
weight  on the high-tech sector is large, then the technology shock leads to a large
increase in   so a substantial share of the increase in final output accrues to workers
in the high-tech sector. For tasks in the low-tech sector, there are two eﬀects: the price

                                                31
 falls and output  rises. If the elasticity  is large, the price eﬀect dominates.
For workers who use the improved technology, the direct productivity eﬀect oﬀsets
the sector price change. But for workers using the unchanged technology, the wage
change is dominated by the negative price eﬀect.
  Equilibrium requires that no worker can increase his wage by changing jobs. As
shown in the Appendix, the parameters can be chosen so this requirement is satisfied.

                              6. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES

  This section displays results for a simulated example. The substitution elasticity5
between technology and skill is set at  = 05 Since the results of a technology change
are sensitive to the elasticity of substitution across tasks, four values are used,  = 05
1002 2 and 6.
  It is innocuous to set  = 05, since the input weights can be oﬀset by choice of
the relative means of the technology and skill distributions. In addition, the mean of
one distribution can be normalized in any convenient way.
  As suggested by Zipf’s law for the firm size distribution, the probability vector 
for technology types is a discrete approximation to a Pareto, with a shape parameter
 = 10 The location parameter is min = 1 the maximum value truncates ten
percent of the distribution, and there are  = 50 types. As suggested by the wage
distribution, the distribution of human capital is lognormal. The mean and variance
are unity,  = 2 = 1 and the range is symmetric, truncating about 2.1% of
the distribution in total. There are  = 20 000 values, to mimic a continuous

                   = 05  = 1       = 1  = 05 1002 2 6
                   = 05 min = 1 2 = 1

A. Baseline economies

  Figure 2 displays the results for the baselines economy. The number of technology
types is large enough so that the skill bins are quite narrow, except at the very
low end. Figures 2a and 2b show the average skill and employment levels for each
technology, for the four values of  For the highest  value, labor is concentrated on
the better technologies: employment is strong increasing in  and the average skill
for each  is lower. For the two lowest elasticities, employment is concentrated on
the lower technologies. Figure 2c shows the wage functions for the four values of 
For lower skill levels, the wage is approximately the same for all four elasticities. For
higher skill levels, the wage is higher for higher elasticities. Total output (which is
also the total wage bill) is significantly higher for the higher elasticities.

B. Homogeneous technologies

  Figure 3 displays the eﬀects of eliminating heterogeneity in technologies, with the
common technology  in each case chosen so that final output–and hence the total
wage bill–are unchanged. Recall that the direct technology eﬀect raises (lowers)
individual productivity for workers in the lower (upper) end of the skill distribution.
But the average productivity of co-workers moves in the same direction. In addition,
employment is uniform across all tasks in the HT economy.
  The net eﬀect in all four economies is to depress wages at both ends of the skill
distribution, and to raise wages for those in the middle, as shown in Figure 3. The
loss function is approximately quadratic, as (15) suggests, even though here the dis-


                                            33
tribution functions for skill and technology are very diﬀerent from each other.
  Interestingly, in every case the variance of log wages in the HT economy is slightly
higher than in the baseline economy. This fact suggests that reported values in the
empirical literature, which show positive contributions of technology inequality to
wage inequality, are missing an important element–price eﬀects.

C. A limited technology improvement

  Figure 4 shows the eﬀects of a small improvement for a group of technologies
in the middle of the distribution. There are  = 50 technology types, and types
 = 21  30 are increased by 3%.
  Panel (a) shows the resulting changes in employment. For the elasticities greater
than unity, employment expands at the aﬀected tasks and falls for all others. For
 = 1002 employment is almost unchanged, although it rises (falls) very slightly for
tasks below (above) the aﬀected group. For  = 05 it falls noticeably at the aﬀected
group, and rises very slightly (is unchanged) for tasks below (above) the aﬀected
group.
  Panel (b) shows the output changes. Output always rises for the tasks that are
directly aﬀected, and the size of the increase is larger for the higher elasticities.
Output always falls for tasks higher up the technology ladder, although the changes
are very small for the low elasticities. For the higher elasticities, outputs also fall
for tasks farther down the ladder. For the lower elasticities, there is a very slight
increase.
  Panel (c) shows the wage changes, plotted as a function of the worker’s position
in the skill distribution. In all four economies, wages rise for all workers, although
the changes are small for skill levels below the group that is directly aﬀected. For
the high elasticity,  = 6 the group that is directly aﬀected–and hence is getting a
substantial wage increase–extends much farther down the skill ladder.

7. Conclusion

  The analysis here has focussed on the eﬀects of technology changes, but the frame-
work could also be used to examine other questions, and it could be extended in a
number of ways. For example, it could be used to study the eﬀects of changes in the
skill distribution resulting from a change in immigration policy, or of changes in the
demand structure resulting from a change in trade policy. It could also be used to
revisit the role of labor market frictions in generating unemployment and producing
job ladders, as in Mortensen and Pissarides (1999) and Moscarini and Postel-Vinay
(2015).
  In addition, the multi-sector model in section 5 could be used study more targeted
types of technical change. As illustrated by the examples there, change that hits some
tasks/goods within a single sector may have quite diﬀerent eﬀects from change that
hits uniformly across sectors. The two-sector example suggests that the multi-sector
framework may be useful for studying labor market polarization.
  In the framework here, individuals work in isolation to produce outputs, here called
tasks. But most goods and services, whether for consumption or investment, are not
produced by single individuals. Aggregating tasks into goods requires additional in-
formation about how goods and services are produced, about which tasks are involved.
Tackling this question is important because it connects the job/occupation decisions
of individual workers with the outputs of goods and services measured in so many
data sources. The multi-sector model in section 5 may provide a starting point for
thinking about this issue.
  Defining the boundaries of firms seems even harder, since a firm may produce
only one task or a wide variety of goods. And firms, whether large or small, also
choose which tasks to produce in-house and which to purchase in the marketplace.
Nevertheless, the patterns for recent wage changes suggest rather strongly that firms


                                         35
are important in determining how technical change gets translated into rising wages.
  Wage inequality has displayed large and long-lived shifts over the last century, as
described in Goldin and Margo (1992) and Goldin and Katz (2007), and many of these
shifts are surely due to changes in technology. Large increase in wage inequality lead,
understandably, to calls for policies to deal with it. But to guide policies targeted at
reducing inequality, we need to better understand its sources.

Lemma A1 shows that these constants and certain sums are positive.

  Lemma A1: The constants satisfy   0 all  and   0 all  and in addition

                             −1 +  −2  0            = 2   − 1                  (44)

  Proof of Lemma A1: Use (41) in (42) to find that

                                                     43
Since   0   0 +1  0 all  it follows that

     −1  0 and −1 +  −2  0             =⇒          + +1 −1  0 and   0

Since 1 = 1  0 and
                                  1 + 2 0 = 1 + 2  0

by induction (44) holds. Similarly, use (41) in (43) to find that

           +  +1 =  +1 − +1 (+1 + +1 +2 )               =  − 2  1

so

 +1  0 and +1 + +1 +2  0                 =⇒           +  +1  0 and   0

Since −1 = −1  0 and

                            −1 + −1  = −1 + −1  0

by induction (45) holds. ¥

D. One-sector example with wage declines

  For a one-sector example where the wage falls for some workers, let  = 3 and  = 2
and let the skill distribution be discrete, also with three types. Let      = 1 2 3
be the skill types and the number of workers of each type. The parameters are

              3 = 10 000         2 = 4               1 = 1               02 = 1012 
              3 = 10 000         2 = 4               1 = 095
              3 = 099            2 = 00090          1 = 00010
              3 = 0988912 2 = 0007991 1 = 0003097
               = 022              = 05               = 12

The vast majority of firms have technology 3  and the vast majority of the workforce
has skill 3 = 3  and these levels are much higher than the others. Hence the increase
in technology 2 leaves final output virtually unchanged, and the price change at 1
firms depends almost entirely on their own output change. In the initial equilibrium
all workers with skill 3 are employed at firms with technology 3  and all with skill
2 are matched with technology 2  Workers with skill 1 are divided between firms
with technologies 1 and 2  The increase in 2 reallocates some additional 1 workers

                                                     49
to 1 firms, and 1 falls. Workers with skill 1 take a wage cut equal to decline in 1 .

E. Two-sector example with wage declines

  Equilibrium in the example in section 4.D requires that no worker can increase his
wage by changing jobs, or

                         (   ) ≤   (   )         = 1 2 3

It suﬃces to show that this condition holds for   = 1 2 and for   = 2 3
  Suppose  =   so (   ) =    = 1 2 3 Since  = 1 2 are in the same
sector, 2 1 = (2 1 )−1  Hence for   = 1 2 we need

Let  = 1 2  and write this condition as
