Leverage Restrictions in a Business Cycle Model

                                               ABSTRACT

We modify an otherwise standard medium-sized DSGE model, in order to study the macroeconomic
effects of placing leverage restrictions on financial intermediaries. The financial intermediaries (‘bankers’)
in the model must exert effort in order to earn high returns for their creditors. An agency problem arises
because banker effort is not observable to creditors. The consequence of this agency problem is that
leverage restrictions on banks generate a very substantial welfare gain in steady state. We discuss the
economics of this gain. As a way of testing the model, we explore its implications for the dynamic
effects of shocks.

1         Introduction
We seek to develop a business cycle model with a …nancial sector, which can be used to study
the consequences of policies to restrict the leverage of …nancial institutions (‘banks’).1 Because
we wish the model to be consistent with basic features of business cycle data, we introduce our
banking system into a standard medium sized DSGE model such as Christiano, Eichenbaum
and Evans (2005) (CEE) or Smets and Wouters (2007). Banks in our model operate in perfectly
competitive markets. Our model implies that social welfare is increased by restricting bank
leverage relative to what leverage would be if …nancial markets were unregulated. With less
leverage, banks are better able to use their net worth to insulate creditors in case there are
losses on bank balance sheets. Our model implies that by reducing risk to creditors, agency
problems are mitigated and the e¢ ciency of the banking system is improved. We explore the
economics of our result by studying the model’s steady state. We also display various dynamic
features of the model to assess its empirical plausibility.
        There are two types of motivations for restrictions on banking leverage. One motivates
leverage restrictions as a device to correct an agency problem in the private economy. Another
motivates leverage restrictions as a device to correct a commitment problem in the government.2
In this paper we focus on the former type of rationale for leverage restrictions.
        We posit the existence of an agency problem between banks and their creditors. By bank
creditors we have in mind real-world depositors, holders of debt securities like bonds and
commercial paper, and also holders of bank preferred stock.3 As a result, bank credit in our
    1
      By ‘banks’we mean all …nancial institutions, not just commercial banks.
    2
      For example, Chari and Kehoe (2012) show that a case for leverage restrictions can be built on the
assumptions that (i) bankruptices are ex post ine¢ cient and (ii) governments are unable to commit ex ante
to not bailout failed banks. See also Gertler, Kiyotaki and Queralto (2011) for a discussion. In the general
discussion of Adrian, Colla and Shin (forthcoming), Robert Hall draws attention to the implications for bank
leverage decisions of the expectation of government intervention in a crisis episode.
    3
      Our logic for including bank preferred stock in bank ‘credit’is as follows. In our model, the liability side of
bank balance sheets has only ‘bank debt’and ‘bank net worth’. For the vast majority of banks in our model,
their asset portfolio performs well enough that debt holders receive a high return and bank net worth generally
earns a positive return. In the case of banks in our model whose portfolio of assets performs poorly, net worth
is wiped out and debt holders earn a low return. The reason we think of preferred stock as part of bank debt in
the model is: (i) dividend payments on preferred stock are generally not contingent on the overall performance
of the bank’s assets, unless the performance of the assets is so bad that common stock holders are wiped
out; and (ii) like ordinary debt, holders of preferred stock do not enjoy voting rights. Our model abstracts
from the di¤erences that do exist between the di¤erent components of what we call bank debt. For example,
dividends on preferred stock are paid after interest and principal payments on a bank’s bonds, commercial
paper and deposits. In addition, the tax treatment of preferred stock is di¤erent from the tax treatment of
a bank’s bond and commercial paper. The reason we identify the common stock portion of bank liabilities
with bank net worth in our model is that holders of common stock are residual claimants. As a result, they
are the recipients of increases in bank earnings (magni…ed by leverage) and they su¤er losses when earnings
are low (and, these losses are magni…ed by leverage). Financial …rms are very important in the market for
preferred stock. For example, Standard and Poor’s computes an overall index of the price and yield on preferred
stock. In their index for December 30, 2011, 82 percent of the …rms belong to the …nancial sector (see https://
www.sp-indexdata.com/idp…les/strategy/prc/active/factsheets/fs-sp-us-preferred-stock-index-ltr.pdf).

model is risky. To quantify this risk, we calibrate the model to the premium paid by banks
for funds in the interbank market. This premium is on average about 50 basis points at an
annual rate.4 To simplify the analysis, we assume there is no agency problem on the asset side
of banks’balance sheets. The role of banks in our model is to exert costly e¤ort to identify
good investment projects. The source of the agency problem in our model is our assumption
that bank e¤ort is not observed. Under these circumstances it is well known that competitive
markets do not necessarily generate the e¢ cient allocations. In our analysis, the fact that
banker e¤ort is unobserved has the consequence that restricting the amount of liabilities a
bank may issue raises welfare.
       As in any model with hidden e¤ort, the resulting agency problem is mitigated if the market
provides the agent (i.e., the banker) with the appropriate incentives to exert e¤ort. For this,
it is useful if the interest rate that the banker pays to its creditors is not sensitive to the
performance of the asset side of its balance sheet. In this case, the banker reaps the full reward
of its e¤ort. But, this requires that the banker have su¢ cient net worth on hand to cover the
losses that will occasionally occur even if a high level of e¤ort is expended. The creditors in
low net worth banks which experience bad outcomes on their portfolio necessarily must share
in bank losses. Understanding this in advance, creditors require that low net worth bankers
with well-performing porfolios pay a high interest rate. Under these circumstances, the banker
does not enjoy the full fruits of its e¤ort and so its incentive to exert e¤ort is correspondingly
reduced.
       We analyze the steady state properties of the model and show that a leverage restriction
moves equilibrium consumption and employment in the direction of the e¢ cient allocations
that would occur if e¤ort were observable. In particular, when banks are restricted in how
many liabilities they can issue, then they are more likely to be able to insulate their creditors
from losses on the asset side of their balance sheet. In this way leverage restrictions reduce the
interest rate spread faced by banks and promote their incentive to exert e¤ort. We calibrate
our model’s parameters so that leverage is 20 in the absence of regulation. When a regulation
is imposed that limits leverage to 17, steady state welfare jumps an amount that is equivalent
to a permanent 1.19 percent jump in consumption.5
       After obtaining these results for the steady state of the model, we turn to its dynamic

   4
     We measure the interest rate on the interbank market by the 3 month London interbank o¤er rate (LIBOR).
The interest rate premium is the excess of LIBOR over the 3 month rate on US government Treasury bills.
   5
     In our analysis, we do not factor in the bureaucratic and other reporting costs of leverage restrictions. If we
do so, presumably the steady state welfare bene…t of leverage would be smaller. However, because the bene…ts
reported in this paper are so large, we expect our …nding that welfare increases to be robust.

properties. We display the dynamic response of various variables to four shocks. Of these,
one is a monetary policy shock, two are shocks to bank net worth and fourth is a shock
to the cross-sectional dispersion of technology.6 In each case, a contractionary shock drives
down consumption, investment, output, employment, in‡ation and bank net worth, just as
in actual recessions. In addition, all four shocks raise the cross-sectional dispersion of bank
equity returns. We use Center for Research on Security Prices (CRSP) data to show that
this implication is consistent with the data. The countercyclical nature of various measures
of dispersion has been a subject of great interest since Bloom (2009) drew attention to the
phenomenon. A factor that may be of independent interest is that our paper provides examples
of how this increase in dispersion can occur endogenously. Finally, we show that the shocks in
our model imply that bank leverage is countercyclical. We show that broad-based empirical
measures of leverage are consistent with this implication.
        The paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the circumstances of the
bankers. We then describe the general macroeconomic environment into which we insert the
bank. After that we report our …ndings for leverage and for the dynamic properties of our
model. A last section includes concluding remarks.



2         Banks, Mutual Funds and Entrepreneurs
We begin the discussion in period t; after goods production for that period has occurred.
There is a mass of identical bankers with net worth, Nt : The bankers enter into competitive
and anonymous markets, acquire deposits from mutual funds and lend their net worth and
deposits to entrepreneurs. Mutual funds take deposits from households and make loans to
a diversi…ed set of banks. The assumption that mutual funds stand between households and
banks is made for convenience. Our bankers are risky and if households placed deposits directly
with banks they would choose to diversify across banks. The idea that households diversify
across a large set of banks seemed awkward to us. Instead, we posit that households place their
deposits with mutual funds, and then mutual funds diversify across banks. Another advantage
of our assumption that mutual funds stand between households and banks is that this allows
us to de…ne a risk free rate of interest. However, nothing of substance hinges on the presence
of the mutual funds.
        Each entrepreneur has access to a constant returns to scale investment technology. The
technology requires as input an investment at the end of goods production in period t and
    6
        For the latter we consider a risk shock, as in Christiano, Motto and Rostagno (2012).

produces output during production in t + 1: Entrepreneurs are competitive, earn no rent
and there is no agency problem between entrepreneurs and banks. The bank from which an
entrepreneur receives its loan receives the full rate of return earned by entrepreneurs on their
projects.
       There are ‘good’ and ‘bad’ entrepreneurs. We denote the gross rate of return on their
                        g        b                          g      b
period t investment by Rt+1 and Rt+1 ; respectively, where Rt+1 > Rt+1 in all period t + 1
states of nature. These represent exogenous stochastic processes from the point of view of
entrepreneurs. We discuss the factors that determine these rates of return in the next section.
There, we situate entrepreneurs and bankers in the broader macro economy.
       A key function of banks is to identify good entrepreneurs. To do this, bankers exert a costly
e¤ort. In our baseline model this e¤ort is not observable to the mutual funds that supply the
banks with funds, and this creates an agency problem on the liability side of a bank’s balance
sheet. As a convenient benchmark, we also consider the version of the model in which banker
e¤ort is observable to the mutual fund which supplies the bank with deposits, dt .
       At the end of production in period t each banker takes deposits, dt and make loans in
the amount, Nt + dt ; to entrepreneurs. We capture the idea that banks are risky with the
assumption that a bank can only invest in one entrepreneur.7 The quantities, Nt and dt are
expressed in per capita terms.
       We denote the e¤ort exerted by a banker to …nd a good entrepreneur by et : The banker iden-
ti…es a good entrepreneur with probability pt (et ) and a bad entrepreneur with the complemen-
tary probability. For computational simplicity, we adopt the following simple representation
of the probability function:


                                    p (e) = min 1; a + be ; a; b        0


Because we work with equilibria in which p (e) > 1=2; our model implies that when bankers
exert greater e¤ort, the mean return on their asset increases and its variance decreases.
       Mutual funds are competitive and perfectly diversi…ed across good and bad banks. As a
result of free entry, they enjoy zero pro…ts:

                                          d                      d
                                 p (et ) Rg;t+1 + (1   p (et )) Rb;t+1 = Rt ;                             (1)
   7
    We can describe the relationship between a bank and an entrepreneur in search theoretic terms. Thus,
the bank exerts an e¤ort, et ; to …nd an entrepreneur. Upon exerting this e¤ort a bank meets exactly one
entrepreneur in a period. We imagine that the outside option for both the banker and the entrepreneur at this
point is zero. We suppose that upon meeting, the bank has the option to make a take-it-or-leave-it o¤er to the
entrepreneur. Under these circumstances, the bank will make an o¤er that puts the entrepreneur on its outside
option of zero. In this way, the banker captures all the rent in their relationship.

in each period t + 1 state of nature. Here, Rg;t+1 and Rb;t+1 denote the gross return received
from good and bad banks, respectively. In (1), p (et ) is the fraction of banks with good returns
and 1       p (et ) is the fraction of banks with bad returns.8 The following two subsections discuss
the deposit contracts between banks and mutual funds that emerge in equilibrium. The …rst
discussion reviews the case when mutual funds observe et : The case that we consider empirically
relevant is the one in which the et selected by a bank is not observed by the mutual fund that
provides the bank with deposits. The latter case is considered in the subsequent section. After
that we describe the aggregate law of motion of banker net worth. Finally, we describe the
changes to the environment when there are binding leverage restrictions.


2.1        Deposit Contracts When Banker E¤ort is Observable

A loan contract between a banker and a mutual fund is characterized by four objects,

                                                            d        d
                                                 dt ; et ; Rg;t+1 ; Rb;t+1 :                               (2)


In this section, all four elements of the contract are assumed to be directly veri…able by the
mutual fund. Throughout this paper, we assume that su¢ cient sanctions exist so that veri…able
deviations from a contract never occur.
       The representative mutual fund takes Rt as given. We assume the banker’s only source of
funds for repaying the mutual fund is the earnings on its investment. Regardless of the return
on its asset, the banker must earn enough to pay its obligation to the mutual fund:

                       g                      d                 b                      d
                      Rt+1 (Nt + dt )        Rg;t+1 dt      0; Rt+1 (Nt + dt )        Rb;t+1 dt   0:


Mutual funds are obviously only interested in contracts that are feasible, so the above inequal-
ities represent restrictions on the set of contracts that mutual funds are willing to consider. In
practice, only the second inequality represents a restriction.
       In equilibrium, each bank has access to a menu of contracts, de…ned by the objects in (2)
   8
       We obtain (1) as follows. The period t measure of pro…ts for mutual funds is
                                                      d                      d
                                 Et    t+1   p (et ) Rg;t+1 + (1   p (et )) Rb;t+1   Rt ;

where the product of t+1 and the associated conditional probability is proportional to the state contingent
price of cash. In addition, we assume the only source of funds for mutual funds in period t + 1 is the revenues
from banks, so that mutual funds have the following state-by-state non-negativity constrain:
                                               d                      d
                                      p (et ) Rg;t+1 + (1   p (et )) Rb;t+1    Rt    0:

Equation (1) is implied by the zero pro…t condition and the above non-negativity constraint.

as well as non-negativity of et and dt . The problem of the banker is to select a contract from
this menu.
       A banker’s ex ante reward from a loan contract is:

                       g                   d                              b                      d          1 2
 Et     t+1   p (et ) Rt+1 (Nt + dt )     Rg;t+1 dt + (1        p (et )) Rt+1 (Nt + dt )        Rb;t+1 dt    e ; (4)
                                                                                                            2 t

where e2t =2 is the banker’s utility cost of expending e¤ort and                    t+1   denotes the marginal value
of pro…ts to the household. As part of the terms of the banker’s arrangement with its own
household, the banker is required to seek a contract that maximizes (4).9 Formally, the banker
                                      d           d
maximizes (4) by choice of et ; dt ; Rg;t+1 ; an Rb;t+1 subject to (1) and (3). In Appendix A, we
show that (3) is non-binding and that the following are the optimization conditions:



                                                 0            g         b
                         e : et = Et        t+1 pt   (et+1 ) Rt+1      Rt+1 (Nt + dt )                           (5)
                                                     g                          b
                         d : Et     t+1    pt (et ) Rt+1 + (1        pt (et )) Rt+1       Rt = 0                 (6)
                                              d                                d
                             : Rt = pt (et ) Rg;t+1 + (1            pt (et )) Rb;t+1 :                           (7)


Here, the letter before the colon indicates the variable being di¤erentiated in the Lagrangian
version of the bank’s optimization problem. The object,                       denotes the multiplier on (1). Note
from (5) how the size of the base, Nt + dt ; on which banks make pro…ts a¤ects e¤ort, et : Also,
note from (5) that in setting e¤ort, e; the banker looks only at the sum, Nt + dt ; and not at
how this sum breaks down into the component re‡ecting banker’s own resources, Nt ; and the
component re‡ecting the resources, dt ; supplied by the mutual fund. By committing to care
for dt as if these were the banker’s own funds, the banker is able to obtain better contract
terms from the mutual fund. The banker is able to commit to the level of e¤ort in (5) because
et is observable to the mutual fund.
       The values of the state contingent return on the deposits of banks with good and bad
              d        d
investments, Rg;t+1 ; Rb;t+1 are not uniquely pinned down. These returns are restricted only by
                                                                                    d
(7) and (3). For example, the following scenario is compatible with the equations, Rg;t+1 =
 g      d        b
Rt+1 ; Rb;t+1 = Rt+1 : It may also be possible for the equations to be satis…ed by a non-state
   9
    Throughout the analysis we assume the banker’s household observes all the variables in (4) and that the
household has the means (say, because the household could threaten to withhold the perfect consumption
insurance that it provides) to compel the banker to do what the household requires of it.

requires Nt to be su¢ ciently large.


2.2      Deposit Contracts When Banker E¤ort is Not Observable

We now suppose that the banker’s e¤ort, et ; is not observed by the mutual fund. Thus,
               d        d
whatever dt ; Rg;t+1 ; Rb;t+1 and et is speci…ed in the contract, a banker always chooses et ex
post to maximize (4). The …rst order condition necessary for optimality is:

                                         0               g           b                                d        d
                 e : et = Et        t+1 pt    (et )     Rt+1        Rt+1 (Nt + dt )                  Rg;t+1   Rb;t+1 dt :              (8)

           d        d
Note that Rg;t+1 > Rb;t+1 reduces the banker’s incentive to exert e¤ort. This is because in this
case the banker receives a smaller portion of the marginal increase in expected pro…ts caused by
a marginal increase in e¤ort. The representative mutual fund understands that et will always be
selected according to (8). Since the mutual fund is only interested in contracts that will actually
be implemented, it will only o¤er contracts that satisfy not just (3), but also (8). Thus, we
                                                                                      d        d
assume that the menu of contracts that exists in equilibrium is the set of dt ; et ; Rg;t+1 ; Rb;t+1 ’s
that satisfy (1), (3) and (8). The banker’s problem now is to maximize (4) subject to these
three conditions. In the appendix, we show that the conditions for optimization are:

                                        0            d               d
        e : Et (       t+1   +   t+1 ) pt     (et ) Rg;t+1          Rb;t+1 dt +            t   =0                                      (9)

Here,    t   is the multiplier on (8),                t+1   is the multiplier on (3). The date on a multiplier indicates
the information on which it is contingent. Thus,                               t;    t   and     t   are each contingent on the period
t realization of aggregate shocks. For computational simplicity, we only consider parameter
values such that the cash constraint, (3), is always binding. The …rst three equations in (9)
correspond to …rst order conditions associated with the Lagrangian representation of the banker
problem, with the names corresponding to the variable being di¤erentiated.
   The magnitude of the multiplier,                           t+1     0; is a measure of the ine¢ ciency of the banking
system. If       t+1   is zero, then           t   = 0 is zero by the Rgd condition in (9). Then, combining the e


                                                                        7
equation with the         equation, we see that et is set e¢ ciently, in the sense that it is set according
to (5). When       t+1   > 0 then      t   < 0 and et is below the level indicated by (5).10
       A notable feature of the model concerns its implication for the cross-sectional variance on
the rate of return on bank equity. In period t + 1; the realized rate of return on bank equity
for the p (et ) successful banks and for the 1              p (et ) unsuccessful banks is, respectively,

                            g                      d         b                  d
                           Rt+1 (Nt + dt )        Rg;t+1 dt Rt+1 (Nt + dt )    Rb;t+1 dt
                                                           ;                               :
                                      Nt                               Nt

Given our assumption that the cash constraint is binding for unsuccessful banks, the second
of the above two returns is zero. So, the period t cross-sectional standard deviation, sbt+1 ; and
       b
mean, Et+1 ; of bank equity returns is:11

                                                         g                        d
                                                        Rt+1 (Nt + dt )          Rg;t+1 dt
                         sbt+1 = [p (et ) (1       p (et ))]1=2                                ;                 (10)
                                                                     Nt
                                          g                d
                       b
                                         Rt+1 (Nt + dt ) Rg;t+1 dt
                      Et+1     = p (et )                           :
                                                    Nt

                                                                             b
When et increases, banks become safer in the sense that their Sharpe ratio, Et+1 =sbt+1 ; increases.


2.3       Law of Motion of Aggregate Bank Net Worth

In the next section, we assume that each banker is a member of one of a large number of
identical households. Each household has su¢ ciently many bankers that the law of large
numbers applies. We assume that the bankers in period t all have the same level of net worth,
Nt : We assume in t + 1 they pool their net worth after their period t + 1 returns are realized. In
this way, we avoid the potentially distracting problem of having to model the evolution of the
distribution of banker net worth. After bankers have pooled their net worth in period t + 1; an
exogenous fraction, 1          t+1 ;   of this net worth is transferred to their household. At this point,
the representative household makes an exogenous lump sum transfer, Tt+1 ; to the net worth of
its banker. After pooling and transfers, the worth of a banker in the representative household
in period t + 1 is given by:

                           g                      d                          b                      d
Nt+1 =      t+1   p (et ) Rt+1 (Nt + dt )        Rg;t+1 dt + (1    p (et )) Rt+1 (Nt + dt )        Rb;t+1 dt   +Tt+1 :
                                                                                                                 (11)
  10
     In Appendix A we show that t+1 is positive in any period t + 1 state of nature if, and only if, it is positive
in all period t + 1 states of nature.
  11
     Recall that if a random variable has a binomial distribution and takes on the value xh with probability p
                                                                                               2
and xl with probability 1 p; then the variance of that random variable is p (1 p) xh xl :



                                                            8
We assume that    t+1    and Tt+1 are exogenous shocks, realized in t+1. A rise in Tt+1 is equivalent
to an in‡ux of new equity into the banks. Similarly, a rise in                    t+1   also represents a rise in
equity. Thus, we assume that the in‡ow or out‡ow of equity into the banks is exogenous and
is not subject to the control of the banker. The only control bankers have over their net worth
operates through their contol over deposits and the resulting impact on their earnings.
   In the unobserved e¤ort model, where we assume the cash constraint is always binding in
the bad state, we have:

                                                   g                   d
                         Nt+1 =     t+1 p (et )   Rt+1 (Nt + dt )     Rg;t+1 dt + Tt+1 :                    (12)


The object in square brackets is the realized pro…ts of good banks. It is possible for those to
                                      g      d
make losses on their deposits (i.e., Rt+1 < Rg;t+1 ), however we assume that those pro…ts are
never so negative that they cannot be covered by earnings on net worth.
   When there is no aggregate uncertainty, the d and                  equations (9) imply that the expected
earnings of a bank on deposits is zero. Then,

                                             g                       b
                                   pt (et ) Rt+1 + (1     pt (et )) Rt+1 = Rt :                             (13)


Equation (13) and the       equation in (9) together imply that the law of motion has the following
form:
                                          Nt+1 =      t+1 Rt Nt   + Tt+1 :                                  (14)

When there is aggregate uncertainty, equation (13) holds only in expectation. It does not hold
in terms of realized values.


2.4     Restrictions on Bank Leverage

We now impose an additional constraint on banks, that they must satisfy:

                                                  Nt + dt
                                                               Lt ;                                         (15)
                                                    Nt

where Lt denotes the period t restriction on leverage. The banker problem now is (A.3) with
the additional constraint, Nt Lt          (Nt + dt )         0: Let    t     0 denote the multiplier on that
constraint. It is easy to verify that the equilibrium conditions now are (9) with the zero in the
d equation replaced by       t;   plus the following complementary slackness condition:


                     t   [Nt Lt     (Nt + dt )] = 0;     t     0; Nt Lt      (Nt + dt )    0:

                                                         9
Thus, when the leverage constraint is binding, we use the d equation to de…ne                                 t   and add the
equation
                                                     Nt Lt = (Nt + dt ) :

     Interestingly, since the d equation does not hold any longer with                               t   = 0, the expected
pro…ts of banks in steady state are positive. As a result, (14) does not hold in steady state.
Of course, (11) and (12) both hold. Using the                          equation to simplify (11):

                                              g                             b
               Nt+1 =      t+1      pt (et ) Rt+1 + (1           pt (et )) Rt+1 (Nt + dt )      Rt dt + Tt+1 :           (16)


The modi…ed d equation in the version of the model without aggregate uncertainty is:

                                                      g           d                            b          d
                t   =(   t+1   +   t+1 )    pt (et ) Rt+1        Rg;t+1 + (1        pt (et )) Rt+1       Rb;t+1    :     (17)


Substituting this into (16):

                                                     t
                         Nt+1 =      t+1                         + Rt (Nt + dt )        Rt dt   + Tt+1 ;
                                                 t+1 +     t+1


or
                                                                       t
                          Nt+1 =           t+1   Rt Nt +                         (Nt + dt ) + Tt+1 :
                                                                 t+1   +   t+1

From here we see that banks make pro…ts on deposits when the leverage constraint is binding,
so that    t   > 0:



3      The General Macroeconomic Environment
In this section, we place the …nancial markets of the previous section into an otherwise stan-
dard macro model, along the lines of Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2005) or Smets and
Wouters (2007). The …nancial market has two points of contact with the broader macroeco-
nomic environment. First, the rates of return on entrepreneurial projects are a function of
the rate of return on capital. Second, there is a market clearing condition in which the total
purchases of raw capital by entrepreneurs, Nt + dt ; is equal to the total supply of raw capital
by capital producers. In the following two subsections, we …rst describe goods production and
the problem of households. The second subsection describes the production of capital and its
links to the entrepreneur. Later subsections describe monetary policy and other aspects of the
macro model.



                                                                  10
3.1         Goods Production

Goods are produced according to a Dixit-Stiglitz structure. A representative, competitive …nal
goods producer combines intermediate goods, Yjt ; j 2 [0; 1]; to produce a homogeneous good,
Yt ; using the following technology:

                                          Z    1          1          f

                                   Yt =            Yj;t   f   dj         ; 1        f   < 1:                    (18)
                                           0


The intermediate good is produced by a monopolist using the following technology:
                           8
                           < K (z l )1              zt        if Kj;t (zt lj;t )1       > zt
                               j;t t jt
                  Yj;t   =                                                                     ; 0<   < 1:      (19)
                           : 0                                otherwise

Here, zt follows a determinist time trend. Also, Kj;t denotes the services of capital and lj;t
denotes the quantity of homogeneous labor, respectively, hired by the j th intermediate good
producer. The …xed cost in the production function, (19), is proportional to zt ; which is
discussed below. The variable, zt ; has the property that Yt =zt converges to a constant in
non-stochastic steady state. The monopoly supplier of Yj;t sets its price, Pj;t ; subject to Calvo-
style frictions. Thus, in each period t a randomly-selected fraction of intermediate-goods …rms,
1      p;   can reoptimize their price. The complementary fraction sets its price as follows:


                                                    Pj;t = Pj;t 1 :


Let    t    denote the gross rate of in‡ation, Pt =Pt 1 ; where Pt is the price of Yt : Then,                denotes
the steady state value of in‡ation.
      There exists a technology that can be used to convert homogeneous goods into consumption
                                                                                                                   t
goods, Ct ; one-for-one. Another technology converts a unit of homogenous goods into
investment goods, where            > 1. This parameter allows the model to capture the observed
trend fall in the relative price of investment goods. Because we assume these technologies are
operated by competitive …rms, the equilibrium prices of consumption and investment goods
are Pt and

    Our treatment of the labor market follows Erceg, Henderson and Levin (2000), and parallels
the Dixit-Stiglitz structure of goods production. A representative, competitive labor contractor
aggregates the di¤erentiated labor services, hi;t ; i 2 [0; 1] ; into homogeneous labor, lt ; using
the following production function:

                                        Z     1                        w
                                                            1
                                 lt =             (hi;t )   w   di         ; 1       w:                     (20)
                                          0


The labor contractor sells labor services, lt ; to intermediate good producers for a given nominal
wage rate, Wt : The labor contractor also takes as given the wages of the individual labor types,
Wi;t .
    A representative, identical household supplies each of the di¤erentiated labor types, hi;t ; i 2
[0; 1] ; used by the labor contractors. By assuming that all varieties of labor are contained within
the same household (this is the ‘large family’assumption introduced by Andolfatto (1996) and
Merz (1995)) we avoid confronting di¢ cult - and potentially distracting - distributional issues.
For each labor type, i 2 [0; 1] ; there is a monopoly union that represents workers of that type
belonging to all households. The ith monopoly union sets the wage rate, Wit ; for its members,
subject to Calvo-style frictions. In particular, a randomly selected subset of 1                    w   monopoly
unions set their wage to optimize household utility (see below), while the complementary subset
sets the wage according to:
                                            Wi;t =          z       Wi;t 1 :

Here,    z   denotes the growth rate of zt . The wage rate determines the quantity of labor
demanded by the competitive labor aggregators. Households passively supply the quantity of
labor demanded.


3.2      Households

The representative household is composed of a unit measure of agents. Of these, a fraction %
are workers and the complementary fraction are bankers. Per capita household consumption
is Ct ; which is distributed equally to all household members. Average period utility across all
workers is given by:

The representative household’s utility function is the equally-weighted average across the utility
of all the workers and bankers:

       Bankers behave as described in section 2. They are assumed to do so in exchange for the
perfect consumption insurance received from households. Although the mutual funds from
which bankers obtain deposits do not observe banker e¤ort, et ; we assume that a banker’s own
household observes everything that it does. By instructing the bankers to maximize expected
net worth (taking into account their own costs of exerting e¤ort), the household maximizes
total end-of-period banker net worth.12
       The representative household takes et and labor earnings as given. It chooses Ct and the
quantity of a nominal bond, Bt+1 ; to maximize (22) subject to the budget constraint:
                                                                 Z       1

Here,      t   denotes lump sum transfers of pro…ts from intermediate good …rms and bankers and
taxes. In addition, the household has access to a nominally non-state contingent one-period
  12

   A brief observation about units of measure. We measure the …nancial objects that the banker works with,
Nt and dt in per capita terms. Bankers are a fraction, 1 %; of the population, so that in per banker terms,
bankers work with Nt = (1 %) and dt = (1 %) : We assume the banker values pro…ts net of the utility cost of
its e¤ort as follows:


                        g       Nt + dt        d            dt                                      b            Nt + dt             d            dt
  Et     t+1   p (et ) Rt+1                   Rg;t+1                     + (1             p (et )) Rt+1                             Rb;t+1                 ~e2t :
                                                                                                                                                           %
                                 1 %                    1        %                                                1 %                         1        %

Multiplying this expression by 1           % and using (21), we obtain (4).

3.3    Monetary Policy

We express the monetary authority’s policy rule directly in linearized form:

                                                                         1                    1 p
      Rt   R=        (Rt   1   R) + 1            (   t+1      )+     y     (gy;t       ) +      ";   (24)
                 p                       p
                                                                         4         z
                                                                                             400 t

where "pt is a shock to monetary policy and          p    is a smoothing parameter in the policy rule.
Here, Rt    R is the deviation of the period t net quarterly interest rate, Rt ; from its steady
state. Similarly,    t+1       is the deviation of anticipated quarterly in‡ation from the central
bank’s in‡ation target. The expression, gy;t          z    is quarterly GDP growth, in deviation from
its steady state. Finally, "pt is an iid shock to monetary policy with standard deviation,             p:

Note that the shock is in units of annual percentage points.


3.4    Capital Producers, Entrepreneurial Returns and Market Clear-
       ing Conditions

In this section we explain how entrepreneurial returns are linked to the underlying return on
physical capital. In addition, we discuss the agents that produce capital, the capital producers.
Finally, we present the …nal goods market clearing condition and the market clearing for capital.
   The sole source of funds available to an entrepreneur is the funds, Nt + dt ; received from
its bank after production in period t. An entrepreneur uses these funds to acquire raw capital,
~ t+1 ; and convert it into e¤ective capital units,
K


                                                ~ t+1 = Nt + dt ;
                                         Pk0 ;t K


where Pk0 t is the nominal price of a unit of new, raw capital. This is the market clearing
condition for capital. Good and bad entrepreneurs convert one unit of raw capital into


                                                egt ; ebt ;


units of e¤ective capital, respectively, where gt > bt . Once this conversion is accomplished,
entrepreneurs rent their homogeneous e¤ective capital into the t + 1 capital market. Thus, in



                                                     14
period t + 1 the quantity of e¤ective capital is Kt+1 ; where


                                 Kt+1 = p (et ) egt + (1                     ~ t+1 :
                                                                p (et )) ebt K                                 (25)


Here, et is the level of e¤ort expended by the representative banker in period t: Note that if et
is low in some period, then the e¤ective stock of capital is low in period t + 1: This reduction
has a persistent e¤ect, because - as we shall see below - e¤ective capital is the input into the
production of new raw capital in later periods. This e¤ect of banker e¤ort into the quantity of
e¤ective capital re‡ects their role in allocating capital between good and bad entrepreneurs.
The object in square brackets in (25) resembles the ‘capital destruction shock’ adopted in
the literature, though here it is an endogenous variable. We refer to it as a measure of the
allocative e¢ ciency of the banking system.
       Entrepreneurs rent the services of e¤ective capital in a competitive, period t + 1 capital
                                                                               k
market. The equilibrium nominal rental rate in this market is denoted by Pt+1 rt+1 :13 Entre-
preneurs’ e¤ective capital, Kt+1 ; depreciates at the rate                while it is being used by …rms to
produce output. The nominal price at which entrepreneurs sell used e¤ective capital to capital
producers is denoted Pk;t+1 : The rates of return enjoyed by good and bad entrepreneurs are
given by:


                                       g
                                      Rt+1 = egt Rt+1

                                                                    k
                                                                        ;                                      (26)

where
                                             k      t 1
                                   k        rt+1          Pt+1 + (1     ) Pk;t+1
                                  Rt+1                                             :
                                                             Pk 0 t
       k
Here, Rt+1 is a benchmark return on capital. The actual return enjoyed by entrepreneurs scales
the benchmark according to whether the entrepreneur is good or bad.
       We assume there is a large number of identical capital producers. The representative capital
producer purchases the time t stock of e¤ective capital and time t investment goods, It ; and
produces new, raw capital using the following production function:


                                 ~ t+1 = (1
                                 K                 ) Kt + (1     S (It =It 1 )) It ;                           (27)


where S is an increasing and convex function de…ned below. The number of capital producers
  13                                                                                                     k      t 1
    Here, the real rental rate on capital has been scaled. That actual real rental rate of capital is rt+1          :
The latter is a stationary object, according to the model. In the model, the rental rate of capital falls in steady
state because the capital stock grows at a rate faster than zt due to the trend growth in the productivity of
making investment goods.



                                                          15
is large enough that they behave competitively. However, there is no entry or exit by entrepre-
neurs in order to avoid complications that would otherwise arise due to the presence of lagged
investment in the production function for new capital. The representative capital producer
takes the price of ‘old’e¤ective capital, Pk;t ; as given, as well as the price of new, raw capital,
Pk0 t : If we denote the amount of e¤ective capital that the capital producer purchases in period
t by xt and the amount of raw capital that it sells in period t by yt ; then its objective is to
maximize:

where      t   denotes the multiplier on the household budget constraint and PI;t denotes the price of
investment goods. The multiplier and the prices are denominated in money terms. Substituting
out for yt using the production function, we obtain:

                         X
                         1
          max                  t+j   fPk0 ;t+j [xt+j + (1               S (It+j =It+j 1 )) It+j ]         Pk;t+j xt+j              PI;t+j It+j g
      fxt+j ;It+j g1
                   j=0   j=0


From this expression, we see that the capital producer will set xt = 1 if Pk0 ;t > Pk;t or set
xt = 0 if Pk0 ;t < Pk;t : Since neither of these conditions can hold in equilibrium, we conclude
that
                                                        Pk0 ;t = Pk;t for all t:

Thus, the problem is simply to choose It+j to maximize:


                                 t   fPk0 ;t [(1     S (It =It 1 )) It ]            PI;t It g

The …rst order necessary condition for a maximum is:

Market clearing in the market for old capital requires:


                                                           xt = (1              ) Kt :


      Combining (27) with (25), we have the equilibrium law of motion for capital:


                  Kt+1 = pt (et ) egt + (1              pt (et )) ebt          (1        ) Kt + (1        S (It =It 1 )) It :

Finally, we have the market clearing condition for …nal goods, Yt ; which is:

3.5     Shocks, Adjustment Costs, Resource Constraint

The adjustment cost function on investment is speci…ed as follows:

         It                      1 p 00      It                                        1 p 00      It
  S                    =   exp      S & I;t                 z              + exp          S & I;t              z   2 ;
        It       1               2          It 1                                       2          It 1

where the parameter, S 00 ; controls the curvature of the adjustment cost function. Also, we
specify that Tt and Gt evolve as follows:


                                                     Tt = zt T~t ; Gt = zt g~;


where g~ is a parameter and the additive equity shock, T~t ; obeys the following law of motion:


                                          log T~t =T~ =          T   log T~t 1 =T~           "Tt :


The multiplicative equity shock,                t,   obeys the following law of motion:


                                           log ( t = ) =             log      t 1=          "t :


Our third …nancial shock is a risk shock,                       t;   like the one considered in Christiano, Motto and
Rostagno (2012). In particular, let


                                                        bt = b                 t

                                                        gt = g +               t:



Thus,        t       is a shock to the spread between the return to good banks and the return to bad
banks. We assume
                                                        t   =          t 1   + "t :

The innovations to our three …nancial shocks are iid and

4        Results
We …rst consider the steady state implications of our model for leverage. We then turn to the
dynamic implications.


4.1       Model Parameterization

Our baseline model is the one in which banker e¤ort is not observable and there are no lever-
age restrictions on banks. There are four shock processes, and these are characterized by 7
parameters


                                p   = 0:25;      T   =        = 0:01;      = 0:001

                               T    =      =         = 0:95:


The monetary policy shock is in annualized percentage points. Thus, its standard deviation is
25 basis points. The two other three shocks are in percent terms. Thus, the innovation to the
equity shocks are 1 percent each and the innovation to risk is 0.1 percent. The autocorrelations
are 0.95 in each.
       Apart from the parameters of the shock processes, that model has the 25 parameters
displayed in Table 1. Among these parameters, values for the following eight:


                                           b; g; a; T~; g~; ;    z   ; ;


where chosen to hit the eight calibration targets listed in Table 2.
       The …rst calibration target in Table 2 is based on the evidence in Figure 1. That …gure
reproduces data constructed in Ferreira (2012). Each quarterly observation in the …gure is the
cross-sectional standard deviation of the quarterly rate of return on equity for …nancial …rms
in the CRSP data base. The sample mean of those observations is 0.2, after rounding. The
analog in our model of the volatility measure in Figure 1 is sb in (10). We calibrate the model
so that in steady state, sb = 0:20. The cyclical properties of the volatility data, as well as
HP-…ltered GDP data in Figure 1 are discussed in a later section.
       Our second calibration target in Table 2 is the interest rate spread paid by …nancial …rms.
We associate the interest rate spread in the data with Rgd                   R in our model. Loosely, we
have in mind that Rgd is the interest rate on the face of the loan contract.14 The 60 annual
  14               d
    The return, Rg;t  ‡uctuates with aggregate uncertainty in our model. In this respect, it does not look like
the rate of return on the face of a loan document.

basis point interest rate spread in Table 2 is the sample average of the data on spreads in
Figure 2. That …gure displays quarterly data on the spread on 3 month loans, measured by
the London Interbank O¤er Rate, over the rate on 3-month US government securities. The
data are reported in annual percent terms.
       The third calibration target is leverage, L; which we set to 20: We based this on sample
leverage data reported in CGFS (2009, Graph 3). According to the results reported there, the
leverage of large US investment banks averaged around 25 since 1995 and the leverage of US
commercial banks averaged around 14 over the period.15 Our value, L = 20; is a rough average
of the two.
       For the remaining calibration targets we use the average growth of US per capita GDP and
the average decline in US durable good prices. We set the allocative e¢ ciency of the …nancial
system in steady state to unity. We suspect that this is in the nature of a normalization. Finally,
we set the …xed cost in the production function so that pro…ts of the intermediate good …rms
in steady state are zero. We do not allow entry or exit of these …rms, and the implausibility
of this assumption is perhaps minimized with the zero steady state pro…t assumption.
       The parameters pertaining to the …nancial sector that remain to be determined are b and :
The parameter, b; is important in our analysis. If b is su¢ ciently low, then the unobserved and
observed equilibria are similar and the essential mechanism emphasized in this paper is absent.
With low b, our baseline model inherits the property of the observable e¤ort equilibrium, that
binding leverage reduces social welfare. If b is too high, then the incentive to exert e¤ort is
substantial and there ceases to exist an interior equilibrium with p (e) < 1 in the baseline
model. We balance these two extremes by setting b = 0:3: With b = 0:2; social welfare falls
when leverage is restricted by a very modest amount, to 19:999: The parameter, ; resembles
a similar object in Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist (1999), who assign a value of 0.98 to it.
We found that with such a large value of ; the dynamic response of variables to a monetary
policy shock is very di¤erent from the results based on vector autoregressions (VARs) reported
in CEE. In particular, a jump in the monetary policy shock in (24) drives in‡ation and output
up, rather than down. We are still exploring the economic reasons for this result. However,
we noticed that with      = 0:85; the impulse responses to a monetary policy shock appear more
nearly in line with the results reported in CEE. This is why we chose the value,         = 0:85: We
are investigating what the implications of micro data may be for the value of this parameter.
       The parameters in Panel B were assigned values that are standard in the literature. The
steady state in‡ation rate corresponds roughly to the actual US experience in recent decades.

    The data are base on information about Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch
and Morgan Stanley.


                                                 19
The Calvo sticky price and wage parameters imply that prices and wages on average remain
unchanged for about a year. Similarly, the parameter values in Panel C are also fairly standard.


4.2    The Steady State E¤ects of Leverage

We consider the impact on welfare and other variables of imposing a binding leverage restric-
tion. The results are reported in Table 3. The …rst column of numbers displays the steady
state properties of our baseline model, the unobservable e¤ort model without any leverage
restrictions. In that model, the assets of the …nancial system are 20 times its net worth. The
second column of numbers shows what happens to the steady state of the model when all pa-
rameter are held at their values in Table 1, but a binding leverage restriction of 17 is imposed.
The last two columns of numbers report the same results as in the …rst two columns, but they
apply to the version of our model in which e¤ort is observable. We …rst consider the results
for the unobserved e¤ort version of the model.
   When leverage restrictions are imposed, Table 3 indicates that bank borrowing, d; declines.
A consequence of this is that the interest rate spread on banks falls. To gain intuition into this
result, we can see from the fact that the multiplier, ; on the cash constraint, (3); is positive,
that the cash constraint is binding (for ; see (9)). This means that the creditors of banks
with poorly performing assets must share in the losses, i.e., Rbd is low. However, given the zero
pro…t condition of mutual funds, (13), it follows that Rgd must be high. That is, Rbd < R and
Rgd > R: We can see from (3) that, for given Rb and bank net worth, creditors of ex post bad
banks su¤er fewer losses the smaller are their deposits. This is why the value of Rbd that solves
(3) with equality increases with lower deposits. This in turn implies, via the mutual funds’
zero pro…t condition that Rgd falls towards R as d falls. Thus, deposit rates ‡uctuate less with
the performance of bank portfolios with smaller d: This explains why the interest rate spread
falls from 60 basis points in the baseline model to 21 basis points with the imposition of the
leverage restriction. A closely related result is that   falls with the introduction of the binding
leverage constraint.
   The reduction in the interest rate spread faced by banks helps to improve the e¢ ciency of
the economy by giving banks an incentive to increase e (see (8)). But these e¤ects alone only
go part way in explaining the full impact of imposing a leverage restriction on this economy.
There is also an important general equilibrium, dynamic e¤ect of the leverage restriction that
operates via its impact on banker net worth.
   To understand this general equilibrium e¤ect, we observe that a leverage restriction in e¤ect
allows banks to collude and behave like monopsonists. Deposits are a key input for banks and


                                                20
unregulated competition drives the pro…ts that banks earn on deposits to zero. We can see this
from the d equation in (9). That equation shows that in an unregulated banking system, the
pro…ts earned by issuing deposits are zero in expectation. This zero pro…t condition crucially
depends on banks being able to expand deposits in case they earn positive pro…ts on them.
When a binding leverage restriction is imposed, this competitive mechanism is short-circuited.
The d equation in (9) is replaced by (16), where                                0 is the multiplier on the leverage
constraint in the banker problem. When this multiplier is positive the bankers make positive
pro…ts on deposits. To explain this further, it is useful to focus on a particular decomposition
of the rate of return on equity for banks. This rate of return is:

                  g                        b                 g                 d                       b      d

                                                                                                                            1

                    g                  b

                     g         d                                 b      d          dt
        + p (et )   Rt+1      Rg;t+1     + (1        p (et ))   Rt+1   Rb;t+1
                                                                                   Nt

                                                                          d         d
These three objects are displayed in Table 3, after substituting out for Rg;t+1 an Rb;t+1 using
the mutual fund zero pro…t condition. The d equation in (9) implies that, in steady state,
the object in brackets in the deposit contribution to banks’return on equity is zero.16 So, the
fact that dt =Nt is very large when leverage is 20 has no implication for bank pro…ts. However,
with the imposition of the leverage restriction, the object in square brackets becomes positive
and then the large size of dt =Nt is very important. Indeed, it jumps from 0 to 9.76 (APR)
when the leverage restriction is imposed. This is the primary reason why banks’rate of return
on equity jumps from only 4.59 percent per year in the absence of regulations to a very large
14.96 percent per year when the leverage restriction is imposed. A small additional factor
behind this jump is that the equity portion of bankers’rate of return on equity jumps a little
too. That re‡ects the improvement in the e¢ ciency of the banking system as e rises with the
imposition of the leverage regulation. To see this, recall from (26) that the gross return on
bank assets is given by:


                                                 p (e) Rg + (1         p (e)) Rb                                (29)

                                            =        p (e) eg + (1     p (e)) eb Rk :


From this we see that the gross return on bank assets can rise even if Rk falls a little, if the
 16
      Here, we also use the mutual fund zero pro…t condition.


                                                                 21
allocative e¢ ciency of the banking system improves enough.17
       With the high rate of pro…t it is not surprising that in the new steady state associated
with a leverage restriction, bank net worth is higher. Indeed, it is a substantial 17 percent
higher. This e¤ect on bank net worth mitigates one of the negative consequence of the leverage
restriction. We can see this from (8), which shows that banker e¤ort is not just decreasing
with an increased spread between Rbd an Rgd ; but it is also a function of the total quantity of
assets under management. Thus, the bank pro…ts occasioned by the imposition of leverage
restrictions raise banker net worth and mitigate the negative impact on banker e¢ ciency of a
fall in deposits.
       As a way of summarizing the results in Table 3 for the unobserved e¤ort model of this
section, we examine the impact of leverage on welfare. We suppose that the social welfare
function is given by:
                                                 b                 L                 1 2

                                                                                       e;

where c represents Ct =zt in steady state. Let ul and unl denote the value of this function
in the equilibrium with leverage imposed and not imposed, respectively. Let unl ( ) denote
utility in the equilibrium without leverage in which consumption, cnl ; is replaced by (1 + ) cnl .
We measure the utility improvement from imposing leverage by the value of                           that solves
unl ( ) = ul : That is,

                                                         l   unl
                                                  = eu             1:

In the table we report 100 : Note that the welfare improvement from imposing leverage is a
very substantial 1:19 percent. We suspect that, if anything, this understates the welfare im-
provement somewhat. According to the table, the quantity of capital falls a small amount with
the imposition of the leverage restriction while the e¢ ciency of the banking system improves.
This suggests that during the transition between steady states (which is ignored in our welfare
calculations), investment must be relatively low and consumption correspondingly high.
       We now discuss the last two columns in Table 3. The column headed ‘non-binding’describes
properties of the equilibrium of our model when e¤ort is observable and the model parameters
take on the values in Table 1. The column headed ‘binding’indicates the equilibrium when
leverage is restricted to 17. We do not report interest rate spreads for the observable e¤ort
model because, as indicated above, spreads are not uniquely determined in that model. Com-
paring the results in the last two columns with the results in the …rst two columns allows us to
  17
    The rate of return, Rk ; on capital falls somewhat because the capital labor ratio rises, and this reduces the
rental rate of capital. This is the only input into Rk that changes with the imposition of leverage.

highlight the central role in our analysis played by the assumption that e¤ort is not observable.
The welfare results in the table provide two ways to summarize the results.
       First, note that imposing a leverage restriction on the model when e¤ort is observed implies
a very substantial 2.70 percent drop in welfare.18 Evidently, leverage restrictions are counter-
productive when e¤ort is observable. Second, the results indicate that the lack of observability
of e¤ort implies a substantial reduction in welfare. In the absence of a leverage restriction, the
welfare gain from making e¤ort observable is 6.11 percent.19 When a binding leverage limit of
17 is in place, then the welfare gain from making e¤ort observable is also a substantial 2.03
percent.20
       We now discuss why it is that the observable e¤ort equilibrium is so much better than the
equilibrium in which e¤ort is not observable. We then sum up by pointing out that the bene…ts
of the leverage restriction on the unobserved e¤ort economy explaining what it is about the
leverage restriction that improves welfare.
       Making e¤ort observable results in higher consumption and output, and lower employment.
These additions to utility are partially o¤set by the utility cost of extra e¤ort by bankers. This
extra e¤ort by bankers in the observable e¤ort equilibrium is the key to understanding why
consumption and capital are higher and labor lower, in that equilibrium. To see this, note that
the steady state version of (6), combined with (29), imply:


                                     R = p (e) eg + (1       p (e)) eb Rk :


When e rises with observability of e¤ort, the object in square brackets (the allocative e¢ ciency
of the banking system) increases and, absent a change in Rk ; would cause a rise in R: Imagine
that that rise in R did occur, stimulating more deposits. That would lead to more capital,
thus driving Rk down. In the new steady state, R is the same as it was before e¤ort was made
observable. Thus, across steady states Rk must fall by the same amount that the e¢ ciency
of the banking system rises. The fall in Rk implies a rise in the capital to labor ratio, k=h:
According to Table 3, this rise is accomplished in part by an increase in k and in part by a
decrease in h: The higher steady state capital is sustained by higher intermediation, N + d;
  18
     The simultaneous drop in the capital stock and the absence of any change in the e¢ ciency of the banking
system suggests that when the transition is taken into account, the drop in welfare may be smaller.
  19
     It is not clear how taking into account the transition between steady states would a¤ect this welfare
calculation. In the steady state with observable e¤ort, the quantity of capital is higher but the e¢ ciency of the
banking system is also greater. The impact of the transition on welfare depends on the extent to which the
higher amount of capital re‡ects increased e¢ cience and/or a reduction in consumption during the transition.
  20
     The observations about the impact of the transition on welfare calculations made in the previous footnote
apply here as well.




                                                       23
and this primarily re‡ects a higher level of deposits.21 Imposing the leverage restriction on the
unobserved e¤ort economy moves consumption, employment and e¤ort in the same direction
that making e¤ort observable does. This is why imposing the leverage restriction raises welfare.


4.3       Dynamic Properties of the Model

In this section we consider the dynamic e¤ects of a monetary policy shock and four …nancial
shocks.


4.3.1      Monetary Policy Shock

Figure 3 displays the responses in our baseline model to a 25 basis point shock to monetary
policy. First, consider the standard macroeconomic variables. The shock has a persistent,
hump-shaped and long-lived e¤ect on output, consumption and investment. The maximal
decline of 0.3 and 0.5 percentage points, respectively, in GDP and investment occur after
about two years. In the case of consumption the maximal decline occurs three years after
the shock and the maximal decline is a little over 0.3 percent. In‡ation drops a modest 8
annualized basis points. Unlike the pattern reported in CEE, the response in in‡ation does
not display a hump-shape. However, direct comparison between the results in Figure 3 and
VAR-based estimates of the e¤ects of monetary policy shocks reported in CEE and other places
is not possible. The latter estimates often assume that aggregate measures of economic activity
and prices and wages are predetermined within the quarter to a monetary policy shock. In
our model, this identifying assumption is not satis…ed. One way to see this is to note that
the actual rise in the interest rate is only 15 basis points in the period of the shock. The
fact that the interest rate does not rise the full 25 basis points of the policy shock re‡ects the
immediate negative impact on the interest rate of the fall in output and in‡ation. Still, it seems
like a generally positive feature of the model that the implied impulse responses correspond,
in a rough qualitative sense, to the implications of VAR studies for aggregate variables and
in‡ation.
      Now, consider the impact on …nancial variables. The reduction in output and investment
reduces Rk by two channels: it reduces the rental rate of capital and the value of capital, Pk0 :
Both of these have the e¤ect of reducing bank net worth. The reduction in bank net worth
leads to a tightening of the cash constraint, (3). The result is that the interest rate spread
on banks increases and banker e¤ort declines. That is, p (e) falls 70 basis points. This in
turn is manifest in a rise in the cross-sectional dispersion of bank equity returns. Interestingly,
 21
      In the case with no leverage restriction, the rise in N + d is entirely due to a rise in d:


                                                          24
cross-sectional dispersion in the rate of return on …nancial …rm equity is countercyclical in the
data (see Figure 1). Finally, bank assets, N + d; and bank liabilities, d; both decline.
       The relative size of the decline in N + d and in d is of some interest. To pursue this, it is
useful to focus on a particular decomposition of the percent change in bank leverage. Let             x
denote (x          xs ) =xs ; where xs is a reference value (perhaps its lagged value) of a variable, x:
Then, letting L denote bank leverage, (N + d) =N; we have22


                                       L = (L       1) [ d        (N + d)] :


Using this expression we can infer from Figure 3 that our model implies a rise in leverage in
the wake of a monetary-policy induced contraction. Recent literature suggests this implication
is counterfactual (see Adrian, Colla and Shin (2012)). We suspect that a version of the model
could be constructed in which credit responds more and net worth less, so that leverate is
procyclical.


4.3.2      Financial Shocks

The dynamic responses of the model variables to our three …nancial shocks are displayed
in Figures 4, 5 and 6. A notable feature of these …gures is how similar they are, at least
qualitatively. In each case, consumption, investment, output, in‡ation and the risk free rate all
fall in response to the shock. The interest rate spread rises and the cross-sectional dispersion in
bank equity returns jumps as p (e) falls. Finally, bank assets and liabilities both fall. However,
the former fall by a greater percent, so that leverage is countercyclical in each case. It is
perhaps not surprising that the risk shock has the greatest quantitative impact on p (e) :



5        Conclusion
Bank leverage has received considerable attention in recent years. Several questions have been
raised about leverage:
  22
       Note that
                                                     N        d
                                        (N + d) =        N+      d;
                                                    N +d    N +d
so that
                                              N +d                  d
                                         N=            (N + d)          d:
                                               N                    N
Also,
                                              L=     (N + d)       N:
The formula in the text follows by substituting out for      N from the …rst expression.

     Should bank leverage be restricted, and how should those restrictions be varied over the
     business cycle?

     How should monetary policy react to bank leverage, if at all?

This paper describes an environment that can in principle be used to shed light on these
questions. We have presented some preliminary results by studying the implications for leverage
in steady state. We showed that steady state welfare improves substantially with a binding
welfare restriction. There are several ways to understand the economics of this result. We
pursue one way in this paper. Bigio (2012a) takes an alternative approach, in which he relates
the improvement in welfare to the operation of a pecuniary externality. Either way, leverage
restrictions help to correct a problem in the private economy. For this reason, we think the
model environment is an interesting one for studying the questions listed above.

A       Appendix A: Derivation of Financial Sector Equilib-
        rium Conditions
This appendix derives the equilibrium conditions associated with the …nancial sector. The …rst
subsection considers the conditions associated with the case where banker e¤ort is observable.
We then consider the unobservable e¤ort case.

A.1       Observable E¤ort
The Lagrangian representation of the banker’s problem in the observable e¤ort rerpresentation
of the problem is:
                                          g                          d                                 b                          d
      max Et              t+1   pt (et ) Rt+1 (Nt + dt )            Rg;t+1 dt + (1          pt (et )) Rt+1 (Nt + dt )            Rb;t+1 dt

     2 t
                                    d                                d                                     b                      d
    +Et            t+1    pt (et ) Rg;t+1 dt + (1         pt (et )) Rb;t+1 dt        Rt dt +     t+1      Rt+1 (Nt + dt )        Rb;t+1 dt

where t+1 is the Lagrange multiplier on (1) and t+1 0 is the Lagrange multiplier on (3).
Note that the constraints must be satis…ed in each period t + 1 state of nature, which is
indicated by the fact that the multipliers, t+1 an t+1 ; are contingent upon the realization of
period t + 1 uncertainty. The …rst order conditions associated with the banker problem are:
                                      0             g         b                             d           d

            d : 0 = Et f         t+1   pt (et ) Rt+1          Rg;t+1 + (1            pt (et )) Rt+1         Rb;t+1
                                     d                             d                              b           d

            Rgd : 0 =            t+1 pt   (et ) dt +    t+1 pt   (et ) dt
            Rbd : 0 =      t+1 (1    pt (et )) dt + t+1 (1 pt (et )) dt                          t+1 dt
                          d                          d
              : pt (et ) Rg;t+1 dt + (1 pt (et )) Rb;t+1 dt = Rt dt
                              b                         d                                  b                          d
                :    t+1     Rt+1 (Nt + dt )           Rb;t+1 dt = 0;          t+1     0; Rt+1 (Nt + dt )            Rb;t+1 dt     0;

where “x : ”in the …rst column indicates the …rst order condition with respect to the variable,
x: In the Rgd and Rbd equations, we di¤erentiate state by state. In the results reported above
the density of the state does not appear. This re‡ects our assumption that the density is
strictly positive over all states, so that we can divide through by that density. We make this
assumption throughout. Adding the Rgd and Rbd equations, we obtain:

                                                            t+1   =    t+1    +    t+1 :                                             (A.2)

Substituting (A.2) back into the Rgd equation, we …nd

                                                                    t+1     = 0;

so that the cash constraint is non-binding. Substituting the latter two results back into the
system of equations, they reduce to (5), (6) and (7) in the text. To see this, note that


                                                                        1
 t+1 = t+1 in the e equation results in a simple cancellation that implies (5). Equation (6) is
derived in a similarly simple way. Finally, equation (7) is simply the equation repeated.
    Now suppose we impose a leverage restriction, (15). This only a¤ects the d equation above,
since dt is the only choice variable in the leverage restriction. As a result, our …ndings, t+1 = 0
and t+1 = t+1 are una¤ected. That is, the cash constraint remains non-binding and the e¤ort
equation remains as in (5). The only change implied by a binding leverage constraint is that
the 0 in the d equation is replaced by the multiplier on the leverage constraint.

A.2         Unobservable E¤ort
Given the indicated set of contracts, the Lagrangian representation of the banker’s problem
now is:
                                                                     g                           d                                     b                   d

where t is the Lagrange multiplier on (8). Note that this multiplier is not contingent on the
realization of the period t+1 state of nature since the constraint is on the e¤ort level exerted by
the banker in t: To understand the solution to this problem, consider the …rst order necessary
conditions associated with the banker problem, (A.3):

   We now simplify the d equation. From the                                                -condition, we delete the third term in d

Use (A.2) to substitute out for                        t+1    in the Rgd condition:
                                                                                         0

Substituting out               t   using Rgd -condition,
                                                                                                            0
                                      t+1 pt   (et ) + [      t+1   +    t+1 ] pt(et ) +             t t+1 pt   (et ) = 0
                                                                                                            0
                                                                          t+1 pt (et ) +             t t+1 pt   (et ) = 0                           (A.4)

Note that this equation implies
                                                                              t       0:
This is to be expected. The interpretation of this may be seen from (A.3). The sign of t
suggests that in the absence of the constraint, i.e., if t = 0; then et would be set in a
way that makes et greater than the object on the right of the minus sign in the incentive
constraint. A negative value of t in the Lagrangian penalizes such a setting. But, we know
from our analysis of the observable e¤ort case (the only di¤erence in this case is that the
incentive constraint is absent), that et is greater than the object on the right of the minus sign
in the constraint in (A.3) when that constraint is ignored. But, (A.4) has another notable
implication. Suppose, for simplicity, that from the point of view of t; there are two possible
states of nature in t + 1; 1 and 2. Then,
                                                       1                        1    0
                                                       t+1 pt   (et ) +       t t+1 pt       (et ) = 0
                                                       2                        2    0
                                                       t+1 pt   (et ) +       t t+1 pt       (et ) = 0

We assume that 1t+1 ; 2t+1 ; p0t (et ) ; pt (et ) > 0: Suppose the cash constraint is not binding in
state of nature, 1; so that 1t+1 = 0: In that case, the …rst equation says that t = 0: But,
the second equation then implies 2t+1 = 0 too. Thus, if the cash constraint is not binding
in some state of nature for a particular date, then it must not be binding in the other state
either. If it is binding is one state, 1t+1 > 0; then t > 0 and it is binding in the other state.
Thus, it is either binding in all states at a particular date, or none. This is general. Note from


                                                                                  3
Rgd -condition that
                                                                                        0
                                               t   =         t+1 pt   (et ) = [    t+1 pt   (et )] ;
which implies that there exists no solution such that t+1 = 0 for some states of nature
and t+1 > 0 for others. Intuitively this is because a banker smooths ine¢ ciency caused by
  d        d                                    b
Rg;t+1   Rb;t+1 > 0 state by state. Suppose Rt+1   is very low in one state and it is very high
                                                                             d         d
in another. Then, the cash constraint is binding in the low state so that Rg;t+1     Rb;t+1 > 0.
                                   d
In the high state the banker sets Rb;t+1 high enough so that the cash constraint is binding and
  d         d
Rg;t+1   Rb;t+1                                                            d
                 < 0: By doing this the banker minimizes Et t+1 p0t (et ) Rg;t+1     d
                                                                                   Rb;t+1     0,
which is, loosely speaking, the measure of ine¢ ciency.

                                           Rgd :      t+1 pt   (et ) +              0
                                                                             t t+1 pt   (et ) = 0:

The optimization conditions derived here are summarized in (9).
    To gain intuition into this multiplier, consider the case, t+1 = 0, so that the cash constraint
is not binding and the Rgd condition implies t = 0: Since t+1 + t+1 > 0 the e-condition then
               d         d
implies that Rg;t+1 = Rb;t+1  can be the solution (as long as it does not make the cash constraint
binding). Combining this with the -condition then implies that
                                                        d        d
                                                       Rg;t+1 = Rb;t+1 = Rt                                                                  (A.5)

can be the solution. It then follows from the -condition that:
                                                        0              g            b
                                 et = Et           t+1 pt   (et )     Rt+1         Rt+1 (Nt + dt ) ;                                         (A.6)

so that banker e¤ort level is e¢ cient.
    Now consider the case, t+1 > 0 for all states of nature. Then, the Rgd -condition implies
                                                                      d
 t < 0 and the e-condition, after substituting out t+1 using the the Rg -condition, implies

                                     0            d                  d                                 t
                         Et     t+1 pt     (et ) Rg;t+1             Rb;t+1 dt =                           0         > 0:
                                                                                                       t pt (et )
                                                                                            1          pt (et )

The e-condition then shows that banker e¤ort is suboptimal. By continuity, when t+1 is large
the ine¢ ciency of the banking system is great and when it is small, there ine¢ ciency is smaller.
We think of a ‘crisis time’as one in which t+1 is large.


                                                                        4
    Given our constraints, we suspect that when the cash constraint is always binding, t+1 > 0;
                                       d       d
all state contingent deposit returns Rg;t+1 ; Rb;t+1 ;are pinned down. To see why, consider the
case in which there are two aggregate states possible in period t + 1; given period t: Denote
these by 1 and 2 and suppose they have probability, t and 1 t ; respectively. The equations
are:
                                           d;1                          d;1
                            Rt = pt (et ) Rg;t+1 + (1        pt (et )) Rb;t+1
                                           d;2                          d;2
                            Rt = pt (et ) Rg;t+1 + (1        pt (et )) Rb;t+1

and the    equations are
                                  b;1                   d;1
                                 Rt+1 (Nt + dt )       Rb;t+1 dt = 0
                                  b;2                   d;2
                                 Rt+1 (Nt + dt )       Rb;t+1 dt = 0

Given the time t realization of variables, this represents four equations in four unknowns.
In general, for given Rt ; pt (et ) these variables are pinned down. If there are more states of
nature, then these equations represent restrictions on the deposit returns. Either way, the state
contingency in the returns does not appear to contribute directly to multiplicity of equilibria,
at least when the case constraint is always binding. As a practical matter, we can solve the
model assuming the cash constraint always binds. We can then inspect the multiplier and
verify that it is always positive. If ever it is negative that means that the constraint as an
inequality is in fact not binding.
                                                          d          d
    Consider the issue of the relative magnitude of Rb;+1      and Rg;+1 : We suspect that it will not
                                              d         d
be true across all states of nature that Rb;t+1       Rg;t+1 : Consider a simple example. Suppose
                                        b                                            d
there is an aggregate state where Rt+1 = 0: In that state, it must be that Rb;t+1        = 0 too. In
                                                      d         d
such a state, assuming Rt > 0; it must be that Rg;t+1 > Rb;t+1 : By itself, this spread induces a
substantial ine¢ ciency in the e decision (see the equation). But, the spread a¤ects the choice
of e only by its expected value. If that spread is very large in some state then it does not induce
a large ine¢ ciency if it is su¢ ciently small in another state. We might even imagine that it
                                           d        d
could be negative in another state, Rb;t+1      > Rg;t+1 : In this case, creditors in e¤ect subsidize
bankers that make positive pro…ts and tax the ones that lose. This obviously has a big positive
incentive e¤ect on e: This possibility should not be a problem for our maintained assumption
that the cash constraint is non-binding in the g state. To see this, suppose that it is binding
in the b state:
                                      b                 d
                                    Rt+1  (Nt + dt ) Rb;t+1  dt = 0:
                      g       b
By construction, Rt+1     > Rt+1  in all aggregate states. also, in the scenario we are discussing,
 d         d
Rg;t+1 < Rb;t+1 : Both guarantee that the cash constraint is not binding in the g state.
    An interesting feature of the model is that it implies a non-trivial cross-sectional variance
on the returns of banks. In any given period t + 1 state of nature, the cross section mean of
bank returns on equity is:
                     " g                            #                "                           #
                                           d                             b               d
      m
                       Rt+1 (Nt + d t )  Rg;t+1 d t                    Rt+1 (Nt + dt ) Rb;t+1 dt
     Rt+1 = pt (et )                                  + (1 pt (et ))                               :
                                  Nt                                              Nt

To determine the cross sectional standard deviation of bank equity returns, note that in the
cross section, in any aggregate state, pt (et ) banks each earn
                                      g                    d
                                     Rt+1 (Nt + dt )      Rg;t+1 dt

                                                   5
return on equity. Similarly, 1                 pt (et ) banks earn a return on equity equal to
                                                      b                    d

                                                                                         :

Recall that if a random variable has a binomial distribution and takes on the value xh with
probability p and xl with probability 1 p; then the variance of that random variable is
                   2
p (1 p) xh xl : So, the period t cross-sectional standard deviation of bank returns is:

taking into account our assumption that the cash constraint is binding for bad banks. Note
that pt (et ) > 1=2 then the cross sectional standard deviation is decreasing in et :


B       Appendix B: Scaling and Miscellaneous Variables
To solve our model, we require that the variables be stationary. To this end, we adopt a
particular scaling of the variables. Because our model satis…es su¢ cient conditions for bal-
anced growth, when the equilibrium conditions of the model are written in terms of the scaled
variables, only the growth rates and not the levels of the stationary shocks appear. In this
appendix we describe the scaling of the model that is adopted. In addition, we describe the
mapping from the variables in the scaled model to the variables measured in the data.

C.3     Capital Utilization, Marginal Cost, Return on Capital, Invest-

The …rst order necessary condition associated with the capital utilization decision is:
                                                           1
                                                               t
                                                                   a0 (ut ) = r~tk ;

or,
                                                  a0 (ut ) =              t k
                                                                           r~t      = rtk ;
after scaling. Making use of our assumed utilization cost function, this reduces to:

                                         (9) rtk = rk exp (                     a   [ut           1]) ;

where
                                                      rk
                                      a (ut ) =                [exp(        a   [ut        1])          1] :
                                                       a

Also, rk denotes the steady state value of rtk : The above restriction on the a (ut ) function
implies that u = 1 in a steady state. As a result, the steady state is independent of the capital
adjustment costs.
   Marginal cost is given by:
                                                                                                           w    !1

where k;t and l;t denote the fraction of the capital services and labor bills, respectively,
that must be …nanced in advance. Combining the last two equations, we obtain the familiar
expression for marginal cost:

It’s important not to confuse yt and Yt : The former is scaled GDP while the latter is unscaled
gross output. Scaled gross output and scaled GDP are the same in steady state but di¤erent
in the dynamics because ut is potentially di¤erent from unity then.

C.4     Conditions Pertaining to Financial Frictions

unobserved e¤ort. Consider the following scaling:

or,

                                                                                                   Rb;t+1 d~t +     t   = 0:
                                                        z ;t+1 t+1

Now consider the d equation:
                                                            1               g                                    b
            d : 0 = Et (     z;t+1      +     z;t+1 )             pt (et ) Rt+1 + (1                  pt (et )) Rt+1          Rt
                                                        zt+1 Pt+1

Multiply this equation by zt Pt to obtain:
                                                                1                   g                             b
           d : 0 = Et (     z;t+1   +       z;t+1 )                       pt (et ) Rt+1 + (1           pt (et )) Rt+1          Rt
                                                        z ;t+1 t+1


In the case of the Rgd equation, we can simply multiply by zt+1 Pt+1 :

                                        Rgd :      z;t+1 pt     (et ) +               0
                                                                             t z;t+1 pt   (et ) = 0:

Equation     requires no adjustment:
                                                         d                                      d
                                        : Rt = pt (et ) Rg;t+1 + (1                  pt (et )) Rb;t+1

Next, consider equation             :
                                    1                       h                                                                            i

We also require equations to de…ne the returns of good and bad entrepreneurs:
                                                               g

Finally, we have the market clearing condition for capital:

If we multiply both sides of this expression by pt (et ) egt + (1                                          pt (et )) ebt ; we obtain:

calibration objects. The interest rate spreads for banks is, using the -equation:

Combining this with (D.20):

We conclude that the cross sectional standard deviation of the return on bank equity is:

   Given k (= h=(h=k)) and z we can compute the …nancial variables:

using the approach in the previous section. In particular, given sdb ; p (e) is determined by
(D.23); given L (D.21) determines eb . The expression (D.24) can be solved for eg : Then, Rbd
can be solved from (D.20); Rgd from (D.22); N~ from (D.18) and d~ from (D.17). Then, a and
e can be solved using (D.25) and (D.26). Finally, z and can be solved using (D.29) and
(D.30). At the end of the calculations we need to verify that

             z   > 0; p (e) > 1=2; c > 0; d~ > 0; N
                                                  ~ > 0; g > b; e > 0; k > 0; Rd > Rd

Some of these tests are nearly redundant. For example, Rgd > Rbd by the calibration (see
(D.22)).

Note that the right hand side of this expression is a function of h alone. We adjust the value

    We use (15) to compute

We also have Rgd from (13):

  Solving for from (10):

Substitute this into (12)

So that we have and z :
   Finally, we solve (9) for w:
                             ~ We adjust p (e) until (2) is satis…ed. Thus, for an arbitrary

D.6     Steady State Algorithm, Observed E¤ort
In the observed e¤ort case, the equilibrium conditions for the …nancial sector do not require
computing Rgd and Rbd and the multipliers, and vz , are both zero. This means that we
can ignore equations (10), (12), (13), (15) in (D.31). Thus, the …nancial sector equilibrium
conditions in nonstochastic steady state are:
