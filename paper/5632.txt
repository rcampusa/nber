                            OBSERVATIONS ON INTERNATIONAL
                              LABOR STANDARDS AND TRADE


                                              ABSTRACT


        This paper reviews the theoretical arguments for and against linking international        labor

standards to trade.   Based on theory alone it is difficult to generalize about the effect of labor

standards   on efficiency   and equity.     Some economists    have argued that international     labor

standards   are merely disguised     protectionism.   An evaluation   of determinants   of support for

legislation that would ban imports to the United States of goods made with child labor provides

little support for the prevailing    political economy view.    In particular,   members   of Congress

representing   districts with relatively many unskilled workers, who are most likely to compete

with child labor, are less likely to support a ban on imports made with child labor.           Another

finding is that the prevalence      of child labor declines sharply with national income.     Last, an

analysis of compulsory schooling laws, which are often suggested as an alternative to prohibiting

child labor, finds a tremendous      amount of noncompliance   in developing nations.

                OBSERVATIONS        ON INTERNATIONAL              WOR      STANDARDS          AND TRADE




         As national      economies        have become          more    integrated,           the issue      of

international         coordination     of labor          standards       has become           more    prominent.

Opponents     of labor     standards        argue    that       international           pressure       on foreign

countries     is an unnecessary            and counterproductive                 interference          in the workings

of the free market.             In this view pressure              for international                 labor    standards

represents     either     disguised        protectionism          or misplaced           compassion.              Proponents

of labor     standards     argue     that a set of minimal                 labor      standards        is necessary           to

promote     fair    competition      and    to facilitate          efficient          operation        of the labor

market.      In industrialized         countries          there    has also been              a growing

undercurrent        of resentment      toward       trade       with     countries       with    low labor          costs,

which     threatens     the viability        of international              trade      agreements.            In the

United     states,     for example,        this    opposition          has been       galvanized        by

presidential        candidate     Pat Buchanan,           but    it also has been              voiced     by several

union     leaders     and liberal     politicians.

         The core      areas    of labor     standards          typically        include       freedom       of

association,        collective     bargaining,           prohibition        of forced          labor,     elimination

of exploitative         child    labor,     and nondiscrimination.                1     The    International          Labor

Organization         (ILO) has been        the main       institution           concerned       with     international

labor     standards     since    its inception           in 1919.         The    ILO establishes             conventions

that    are binding      only    on the countries           that ratify           them.        The    ILO is not

empowered     to enforce        compliance        with    ratified        conventions;          instead,          it relies

on international         pressure,     advice,       and monitoring              to encourage           compliance.

Additionally,         several    bilateral        and multilateral              trade    agreements          cover    labor

and environmental         standards.         For example,           the labor         side     agreements          were   a

critical     element     of the North        American       Free        Trade    Agreement           (NAFTA) .
         The goal     of this paper          is to critically             evaluate     the case       for and

against     international       labor       standards.           The next       section     reviews    theoretical

perspectives       on labor     standards       and discusses             issues    related        to the use of

international        trade    linkages       as a lever          to influence       labor     standards.           My main

conclusion       is that     there    are valid       arguments          on both    sides     of this       debate.

Thus , empirical       evidence       and experience             are necessary        to sort       out the validity

of the case       for and against           international          labor    standards        and determine          the

desirability       of linking        labor    standards          to trade       policy.      The    following

section    provides     evidence       on the political             economy       of child     labor       standards       by

studying       the sources     of support       for legislation             currently        before    the United

States    Congress     that would       ban    importation          of products       made     with    child       labor.

Specifically,        this    section    asks whether             there    is evidence        that    support       for

international        labor    standards       stems    from a desire             to protect        constituents          from

foreign    competition.         Next,       I examine     how the prevalence               of child        labor    varies

across    countries     according       to levels       of economic             development.         Not

surprisingly,       child     employment       rates    decline          sharply    with     income    per    capita.

Last,    I look    at compulsory        schooling        laws,      which       are often     a complementary,             or

alternative,       policy     to banning       child     labor.          This    analysis     finds    a tremendous

amount    of noncompliance           with    minimum     schooling         laws    in developing           countries.




Theoretical       Perspectives        On International             Labor    Standards




A variety       of theoretical        arguments       have       been made       for and against

international        labor    standards.        Some of these             arguments       are very     old;     others

have    been    developed     more    recently.

Efficient,       competitive       markets     and the political              economy       model




          A starting      point    for most     economic          analyses       is the efficient,

competitive       model.        Ehrenberg     1994 provides             a nice    overview     of the

implications          of this model        for international             labor    standards.         In this     model

the total       compensation        (monetary       and nonmonetary)             workers     receive     equals       their

marginal       contribution       to the value        of output.           Each    country’s        economy     operates

at a Pareto       optimal       position    — no government              policy    will     make    a person     better

off without       making     another      person     worse       off.     Wage    differentials         compensate

workers     for the varying         health     risks    and other          disamenities        they     face    on the

job.     Child    laborers       are assumed        to be paid          a wage    commensurate        with     their

contribution          to output    and to rationally              choose    between       working     and pursuing

formal     education      or other     activities.           Labor       standards       in this model         cannot

raise     the welfare       of a nation       as a whole,          although       they    can make      some    workers

better     off at the expense          of other       workers,          consumers,       or employers.

Ehrenberg        (1994) and others          argue    that    the cost       of meeting        standards        is likely

to be borne       by workers,       in the form of lower                 wages    or devalued        currency.            This

model     is clearly      a simplified        view    of the world,          but     it may    capture        some

critical       effects    of introducing        labor       standards.

         Trade    between       nations     is based    on comparative             advantage.         Countries

specialize       in the activities           in which       they have       a comparative           advantage        in

terms    of physical       or human       resources.         The more       different        are nations,        the

more    they    stand    to gain    from     trading    with       each    other.        A reduction      in trade

barriers       will    create    winners     and losers          in each    country,        although     under       fairly

general     conditions       the gain       to the winners          will    exceed       the loss      to the losers

in each     country.        If a common       set of labor          standards        were    imposed     on



                                                             3
countries,        according     to this model           the net gains          from     trade    will    be reduced.

Prices     of goods      produced      by labor-intensive                 technologies     will     rise    if labor

standards        raise    the cost of labor.             Because          developed     countries       tend    to

specialize        in capital-intensive            goods,       this model       predicts        that the welfare                of

consumers        in developed        nations     will    decline          if minimum     labor    standards          are

imposed     worldwide,        although     the welfare             of workers       in labor-intensive

industries        in industrial        nations     may    increase.            (See Brown,       Deardorff          and

Stern     1993    for a theoretical         treatment          of these       and related        issues. )

         Why do some         industrial     countries          seek       to impose     international          labor

standards        in this model?         A widely        held       view    is that     labor    standards       are

pursued     by vested        interests     in these       countries          (labor unions,         employers         in

certain     industries)        to prevent        competition          from developing           countries       based       on

comparative        advantage       (Hansson      1983,    Bhagwati          1994,     and Srinivasan        1994) .         For

example,     if child        labor    is used     extensively             in the textile        industry       in

developing        nations,     then textile        companies          in industrial        nations       would       benefit

from an international              ban on child         labor.        The textile        industry       in industrial

nations     will    have     an incentive        to lobby          for such policies.            Srinivasan          (1994)

argues     that    [Ithe demand       for linkage        between          trading     rights    and observance             of

standards        with    respect     to environment        and labor          would     seem    to arise       largely

from protectionist            motives. ”       I call     this       the prevailing        political        economy

view    of international           labor   standards.




Redistribution




-   efficient       private     market     may    fail    to generate           a distribution          of incomes          or

working     conditions        that    is desired        by the public.              For example,        wages       for the



                                                               4
least    skilled     workers       may be so low as to impoverish                 a large       segment     of the

workforce.         Society     may wish     to redistribute           income     toward    low-income           people.

&y     redistribution         in an economy        that    is operating         at the efficient           frontier

will    entail     some    deadweight      loss,    ruling      out lump-sum        transfers.        For example,

it is often        argued     that    a minimum     wage    reduces      the employment          of some groups

of workers        (causing     deadweight        loss) .    But a minimum         wage    may    still     be

desirable     because       the    total   income    of low-paid         workers       increases    if the

elasticity        of demand       for labor      is less than one.            The desirability           of labor

standards     as a redistributive               tool would      depend     on the society’s         interest           in

redistributing           income    and on the comparative             strengths        and weaknesses           of other

programs     that    could     be used     to redistribute          income.

         The comparative           advantage      of a minimum        wage,     for example,       depends

critically       on the elasticity          of labor       demand-the       lower      the elasticity,           the

smaller     the distortion           created     by a minimum       wage.2       My reading       of the

evidence     for the United           States,     where    most    minimum      wage    workers    are employed

in nontraded        goods     sectors,     is that    employment         would    not be noticeably

affected     by a moderate           increase     in the minimum         wage    from    its current        level

(Card and Krueger           1995).      This     conclusion       may be very       different      in developing

countries,       however.         ti interesting      recent       paper    by Squire      and Suthiwart-

Narueput     (1995) points           out that     the distortionary           effect     of a minimum           wage    and

other    labor     standards       may be diminished           by endogenous        compliance;      when        the

efficiency        loss    is great,      firms    and workers       have    a stronger         incentive        to avoid

the minimum        wage    through     noncompliance        or by moving         to the uncovered           sector.

It is also        important       to compare      the net benefits          of labor      standards        with    the

net    benefits     of feasible        alternative        policies.        Often,      labor    standards        are not

targeted     to the poorest           in society     because       the very poor         are either        not



                                                           5
working     or working           in the informal          sector,       which    does not abide      by labor

standards .

          Much    economics        research        focuses    on the adverse         side     effects     of public

policies,        to the exclusion           of the effectiveness                of the policies      themselves.

But    just because        policy        interventions        may have         negative   side effects         is not       in

itself     reason       to conclude        that     the interventions            are undesirable.          These

unintended        consequences           must    be weighed          against    the intended      consequences.             AI-I

analogy     to medicine           is instructive.            Chemotherapy         is used     to treat     certain

forms     of cancer,       but     chemotherapy          has adverse       side effects.          To treat      these

adverse     side       effects,     doctors       often     prescribe      additional        medications,       that

themselves        may    have     some    adverse     side effects.             Similarly,     multiple       economic

policies       to bring     about        a desired       level       of redistribution        may be more

effective        than    a single        policy.




Market     failure




Some    observers        have    emphasized        market     failures,         especially     in the labor

market,     as a justification              for international             labor    standards.3       Labor

standards        may    improve     efficiency        as well         as equity    if the market        has    failed.

There    are     several    possible        reasons       for market       failures.         Information       in the

labor    market        is often     imperfect       and asymmetric.              For example,      employees       may

lack    adequate        information        about     safety      conditions.        Employers      may have      an

incentive        to conceal        safety       risks,    especially       in casual      labor    markets      in which

reputational           effects    are     small.

         Unequal        market    power     may also        lead to market         failure.       Forced      labor    is

an obvious        example       in which        employers     have      market    power   and the abolition            of



                                                                 6
forced     labor    would    enhance        economic     efficiency.         As another       example,     child

laborers     are often       not perfectly           mobile,     which    would    confer     some monopsony

power    to employers.             If employers        have monopsony        power    over    workers,     a

skillfully        set minimum        wage    could     increase     employment,       wages,    and welfare.               Of

course,     if the minimum           wage    is set too high,         it could       reduce    employment        and

efficiency,        even    in a monopsonistic            labor    market.

         A related        issue     concerns     discrimination,          broadly     defined     to mean      the

existence     of equally          productive      workers       who are paid       different     wages     based       on

characteristics           unrelated     to their        productivity        (such as race       or gender) .           In

a perfectly        competitive        market     there    is a strong        economic      incentive      against

discrimination           because     nondiscriminating           firms     will   gain   a competitive

advantage.         Yet    social     customs     and market       power     may   enable     discrimination           to

persist     (Akerlof       1976) .     The elimination           of discrimination           would   improve

economic     efficiency,          as well      as be morally        justified.        Swinnerton        (1996)

argues     that    “core”     labor    standards,        such    as prohibitions         against     forced      labor

and discrimination,            are always        economically        efficient,       while    other     standards

(such as a fixed           minimum     work     age)    are efficient        in some     countries       and

inefficient        in others,        depending       on the level         of development.

          Externalities,           resulting     from the failure           of the parties        involved       to

internalize        all the costs        and benefits        of particular          actions,      could    also    lead

to market     failure.         Although        externalities        probably      provide     a stronger

justification        for environmental            standards        than    for labor     standards,       they may

also    justify     some     labor    market     standards.

          Recent    economic        modeling     of standards        focuses      on potential       multiple

equilibria         (Fields    1995 and Basu          and Van      1996) .    The economy        could    settle       down

in one of several            equilibria,        some of which        may be Pareto          inferior     to others.

Standards       could     potentially       move       the economy        to a more       efficient        equilibrium,

or they       could    reinforce        an inefficient           one.     Unfortunately,           little    evidence         is

available       to test       whether     standards        help    overcome       market     failures.




Race     to the bottom




One version       of the race           to the bottom        model       assumes     that    in some       countries

labor     is exploited         by the political           or economic        leadership.            Such    exploitation

may    take    the form of forced           labor.         If some       countries     exploit       labor     in this

fashion,       other    countries        will    be induced        to lower       their     labor    practices          and

standards       as well       because     of competition,           or suffer       higher       unemployment.

Echoing       Gresham’s       law, Marshall        (1994) argues           that    “a basic        principle       of

highly     competitive         markets     is that bad        standards        tend    to drive       out the good.”

Collectively,          people       in all countries         could       be better     off with       a minimal          level

of labor       standards       if some     countries        exploit       labor,    and this        exploitation

leads    to lower       labor       standards     abroad.4

         Freeman       (1994) and Ehrenberg              (1994) argue        that,     as a practical             matter,

race    to the bottom          is unlikely.            As evidence,        they note        that    states     in the

United     States      have    persisted        with    widely     divergent       labor     standards       for

decades.        This    is certainly        truer       and it is improbable              that     a race    to the

bottom    will    cause       all    countries     to converge           to a common,        negligible        set of

labor    standards.           Nonetheless,        on the margin           a low-level        of standards          in one

country       could    put    downward     pressure       on standards         in other       countries,

especially       as the world          trading     system     becomes       more    integrated.5            For

example,       Newt    Gingrich       and Pat Buchanan            both    argued    against        a minimum       wage

increase       in the United          States     because     the Mexican          minimum     wage    is less       than

one-quarter       the United       States     level.




Consumer     sovereignty




Consumers     may    consider      the process      by which      products     are made       an important

attribute     of the product.           Thus , Freeman       1994 argues       that    consumers    often        are

willing     to pay more       for products       that are made       in socially        responsible        ways

(without     forced     labor,     for example),        and this desire        is likely       to increase

with    income.      A 1994 poll       by Marymount       University      provides      some    support     for

Freeman’s     view:     84 percent      of U.S.     shoppers      said   they would      be willing        to pay

$1 extra     for a $20 garment          if it were made        without      sweatshop     labor     (Haq 1996).

Freeman     concludes       that a proper       role of government           is to provide       information

regarding     “socially       responsible”       companies,       to induce     companies       to provide

better    working     conditions       by altering      market     demand     for their       products.      In

its recent       campaign     against    sweatshop       labor,    the United       States     Department        of

Labor    tried    exactly     this    tactic,    to some effect.

         Taken    to an extreme,        individuals       in one country        may    feel    it is morally

unacceptable        for a country       to gain     a comparative        advantage      based    on certain

labor    practices,      such as forced         labor    (Charnovitz      1992 and Bhagwati         1994) .

Just    as individuals       may     choose   not   to buy    certain     products      because    they

dislike     attributes      of the product,         society    may   collectively        express    these

preferences       by pursuing        national    and international          labor     standards.      It may          or

may not be more         efficient      for the government          to collect       the necessary         data    to

pursue    these     preferences       through    international       labor     standards.

         Rodrik     (1995) draws       an interesting        parallel     between      international        labor

standards     and restrictions          on domestic       technology.        Formally,        liberalized



                                                         9
trade     is equivalent        to an improvement          in technology,          because     trade       enables

goods     to be    “produced”     at lower       costs.        Rodrik   notes     that nations           often

restrict     the type of technology              that domestic          firms    can use.        Labor     standards

are a type        of restriction        on technology.           Rodrik    argues,       “It is difficult              to

see why     a particular        sort    of technology,          that which       is etiodied        in

international        trade,     should    be immune       from the same type             of considerations.             11

From    the standpoint         of a worker       in an advanced          country    who     is displaced          by an

under-age       child,    it makes      little    difference       if that       child     works    at home       or

abroad.




Enhance     labor    market     institutions




Some    labor     standards     are desirable       because       they enhance          the efficient

operation       of the labor      market.        For example,       Freeman        (1992), Marshall          (1994) ,

and others        argue   that protected         collective       bargaining       could     enhance       the

operation       of the labor      market.        Piore    (1994) argues          that    labor     market

standards       enhance     the stability        of social       relationships,          and may     lead    to the

evolution       of more     efficient     production        strategies.

         Labor     market     institutions       may have       positive    spillovers        to the rest          of

society.        It is arguable         that    Solidarity       and Western       pressure       for free        trade

unions    in Poland       had as much         of an impact       on the rise       of democracy           and markets

in Central        and Eastern     Europe       as the United       States       military     buildup.        Many

argue    that policies         that protect        free and democratic            unions     have    collateral

political       benefits.       Take    the U.S.     ordeal      of forced       labor     as another       example.

In the nineteenth           century     European     countries      made    no effort        to link       trade       to

the abolition        of slavery.         Had Britain        refused      to purchase        cheap    U.S.    cotton



                                                          10
produced       with    slave    labor,       one can only             speculate     about    whether      the bloody

Civil    War    could    have       been    averted       or shortened.            When    judged    against      the    small

increase       in prices       that may          result    from       international        labor    standards,      the

collateral       political          and    social       benefits       could    be quite     large.




Why   Link     International          Trade       And    Labor    Practices?




Preliminarily,          it can be noted             that     in a well-functioning               democracy,       the

government       would       have    a strong       incentive          to set labor        standards      so as to

overcome       market     failures,         achieve       desired       redistribution,          and enhance

efficiency.           Each    country       therefore       would       have    a strong     incentive      to choose

the   “right”     level       of labor       standards,          given    its norms,        culture,      and level       of

economic       development,          because       by choosing          the right       standards       the government

maximizes       social       welfare       and    increases        its chances         of being     reelected.          For

the country       itself       the optimal          labor     standards         will    depend     on the significance

of market       failures,       the comparative             efficacy       of standards,           the desired      level

of redistribution,             and other          factors.        Technical        assistance       and nonbinding

advice       may help     countries         establish       the set of standards              that      is best    for

them,    but    if the political             system       functions       well,     outside      influences       are

unlikely       to enhance       welfare          by interfering          with     labor    standards      in sovereign

countries .

         M     exception       to this       optimistic          conclusion        would    occur    if the political

system       in a particular          country       is not responsive              to the welfare         of its

citizens.        For example,             as noted       above,       if the leadership          of a nation       exploits

its workers           (say through         forced       labor) , this exploitation               will    put downward

pressure       on wages       and working          conditions          in other     countries       (although



                                                                 11
consumers       will     face    lower    prices      of goods) . International               pressure       for labor

standards       could       improve     the welfare         of workers       in both     nations      if one nation

unfairly       exploits        its workers.          This    observation        underscores         U.S.    Labor

Secretary       Robert        Reich’s     1994 position        that,     if a country         “lacks       democratic

institutions          and     fails    to disseminate         the benefits         of growth,        other    countries

might    justifiably           conclude      that    low labor      standards        are due not       to poverty

itself,       but    to political        choices      that distort        development         and warp       the

economy’s       structure. “

         ~     one assumes          that minimal       labor      standards      are desirable,            what    are   the

arguments       for or against           using      international        trade    as a point         of leverage         to

enforce       minimum       labor     standards      in other      countries?         Some    trade    economists

have    taken       the extreme        position      that any policy          that    interferes       with       free

trade    must       be disguised        protectionism        and must       be bad.       I have      six pragmatic

observations          on this       issue.

         1.     Multinational           and other      organizations         often     play    an

         informational           and monitoring         role      insofar    as labor        standards       and

         working       conditions        are concerned.            Better    information         is expected

         to political           and economic        markets       work   better.

         2.     If the pressure           for standards           emanates      solely    from      a desire       to

        protect        workers        in advanced      economies,        the standards         may not be in

         the best       interest        of the less advanced             economies.          In particular,

         a concern          is that     developing      countries        will    be pressured         to accept

         standards          that exceed      their     economic      capacity.

         3.     It is unlikely,           in any event,           that minimal       labor     standards

        will        provide     much    protection      to workers        in industrial          countries.

         The gap       in wages        and working      conditions        for unskilled          workers



                                                             12
between     advanced       and     less advanced            economies     is so great      that       any

realistic        set of minimal          labor    standards          is unlikely      to have     much

impact     on trade       flows     (Grossman         and Krueger        1993) .    If the sole

goal    of labor       standards        is to help          workers     in industrial

countries,        there    are probably          more       direct    and more     efficient      ways

than    international           labor    standards.

4.     Ehrenberg       (1995) proposes           that       industrial     countries

compensate        developing        countries         to accept       and enforce       higher    labor

standards .        Whatever       the economic             merits    of this    idea,    it is

unlikely       to attract        much    support       in industrial        countries,         which

can barely        muster     the political            support       for trade     agreements      or

for aid to developing               countries.

5.     Labor     standards       are often       a subject          of bargaining       in trade

negotiations       .     Presumably,          a well-intentioned           government      will       not

accept     an agreement          unless,       in total,       it is expected         to make     the

country     better       off.     No country          has the right        to impose      its laws

on a sovereign           nation.        Yet    trade       agreements     are voluntarily

agreed     to.     Side    agreements          may help produce           a more    equitable

distribution        of the surplus             resulting       from expanded        trade.       The

NAFTA    side     agreements,        which      create       institutions       to ensure       that

parties     to the agreement             enforce       their    own     labor   laws,    may    serve

as a model.         Also    note     that      if, as expected,           trade    agreements

increase       national      income,      countries          will    be able    to afford       more

stringent        labor    standards        following         the agreements.          Since     the

demand     for labor       standards          tends    to rise with        national      income,

many    countries        will    endogenously          desire       to strengthen       and enforce



                                                      13
          their    standards        following       trade    agreements.

          6.     Political        support    for free trade          is currently        tenuous     in many

          industrial        countries,       which    have    experienced        rising     income

          inequality        and high     unemployment.             Labor     and environmental        side

          agreements        are    likely    to enhance       political        support    for trade

          agreements        in industrial        countries.          If faced with        a choice

         between     no trade        agreement       and an agreement           that   also   requires

         more     vigorous        enforcement       of labor       laws    that are already         on the

         books , my guess           is that     even most         hardened     trade   economists      would

         prefer     the second        option.




Disguised        Protectionism?




Although        a major     concern     with    international         labor     standards     is that       they may

be used        as an excuse        to inefficiently          protect       interests     in industrial       nations

from    competition         from developing          countries,       there     is surprisingly        little

empirical        evidencrnne         way or the other-on             this     issue.     One way     to investigate

whether        legislators        support    international          labor    standards      in an effort       to

protect        domestic     interests       would    be to examine          whether    support      for such

legislation        is greatest        among     legislators         whose    constituents      would    benefit

most    from     international        labor     standards.          This    hypothesis      is particularly

difficult        to test,     however,       because    labor       standards     are typically        bundled      with

other    trade     legislation        and rarely       come up for a separate              vote,     such    as was

the case        for the NAFTA        side    agreements.

         One bill         that provides        an opportunity         to study     the determinants           of

support        for international         labor      standards       is the proposed         Child    Labor



                                                             14
Deterrence       Act    of 1995        (S. 706 and H.R.          2065) .       If passed,       this     legislation

would    prohibit        the importation         to the United           States    of goods          produced     abroad

with    child     labor.6        Senator      Tom Harkin         (D-Iowa)       has sponsored          this

legislation        in the Senate,          and Representative             Barney       Frank        (D-Massachusetts)

in the House.           Although       the bill       has not     come    to a vote,          it has thirty-five

additional        cosponsors       in the House         of Representatives              and seven        in the Senate.

Cosponsoring          legislation       is an indication           of strong       support          for the bill.           I

have    assembled       a data     set to study         the determinants           of support           for this trade-

linked     child      labor    standard.

         Specifically,          I relate       whether     a member       of the House          of Representatives

is a cosponsor          of the Child          Labor    Deterrence        Act    to characteristics             of the

representatives’           districts       and the representatives’                political          background.7

Plausibly,       constituents          with    a low level        of education          (and their          employers)

are those       most    likely    to benefit          directly     from this act because                 imported

products       made    with    child    labor    are most        likely    to compete          with    domestic

products       produced       by less-educated          workers     in the United             States.       So if support

for banning        imports      of products        made    with    child       labor    in part       represents       a

concealed       desire     on the part         of representatives              to protect       their       constituents

from    foreign       competition,       one would        expect    support       for this          legislation       to be

strongest       among     legislators         who represent        districts       with       relatively       many    high

school     dropouts.          To test    this proposition,              I collected          data    on the share          of

the population          age twenty-five          and over        with    less    than    a high       school    degree

for each       Congressional        district.a

         Results       of estimating          several     linear    probability          models       are    reported       in

table    1.9     The dependent          variable      equals      one if the representative                   is a

cosponsor       of the Child        Labor      Deterrence        Act of 1995,          and    zero    if he or she          is

not .    In addition       to the share          of high    school       dropouts,     I control         for a number

of other    variables.           The union       rate variable        measures       the proportion         of the

workforce    in the state          that belongs          to a union,       based     on Hirsch      (1994) .       Votes

on NAFTA,    the General          Agreement       on Tariffs       and Trade       (GATT) , party

affiliation,       the    representative’s           rating      by Americans        for Democratic         Action

(ADA) , the popular         vote    for the representative                in the 1994        election,      and    the

number    of terms       served    by the representative              are all      from Duncan       and Lawrence

(1995) .    The    sample       consists     of 434 members         of the 104th        Congress.          (The

sample    size    is not    435 because          one seat was open          in 1995.)

         The results       indicate       that    representatives          from districts          with    a high

concentration       of high       school     dropouts      are ~          likely     to cosponsor         the Child

Labor    Deterrence       Act.     And    the magnitude          of the effect        is fairly      large:        going

from a district          with    10 percent       high    school    dropouts       to one with       30 percent

lowers    the probability          of sponsoring          the Act by roughly           8 percentage         points,

other    things    equal.        This    finding     is contrary         to what     I would      expect    from    a

simple    political       economy       model    that    says metiers       of Congress          whose

constituents       benefit       most    from    the Child       Labor    Deterrence       Act    are most    likely

to support       the Act.

         Several    of the other          variables       reported       in table     1 are also         of interest.

Firstr    representatives          from     states      that have     a higher       union    rate are more

likely    to cosponsor          the Child       Labor    Deterrence       Act.     There     are two plausible

explanations       for this       finding:       (1) workers       in the unionized           sector      receive

rents,    and unions       therefore        try to prevent         foreign       competition       from eroding

those    rents;    (2) unionized           workers      and their     representatives            are concerned

about    labor    rights    generally.           As discussed       below,       because     unionized      workers

are unlikely       to compete       with     child      labor,    the first       explanation       is



                                                           16
questionable       .

         For representatives              who also     served      in the 103rd       Congress,       I can examine

the relationship          between        support    for NAFTA       and GATT       and support       for the Child

Labor    Deterrence       Act.      Specifically,          columns    2 and 3 include             dummy    variables

which    measure       whether     the representative             voted    for NAFTA       and for GATT,          for

NAFTA    and against       GATT,     and       for GATT    and against       NAFTA.        Interestingly,          the

results    indicate       that     representatives          who    supported       NAFTA    and GATT       were    11

percentage       points    less     likely       to support       the Child       Labor    Deterrence       Act    of

1995    than were       representatives           who opposed       both    NAFTA    and GATT.        Thus , those

who opposed       expanding        trade       opportunities       through    NAFTA       and GATT    were    also

more    likely    to support        the Child       Labor    Deterrence       Act.        This    finding    suggests

that    those    who    support     international          labor    standards       are more       likely    to favor

protectionist          policies     generally,       but    the findings          for the education          variable

make    it unclear       whether     those       protectionist       policies       are    in the narrow

interest     of their      constituents.            Below    I examine       the determinants             of support

for NAFTA       and GATT     to gain       further     insights      into this       issue.

         Metiers       of the Democratic           Party    (which is defined             to include       the one

Independent       member     of Congress)          are more       likely    to support       child    labor

standards .        Indeed,    none       of the cosponsors          of the Child          Labor    Deterrence       Act

in the House        is a Republican             (although    two Republicans          cosponsored          the bill       in

the Senate) .          In columns        4-6    I reestimated       the models       for the subsample             of

Democrats.        The    results     for this       subsample       are qualitatively             similar;    most

important,       districts        with    relatively       many    poorly    educated       workers       continue       to

be less    likely       to support        the Child       Labor    Deterrence       Act.

         support       for international           labor    standards       may    just    reflect    the

representatives’          ideology.            Unfortunately,       ideology       is hard       to define    and
quantify.          The ADA    rating     measures    the    “liberalness”          of the member’s           voting

record,     as reflected           by votes     for bills       supported     by the ADA.          This    variable,

which     is intended        to reflect        the ideology       of the member,          is positively

associated         with    support    for the Child        Labor    Deterrence        Act.1°      Except     for the

dummy     variable        measuring    party     affiliation-which          becomes       statistically

insignificant—including               this variable        hardly      alters     the effect       of the other

variables      .    Last,    notice     that    the variables       measuring        the representative’s

share     of the vote        in 1994 or number           of terms      in office      both    have   statistically

insignificant           effects     in all of the specifications.




Comparison         with    NAFTA    and GATT     votes




It is useful         to contrast       the model     results       reported       here    with    comparable

models     of the determinants            of support       for NAFTA       and GATT.         Specifically,          I ask

whether     representatives           from districts        with    many    less educated          workers     were

more    or less      likely    to vote       for NAFTA     and GATT.        The    first     two columns       of

table    2 contain         linear    probability     models       in which      the dependent        variable

equals     one     if the representative           voted    in favor       of NAFTA,       and zero       if he voted

against.         The next     two columns        contain    the same models           for GATT.       The     sample

consists       of the      subset    of Congressmen        who were       in office       in 1994    and    1995.

Even    though      the vote       on GATT     was held    in a lame duck          session       of Congress,       we

would    expect      this    sample    to be responsive           to their      constituents’        interests

because     it consists        exclusively        of members       who    returned       to Congress.

         The     independent        variables     are much      more     successful       at explaining        support

for NAFTA        than     for GATT.11        Interestingly,       representatives          with    a high

fraction       of less-educated         workers     in their       district       are more       likely    to oppose



                                                           18
NAFTA     and GATT,       even     though    they   are less       likely    to support      international

child     labor    standards.         This     finding    suggests       that   the fraction        of less

educated       workers     in a district         does    at least     partially       reflect      a constituency

base    that    stands     to benefit        from protectionist           policies.

         A higher        union     rate    and membership         in the Democratic         party    are also

strongly       negatively        related      to votes    for NAFTA.         McArthur      and Marks        (1988)

similarly       find     that    a high     union   rate and union          political      contributions            are

strong    predictors        of votes        for the 1982 automobile             industry     domestic          content

bill,    and Baldwin         (19E5) finds        that union       political      contributions        are

correlated        with    opposition        to the Trade        Act of 1974.        The    finding    of a

negative       relationship         between     unionization        and support       for NAFTA      is not

surprising,        as the AFL-CIO           strongly     opposed     NAFTA.      The ADA     rating       is

insignificantly           related     to support        for NAFTA     or GATT,      but    in other       results         I

find    that    the AFL-CIO’s         political       rating     scale    has a significant          negative

effect     on votes       for NAFTA        and GATT.12

         A consideration            of the major        players     in the legislative            battles       over

NAFTA    and GATT        yields     some    additional     insights.         Senator      Earnest    Hollings

(D-South       Carolina)        led the unsuccessful            campaign     against      GATT,    although         he did

succeed     in postponing           the vote     to a lame duck          session.       Notably,     a majority               of

the South       Carolina        Congressional       delegation       also voted       against      GATT    and NAFTA.

It was widely           believed     that    Senator     Hollings     was motivated         by a concern            to

protect     textile       and apparel        firms,     which    are major      employers     in South

Carolina.         The    textile     and apparel        industry     is also     a major     employer          of

children       abroad.      Yet not one of the current                cosponsors        of the Child           Labor

Deterrence        Act    of 1995     is from South        Carolina.         Since   South    Carolina          stands         to

benefit     as much       as any state         in the nation        from a ban on imports            produced            by



                                                           19
child     labor,      the lack of support            by South       Carolina       representatives           also

suggests       that    support     for the act is not motivated                    by disguised        protectionism.

         A broader       literature         on the political           economy      of tariffs        also    finds       that

opposition       to trade       liberalization            is related       to constituents’           economic

interests,       similar     to results        of the NAFTA           and GATT      regressions.          Baldwin

(1985) , for example,            finds      that    representatives          from districts           with    relatively

many    workers       in import-sensitive            industries       were    more     likely    to oppose          the

Trade    Act    of 1974.        In related         work    Tosini    and Tower        (1987) examine          support

for the Textile          Act of 1985,         which       would    have    established        quotas    to restrict

imports     of textile       goods     to the United           States.       Legislators        were    much    more

likely     to support       this    bill     if their       district       had a high        percentage       of workers

in the     textile      industry      and    if they       received       funds    from    the Amalgamated

Clothing       and Textile       Workers      Union,       while    they were more           likely    to oppose          the

bill    if their       districts     had     a high percentage             of workers        in export       industries.

Thus    although       support     for child        labor    standards       does not        appear    to be related

to constituents’           economic      interests,         support       for tariffs        and quotas       does

appear     to reflect       constituents’           economic       interests.




Interpretation




There    are a variety          of ways     of interpreting           these       results.      In my view,

however,       there    is scant     support        for the most          direct    test    of the hypothesis

that    advocacy       of international            labor    standards       reflects       disguised

protectionism.           Representatives            from districts          that    stand     to gain     the most

from    the Child       Labor    Deterrence        Act—those        with    relatively        many    unskilled

worker~re          least    likely     to cosponsor          the act.        Moreover,        a higher       fraction       of



                                                             20
less-skilled          workers     is associated           with       opposition     to NAFTA       and GATT       (see

table     2) .    An alternative           explanation          for these       results     is, as Freeman              (1994)

argues,     that      demand     for international              child    labor    standards        is a normal          good

(meaning       that     demand    rises     with       income)       and that people        with    higher

socioeconomic           status     (higher       education)          select    representatives        who    are more

supportive        of placing          limits     on child       labor.        It is, of course,           possible       that

support     for other          types     of labor       standards       represents     disguised          protectionism.

But    in view     of the results           for the Child             Labor    Deterrence     Act,    it is incumbent

on those       who view        international           labor    standards       as disguised        protectionism             to

provide     evidence       to support           that    conclusion.

         Another        issue    concerns        the strong          effect    of the union        rate    variable       on

the Child        Labor    Deterrence        Act.        One may be tempted           to conclude          from    this

result     that unions          support     international             labor    standards     out of self-interest

(to raise        the incomes          of their     members) .          Studies    of legislative           support       for

the minimum        wage    have       reached     this    conclusion          from similar     evidence;          for

example,       Bloch     (1980) and Cox and Oaxaca                    (1981) interpret        a positive

correlation        between       a state’s        union    rate       and support     for a minimum          wage

increase       as evidence        that     (generally          high-wage)       unionized     workers       benefit       from

minimum     wage      legislation        because       union     workers       are substitutes        for minimum-

wage    workers.         However,        I find this       interpretation          strained        in this       case

because     unionized          workers    are not obvious              beneficiaries        of a ban on imports

made    with     child    labor+nd         certainly       stand       to benefit     less    than high          school

dropouts       from     such    a ban.      -     alternative          interpretation        is that unions             are

pursuing       policies        that    strengthen        worker       rights    generally,     rather       than merely

maximizing        the    self-interest           of their       members.

         My own experience              suggests        to me that union          leaders     actively       support



                                                                21
labor    standards,          and that,       in many     instances,         labor    standards        would    not

receive     any attention            if it were not for unions.                  U.S.    labor       unions    have

pressed     the Clinton         Administration           to add labor          standards       to the agenda          of

international          summits,       supported       stronger       labor     side agreements          in NAFTA,          and

lobbied     Congress         to increase        the budget         of the ILO.        Yet    in many     cases       I do

not    think    that    the union          leadership     effectively          furthers      its members’        narrow

interests       by pushing          these    policies.        Indeed,       in many     instances       I am surprised

that    the AFL-CIO          uses    its limited        political       capital      to press        for international

labor    standards       that       are of little        benefit      to its members,           when    it could

instead     pursue      policies          of much    greater       direct    benefit     to its metiership.                 For

example,       in the recent          AFL-CIO       presidential        election,       Lane    Kirkland       was

roundly     criticized         for pursuing          international          labor    standards        at the expense

of domestic       union       bread       and butter     issues.        This    is not      to suggest        that    unions

never    pursue       legislation          that benefits        their    metiership         at the expense           of

others .       They    do.     But    it does       suggest     that one cannot          leap    to the conclusion

that    a positive       association          between     support       for international             labor    standards

and unionization             proves       that unions     support       standards       for the narrow          reason          of

enhancing       the position          of their       metiers.

         Two    final    points       are    in order.        First,     a conclusion          that    support       for a

child    labor    ban does          not    result    primarily       from disguised          protectionism           does

not mean       that    such    a standard          is economically          efficient       or desirable.            Second,

if support       for the ban were             motivated       primarily        by disguised          protectionism,             it

might    still    be economically             efficient.           To evaluate       the desirability           of

standards,       it is necessary             to examine       their     actual      impact.      Are    labor

standards       complied       with?        What    is their       economic     effect?        Are    there    better

ways    of achieving          the same       ends?      These      questions     are partially          addressed          in



                                                              22

Child     Labor    Standards          And Compulsory       Schooling




Many    countries        have    laws prohibiting          “exploitative          child    labor”     and the

employment        of    “very young”        children.         It is not economically              efficient       to

exploit     child       or other       labor.      Furthermore,        very    young     children     may not have

the ability        to make       rational       employment         and schooling        decisions.        Although

left    to their        own,    children     may make      irrational         decisions,     their     families         will

often    help     them    to make        sensible     choices.        The primary        economic     approach         to

modeling     child       labor    is to assume         that    rational       time allocation         decisions         are

made    jointly        by children        and their     families.           As Grootaert     and Kanbur        1995

emphasize,        child       labor    standards     could     alter       the bargaining     power       and welfare

of children,           while    at the same        time weakening           the economic     position       of their

families.         Basu    and Van        (1996) note     that       a ban on child        labor    will    push   up the

wage    of adults,        possibly        to the point        where    families        are wealthy     enough      that

they    no longer        want    their     children     to work.           On the other     hand     a prohibition

against     child       labor    in one sector         could       force    children     into less     desirable

activities,        such       as the underground         economy.

         The effect           of government       policy      toward       schooling     on child     labor    supply

has    largely     been       ignored     in this    literature.            If the government        provides

higher     quality       education,        the incentive           for students        to acquire     education         and

postpone     work       will    be greater.         If schools        are not available           nearby,     or are of

low quality,           then    work    is a more     attractive        option.         It is possible       for

children     to make          rational     decisions     to work       instead    of attend        school     based         on

their    existing        set of schooling           opportunities,           but the schooling         opportunities



                                                              23
may be suboptimal.

         How widespread           is child     labor?       Child     labor    is difficult        to define          and

measure.        Often,     statistical        agencies      do not     collect       information        on labor

force    status     for children          below     the minimum       work    age.     Based     on a collection

of data     from    124 countries,          the ILO estimates           that    some    78.5 million           children

age fourteen        and under       worked     worldwide         in 1990     (Ashagrie     1993) .       The    ILO

convention       on child        labor    (Convention       138)    sets     the minimum       work     age at

fifteen,     but permits          a lower     age for developing             countries.         (The ILO

convention       also    permits     light     work      for children        age thirteen        to fifteen,

provided     it does       not    interfere       with    educational        activities.    )     Forty-six

countries       have    ratified     this     convention.          However,     the high        rate of employment

of children        under    fifteen       suggests       a fair amount        of noncompliance           with    this

standard     in many       countries.

         Figure     1 illustrates          an obvious       point:     employment       of young        children       is

common     in low-income          countries       and uncommon        in high-income        countries.13           The

figure    utilizes       data     collected       by the ILO on the percent               of ten to fourteen

year    old children        who were       employed       in 1995.      Data    on GDP per        capita       in 1992,

which    are shown       with     a logarithmic          scaler    are from Penn World            Table    5.6.        The

steep    downward       sloping     relationship          indicates     that    child     labor    declines       as one

moves    from    low-income        to high-income          countries.         Employment       rates     are highest

for children        in Burundi        (49 percent),           Uganda    (45 percent),          and Rwanda        (42

percent) .       In countries        where     GDP per      capita     exceeds       $5,000,     such    as most       of

Western     Europe      and North        America,     employment       of young       children     is negligible.

Cross-country          differences        in log GDP per          capita     and its square        account       for an

astounding       80 percent        of the variability             in child     emplopent         rates    worldwide.

         Child     labor    is a necessary           source      of production        and income        in many



                                                            24
developing        countries            The    ILO survey         finds    that nearly         80 percent          of child

laborers       work    in the agriculture,               hunting,        forestry,      and    fishing       sectors.           In

many    cases     this work       may not       interfere         with    the normal         social    and educational

development        of children.              While    child      labor    is considered         a necessity          for

economic       survival       in some        societies,       it is considered           an abomination             in

others .       From    figure     1 it is obvious             that      it would      be difficult          to enforce          a

single    minimum        work    age    in all countries.

         Another       important        lesson       is that a higher           level    of economic          development

is associated          with     a decline       in child         labor.       Many    goods    are normal          goods,

meaning     that      their     consumption          rises    as income        rises.        Child    labor       could    be

thought     of as a “normal             bad,”       a practice        that    is tolerated       when       societies       are

poor    but not when          they     are wealthy.           Thus , one would          expect       more    developed

economies       to have       stronger        child     labor     standards,         and they    typically          do.     Also

note    that    according        to ILO figures           the number          of children       under       age    fifteen

who are working           declined       by 11 percent            between      1980 and 1990          (although          much       of

this    decline       may well       represent        a reporting         phenomenon)           Economic          growth

appears     to be an important                way    to reduce        child    labor.        If trade       agreements

increase       the wealth        of nations,          then developing           countries       that    are a party             to

such    agreements        would      be expected         to more        readily      adopt    child    labor       standards

after    trade     has    expanded.




Compulsory       schooling




Compulsory       schooling        laws       and minimum         work    age requirements            are typically

complimentary          policies.        Weiner       (1991) observes           that    l’compulsory primarY


education       is the policy           instrument        by which        the state      effectively          removes



                                                                 25
children     from    the labor        force. “      The    ILO recommends        full-time       schooling       or

vocational        training     at least       until    the minimum       work    age.     A number       of authors

have    recently     suggested        that    compulsory         schooling     be emphasized       as a policy          to

reduce     child    labor     instead      of minimum       work    age requirements.            Given    the

importance        of compulsory        schooling       laws,      I examined     evidence       on compliance

with    compulsory        schooling,       using    data    from the 1990–91           waves    of the World

Values     Survey,    a set of international                cross-sectional        surveys       launched       by the

European     Values       Systems     Study    Group.       The survey        is designed       for international

comparisons,        and     in each    country      respondents       were     asked    for the age at which

they    completed      (or will       complete)       full-time      education.

         Table     3 reports       the school       leaving       age distribution        for individuals             born

between     1959 and       1974    in selected        low-income      countries,        and    for comparison          in

the United        Kingdom     and the United          States.       The table     indicates       a tremendous

amount     of noncompliance           with    compulsory         schooling     laws.     In Brazil       fully    80

percent     of youngsters          left    school     before      reaching     their    thirteenth       birthday,

even    though     the compulsory          schooling       age    is fourteen,     and    in Mexico       and

Portugal     one-quarter          of the population          left    school     before    reaching       the minimum

schooling     age.        In India,       where    the compulsory        schooling       law varies       across

regions     and    is often       as low as eleven,          40 percent        of the population          left

school     at age 12 or earlier.               Weiner      (1991) argues        that    the lack     of commitment

to a national        compulsory        schooling       policy      in India     is a major       reason    why    a

large    share     of the population           is illiterate.           In the United          States,    where

sixteen     is the most        common      compulsory       schooling        age, very    few students          leave

school     before    age seventeen.            In the United         Kingdom     half    of students        leave

school     at age    sixteen,       the compulsory          age.

         Although     there       is clearly       noncompliance        with    compulsory       schooling       laws,



                                                            26
the laws     still      may    lead    to higher       educational             attainment       than would    otherwise

be the case.           Table    4 documents        that    the compulsory               schooling       age clearly        has

affected     educational         attainment        in the United               Kingdom.      The compulsory

schooling       age was       raised    from    fourteen       to fifteen          in 1947 and then          from

fifteen     to sixteen         in 1973.        A comparison             of the schooling          leaving    age

distribution          for three       cohort~ne         covered          by the age        fourteen      law, one

covered     by the age         fifteen     law, and one covered                  by the age sixteen          la~hows

that    for each       cohort    the modal        school      leaving          age equals       the minimum

compulsory       level.        Moreover,       for each       cohort       no more       than    5 percent    of

individuals       leave       school    before     reaching            the minimum       age.     Harmon    and Walker

(1995) similarly          find    that     educational         attainment          shifted       out with    the

increases       in the compulsory           schooling         age in the United              Kingdom.

          In developing         countries       it is less             clear    that    the compulsory       schooling

age has much          effect    on educational          attainment.              None    of the lower-income

countries       in table       3 shows     much    of a spike            in school       completion       around     the

compulsory       schooling       age.      In Brazil       child         labor    and low educational

attainment       are particularly           a problem.             ~     estimated       10 percent       of Brazilian

children     work      for their       own or their        family’s            survival     on the streets         (Myers

1988) .     Brazil      increased       its compulsory             schooling       age from       eleven    to fourteen

in 1971.        Yet    table    5 shows     there      is hardly          any difference          in school     leaving

ages    for the younger          cohort,       which    was    covered          by the age fourteen          law     (born

after    1962)    and    the older       cohort        (born before            1958) , which      was    covered     by the

age eleven       law.     Regardless        of the compulsory                  schooling     age,   roughly     85

percent     of children         left    school    before       reaching          the age of fourteen.

          In the United         Kingdom     and the United               States    compulsory       schooling        has

been    found    to lead       to higher       earnings       (Angrist          and Krueger       1991 and Harmon           and



                                                              27
Walker     1995) .       These       studies     find that       the earnings          payoff       to years      of

compulsory           schooling       tends    to exceed      the payoff            to years     of schooling           beyond

the compulsory           level.        For several        reasons       policies       that     increase       educational

attainment           in developing        countries       are likely          to have       large     rewards     as well.

First,     Psacharopoulos             (1994)     finds    that primary             education     pays    a higher        return

than    secondary        and higher          education     in developing             countries,        and compulsory

schooling        laws    typically        pertain      to primary           schooling.         Second,    fertility

rates     tend       to decline       with    maternal     education          in developing           nations.         And

third,     infant       and child       mortality        tend    to decline          with   maternal      education           as

well     (World Bank          1995a) .

         Compulsory           schooling       laws,    by themselves,              are unlikely        to increase

educational           attainment       and    to reduce      child      labor.        ti increase        in educational

attainment        requires       the availability            of adequate            educational        facilities,

vigorous       enforcement,           and a commitment           on the part          of parents        and policy

makers     to foster          education.         Compulsory          schooling       laws   can form      an important

component        of child       labor    policy,       but unless           communities        have    adequate        schools

and    families        have    the    financial       wherewithal           and will     to send       their     children          to

school , there          will    be rampant        noncompliance             with    compulsory        schooling        laws.

         More     generally,          low compliance        with       labor       standards     is often        a major

issue    in developing           countries        (World Bank          1995b) .       If countries        lack     the

capacity       or will        to enforce       their     existing       labor       standards,        pressing     them       to

adopt    more     stringent          standards     probably          will    have    little     effect.        Recent

efforts    by the international                  community       to encourage          nations        to enforce        the

laws    that     they    already       deem    adequate      seems      to be a response              to the low

compliance       .




                                                                28
Conclusion

          A review       of the theoretical            literature          suggests    that    labor    standards

could     enhance       the efficiency       of the labor            market     and improve         the distribution

of income       in some     situations,         but    could       prove    counterproductive          for efficiency

and equity       in others.         Interestinglyr            after    surveying       the unequal          political

power     of employers         and employees,          Adam    Smith       (1776) concluded          that     “when    the

regulation,          therefore,     is in favor         of the workmen,           it is always         just     and

equitable;       but     it is sometimes         otherwise          when    in favor     of the masters. 11 In

modern     democratic       countries,       however,         Fields’s        (1995) observation            regarding

labor     standards      may be more        relevant:         “There       is no easy generalisation,                 and

the    ‘less    is better’        view   is as itialanced             on one side as is the             ‘more     is

better’       view    on the other.”

         Support       for international          labor       standards        in advanced      nations       does     not

necessarily          represent     disguised      protectionism.              Although       a large    literature

finds    that political           support    for tariffs            and quotas     at least         in part     reflects

a desire       to protect        constituents’         economic       interests,       the available          evidence

does    not    suggest     that politicians            support       international          labor    standards        out of

a desire       to further        the narrow      economic          interests     of their      constituents.

Thus , pressure          for international            labor    standards        cannot      be dismissed

automatically          as disguised       protectionism.              Standards       may    or may not       serve     a

useful    purpose,       but     they must      be evaluated          on their     merits.

         Wealthier        countries      tend    to have more          stringent       labor    standards        and

better    working       conditions.         In particular,            economic     development         is inversely

related       to the use of child           labor.       The costs         of labor      standards      are probably

borne    by the country           with   the standards,             in the form of lower             wages,    higher

product       prices,     or devalued       currency.          Many    labor     standards      are normal        goods,



                                                              29
for which        demand      is likely       to increase        with    economic       growth.       Policies       that

sacrifice        economic      growth       could    therefore        have    a negative        effect    on working

conditions        in the long         run.

          Unless      there    is a concerted           effort       to enforce     standards,        and unless          the

standards        are appropriate            for the economic           conditions        in a country,        standards

are unlikely          to have       much    impact.      If standards          are set too high           they     tend       to

be widely        ignored.       Likewise,          reliance     on compulsory          schooling      laws as an

alternative        policy      to labor        market    standards       will     have    little     effect      unless

they    are enforced,          sufficient          schools     are available,          and school        attendance           is

sufficiently          valued    by parents          and children.

          From    an analytical            standpoint       there     is much     to be said        for treating

labor     standards       as normal         goods,    which     are desired        and consumed          in greater

quantity       when    income       is higher.        Although        the political        economy       model     does       not

adequately       explain       why    some U.S.       legislators        support       the Child      Labor

Deterrence       Act,     a view      of labor       standards        as a normal        good    does.

Representatives           from districts            that are higher           up the socioeconomic            ladder          act

as if their        constituents            have    a stronger        desire    to avoid     products        made    with

child    labor,       even    though       such    actions     may require       their     constituents          to pay

more    for the products             they    consume.        Relatedly,        wealthier        societies     tend    to

impose     stronger       labor      standards       on themselves           and are less        likely     to use    child

labor.     -     important          unresolved       question        is whether     there       are more     efficient

ways    of satisfying          individuals’          demands        for better    treatment        of workers        and

children       than pressuring             foreign    nations        to adopt    labor     standards        or refusing

to purchase        goods      made    under       conditions        deemed    substandard.         For example,           a

wealthy     nation      could       transfer       income    directly        to poor     children     in developing

countries,       admit       more    immigrants,        or subsidize          employers     to improve        the



                                                               30
conditions    of workers   and children   in developing   countries.      But    if labor

standards    enhance   efficiency,   the cost of exercising     those   tastes    through

international    labor   standards   may not be very   great.

Notes

1.   Some observers draw a distinction   between labor standards   (such as minimum
work ages) and labor rights (such as the right to bargain collectively) .
Although this distinction   is meaningful,   for this paper I will use the term
labor standards   to cover both standards and rights.

2.   competition  over rents created by redistributionary  policies may also
reduce efficiency,   as resources are devoted to rent-seeking   rather than
production   (see Krueger 1974) .

3.   The World Bank (1995b) lists several market failures as a rationale for
labor standards.   Maskus, Rutherford,  and Selby (1995) provide a simulation of
the effect of labor standards in Mexico assuming that workers are misinformed
about work-related  hazards.

4.   Davis (1996) provides an interesting    theoretical model in which Europe is
assumed to have a binding minimum wage and the United States is assumed to
have flexible wages.    He predicts that Europe incurs enough unemployment    to
raise the wage of low-skilled    United States workers to the European minimum
wage if trade arbitrages   goods prices between the countries.

5.   Freeman (1994) writes, “I do not accept the premise of some that bad
standards drive out good standards.   Any country that wants higher Labour
standards for itself can have them. .. if it is willing to pay.”   My point is
that lower standards abroad may alter the price that the country will have to
pay.

6.   The Child Labor Deterrence   Act of 1995 would urge the President to seek an
agreement with other governments    to secure an international   ban on trade in
goods produced by children under age fifteen.      Additionally,  it would require
the Secretary of Labor to identify foreign countries that do not comply with
national laws that prohibit child labor and that utilize child labor in export
products.   After consultations   with the U.S. Trade Representative   and
Secretaries   of State, Treasury, and Commerce and at least one public hearing,
the importation   of such products from these countries could be prohibited.

7.   With   only   seven cosponsors in the Senate, this type of statistical
analysis    does   not make much sense for the 100 members of the Senate.

8.   This variable was derived       from   the   STF3   file   of   the    1990   Census,   which
pertains to the 103rd Congress.

9.   Since the dependent variable equals either zero or one, and the mean is
rather low, a linear probability   model is not strictly speaking appropriate.
To partially  address this issue, I have reported standard errors that correct
for heteroskedasticity.    More important,  I also have reestimated   the
regressions  using a logistic model and found qualitatively    similar results.
For simplicity,   I report the linear probability  models.

10.  Results were quite similar when        I used   the AFL-CIO’s         political   rating
scale instead of the ADA rating.
11.  Indeed, a chi square    test finds that   the variables     in the GATT     equations
are jointly statistically    insignificant.

12.   This   may result, in part,   because voting   on NAFTA   enters   into   the
AFL-CIO’s    evaluation criteria,   however.

13.   The data used in Figure 1 were kindly provided by Kebebew Ashagrie of the
ILO . Numerous microdata  studies have found that child labor is negatively
related to family income within countries   (Rosenzweig and Evenson 1977) .
