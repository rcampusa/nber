A Political Economy Theory of Partial Decentralization

                                                 ABSTRACT

We revisit the classic problem of tax competition in the context of federal nations, and derive a positive
theory of partial decentralization. A capital poor median voter wants to use capital taxes to provide
public goods. This results in redistributive public good provision. As a consequence, when all public
goods are provided by the central government, capital taxes and public good provision are high. The
expectation of high capital taxes, however, results in a small capital stock which lowers returns to
redistribution. The median voter would therefore like to commit to a lower level of capital taxes. Decentralization
provides such a commitment: local governments avoid using capital taxes due to the pressure of tax
competition. We therefore obtain that the median voter favors a partial degree of decentralization.
The equilibrium degree of decentralization is non-monotonic in inequality, increasing in the redistributive
efficiency of public good provision, and decreasing in capital productivity. When public goods are
heterogeneous in their capacity to transfer funds, all voters agree that goods with high redistributive
capacity should be decentralized.

1       Introduction
In any given political unit, citizens both participate in and are subject to public
decisions taken at many di¤erent levels of government. In most countries the respon-
sibility to provide goods to citizens is partially decentralized, with some goods and
services provided and funded at the local level, while other goods are provided at
the central level or even at an international level such as the European Union. In
the United States, for instance, education is mostly funded at the local level, using
real estate taxes, while spending on parks or highways is mostly decided at the fed-
eral level. An extensive theoretical literature provides normative analyses based on
trading o¤ di¤erent combinations of bene…ts and costs such as local preference diver-
sity, economies of scale, public good or budgetary spillovers across districts, political
agency considerations, and risk-sharing between districts.1 The usual approach in
this literature is to derive normative statements from comparing welfare in the polar
cases of full centralization and full decentralization.
    Tax competition has also received attention in this literature. Whether it is con-
sidered a positive or a negative consequence of decentralization depends on whether
governments are treated as benevolent social planners or as Leviathan institutions
populated by rent-seeking agents. In the former case, Oates (1972) …rst articulated
the idea that tax competition between subnational units for mobile factors of pro-
duction can force benevolent governments to engage in a “race to the bottom”, and
either switch to more distortive sources of public funds or reduce public provision
levels below optimality.2 In the latter case, decentralization is positive insofar as tax
competition helps restrain self-serving governments.3 Both of these literature streams
    1
      There is large early body of work assuming benevolent governments. This literature is normally
referred to as …scal federalism. An overview is provided by Oates (1999). More relevant to our
analysis are studies that explicitly consider political agents whose incentives depend on the con-
stitutional structure they face. Persson and Tabellini (1994, 1996), Seabright (1996), Alesina and
Spolaore (1997), Bolton and Roland (1996), Lockwood (2002), Besley and Coate (2003), Tommasi
and Weinschelbaum (2007) among many others balance several combinations of the trade-o¤s listed
above from a political economy perspective. See Inman and Rubinfeld (1997), Oates (2005) and
Weingast (2006) for reviews of this second-generation approach.
    2
      Wilson (1986), Zodrow and Mieszkowski (1986) and Wildasin (1988) provide the …rst formal
accounts of this mechanism and Wilson (1999) provides a review of the literature on tax competition
in this tradition.
    3
      Leviathan views of government envisage bureaucrats and politicians primarly preoccupied with
increasing the size of government and therefore their own rents. This view, therefore, considers tax
competition a welcome restraint on the size of government. Edwards and Keen (1996) and Wilson
(1999) provide models in which competition improves the performance of Leviathan governments.
Besley and Smart (2007) bridge these two views with an analysis of …scal restraints in the presence
of both benevolent and rent-seeking politicians.

follow tradition in that they normatively compare the extreme cases of complete de-
centralization and complete centralization. However, this question has seldom been
approached from a positive perspective: what is the structure of the state that results
from a constitutional political game in the presence of tax competition?
       In this paper we propose a positive theory of partial decentralization. In this the-
ory, the constitutional game results in a degree of decentralization that balances the
desire for redistribution with the need to avoid highly distortive taxes. The framework
we examine departs from the previous literature in two important ways. First, we
assume that policies are determined by citizens in a political contest. Therefore gov-
ernments are neither benevolent nor rent-seeking: they simply implement the policies
that result from political competition. Second, our model allows us to focus on the
degree of decentralization as opposed to the polar cases examined previously. This
turns out to be crucial: in most circumstances, the result of the political contest is
an intermediate degree of decentralization.
   More speci…cally, we consider a setting with a central government and a large
number of identical sub-units. Each sub-unit is populated by a continuum of citizens
that di¤er in their capacity to deploy capital. There is a continuum of local public
goods. Some of these public goods are to be funded and provided at the local level
and the remainder of these goods are funded and provided at the central level. Each
level of government has access to two sources of revenue: it can either tax capital
invested within its jurisdiction or it can raise money using non-distortive head taxes.
Taxes and public good provision levels are decided by majority voting among all
citizens a¤ected. Capital is raised before policies are voted on, but it is mobile and
can therefore be invested in the local sub-unit that o¤ers the best after-tax returns.
       We show that despite the availability of non-distortive head taxes, centrally pro-
vided public goods are funded with capital taxes. The reason is that a relatively
poor median voter prefers to shift the burden of taxation to large capital owners. In
essence, by using capital taxes public good provision becomes redistributive in favor
of capital-poor citizens.4 Because the median voter does not face the full marginal
cost of taxation, she also votes for an excessive supply of centrally provided public
goods. The level of capital taxes at the central level is therefore increasing in two
variables: inequality in capital holdings— in particular the ratio of average to median
   4
    Besley and Coate (1991) show that public provision of goods can serve as a redistribution device.
In Alesina and Rodrik (1994) such redistribution can also occur through productive public goods.
Hat…eld (2006) considers how decentralization a¤ects the provision of productive public goods. For
an early take on the redistributive properties of public good provision see Buchanan (1964).




                                                 3
capital— and redistributive e¢ ciency of public good provision.5 Intuitively, inequality
naturally captures the demand for redistribution and redistributive e¢ ciency captures
the ease with which utility can be transferred using public good provision.
       In contrast, competitive pressures ensure that public goods provided at the local
level are funded via head taxes and consequently supplied at the e¢ cient level. In
essence, capital mobility across localities forces the median voter to renounce using
decentralized public goods as redistributive channels because taxing capital implies
losing it to neighboring districts.
       Now consider a constitutional stage of the game where voters decide on the federal
architecture of the country. In the simple framework under consideration, this reduces
to a vote over the degree of decentralization, i.e. the fraction of public goods to be
provided by the central government. Imagine that this vote takes place before capital,
taxes, and public good decisions are made. The discussion above suggests that the
median voter would like full centralization of public good provision, as this would
enable the highest degree of redistribution funded with capital taxes unencumbered by
tax competition among sub-units. However, this misses the fact that the capital stock
is generated endogenously: in a fully centralized country voters set high capital taxes
and this expectation distorts aggregate capital supply downwards. The median voter
therefore faces a trade-o¤; increasing centralization allows for better redistribution
of capital rents, but it also depresses capital supply thereby reducing the pool from
which to redistribute. The solution to the constitutional vote balances these two
forces and yields as the equilibrium a partially decentralized government structure.
    Crucially, the constitutional stage allows voters to commit to a limited degree of
capital taxation. In other words, voters use the federal structure of the constitution
to partially tie their own hands ex ante and rein in their ex post desire for capital
taxes.6 It follows that the stronger is the temptation to tax capital ex post, the higher
the degree of decentralization that results from the constitutional vote. In our analy-
sis, we …nd two interesting determinants of decentralization. First, decentralization
increases monotonically with redistributive e¢ ciency. This follows because high re-
   5
      If the marginal utility of public good consumption diminishes very fast, public good provision
is a poor redistributive channel. Conversely, if this marginal utility diminishes very slowly, public
good provision behaves like a lump-sum transfer and therefore it is a channel with high redistributive
e¢ ciency.
    6
      Obviously, this argument hinges on the fact that constitutional features are more resilient to
change than policies such as taxes. This di¤erence between policies and institutions is crucial
in modern theories of institutional change such as Acemoglu and Robinson (2006). For another
argument why federalism can be self-sustaining in equilibrium, see de Figueiredo and Weingast
(2005).



                                                  4
distributive e¢ ciency induces a strong temptation to set high capital taxes. Second,
the equilibrium degree of decentralization is non-monotonically related to inequality;
when inequality is small, centralization is not as dangerous as incentives to redistrib-
ute are moderate. At this low level, a marginal increase in inequality results in less
decentralization as the median voter wants to increase redistribution at the margin.
At high inequality, however, the temptation to heavily tax capital is much stronger.
Hence, as inequality increases, the median voter is forced to commit to a moderate
level of capital taxes. The resulting degree of decentralization is therefore decreasing
in inequality when inequality is low, but increasing in inequality when inequality is
high.
   When we allow public goods to be heterogeneous in redistributive e¢ ciency, we
obtain a striking result. All voters agree on the ordering in which public goods
should be decentralized. As a consequence, the set of Pareto optimal decentralization
schemes is easy to characterize. In particular, we show that public goods with high
redistributive e¢ ciency are the best to decentralize as they are the most oversupplied
when provided by the central government, and therefore constitute the worst temp-
tation to raise capital taxes. The only point of disagreement between voters is over
the amount of power that is to be devolved to the districts; the richer the agent is,
the more decentralization she desires. It thus follows from our analysis that political
parties that represent capital owners should favor increased levels of decentralization,
as the Republican Party does in the United States.
   We contribute to the literature in several ways. We analyze the determinants of
federal structures and focus on the degree of decentralization as opposed to the com-
parison of institutional extremes that dominates previous work. Most importantly,
we link the federalism literature with the commitment literature that is at the base of
many explanations of endogenous political institutions.7 In our parsimonious model,
we assume homogenous districts, no externalities, and direct democracy as a political
mechanism. As a consequence, we abstract from the usual trade-o¤s examined in
the federalism literature. These factors are, of course, important in determining the
optimal structure of a federation, but are already well understood. Instead, our goal
is to emphasize the overlooked dimension of commitment. Just as it is important in
understanding other institutional arrangements, it can have a key role in determining
the federal structure of a polity.
   7
     The use of institutional arrangements to provide commitment to dynamically inconsistent poli-
cies is long known in economics. It is at the base of classic arguments for central bank independence
(see, e.g., Barro and Gordon, 1983). It also features prominently in recent models of institutional
change such as Acemoglu and Robinson (2001, 2006) and Besley and Persson (2007).


                                                 5
        The underlying economic mechanism is closely related to the classic dynamic in-
consistency problem in capital taxation in the macroeconomics literature.8 Indeed,
Rogo¤ (1985), Kehoe (1989) and Tabellini (1990) show that policy coordination be-
tween countries might not be desirable because tax competition imposes potentially
bene…cial low capital taxes. We show that partial centralization provides a natural
way to voters of trading o¤ the bene…ts and the costs of this competition.9
   Our analysis is also related to a small literature that is interested in the posi-
tive determinants of the structure of federations. Crémer and Palfrey (2000) exam-
ine whether voters support stringent control of district policy by federal authorities.
Closer to our analysis, Crémer and Palfrey (1999) use a one-dimensional median
voter framework to determine the relative weight that centrally voted policies versus
district-level policies have on citizens’utility. This weight can be interpreted as the
degree of decentralization. Their mechanism di¤ers from ours in that uncertainty as
opposed to commitment plays a prominent role.10 Bodenstein and Ursprung (2005)
provide a numerical analysis of the degree of decentralization that results from a simi-
lar constitutional choice. In their paper, however, the emphasis is on the bene…ts that
political yardstick competition conveys. Finally, Dixit and Londregan (1998) take the
structure of government as given but also consider the redistributional consequences
of federal arrangements.
        The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the
general model of partial decentralization. Section 3 provides the analysis of the model.
Section 4 discusses the main intuitions of the paper. The following section takes a
few functional form assumptions in order to examine the degree of decentralization
favored by each voter and provide rich comparative statics. Section 6 provides an
extension of the model to heterogeneous public goods. The last section concludes. All
proofs are in the Appendix.


2         The General Model
The economy is divided into J identical districts, each with its own local government,
and each with a total mass 1 of individuals. There are two levels of government,

provide a useful comprehensive analysis and literature review.

     Persson and Tabellini (2000, Ch. 12) discuss that federalism can be a solution to commitment
problems. We extend this insight to explicitly analyze the degree of decentralization that results in
a constitutional game.

     See also Crémer and Palfrey (1996) for a discrete version of the same mechanism.

the district level (which captures municipality or state level) and the central govern-
ment (which captures the federal level or an international level such as the European
Union). These administrations use their revenues to provide local public goods to
the citizens within their jurisdiction. There is a continuum of size 1 of such homoge-
neous public goods. District governments are responsible for providing goods [0; ],
and the national government is responsible for provision on goods ( ; 1]. therefore
constitutes a measure of the degree of decentralization in this economy and, for the
moment, we take it as given.
       Administrations must raise revenues to meet their expenses in public goods. We
consider a simple economy with a single factor of production, k. Governments have
access to both a tax on capital within their jurisdiction and a head tax.11 Denote by
  and T the tax level on capital and the head tax levied by the central government
and by      j   and Tj the level of taxation levied by district j.12 We shall assume that
taxes are constrained to be nonnegative. Denote by s (p) the amount of spending on
public good p 2 [0; 1] by the administration responsible for its provision (we denote
by sj (p) the level of spending on good p by district j). With this notation, the budget
constraint for the district government is given by
                                     Z
                                             sj (p) dp =   j kj   + Tj                                 (1)

where kj denotes the amount of capital invested in district j. The budget constraint
for the central government is given by
                                         Z   1
                                                 s (p) dp = k + T                                      (2)


where k is the economy-wide average amount of capital holdings.13
       Consumption goods are produced by a continuum of …rms at the district level
using capital. Denote by F (kj ) the production function. F (kj ) is increasing, weakly
concave, and smooth. Since it does not necessarily display constant returns to scale,
we assume that the district accrues the returns that are not captured by capital
owners. Such returns are shared equally by residents of district j.14 Denote by                    j   the

capital to be linear. See Romer (1975), Roberts (1977), and Meltzer and Richard (1981).

     Our results do not change if j and are taxes on capital returns and not capital investment.
  13
     The uniform provision of local public goods allows us to write the budget constraint at the district
                                                                             R1
level. The global budget constraint for the central government would be J        s (p) dp = ( k + T ) J
which is obviously the same.

     These can be unmodeled returns to land or unskilled and non-mobile labor. The assumption of

that capital captures its marginal contribution to production, or

                                                        j   = F 0 (kj )                                                    (3)

for each district. Moreover, we assume that capital is perfectly mobile across districts.
This implies that after-tax returns must be equalized. For large J, it follows that

                                                  r=         j             j                                               (4)

where r is the net return to capital and in equilibrium it is uniform throughout the
economy.
   We can now proceed to describe the preferences of citizens and their economic
opportunities. Citizens are endowed with some wealth that they use as collateral to
obtain capital. Afterwards they invest this capital somewhere in the economy. The
initial wealth endowment is the only source of heterogeneity in the model. Wealth
is identically distributed across districts according to some cumulative distribution
                         min       max                                                                                 n
function H ( ) on              ;         . An agent n in district j is thus endowed with                                   . If
                          n                                                                n   n
she wants to invest k units of capital, she needs to raise k                                       . We assume that
there is a credit market friction such that the repayment interest rate for her loan, l,
                                                          n

and convex.15 Therefore, her total cost of investing k n amounts to (k n                                         )l    n    .16

where cn denotes agent n’s consumption and G ( ) is a smooth, increasing, and concave
equal sharing in these returns allows us to focus on di¤erent capital holdings as the sole source of
inequality in this economy. In any case, as the example in section 3 shows, the presence of these
returns is by no means essential to our argument.
   15
      There are many examples of models of credit markets with frictions that yield interest rates
decreasing in wealth. See, for instance, Ghatak, Morelli and Sjöstrom (2007) or Banerjee (2003).
See Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) for a seminal paper that analyzes credit markets with imperfect infor-
mation, and Tirole (2006) for a textbook approach to the issue.
   16
      Imperfect capital markets is just a simple way of introducing endogenous and unequally held
capital in the economy. We want to capture the idea that available productive capital in an economy
is a function of past investment and savings decisions. Obviously, heterogeneous capital holdings
could be endogenized in many other ways. In the case of human capital, could capture a di¤erential
cost of attending school. In the case of past labor supply decisions, ccould simply scale labor supply
costs. All is needed is a capital generation cost (k n ; n ) increasing and convex in k n and satisfying
a single crossing condition with respect to n .

                                                                     8
function of spending in the publicly provided goods that the agent will enjoy.17 Given
the taxation patterns described above, agent n in district j enjoys consumption equal
to
                                 cnj = rk n + F (kj )      j kj   Tj   T                           (5)

where rk n are the net returns to her capital investment, which she can invest anywhere
in the economy. F (kj )            j kj   are her returns to living in district j. Finally,   Tj    T
are head taxes she incurs living in district j.
       The timing of the model is as follows.

   1. Each agent n in each district j decides how much capital to raise, k n .

   2. By simple majority, taking the net rate of return to capital r, and the district
         budget constraint as given, the citizens in each district choose the Condorcet
         winner in their policy space ( j ; Tj ; sj (p) ; p 2 [0; ]).

   3. By simple majority, taking the budget constraint as given, all the citizenry
         chooses the Condorcet winner in the policy space of the central government
         ( ; T ; s (p) ; p 2 ( ; 1]).

   4. After observing taxation patterns across the economy, agents decide in which
         district to invest their productive capital, k n .

       This model has a number of noteworthy features. First, note that the local public
goods we discuss here could also be publicly provided private goods, given that we
do not allow for citizen mobility. In particular, note that a citizen of district j does
not obtain any utility from resources spent by district i in these goods. Therefore we
abstract from cross-district spillovers.
    Second, while citizens are heterogeneous in their endowment , districts are iden-
tical because the distribution of is the same across districts. Hence, we also abstract
from district heterogeneity.
       Third, we use a quasilinear utility function for consumption and publicly provided
goods. With this assumption, we ensure that there are no income e¤ects in the
enjoyment of such public goods and all citizens enjoy them in the same degree. Any
tension in deciding the provision level will thus come from the use of taxes that a¤ect
citizens di¤erently. Another helpful consequence of quasilinearity is the fact that
  17
    For an agent living in district j, s (p) = sj (p) for goods [0; ]. Goods ( ; 1], being provided by
the central government, have a funding level of s (p) that is equal across districts.



                                                      9
the outcomes of the political contest at the district level become separable from the
political contest at the central level.
    Finally note that for simplicity we focus on the case where J is large and therefore
all districts take the net rate of return on capital r as given.


2.1     De…nition of Equilibrium
For a given level of decentralization , a subgame perfect equilibrium is a capital
investment decision function k (r; ) for 2 min ; max , policy decisions T; ; s (p)
for p 2 [ ; 1] ; Tj ; j ; j j=1;:::;J ; fsj (p) for p 2 [0; ]gj=1;:::;J , an after-tax rate of
return on capital r, and investment location decisions such that

    1. Capital markets are perfectly competitive both intra- and interdistrict:             j   =
      F 0 (kj ) in each district and r, the after-tax rate of return in each district, is
        j        j.


    2. The district citizens, taking the rate of return on capital r and their budget
      constraint as given, choose the Condorcet winner in their policy space.

    3. The citizenry, taking the central government budget constraint as given, chooses
       the Condorcet winner in its policy space.
                                                                         min       max
    4. Agents choose to invest an amount of capital k (r; ) ;       2          ;         to max-
       imize their utility.

    We note that, as in many models where the tax base reacts to expected taxation
levels, there may be multiple equilibria. In particular, there may exist equilibria on
the wrong side of the La¤er curve, where the total revenue of the government is locally
decreasing in the level of taxation. In such situations, we only consider equilibria in
the increasing side of the La¤er curve, i.e. that a small increase in the (expected)
capital tax rate yields an increase in government revenues. We call such equilibria,
standard equilibria.


3     Characterization of Equilibrium
3.1     The Problem of the Central Government
We begin the analysis at stage 3. At this stage, the whole of the citizenry decides
on capital taxes, head taxes and public good provision by the central government.

This vote takes place after capital raising decisions have been taken and therefore
the resulting policy will depend on the predetermined distribution of capital across
voters.
                                                                                                           n
       We …rst introduce some notation to describe such capital holdings. Let k (                              ; r) be
                                                                                 n
the amount of capital held by an agent with endowment                                who expects an after-tax
rate of return on capital r. It follows that
                                              Z        max

                                      k (r)                    k ( ; r) dH ( )

is the amount of capital held in a district when the expected net return is r. Since
there is a mass of size 1 of citizens in each district, k (r) is also the average amount
                                                                 med
of capital per voter. Also, we let k med                   k            ; r be the amount of capital held by
                                                               med 18
the citizen with the median endowment,                            .      We shall assume that

                                                                k (r)
                                         1<        (r)                <1

for all r. Therefore we consider unequal capital holdings such the median voter has
less capital than the average taxpayer.19                         (r) thus captures the level of ex post
inequality (after capital decisions are taken).
   Inequality generates political con‡ict between voters. Capital rich voters prefer to
use head taxes to fund public good provision so that every recipient of the public good
pays the same amount for it. In contrast, capital poor voters prefer to use capital
taxes. Since capital is unequally held but public good enjoyment is uniform, public
good provision funded by capital taxes becomes a redistributive tool.
   To characterize the result of the political contest, we shall …rst consider the pre-
ferred policy from the perspective of the median voter, i.e., the agent with endowment
 med
        , and later show that the median voter’s ideal point is indeed a Condorcet winner
within the policy space of the central government.
   The problem for the median voter in some district j is
                             Z                     Z   1
                                                                                         med       k med

       T; ;s(p)              0

   Therefore, H( m ed ) = 21 .

   This is a standard assumption in voting settings with inequality. See, for instance, Persson and
Tabellini (2000) and references contained therein.

   However, the relevant maximand for the median voter is much smaller for two
reasons. First, k med is determined before this stage, and hence the costs of raising
it are irrelevant at the time of voting. Second, the utility function is quasilinear in
consumption. As a result, additive separability allows us to drop many terms. Using
the expression for citizen’s consumption (5) and the capital markets condition (4),
the median voter’s problem reduces to
                                                        Z   1

subject to the national government’s budget constraint.
   Consider …rst the decision of how to spend in public goods s (p) a …xed amount
of raised revenues. The concavity of G makes this problem particularly simple: all
voters agree that any revenues raised at the central government should be spent
equally across the 1           public goods the central government is responsible for. It
                       k+T
follows that s (p) =   1
                           .
   Since average capital holdings k are …xed at the time of voting, capital taxes are
not distortive ex post. The median voter thus faces a choice between two nondistortive
forms of taxation. This choice is easy: a median voter with less than average capital
always prefers capital taxes over head taxes. This is because capital taxes allow her
to shift the tax burden to citizens with higher capital holdings. Hence, as long as
       k
     km e d
            > 1, the preferred tax policy of the median voter is

                                            ^k
                                   G0               =            1
                                                                     <1               (6)
                                        1
                                                  T^ = 0:

   With quasilinear preferences and available head taxes, the e¢ cient level of public
provision is set at G0 ( ) = 1. Hence, according to (6), the median voter favors
excess provision of public goods. To build intuition for this result, recall that the
median voter is using public provision of goods as a redistributive tool from the
average capital owner to herself. Since she faces less than the average tax burden,
she increases redistribution by voting for an expanded supply of public goods.
   Condition (6) also shows that the total revenue raised in capital taxes, ^k, in-

                                                   12
creases in ex post inequality,         . This is natural: the less capital the median voter
holds, the more she bene…ts from using capital taxes. In the limit in which she held
no capital, she would face no tax burden and therefore she would vote for in…nite tax-
ation. Therefore, a larger degree of inequality increases the desire for redistribution
in a natural result reminiscent of Meltzer and Richard (1981) and Roberts (1977).
   Finally, note that the shape of G ( ) also a¤ects the degree to which central public
goods are overprovided. Since in this model redistribution is channeled through public
good provision, G ( ) ultimately a¤ects how e¢ ciently utility can be transferred from
rich voters to poor voters. If G ( ) is very concave, then the marginal utility of public
goods diminishes very fast and the median voter does not gain much from an excess
supply of public goods. In such a case, we say that redistributive e¢ ciency is low.20
Conversely, if G ( ) is close to linear, large quantities of public good can be provided
before diminishing marginal utility sets in. In such a case of high redistributive
e¢ ciency, (6) implies that capital tax revenues are much larger and central public
goods are grossly oversupplied.
       In sum, given , capital taxes and central public good provision are increasing
in the demand for redistribution— captured by inequality,                   — and in the ease with
which utility can be transferred— which we call redistributive e¢ ciency.
   It remains to be shown, however, that the preferences of the median voter consti-
tute the Condorcet winner under majority voting. Notice that this is not immediate
given that the problem is multidimensional. To see that the policy preferred by the
median agent is indeed a Condorcet winner, consider …gure 1. In this …gure we con-
sider taxation units such that iso-budget curves slope at minus 45 degrees.21 Consider
any policy other than the most favored by the median voter. If it involves a higher
capital tax, as well as a positive head tax (a policy in region A of …gure 1), then the
policy with the same capital tax and no head tax will be favored by all voters; at its
turn, this policy is dominated by the policy with no head taxes and a capital tax ^ in
the eyes of all voters with an amount of capital greater than or equal to the median
amount of capital. Hence, by individual transitivity of preferences, (^; 0) is preferred
to any alternative policy in region A by a majority of voters. If the alternative policy
has a higher total level of funding, but a lower capital tax (a policy in region B of
  20
      This is probably true of expenditures in public parks or basic infrastructure such as the judiciary.
Simply put, a bloated judicial system is clearly a very poor way of transfering utility from rich voters
to poor voters. Redistributive e¢ ciency using this channel is therefore very low.
   21
      As discussed above, given a set amount of revenue, it is clear that all voters wish to spend it in
the most e¢ cacious way on public goods. Therefore the political tension is over the level of T and

…gure 1) then the policy that holds funding constant, while decreasing the head tax
and increasing the capital tax to ^ is favored by all voters with less capital than the
mean. At this point, reducing the head tax to 0 is favored by all voters, since with a
capital tax of ^ each public good has a marginal return of less than one. Hence, again
by individual transitivity of preferences, (^; 0) is preferred to any policy in region B by
a majority of voters. Finally, consider a policy with a lower total level of funding than
(^; 0) (a policy in region C). Again, decreasing the head tax to zero and increasing the
capital tax while holding funding constant is favored by all voters with less capital
than average. After that, increasing the capital tax is favored by all voters with less
than or equal to the capital of the median voter. Hence, by individual transitivity of
preferences, (^; 0) is preferred to any policy in region C by a majority of voters.
   We summarize these results in the following proposition:

3.2      The Problem of the District Government
The political game at the district level is very di¤erent from the con‡ict with respect
to central government policies. The ability of capital to ‡ee from districts with high
capital taxation plays a crucial role in this di¤erence. Recall that district policies are
decided after capital is raised but before citizens decide in which district to invest.
   Consider the district tax and spending policy favored by a given agent n with
                      n
endowment                 . The problem of this generic voter n in district j is:
                                         Z                           Z    1
                                                                                                                   n        kn
           max                 cnj   +          G (sj (p)) dp +               G (s (p)) dp             (k n            )l    n   :
      kj ;Tj ;   j ;sj (p)                 0


Again, the relevant maximand is much simpler. k n , the amount of capital that agent
n commands, is determined before this stage; this is in contrast to kj , the amount
of capital invested in district j, which is a¤ected by tax policy. Quasilinearity of
preferences also implies again that many terms drop from the problem. Using the
expression for citizen’s consumption (5), we can reduce the program to
                                                                                         Z
                                  max               F (kj )     j kj          Tj +               G (s (pj )) dpj                     (7)

and the constraint from capital mobility

                                                           r=    j            j          :

   This program has two important and related features that distinguish it from the
median voter’s problem of the last subsection. First, there is a direct relationship
between j and kj given by the capital mobility constraint. A district that chooses
high capital taxes su¤ers from lower capital supply as capital ‡ees to neighboring
districts. This is costly because district j voters care about kj . Through F (kj )                                                  j kj
citizens can appropriate any returns to production that are not assigned to capital.
In addition, any revenues collected using capital taxes, j kj , can reduce head taxes
and help provide district public goods. For these two reasons citizens want to attract
capital to their districts. In contrast, since aggregate capital k is …xed at the central
level, there is no relationship between                                and k and hence there is no direct cost of

                                                                     15
increasing central capital taxes.
   Second, note that k n (and therefore n ) is absent from (7). The reason is that
each district is too small to a¤ect aggregate net returns to capital r. Capital owners
in district i are therefore safe from high capital taxes in their home district as they
can obtain the rate of return r simply by moving their capital to district j. Hence, the
fact that agents command di¤erent amounts of productive capital is inconsequential,
and agent heterogeneity drops out of the district problem. This implies that there
is no political con‡ict within the district: all citizens agree on tax and spending
decisions at the district level. In contrast, at the central level capital cannot escape
taxation. Central capital taxes reduce net returns to capital thereby generating a
political con‡ict between large and small capital holders.
   Since all agents share the same preferences with respect to district policies, the
Condorcet winner is simply the policy most preferred by every single agent.
                                                                                              j kj +Tj
   Note again that it is immediate from the concavity of G that sj (p) =                                 .
Plugging this condition in the objective function we obtain

                                                                            j kj   + Tj
                     max           F (kj )     j kj        Tj + G
                    kj ;Tj ;   j



Now, taking the …rst order condition with respect to Tj it is immediate that

                                                 j kj     + Tj
                                         G0                            =1                          (8)

which implies the Samuelson condition: each good is provided at the e¢ cient level as
the opportunity cost of public funds equals 1. The …rst order condition with respect
to kj , plugging in (8), yields

                                         F 0 (kj )         j   +   j   =0

which, using (3), immediately implies                 j   = 0. Therefore public goods at the district
level are entirely funded by head taxes. Intuitively, as long as any head tax is used,
(8) implies that the level of public provision is …xed. Moreover, districts want to
attract capital in order to reduce their head tax burden. This leads to competition
across districts. Assuming that districts are price takers (i.e. they take r as given),
competition for capital is perfect and hence all rents at the district level are dissipated
in equilibrium: capital taxes are driven to 0 and local public goods are fully …nanced

by head taxes.22 We have established the following proposition:

Proposition 2 For any level of decentralization , each district government will ef-
…ciently provide each public good (i.e. G0 (sj (p)) = 1 for all j = 1; :::; J; p 2 [0; ])
using only a head tax.


3.3       The Initial Problem of the Citizen
At the initial stage of the game, citizens decide how much capital to raise. The prob-
                                                                                                                        n
lem of agent n in district j is simply to pick the k n level that maximizes u (cn ; s (j) ; k n ; kj ;                      )
for an equilibrium-consistent expectation over r, j , , Tj , and T . Again, because
quasilinearity implies additive separability and individual decisions do not a¤ect ag-
gregate k and kj , this problem reduces to

                                                                  n            kn
                                max
                                 n
                                    rk n           (k n               )l        n
                                 k


for an equilibrium-consistent expected return r. Note that due to capital mobility,
this decision is independent of the district j where the agent lives. Thanks to the
convexity of l ( ), this objective function is globally concave. The …rst order condition
is
                                             kn        kn     0       kn
                                 r       l    n            nl              n    =0                               (9)

                                                                                    n
which implicitly de…nes the capital holding function k (                                ; r). Note that the objective
                                     n        n
function is supermodular in k and                 . It follows that citizens with larger endowments
  will raise more capital. It is also immediate from the maximization problem that the
citizens will, regardless of endowment, demand more capital the higher the expected
after-tax rate of return. This implies that a high expected level of capital taxes results
in a lower level of aggregate capital. This is at the core of the time inconsistency
problem that we discuss in the next section.
     22
    Essentially, the district is trying to maximize returns at the district level buying capital from a
competitive market for capital at price r + . E¢ ciency then requires that capital is rented up to
the level where F 0 (kj ) = r + . If the district taxes capital at any positive level, capital mobility
condition (4) requires that the district obtains less capital than would be e¢ cient. Therefore, it is
optimal to refrain from capital taxation and raise revenues using exclusively head taxes.




                                                      17
4      Time Inconsistency, Capital Taxation, and De-
       centralization
Capital decisions are made before voting on taxes. As a consequence, the median
voter takes the amount of capital in the economy as given, and her desired taxes only
consider the trade-o¤ between her individual consumption lost to capital taxes and
her desire for public provision of goods. To see this, condition (6) can be rewritten
as
                                     kG0 ( )    k med = 0:                                (10)

    The …rst term captures the marginal gains from increasing capital taxes, namely
an increased level of public good spending. The only marginal cost associated to such
increase is the capital tax that the median voter herself has to pay, captured by the
second term.
   In contrast, if the median voter had to decide on capital taxes ex ante, before
capital decisions are made, she would consider an additional cost of high marginal
taxes. This additional cost is given by the fact that an increase in capital taxes
depresses capital stocks and therefore reduces the pool from which to redistribute.
To establish this, consider the following ex ante problem of capital taxation at the
central level.
                     8                                             9

where we already take into account that districts use head taxes and the central
government will only use capital taxes. The …rst order condition that determines the
level of capital taxes that the median voter prefers ex ante is

                                                                       @k

   The third term in (11), which is the only di¤erence with respect to (10), captures
the e¤ect of capital taxes on aggregate capital supply. Obviously @@k < 0, which
implies that this term is negative.23 Within the parentheses, we see that the median
voter cares about aggregate capital k for three reasons. First, G0 ( ) captures the
  23
     Note that the envelope theorem ensures that the e¤ect of changing    on the median voter’s
utility through the change in k m ed is zero.



                                               18
fact that a larger capital stock implies more public goods for the same level of taxes.
Second, F 00 (k) k captures the marginal e¤ect on the gains to the district when
capital supply is higher. Finally, the only cost of an increased capital supply is the
fact that the marginal return to capital diminishes. The size of this e¤ect on the
median voter is given by F 00 (k) k med . Since k med < k, it is clear that the …rst two
forces dominate the third, and the median voter prefers an enlarged aggregate stock
of capital. As a consequence, the capital tax that she would vote for ex ante is lower
than the capital tax she ends up voting for ex post.
   We have established the following result.

Lemma 1 The median voter’s preferred capital tax rate at the beginning of the game
is lower than the Condorcet winning capital tax rate ex post.

   Since agents are forward looking, they expect high capital taxes and respond by
reducing the capital stock, which hurts the redistribution ‡ows that the median voter
perceives ex post. As a consequence, in equilibrium, despite the fact that the preferred
ex post rate of the median voter is implemented, she would gain from the ability to
commit to lower capital taxes ex ante.
   It is, however, notoriously di¢ cult to commit to policies such as taxes. There
are many reasons why governments want to tailor taxation policies to time-varying
circumstances and as a consequence tax schedules are typically determined on a yearly
basis. As long as the horizon of capital investments is longer than the interval between
tax changes, voters cannot commit not to tax capital once it is deployed, and hence
they su¤er from this lack of commitment.
   This simple model, however, suggests a second-best solution to this commitment
problem. In the analysis of the model in Section 3, we have taken the degree of
decentralization as a given institutional parameter. However, it is easy to show
that   a¤ects overall capital taxes in equilibrium because the public goods that are
provided by the central government are funded via capital taxes, while district public
goods are funded using head taxes. It follows that an increase in decentralization
should lead to a reduction in overall capital taxation. The following proposition
establishes that this is indeed the case when we have a unique standard equilibrium.

Proposition 3 If       does not increase too fast in    , any standard equilibrium is
unique, and the equilibrium capital tax rate + j is a decreasing function of decen-
tralization:
                                d ( + j)      d
                                            =   <0
                                    d         d

                                          19
       The intuition behind this proposition follows directly from the equilibrium struc-
ture of taxation. District governments face tax competition for capital and hence
they always set j = 0, irrespective of . In contrast, the median voter always votes
for capital taxes to be used by the central government. However, as                increases, the
central government is responsible for less public goods. Since there are diminishing
returns to each good, the same tax revenues spread across less goods provide less
utility, which reduces incentives to redistribute. As a consequence, the median voter
prefers to reduce      when decentralization increases.
       In most countries, the allocation of responsibilities between the di¤erent layers of
government is either enshrined in the Constitution or requires major legislative e¤orts
to change. This stands in contrast with taxation policy, which is typically decided
every year during the budgetary process, and hence is subject to the commitment
problem highlighted here. Institutional arrangements can not be so …nely tailored
as budgetary policy, but this lack of ‡exibility comes with an important bene…t: the
electorate, by voting on constitutional arrangements, is able to precommit to institu-
tional features in a way it can not with respect to policy. Insofar as the allocation of
public good provision between local and central governments is an institutional fea-
ture, Proposition 3 suggests that it provides a strong commitment device to a reduced
level of capital taxation.
       The question then becomes: if we allow for an ex ante vote on the Constitution,
should we expect the median voter to support a decentralized Constitution?
   By the argument above, the median voter should be willing to commit at least to
some decentralization ex ante. However, complete decentralization will not typically
be optimal from her perspective: every good that is transferred from the central
government to the district governments cannot be used as a redistributive device. An
increase in decentralization thus reduces the ability to redistribute and it is therefore
costly to the median voter. However, by decentralizing a few goods, the median voter
can commit to a limited level of capital taxation and can thereby increase capital
stocks. These larger capital holdings might compensate for the lower level of capital
taxes and generate more revenue to redistribute. Therefore, the median voter typically
prefers an interior solution to the constitutional problem that entails a partial level
of decentralization.24
       Note that this argument does not rely on the 1         centralized goods being directly
  24
    It is also important to note that the partial decentralization solution is not perfect from the
point of view of the median voter. It implies an ine¢ ciency because some public goods will receive
higher funding than others. Indeed, the preferred constitution by the median citizen would be one
in which she could commit to an upper bound to capital taxes.


                                                20
provided by the central government. What matters is which level of government
has the ability to determine the quantity supplied of a given public good, and the
responsibility to raise funds to meet this need. Speci…cally, suppose that the central
government raises funds and then transfers this money to the districts to provide a
centrally determined level s(p) of public good p. In this case the actual providers
would be the districts, but the incentives for capital taxation would remain high.
Hence, in the context of the model, this good p would count as centrally provided.
Note also that in this model, transfers of centrally raised money to be spend at the
will of the district do not count as decentralization either, because tax competition
does not impair the ability of raising such funds via capital taxes.25 To help in the
commitment problem, a decentralized good must be characterized by having both the
quantity supply decision and the fund-raising done at the district level.
       In the following section we assume speci…c functional forms which allow us to ex-
plicitly solve for the level of decentralization preferred by the median voter. In such
an example we can explore comparative statics on how the preferred level of decen-
tralization varies with factors such as productivity, inequality, or the redistributive
nature of publicly provided goods.


5        The Equilibrium Level of Decentralization
With general functional forms, the study of the equilibrium level of decentralization is
impaired by two problems. First, since            (r) is endogenous, multiple equilibria could
exist, which obviously complicates comparative statics. Second, some concepts such
as redistributive e¢ ciency lack a clear parameter of reference. Hence, to examine the
full constitutional game, we consider a particular case of the model developed above.
       Assume that technology is linear in k, F (k) = Ak, where A captures the general
                                                                    kn        kn
level of productivity in this economy. Moreover, let l               n    =    n   . Finally, assume
that G(s(p)) = [s(p)] 1 , for < 1. As before, we consider a distribution of types
H ( ) such that the expected value, is greater than the median value, med . It is
straightforward to see that these functional assumptions satisfy the conditions of the
general model.
       Note that   captures redistributive e¢ ciency. If        is very close to 1, redistribution
  25
     These types of arrangements are prevalent in a number of countries in Latin America, including
Argentina, Brazil, and Columbia. In Argentina, for instance, while more than 80% of revenues were
generated at the federal level in the early 1990s, less than half of the expenditures were done at the
federal level. Please see Ter-Minassian (1997) for further details of the institutional arrangements
for these and other countries with regards to …scal decentralization.


                                                 21
through public provision performs very similarly to the classic case of proportional
taxes on income and lump-sum equal transfers back to all citizens. Conversely, if
is close to 0, public funds are not easy to transfer through public good provision as
marginal utility for such goods diminishes very quickly. The justice system might be
a good example of a public service with a very small , while a public health system
system would have relatively high .26
   We therefore consider a constitutional game with the following timing:

   1. By simple majority a Constitution is chosen such that the degree of decentral-
         ization,     , is determined.

   2. Each agent n in each district j decides how much capital to raise, k n .

   3. By simple majority, taking the net rate of return to capital, r, and the district
      budget constraint as given, the citizens in each district choose the Condorcet
         winner in their policy space ( j ; Tj ; sj (p) ; p 2 [0; ]).

   4. By simple majority, taking the budget constraint as given, all the citizenry
      chooses the Condorcet winner in the policy space of the central government
         ( ; T ; s (p) ; p 2 ( ; 1]).

   5. After observing taxation patterns across the economy, agents decide in which
      district to invest their productive capital, k n .

       We begin the analysis at the second stage, using the results in the previous section,
before moving to the Constitutional vote.
   The problem of agent n in district j simpli…es to

                                                                               n       kn
                       max
                        n
                           E k(A                    j)    T   Tj        (k n       )       n   (12)

                                                                                       n
and yields a solution that is proportional to her endowment,
                                               n
                                        kn =       [E(A            j)     1]                   (13)
                                               2

   As before, an agent with a richer endowment, expecting a net rate of return
r = E(A         j ), raises more capital because her collateral allows her to access

loans at lower rates.27
  26
     Note that for the case where waste and bureaucratic expenses increase more than proportionately
in the funds to be disbursed, direct lump-sum transfers can also be captured by a high .
  27
     For simplicity, we shall assume A large enough so that k n > n

                                                         22
   With linear technology there are no returns to the district. As a consequence, the
problem of the district government is particularly simple
                                          8                                 9
                                                        Tj +   j kj
                                          <                                1=
                               max            Tj +                                :
                               Tj ;   j   :                                 ;

This objective function already assumes that public spending will be equally dis-
tributed across the         goods. Note that with linear technology, the capital mobility
constraint is particularly tight. In particular, district d only receives any capital in-
vestment at all if d = min f j g. In short, district compete à la Bertrand for capital.
Not surprisingly, such competition between districts yields                           j   = 0 8j 2 J. Hence, the
voting equilibrium at the district level is ( j ; Tj ) = (0; ).
   The problem of the median voter for central government policies is slightly more
involved. Integrating (13), and taking into account E( j ) = 0 in equilibrium, we
obtain
     Z the average level of capital as a function of expected taxation. This yields
         n
k =     2
           [A E( ) 1] h( )d = A E(2 ) 1 , where is the expected value of the
distribution H ( ) of abilities to generate capital. With this, we can write

                                                                           T+ k

the linear-quadratic formulation is that ex post inequality equals ex ante inequality
and is independent of r. We thus have

thanks to our initial assumptions on H ( ). Hence, no head taxes are used. Taking
the …rst order condition with respect to yields

where     =    1
                   . It is clear from this condition that the total revenues collected
                                                      +1
with capital taxes, k, equal (1                   )        . Therefore, total capital tax revenue is
increasing in inequality and in redistributive e¢ ciency . As in the general model,
this is natural: inequality refers to the median voter’s desire for redistribution, and

                                                       23
redistributive e¢ ciency speaks to the feasibility of redistribution. Note also that
capital tax revenue is decreasing in , the degree of decentralization, as was discussed
in the previous section. This formulation thus con…rms the intuitions built with the
general model.
   The equilibrium level of capital taxes and capital generation can be found by
solving the non-linear system of equations (13) and (14). By doing so, one obtains a
well-de…ned capital generation function k n ( n ; ; ; ) for the standard equilibrium
of this model.

Proposition 4 The linear-quadratic model admits a unique standard equilibrium.
This equilibrium features the following comparative statics for all agents n:

       @kn
  1.   @
             >0
       @kn
  2.   @
             <0
       @kn
  3.   @
             <0
       @kn
  4.   @A
             >0

                                       n
   Since (13) is proportional to           and    is common for all voters, the equilibrium
capital level of any agent n is proportional to k. This is the reason why the com-
parative statics in Proposition 4 are common for all voters. These are also true for
the aggregate level of capital held in the economy. Note again that an increase in
decentralization reduces the level of capital taxation expected by agents, thereby
generating a bigger stock of productive capital. Holding         constant, however, we …nd
other natural comparative statics.
    As redistributive e¢ ciency increases, aggregate capital contracts. As discussed
at length above, as increases, the median voter prefers an increased supply of public
goods to redistribute in her favor. As a consequence, she is tempted to increase capital
taxation. These expectations depress capital generation.
   Similar intuition lies behind the result that capital generation is decreasing in in-
equality, . Again, as inequality increases, the temptation to expand public spending
in order to redistribute becomes stronger because the tax burden is more unevenly
allocated. In such circumstances, expected capital taxation increases which reduces
incentives to hold capital.
    Finally, an increase in productivity increases returns to capital. Since in this linear
model ex post inequality     is constant, these excess returns are not taxed away and
therefore capital reacts positively.

5.1       The Constitutional Problem
We now examine the initial stage in which voters decide on                                      , the level of decen-
tralization that they want enshrined in the Constitution. Since the Constitution is
decided by a majority vote, we …rst consider the problem of the median voter before
showing that her preferred position is again the Condorcet winner in the constitu-
tional stage.
   Taking as given the taxation and investment decisions that will follow, her problem
can be written as

                                                                                            k                   Tj
                                                       k med                            1
                                                                                                    1                 1
           med                 med           med
 max k           (A    )   k                            med
                                                                    Tj + (1         )                   +

The …rst two terms correspond to her private returns to capital. The third term is her
expected head tax and the last two terms correspond to her enjoyment of publicly
provided goods. By using the results in the previous subsection, we can further
simplify this expression to

                                                               med      k med                               1
                 max k med (A         )       k med                      med
                                                                                    + (1        )                    (15)

       This program is well behaved, and it always yields a unique solution. In particular,
because k med is a concave function of , we obtain:

Lemma 2 Program (15) is globally concave.

       Hence, we can proceed to examine the …rst order condition of this problem:

                                             d         ;k                       1
                                     k med                          1               =0
                                                   d

The last two terms encapsulate the costs that the median voter su¤ers when decen-
tralization increases: …rst, her head taxes increase as decentralized goods are funded
with such taxes. This has a constant marginal cost of 1. Second, the level of provision
of decentralized goods is lower than for centralized goods due to the lost incentive to
redistribute. This e¤ect is captured by the last term and is larger if inequality                                    and
transferability       are high.
    The gains that the median voter obtains from an increase in decentralization are
in the …rst term.28 Clearly, these gains come from the fact that decreases as
  28
    Due to the envelope condition, the bene…ts that the median voter perceives from increased
decentralization are not related to her own adjustment in k m ed .

                                                               25
increases. Note that using (14), we can write                 ; k . It follows that this adjustment
of    has two components:

                              d        ;k         @   @ @k
                                            =       +      <0
                                   d              @   @k @

The …rst component is the direct e¤ect: keeping the capital stock constant, as de-
centralization increases capital taxes mechanically decrease as they are to be spent
on less goods. This is the e¤ect we have emphasized in Section 4. However, there
is a second force that corresponds to aggregate capital adjustment: as there is more
capital in the economy, lower capital taxes can raise larger amounts of revenue. We
call this second channel the indirect e¤ect of decentralization on capital taxes.
     Using (14) to derive the direct and indirect e¤ects we obtain

                          d       ;k                      +1 1           @k
                                       =                             2      :
                              d                 k med            k       @

Hence the direct and indirect gains of the change in                 for the median voter are both
increasing in     and   . This is intuitive as inequality and redistributive e¢ ciency
increase in equilibrium. It is then natural that the reduction in caused by an
increase in decentralization is bigger when and are high. Using this expression,
the …rst order condition of program 15 can be simpli…ed to:

                                        1         @k                     1
                                  +                  =1+                                      (16)
                                            k     @

It follows that the median voter’s incentives to decentralize do not have an obvious
relationship with and as both bene…ts and costs are increasing in and .
    On the one hand, the marginal cost of decentralizing, in the right hand side of
(16), is increasing in both   and       for most values. This is again because an increase
in either parameter increases the returns to redistribution. And obviously, if the
median voter wants to increase redistribution, she should favor less decentralization
at the constitutional stage.
     On the other hand, these exacerbated incentives to redistribute worsen the com-
mitment problem and further contract aggregate capital. As a consequence, the ex
ante marginal gains to decentralization, in the left hand side of (16), also increase in
  and . According to this commitment problem, the median voter would gain more
from an increase in decentralization when               and     are high. The following proposi-
tion characterizes the optimal degree of decentralization and explores the comparative

Proposition 5 Program (15) de…nes a unique optimal level of decentralization

     for > ~ ( ).

   Given the complex forces that the median voter faces, it is quite striking that we
obtain some unambiguous comparative statics. The intuition for the …rst result is,
however, clear. An increase in productivity A increases the incentives to generate
capital while keeping the incentives to tax it constant. In that case, the median agent
can a¤ord to reduce the level of decentralization: this allows the median voter to
redistribute some of the returns to this additional capital accumulated.
   Despite the opposite incentives that the median voter faces with respect to redis-
tributive e¢ ciency , the commitment problem dominates. An increase in implies
high ex post incentives to raise and the median voter prefers to increase decentral-
ization to avoid the capital contraction that these expectations generate.
   This is not always true, however, for an increase in inequality. Note, in particular,
that when the median voter expects to have the same amount of capital as the median
voter, i.e. = 1, she prefers full decentralization, i.e. = 1, to ensure that only head
taxes are used. From this point, if inequality marginally increases, the median voter
wants to centralize a few goods: since inequality is still small, expected capital taxes
are small and hence capital accumulation distortions are not large enough to make
the median voter relinquish this opportunity for redistribution. For higher levels of
inequality, however, these distortions increase and eventually the ex post temptation
to redistribute is too costly. At that point, the median voter prefers to gradually
decentralize to avoid such costs. Figure 2 shows the evolution of              as inequality
increases, for a given level of transferability = 1.



                                             27
Figure 2: Graph of the optimal level of decentralization as a function of inequality.
Note that for no inequality, full decentralization is optimal, while with some inequality,
the median voter prefers less than full decentralization. However, as inequality grows,
the median voter prefers more decentralization as a means of precommitment.


   To see how the median voter’s optimal level of decentralization evolves with in-
equality and redistributive e¢ ciency, Figure 3 shows the three-dimensional plot. As
can be readily seen, for any given level of inequality, the optimal degree of decen-
tralization is (weakly) increasing in the redistributive e¢ ciency of the public good,
which is parameterized by . Furthermore, when inequality is zero, the median voter
always wishes to fully decentralize, so as to ensure the use of nondistortive head taxes.
However, as redistributive e¢ ciency increases, the need to commit becomes more im-
portant to the median voter; hence, for higher levels of , optimal decentralization
rises sooner with respect to the level of inequality.


5.2    Preferences for Decentralization
In the previous subsection we have shown that, in general, the very median agent
that decides on taxation patterns ex post prefers to tie her hands ex ante by voting
for an interior level of decentralization. We still need to determine, however, that
the preferences of the median voter are the Condorcet winner at the Constitutional
stage. For this, we need to determine the preferences for decentralization for the rest
of the citizens. This turns out to be a simple problem. In particular, we can write the
constitutional program that the median agent solves (15), for a generic agent with


                                           28
Figure 3: Graph of the optimal level of decentralization as a function of inequality
and transferability. Note that for public goods with a quickly diminishing marginal
utility (i.e. low ), the optimal level of decentralization is decreasing in inequality
over a larger range.


endowment . Denote by       ( ) the solution to the following program:

                                                      k( )                 1
           max k ( ) [A      ( )]   (k ( )        )          + (1   )              (18)

The last two terms do not depend on due to the fact that taxation and redistribution
decisions will ex post be decided by the median agent, conditional on constitutional
arrangements. Hence the tension over      only depends on k ( ). It is intuitive, then,
that the higher the ability to raise capital, the lower the level of capital taxation
preferred and therefore the higher the degree of decentralization favored.

Proposition 6 Program (18) admits a unique solution,          ( ). This solution is such
that
                                      @ ( )
                                            >0
                                       @

   The unique solution follows from the fact that (18) is concave in . Therefore
voter’s preferences are single-peaked. The proposition states that their ideal point is
increasing in and hence it follows that at the Constitutional stage, the degree of
decentralization favored by the median agent is the Condorcet winner. Moreover, this
proposition also implies that there should be a relationship between capital ownership,

                                             29
preferences for capital taxation and public spending, and preferences for decentraliza-
tion. In particular, political parties that represent capital owners should put forward
platforms that favor low taxes on capital, a low level of public expenditure, and a
higher degree of decentralization. In our model, decentralization becomes the way
of obtaining the …rst two items on this agenda. The position in these dimensions of
parties such as the Republican Party in the United States are therefore consistent
with a political economy view of the degree of decentralization.


6      Heterogenous Public Goods
In this section we explore whether the commitment problem prescribes a distribu-
tion of public goods between central and local administrations that is orthogonal to
spillovers or di¤erences in taste. We use the same utility function over public goods
                                                 [s(p)]    1
in the previous section, G(s(p)) =                             . However, we now assume that goods are
heterogeneous. In particular, there are many types of public goods, and each is char-
acterized by h 2 (0; 1], h 2 H = f1; 2; :::; Hg with h < h0 if h < h0 . Furthermore,
for each type of good, there is a continuum of size 1 of these goods.
     A decentralization scheme is now a set of f                        h gh2H ,   such that 0          h   1.       h   is
the degree of decentralization of goods of type h: local governments will provide h
                                                                                    h
of this type of public good, while the central government will provide 1    h . If gj

is the amount spent per good on goods of type h in district j, and g h is the amount
on goods of type h by the central government, then the utility of agent n in district
j is given by

     Since governments must balance their budget, total tax revenues must equal total
expenditures. Hence

with an equivalent de…nition for the central government.
   Given this inherently multidimensional set up, we obtain a striking result: all
voters agree on the optimal structure of the Constitution.

Proposition 7 All Pareto optimal decentralization schemes are characterized by an


                                                           30
  , such that all public goods with      h   <        are completely centralized and all public
goods with     h   >   are completely decentralized.

   In other words, all voters agree that the best structure of decentralization is one
in which goods with high redistributive e¢ ciency are decentralized and goods with
low redistributive e¢ ciency are centralized. The intuition for the result is as follows.
                                                                            0
Consider a decentralization scheme such that a good with a high                 is centralized but
one with a low is decentralized. Now consider decentralizing " of the …rst good, and
centralizing of the second, such that the equilibrium capital tax remains the same.
        0                          0
Since       > , each centralized       good pushes        up by more than each centralized
good. This implies that to keep        …xed, it must be true that " < . Since this change
implies that more goods are centralized, citizens save in head taxes and only lose at
the margin in public good provision. An invariant also means that the amount of ex
post redistribution and ex ante capital generation remains the same and hence this
is a Pareto improving change.
   As shown above in the case of a single , high redistributive e¢ ciency is dangerous
because it distorts taxation decisions ex post. As a consequence, it is the goods
with the most ‘redistributive power’which are the most important to decentralize as
they exacerbate the temptation to expand public provision ex post as redistribution.
Furthermore, all voters agree on this because all of them want to minimize distortions
at the capital generation margin. This is counter the usual arguments that the goods
that need to be centralized are those with a high redistributional content. Here, the
greater the redistributional power, the bigger the problem of lack of commitment.
   Hence, during the constitutional stage of the game, we can see that the con‡ict
between rich and poor should not be on which particular goods to be decentralized
but rather over the extent of decentralization. In particular, the richer the agent, the
more she bene…ts from increased decentralization and hence she prefers more goods
to be decentralized (lower ). Letting ( ) be the minimal        0 that corresponds
to an optimal decentralization scheme for an agent of type , we have that:
                                                                           min
Proposition 8          ( ) is a weakly decreasing function, and                   < 1.

   Note that even the poorest citizen, one with no capital, does not want full cen-
tralization. In particular, all agents agree that goods for which          is close to 1 should
be fully decentralized. Otherwise, this good will be used ex post to fully redistribute
wealth across society. While this may be good for the poorest agent ex post, it means
that ex ante no capital investment takes place and hence such redistributive capacity
is useless.

7        Conclusion
In this paper, we have proposed a theory of federalism that does not rely on assump-
tions about spillovers and taste heterogeneity. While these issues are important, many
public goods, such as …re protection, sewers, etc. lack both signi…cant spillover e¤ects
and substantial taste heterogeneity. To build this theory we have focused on tax com-
petition within a state. In this view, the main distinction between a centralized and
decentralized state is the existence of constraints on policymaking due to the e¤ects
of competitive pressures. The competitive e¤ects of federalism are many and varied,
and have spawned a literature both decrying the e¤ects and touting the virtues of
such competition.29
   We contribute to that literature by considering the classic dynamic inconsistency
in capital taxation problem. We have shown that federalism provides a tool for a
nation to precommit to certain taxation policies that it would not choose to implement
ex post. We also show that this commitment comes at a cost for the median voter and
hence this theory predicts a partial degree of decentralization even when all public
goods to be provided are homogeneous.
       To illustrate our argument, we have focused on the redistributive properties of pub-
lic good provision. However, it has long been noticed in the literature that benevolent
governments who simply maximize static welfare have very similar precommitment
problems.30 It is easy to see that in this case our argument would have similar predic-
tions: by decentralizing the provision of some public goods, the nation can e¤ectively
precommit to fund those goods using instruments other than capital taxes. While
ex post this may require the use of ine¢ cient tax instruments, ex ante it provides
assurances to those who would choose to invest in capital generation. Hence, in a
world without commitment, federalism is a second-best solution to the problem of
choosing tax policy and public investment.
   We choose to focus on political economy issues because this allows us to link
the expected degree of decentralization to the level of inequality, the redistributive
properties of public goods and the level of productivity in the economy. Moreover,
the virtues of partial federalism in solving these kind of redistributive commitment
problems have not, to our knowledge, been studied in detail before.
   In other respects, our model is obviously restrictive. We do not, for instance,
  29
    For a summary of the competitive e¤ects of federalism, see McKinnon and Nechyba (1997).
  30
    If the head tax in our model was slightly distortionary, a welfare-maximizing government would
choose to use only capital taxes, even if agents were completely homogenous. For arguments built
on similar structures (capital versus labor taxes), see Fischer (1980).



                                               32
allow for citizen mobility which would only add to the competitive pressures that the
districts face. Also, further research should explore the interaction of capital taxes
and distortive labor taxes in a model with redistribution but without access to lump-
sum taxes. In that case our argument would still go through, but public provision
at the local level would be distorted downwards and hence welfare analysis would
be more nuanced. Finally, note that in an age of open capital markets, the central
government might also face capital ‡ight fears. The argument would then hinge on
easier capital mobility within a country than across borders. This is probably true,
but an explicit consideration would allow for informative comparative statics with
respect to global capital market integration.

Since it is immediate that spending will be equal across all national public goods, we
have that the maximization problem is

                 1
Hence, since         < 1, G0 ( ) < 1 and the constraint on land taxes binds. So we have
that

by substituting in the budget constraint. Subject to the constraint from capital

   Proof of Proposition 4. (13) holds for any n , so take the condition for med .
Also, rewrite (14) using k = k med . From these two conditions, obtain a second

statics for k med are immediate from this expression. Since kkm e d = m e d , k n is pro-
portional to k med and hence the comparative statics for k med are common to all k n .


   Proof of Lemma 2. Substituting (14) in (15) obtain:

The …rst two terms are a concave function of k med . From (21) it is clear that                                                               @ 2

function of . The sum of two weakly concave functions is weakly concave and hence

which is the solution consistent with a standard equilibrium. The …rst order condition

Since              1 in the relevant range,                                    is weakly decreasing in A. Furthermore, we

as a quadratic in

hence if the constant term (…rst line) and the quadratic coe¢ cient (third line) are
positive F (           ; ) cannot take on negative values. Since                                                             1, ln           0. Moreover

the cubic form            2+6                   6             +2                 is strictly positive for                                    1. Therefore
the constant term is weakly positive. For the same reason, since ln            1,
the quadratic coe¢ cient must also be weakly positive. Hence dd   0 which implies

   Proof of Proposition 6.     First note that the objective function is globally
concave in because ( ) is a convex function given by (22). Hence preferences are
single-peaked.

However,     12   (k (       ; r) ;       ) is postive by assumption, and the proof of propostion
3 tells us that the derivative of k with respect to r is positive. Finally, Propostion 1
and 4 show that ddrh is positive, and hence by Topkis’theorem we are done.

   To see the second part, note that if                 H   < 1, then            < 1 is less than
1 by de…nition.      Otherwise, the median voter will use this perfectly redistributive
instrument and set the capital tax equal to the pre-tax return on capital ex post.
Hence, there will be no capital investment ex ante. Then any agent could be better
o¤ if every public good was decentralized, ensuring a capital tax of zero so he not be
worse o¤.
