How Can a Q-Theoretic Model Price Momentum?

JEL No. G12

                                               ABSTRACT

The answer, of course, is that it can't. Hou, Xue, and Zhang's (2014) empirical model does price portfolios
sorted on prior year's performance, but for reasons outside of q-theory---it does so by including a fundamental
momentum factor, i.e., a factor based on momentum in firm fundamentals. The ROE factor, which
does all the work pricing momentum, is constructed by sorting stocks on the most recently announced
quarterly earnings, which tend to be high after positive earnings surprises. A post earnings announcement
drift factor prices the model's ROE factor, and subsumes the role the ROE factor plays pricing momentum
portfolios when both are included as explanatory variables. The HXZ model also only prices portfolios
sorted on gross profitability by conflating earnings profitability, which drives the ROE factor's covariance
with gross profitability, with post earnings announcement drift, which drives the ROE factor's high
average returns. Controlling for fundamental momentum, the HXZ model also loses its power to explain
the performance of gross profitability. These facts are inconsistent with a neoclassical interpretation
of the empirical model.

1. Introduction

       Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2014, hereafter HXZ) introduce a multi-factor asset pricing
model “inspired by investment-based asset pricing, which is in turn built on the neoclassical
q-theory of investment” (p. 2). Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2014b) claim, in their abstract, that
their model, which they dub the empirical q-factor model, “outperforms the [Fama and
French, 2014] five-factor model, especially in capturing price and earnings momentum.”
       The q-factor model’s superior performance pricing momentum strategies is
unsurprising, given the construction of the HXZ profitability factor. This ROE factor
is formed on the basis of the most recently announced quarterly earnings using monthly
rebalancing, “because the most recent ROE contains the most up-to-date information about
future ROE.” This construction conflates basic economic profitability, which is highly
persistent and what the q-theory model is ostensibly about, with earnings surprises and
the associated post earnings announcement drift, which is highly transitory and outside the
scope of the motivating theory.1
       All of the empirical model’s success pricing momentum strategies comes from earnings
surprises and post earnings announcement drift. Disentangled factors, which separate
the effects of lagged earnings and recent changes in earnings, price the ROE factor, and
cannot be priced by the HXZ model. These factors basically proxy for a low frequency
earnings profitability factor and a post earnings announcement drift factor, respectively.
A model that includes a factor based on annual earnings profitability and a factor based
on standardized unexpected earnings (SUE) also price the ROE factor, and completely
subsume the ROE factor when used to price momentum. In regressions of momentum
   1
      This construction also introduces a look-ahead bias into the factor, because quarterly earnings in
Compustat include revisions, and thus not necessarily the earnings that were actually announced. This bias
will tend to inflate the returns to the ROE factor, as stocks bought on the basis of future positive revisions
will tend to perform strongly on the revision date. Quantifying the magnitude of this bias is beyond the scope
of this paper, but could be addressed simply by lagging quarterly earnings sufficiently from the recorded
earnings announcement dates.



                                                      1
onto the HXZ factors and a SUE factor, all of the pricing is done by SUE. The fact that a
SUE factor prices momentum strategies is itself somewhat surprising, in light of Chan,
Jegadeesh, and Lakonishok’s (1996) well known conclusion that “past return and past
earnings surprise each predict large drifts in future returns after controlling for the other”
(p. 1681). The results are consistent, however, with Novy-Marx (2014), which shows
that fundamental momentum, i.e., momentum in firm fundamentals, especially earnings,
completely explains the performance of strategies based on price momentum.
   The basic HXZ model also only succeeds in pricing portfolios sorted on gross
profitability because it conflates earnings profitability with post earnings announcement
drift. The disentangled factors, which price the ROE factor, cannot price gross profitability.
Gross profitability loads heavily on the low frequency, low premia, earnings profitability
factor, but is orthogonal to the high frequency, high premia, earnings innovation factor.
The ROE factor essentially prices gross profitability by mistakenly attributing gross
profitability’s performance to post earnings announcement drift. All of gross profitability’s
loading on ROE comes through its correlation with the low frequency earnings profitability,
while all of the ROE spread is driven by high frequency revisions to earnings.
   There is also more generally a significant selection bias with regards to the choice
of the test assets used to compare the performance of the HXZ model to the Fama and
French model. The test assets used to compare the two models are chosen from the set of
known anomalies, which are defined by their significant alphas relative to the Fama and
French model. That is, the HXZ model does as well as the Fama and French model pricing
strategies selected because of the difficulties they pose to the Fama and French model.
   Ultimately the HXZ model succeeds in pricing momentum portfolios because it
includes a momentum factor. Because its major success is essentially outside the motivating
neo-classical theory, it is inappropriate to refer to it as a q-theory model, or to even call
its ROE factor a profitability factor. These facts call into question the interpretation of



                                              2
the model as grounded by, and providing supporting evidence for, investment-based asset
pricing.
   The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 replicates the headline
HXZ results, showing that a high frequency earnings-to-book factor generates remarkable
performance and prices momentum. Section 3 decomposes earnings-to-book into lagged
earnings-to-book and earnings innovations-to-book, and shows that the performance of
the ROE factor, as well as the ROE factor’s power pricing momentum, is driven by the
latter. It also shows that a factor based on earnings innovations-to-book is essentially a
fundamental momentum factor, driven by post earnings announcement drift (PEAD) and
almost indistinguishable from a factor based on standardized unexpected earnings. Section
4 shows that the HXZ model’s power pricing strategies based on gross profitability comes
from conflating earnings profitability and PEAD, with all the covariance between gross
profitability strategies and the ROE factor driven by the low frequency, unpriced, part
of ROE, while the ROE’s high average return is driven by the transient, high frequency
component that is orthogonal to gross profitability. Section 5 concludes.


2. Replication of headline results

   Table 1 shows the performance of an ROE factor, constructed using the same
methodology employed by Fama and French to construct the momentum factor, UMD.
I employ the standard double sorting methodology of Fama and French (1993), instead of
the triple sorting methodology preferred by HXZ, for simplicity and to ease comparison
across models. Results are not sensitive to the details of factor construction, and if
they were would raise additional concerns regarding the proposed factors. Specifically,
ROE is an equal-weighted average of value-weighted large and small cap return-on-equity
strategies, where large and small cap are defined as above and below NYSE median market
capitalization, respectively, and the return-on-equity strategies buy and sell stocks ranked


                                             3
in the top and bottom 30% of return-on-equity, using NYSE breaks. Following HXZ,
return-on-equity is measured using the most recently announced quarterly earnings before
extraordinary items (Compustat item IBQ), scaled by quarterly book equity lagged one
quarter. Earnings are assumed to be available at the end of the month during which they
are announced (Compustat item RDQ). The factor is rebalanced monthly.2 The sample
begins in the middle of 1973, when reliable quarterly accounting data becomes available
for a broad cross section of firms.
    Table 1 shows results consistent with HXZ. Specification one shows that the ROE factor
generates large, highly significant average excess returns of 65 bps/month over the 40 year
sample. Specifications two shows an even more significant abnormal returns relative to the
Fama and French (1993) 3-factor model, while specification three shows that the that the
4-factor model that additionally accounts for momentum explains almost none of the ROE
factor’s average returns.
    The last four specifications of the table show the performance of UMD relative to the
HXZ model. Specification four shows the momentum factor earned excess returns of 66
bps/month over the sample. Specification five shows that UMD loads significantly on the
ROE factor, and that covariance with the ROE factor alone explains almost 60% of the
UMD factor’s abnormal returns. Specifications six and seven show that HXZ’s four-factor
model, which additionally includes Fama and French’s market and size factors (MKT and
SMB), and an investment factor (AG), constructed like HML using asset growth instead
of book-to-market, explains 90% of the performance on UMD.3 These specifications also
    2
      The ROE factor holds positions for an average of roughly six months, yielding estimated transaction
cost of 30 bps/month using the methodology of Novy-Marx and Velikov (2014). This is more similar to
UMD (four month average holding times and estimated transaction costs of 50 bps/month) than it is to HML
(three-year average holding times and estimated transaction costs of 6 bps/month). I ignore transaction costs
for the rest of this paper for comparability to HXZ, but doing so obviously significantly overstates the factor’s
performance.
    3
      Specifically, the AG factor is constructed using the same 2 x 3 methodology used for ROE, but the
portfolios are only rebalanced annually, at the end of June, using accounting data from the fiscal year ending
in the previous calendar year. This standard, conservative lag assumption of Fama and French (1993) basically
ensures that accounting data used in the strategies is public at the time of portfolio formation.

show that the marginal power the three additional factors add comes primarily through the
inclusion of the size factor, not the investment factor.


3. ROE decomposition and relation to PEAD

     The impressive observed performance of the high frequency ROE factor, and the
factor’s striking success pricing momentum, are quite surprising, at least in light of Fama
and French’s (2008) conclusion that the empirical evidence does “not provide much basis
for the conclusion that, with controls for market cap and B/M, there is a positive relation


                                                          5
between average returns and profitability” measured by return-on-equity (p. 1663). The
seeming contradiction is completely resolved, however, by recognizing that the high
frequency ROE factor’s high average returns, as well as its power pricing momentum, are
both driven by recent innovations to earnings, not from the level of earnings.
   This can be seen simply by double sorting stocks into portfolios on the basis of lagged
earnings-to-book equity and earnings innovations-to-book equity, where these come from
decomposing return-on-equity:

                   IBQ    IBQ         4       IBQ IBQ     4
   ROE                 D                 C                    lagged-E=B C E=B;
                  BEQ 1   BEQ         1         BEQ 1

where IBQ and BEQ are quarterly income before extraordinary items and quarterly book
equity, respectively, and subscripts denote quarterly lags.
   Table 2 shows results for value-weighted portfolios formed monthly using independent
sorts on lagged-B=E and B=E. Panel A shows the performance of the high-minus-low
lagged-B=E strategies constructed within B=E quintiles, while panel B shows the
performance of the high-minus-low B=E strategies constructed within lagged-B=E
quintiles (properties of all 25 of the double sorted portfolios are provided in Appendix
Table A1). Panel A shows that the sort on lagged earnings-to-book generates large spreads
in current return-on-equity (an average high-minus-low spread in portfolio IBQ=BEQ         1

of 8.3%), but fails to generate any spread in average returns. Gibbons, Ross, and Shanken
(GRS) tests also fail to reject the hypotheses that either the three- or four-factor abnormal
returns of the five high-minus-low lagged earnings-to-book strategies constructed within
earnings innovation-to-book quintiles are jointly zero at the 5% level.
   Panel B shows that the earnings innovations-to-book equity sort, despite generating
slightly less spread in current return-on-equity (average high-minus-low spread in portfolio
IBQ=BEQ       1   of 7.4%), generates large return spreads across lagged earnings-to-book
quintiles (average of 64 bps/month), and large, highly significant three- and four-factor
alphas.

3.1. ROE factor decomposition

   The results of the preceding table suggest that the high average returns to the ROE
factor are driven by recent innovations to earnings, not by the level of earnings. This section
explores this further, by comparing the ROE factor to two new factors, constructed on the
basis of lagged earnings-to-book (the lag-ROE factor) and earnings innovations-to-book
(the ROE factor), using the same basic methodology used to construct the ROE factor.
   The first two specifications of Table 3 show that individually the lag-ROE factor
explains more of the variation in the ROE factor’s returns than does the ROE factor
(51.9% vs. 41.7%), but that the former does little to explain the ROE factor’s monthly
average excess return of 0.65%, while the latter does a remarkable job pricing ROE all
by itself. The next three specifications show that the ROE factor also prices ROE with
lag-ROE, alone or in conjunction with the Fama and French or the other HXZ factors.
   While the ROE factor is in the span of the lag-ROE and ROE factors, the ROE cannot
price either lag-ROE and ROE. Specifications six through nine of Table 3 show that the
lag-ROE factor does not earn significant returns, or generate a significant Fama and French
thee-factor alpha, but is significantly mispriced by ROE, either alone or in conjunction
with the other factors employed by HXZ. This mispricing occurs because the HXZ model
conflates the low frequency, low premia, persistent component of earnings profitability
with the high frequency, high premia, transitory component. Lag-ROE only covaries with
ROE through the first channel, but the HXZ model, unable to distinguish between the two
channels, mistakenly attributes part of the average returns earned by the lag-ROE to the
second. The model thus sees the negligible returns actually earned by the lag-ROE factor
as significantly too low.
   Specifications 10-12 show that the ROE factor earned large, highly significant average
returns, and that these returns cannot be explained by the ROE factor, either alone or in
conjunction with the other factors employed by HXZ.

3.2. The earnings innovation factor is a PEAD factor

       The results presented so far are inconsistent with HXZ’s conclusion that
return-on-equity is the profitability measure most relevant for predicting cross sectional
variation in expected returns, and that they use the most recently announced quarterly
earnings simply “because the most recent ROE contains the most up-to-date information
about future ROE” (HXZ, p. 14). Lagged earnings-to-price explains more of the variation
in recent ROE than earnings innovations do, but HXZ’s empirical results are driven almost
entirely by the latter. These earnings innovations have power predicting returns because
they are closely related to earnings surprises. Fundamental momentum, and the associated
post earnings announcement drift, are completely outside of the scope of the q-theoretic
story told in HXZ.
       Figure 1 shows the close connection between earnings innovations and post earnings
announcement drift. The figure gives the growth of a dollar, net of financing costs, invested
in five different strategies in the middle of 1973. The five strategies include the ROE,
lag-ROE, and ROE factors, a similarly constructed post earnings announcement drift
factor, PEAD, based on standardized unexpected earnings (SUE), and a lower frequency
earnings-to-book factor, E/B, based on annual return-on-equity that is only rebalanced once
a year, at the end of June.4
       The figure shows that the performance of the ROE and PEAD factors are quite
similar. The returns to the two factors are 80.9% correlated at a monthly frequency, and
generate similar excess returns over the sample, with the Sharpe ratio on PEAD slightly
exceeding that on ROE (1.20 versus 1.11). The PEAD factor, like the earnings innovation
factor, also generates significant abnormal returns relative to the HXZ four-factor model,
   4
    standardized unexpected earnings (SUE) is calculated as the most recent year-over-year change in
earnings per share, scaled by the standard deviation of the these earnings innovations over the last eight
announcements, subject to a requirement of at least six observed announcements over the two year window.
For earnings per share I use Compustat quarterly data item EPSPXQ (Earnings Per Share (Basic) / Excluding
Extraordinary Items). Earnings announcement dates are Compustat quarterly data item RDQ.

Fig. 1. Comparison of earnings innovation and PEAD factors. The figure shows the
value of a dollar, net of financing costs, invested at the end of the first quarter of 1974 in
the ROE factor, rebalanced monthly on the basis of the most recently announced quarterly
earnings-to-book, and similarly constructed factors based on standardized unexpected earnings
(PEAD), earnings innovations-to-book (ROE), lagged earnings-to-book (lag-ROE), and a lower
frequency earnings-to-book strategy based on annual return-on-equity, which is only rebalanced
once a year, at the end of June (E/B). To facilitate comparison factor are scaled to match the sample
average volatility of the ROE factor, 10.4%. The start date is determined by the availability of the
quarterly Compustat data, and the requirement of at least six observations of year-over-year changes

28 bps/month with a t-statistic of 4.16. This last fact seems to contradict the HXZ claim
that their model, and in particular the ROE factor, prices portfolios sorted on standardized
unexpected earnings, the variable used to construct the PEAD factor. The two facts are,
however, easily reconciled. The ROE factor puts 50% of its weight on, and derives 75% of
its average returns from, the stocks with below NYSE median market cap that make up only


                                                 11
9% of the market by capitalization. The ROE factor, which is sorted on a noisy measure
of earnings surprises but overweights small cap stocks where post earnings announcement
drift is strong, can price the value-weighted test assets in HXZ, which are sorted on a
clean measure of earnings surprises but driven primarily by large cap stocks where PEAD
is weak. ROE cannot price the PEAD factor, which is sorted on the clean measure of
earnings surprises but overweights small cap stocks just as much as ROE.
   The figure also shows that the factors based on lagged quarterly earnings-to-book and
annual earnings-to-book are also closely related, with a monthly return correlation of
89.9%. The ROE factor, which conflates earnings surprises with low frequency earnings
profitability performs, not surprisingly, somewhere in between.

3.3. PEAD drives ROE’s performance, and its power pricing momentum

   The close connection between PEAD and the earnings innovation factor ROE, and
consequently between PEAD and ROE, can be made formal by repeating the spanning tests
of Tables 1 and 3, but additionally including the PEAD factor as an explanatory strategy.
   The first four specifications of Table 4 replicate specifications two through five of Table
3, replacing the lagged-earnings and earnings innovation factors with the PEAD factor and
the low frequency earnings-to-book factor, E/B. Specification one shows that the PEAD
factor, like the earnings innovation factor, prices the ROE factor all by itself, and explains
roughly the same fraction of the ROE factor’s return variation, 40.9% versus the 41.7%
explained by ROE in specification two of Table 3. Specification two through four show
that the PEAD factor also prices the ROE factor in conjunction with the low frequency
earnings factor, the two together alone, or in conjunction with the Fama and French factors,
or with the other factors employed by HXZ.
   Specification five replicates the headline results of HXZ, also shown in specification
seven of Table 1, that the HXZ four-factor model prices momentum. It does so primarily
through a large, highly significant loading of 0.76 on the ROE factor.

   Specifications six through nine shows that ROE’s power pricing momentum comes from
the fundamental momentum in ROE. Specifications six shows that the model that replaces
the ROE factor with the PEAD factor also prices UMD, and explains one and a half times
as much of UMD’s return variation, 32.5% versus 22.2%. Specification seven shows that
including the PEAD factor in addition to the ROE factor reduces the loading on ROE from
0.76 to 0.29, a 62% reduction. The addition of ROE to the model that already includes
PEAD also does little to increase the UMD return variation explained by the model.
   Specifications eight and nine show even stronger results using the alternative
fundamental momentum factor, ROE. Specification eight shows that replacing the ROE
factor in the HXZ model with the ROE factor more than doubles the UMD return
variation explained by the model, 47.4% versus 22.2%. Specification nine shows that
ROE completely subsumes the role played by ROE pricing the momentum strategy,
reducing the loading on ROE from a highly significant 0.76 to an insignificant -0.06, while
the addition of the ROE factor does nothing to improve the explanatory power of the model
that already includes ROE.


4. What about profitability?

   HXZ also claim that ROE subsumes Novy-Marx’s (2013) gross profitability.                  It
only does so, again, by conflating earnings profitability with fundamental momentum.
Strategies based on gross profitability load on ROE because they are correlated with the low
frequency, low premia part of the factor. The factor prices the strategies because it carries a
large premia driven by the orthogonal, earnings innovations component. In effect the ROE
factor prices gross profitability by adjusting the returns downward to account for gross
profitability’s supposedly large exposure to post earnings announcement drift, despite the
fact that gross profitability has none. Table 5 shows that the disentangled factors, lag-ROE
and ROE, which do not conflate the two distinct effects, cannot price gross profitability.

         The first specification of the table shows the average monthly excess returns to a
profitable-minus-unprofitable factor, PMU, constructed using the same methodology used
to form the Fama and French HML factor, but on the basis of gross profitability (revenues
minus cost of goods sold, scaled by assets) instead of book-to-market.5 PMU generates
     5
     Gross profits-to-assets tends to be low for financial firms (those with one-digit SIC codes of 6), because
of their high levels of financial assets, so I exclude financials when constructing PMU, but results are even
stronger retaining financials (Table A2, in the Appendix). The PMU factor holds positions for an average of
almost five years, even longer than HML, and has estimated transaction costs of 4 bps/month, an order of
magnitude lower than those estimated for ROE.



                                                      15
significant excess returns over the sample (28 bps/month with a test-statistic of 2.62).
Specification two shows an even larger, more significant, three-factor alpha (40 bps/month
with a test-statistic of 3.84). Specifications three through five show that the returns to PMU
are not significant after controlling for the ROE factor, alone, or in conjunction with the
Fama and French factors, or with the other factors employed by HXZ. Also, while the
PMU factor’s returns are insignificant relative to the HXZ model, the model only explains
about a third of the PMU factor’s average returns.
   The last two specifications show that the models lose their power to price PMU
when the ROE factor is decomposed into the factors based on lagged earnings-to-price
and earnings innovations-to-price (lag-ROE and ROE). PMU loads heavily on the
low return lag-ROE factor, but not on the high return ROE. As a result PMU has a
significant abnormal return relative to models that employ the disentangled ROE factors,
and consequently do not incorrectly attribute gross profitability’s performance to post
earnings announcement drift. The appendix shows similar results for models that employ
the ROE factor in conjunction with either or both of the disentangled factors (Table A3).


5. Conclusion

   Hou, Xue, and Zhang’s (2014) alternative factor model prices momentum with
fundamental momentum, not with profitability. Their ROE factor does covary with firms
that have consistently high earnings profitability, but covaries almost as strongly with firms
that have experienced recent positive earnings surprises. This large exposure to earnings
surprises is crucial for all of the HXZ results. The ROE factor’s high average returns are
driven by post earnings announcement drift, and a PEAD factor both prices the ROE factor
and subsumes all of its power pricing momentum.
   The ROE factor also only explains gross profitability by conflating persistent, low
frequency, economic profitability with the high frequency, transitory impact of earnings



                                             16
surprises. Strategies based on gross profitability load on the ROE factor because of
the former, and these loadings only explain the strategies performance because of the
ROE factor’s high average returns, which are driven by the latter. The HXZ model thus
essentially explains the high average returns to strategies based on gross profitability by
counter-factually attributing the strategies’ high returns to post earnings announcement
drift. Controlling for PEAD, the ROE factor loses its power to price gross profitability. The
ROE factor’s conflation of earnings profitability and PEAD also leads it to significantly
misprice strategies based on lagged- or low-frequency earnings profitability.         These
strategies do not generate high average returns, but covary strongly with the ROE factor, so
have highly significant negative alphas relative to the HXZ model.
   These facts are inconsistent with Hou, Xue, and Zhang’s (2014) q-theoretic
interpretation of their factors. Investment based asset pricing provides strong motivation
for including profitability and investment factors into an empirical asset pricing model,
but not for the HXZ model. The ROE factor is a fundamental momentum factor, not a
profitability factor, and outside the scope of the motivating theory.
