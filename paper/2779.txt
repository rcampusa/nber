               A BEQUEST CONSTRAINED ECONOMY:         WELFARE ANALYSIS

     Bequest constraints have played      a   major role in discussions of debt

neutrality but their welfare implications were not sufficiently dealt with

in the literature.     In this paper we focus on the welfare implications          of

bequest constraints. We found     that when institutional        constraints   to the

transfer of resources    from children to their parents        exists the welfare of

the parents'   generation may be improved by an old age security scheme.           Such

a scheme is justified    not by income redistribution consideration, as is

typically the case, but rather on pure efficiency grounds.            Due to its

intergenerational    transfer role the social security scheme is Pareto—

improving   with altruistic parents if,       in addition,   the real income effect

which tends to raise children consumption         is relatively strong.

1.   Introduction

     Bequest constraints have played a major role in discussions of

Barro's (1974) debt-neutrality theorem.      In his famous article (1974),

Barro showed that if finite-lived parents left their descendants positive

bequests in the absence of government debt, the introduction of public

debt would not affect parents' optimal consumption plans and would not

create new opportunities to transfer resources from parents to children.

Barro's proposition thus requires an interior solution or the absence of

nonnegativity constraints on bequests.      Subsequent developments of this

subject have focused on the implications of such nonnegativity constraints

and the possibility of boundary solutions; see Drazen (1978), Kimball

(1987), Weil (1987),    and Abel (1988).   This literature focused mainly on

the positive economics aspects of institutional constraints on bequests

and their implications for government debt neutrality.



     In this paper we focus on the welfare implications of bequest

constraints within the framework of endogenous fertility developed in

Nerlove, Razin and Sadka (1987).     Gary Becker and Kevin Murphy (1988)

pointed out the importance of bequest constraints when family decisions

(such as fertility, investment in human capital, etc.) are endogenous, as

a source of market failure,    for public policies.   In an early paper (1984)

and subsequently in our book (Nerlove et al (1987, Chapter 8)) we dealt

with a similar issue:    the welfare implications of institutional

constraints implying the inability of parents to force transfers among

their children, who have different ability to make use of human capital.
                                     -2-


When children have different abilities, so that investments in their human

capital are not equally productive, and parents cannot enforce transfers

among them, an egalitarian parental attitude may lead to inefficient

investment in human and nonhuman capital.      For example, the parents may he

led to invest too much in the human capital of the low-ability children so

that they will be equal (in the productivity of their human capital) to

their more able siblings.   The resulting market failure is shown to be

alleviated by a tax on earned income and a subsidy to bequest.

     In this paper, we concinue this line of analysis dealing with the

diseconomies associated with institutional constraints on the family by

focusing on the implications of bequest constraints for the

intergenerational distribution of welfare when no differences exist among

children. We examine several potential welfare-improving policies

designed to correct institutional constraints to negative bequests and the

implications of such policies for population growth.      Among such

policies, we consider a social security scheme.

     In his pioneering paper, Samuelson (1958) pointed out to the role of

government debt (money) as a social contrivance for improving

intertemporal allocations of resources within generations. A social

security scheme by which each young generation pays a tax to finance a

t:ransfer to the old generation can, of course, play a similar role.     This

role is limited to intra-generational transfers, because in the original

Samuelson's    overlapping-generationsmodel no intergenerational altruism

exists:   for each generation,   life-time   consumption is equal to own life-

time income.    In the context of intergenerational altruism, social

security can also play a role of intergenerational transfers.      Such a role   -
                                         -3-


is particularly important when there is a binding nonnegativity constraint

on bequests.       In this paper we highlight the role of social security in

the Context of intergenerational transfers in the form of parents'

investment in the human capital of their children.        Even though the social

security tax is, like most taxes, distortionary, it nevertheless improves

welfare.       Other measures,   such as a subsidy to human capital investment,

are shown to be welfare-reducing because they introduce further

distortions into the economy without playing any role for

intergenerational transfers.

     The paper is organized in the following manner.        Section II

introduces a stylized model used to demonstrate the existence of a

potential market failure arising from the institutional constraints on

bequests.       Section III provides a Pareto-comparison between the

laissez-faire allocation and the optimal allocation (from the altruistic

parent's point of view).         Section IV considers the effect of the

institutional constraints on the rate of growth of population.         In

Section    V   we analyze alternative corrective policies for a

bequest-constrained economy with endogenous population.        Section VI

contains concluding remarks. This section is followed by three technical

appendices.

     II.       Bequest-Constrained Equilibrium

               To highlight the economic mechanism underlying the problem at

hand we use a simple stylized model.        Suppose there are only two periods,

two generations and a single all-purpose composite good.          The first


generation consists of identical individuals (parents) who live for one

period.     Each parent is endowed with I units of the composite good.        She
                                                        -4-


consumes c1 units of the composite good in the first period and bears                            n
identical children who each possesses one unit of adult labor in the

second period.

         Investing e units of the single good in the first period in the

education of a child augments her labor supply, as measured in efficiency

units, to g(e).               We assume that the marginal product of human capital is

positive but diminishing, i.e.:



(1)      g' > 0, g" <          0.


The child then earns wg(e) in the second period where w is the wage rate

per efficiency unit. Without loss of generality we henceforth set w—l.
The parent can also bequeath b units of the composite good to each child

in the first period.                    This bequest grows to be bR units in the second

period, where       R     -    1    >   0 is   the   interest rate.   For the sake of simplicity,

R   is   assumed    to be fixed.
         The    parent's budget constraint is thus
(2)      ci    + n(e+b)    —       I.
         We assume that bequests cannot be negative.                    Accordingly:

(3)      bO.
         The consumption (c2) of each child in the second period is

constrained by:

(4)      c       g(e) + bR.

         We    assume   that the nonnegativity constraint               on bequest   is   only
institutional.           Namely,          parents cannot obligate their children to repay

debts that they (the parents) accumulate before they die.                        However, the
                                      .5-


economy lasts for two   periods   and is not constrained in its ability to

transfer resources from the future back to the present.      For instance,   the


economy (via the government) can borrow in the present from abroad at the

rate of interest R-l and repay the loan in the second period.        Thus,

constraint (3) is binding for the individual but not for the economy.J

Therefore, there may be a market failure in the intertemporal allocation

of resources.

      Caring about the number and the well-being of her children,      the


parent in the first period choose c1,n,e,b and a planned c2 so as to

maximize her utility function

(5)   u(c1,n,c2)

subject to the resource constraints (2) and (4) and the institutional

nonnegativity constraint on bequests (3).     We call the solution to this

optimization problem, (c1*,n*,c2*,b*,e*), the laissez-faire equilibrium.

When the institutional constraint is not binding, namely    the;   parent wishes

to bequeath a positive amount to her children,    it is straightforward to

see that the parent invests in the human capital of each child up to the

point where the marginal productivity of human capital is equal to the

rate of interest:

(6) g'(e*) — R.

The rate-of-return equalization ensures efficiency in the choice between

human and nonhuman (physical)     capital as means of transferring resources

from the present to the future.     Notice that this efficiency rule is

obtained independently of the optimal choice of c1,n,b and c2.       (Of



 11
                                  -6-


course, (6) does not guarantee that the latter variables are optimally

chosen.)

     However, this efficiency rule no longer holds when the nonnegativity

bequest constraint is binding. In the latter case b* — 0 and (6) becomes:

(6a) g'(e*)   >   R.

This implies by (1) that investment in human capital is insufficient.           The

parent would have liked to invest more in the human capital of her

children if she could keep some of the return to this investment to

herself by borrowing from her children.     But thu    would have required b to

be negative which is institutionally iwpossible. In this paper we focus

on this bequest constrained equilibrium (b* —    0).
     There are several key factors which determine whether the bequest

constraint is binding or not; see also Abel (1988).       First, the magnitude

of the parent's altruism towards her children,    namely, the marginal rate

of substitution of children's consumption for parent's consumption

(3c2/3cl along the parent's indifference curve),       affects   the size of the

total transfer (i.e., e+b) to each child.     The smaller the magnitude of

parent's altruism, the smaller is the transfer and the larger is the

likelihood that the nonnegativity bequest constraint be binding.          Second,


the magnitude of the marginal productivity of human capital investment

(i.e., g'), relative to the return on physical capital (i.e., R),

determines the composition of the total transfer b+e between b and         e.   The

larger is g', relative to R, the more that parent would like to invest in

the human capital of their children, and even borrow for this purpose.             In

the latter case, the nonnegativity constraint becomes binding.
                                        .7-


       In contrast to the parent, the economy is not constrained by (3).

The optimum for the economy is obtained by maximizing the utility function

(5) subject to the resource constraints (2) and (4) only.       The optimal

allocation is denoted by (c1**,n**,c2**,e**,b**). In this case b** < 0

and investment in human capital is efficient:

(7)    g'(e**)   —   R

(hence e** > e*).

Obviously not only investment in human capital is distorted in the

laissez-faire equilibrium due to the institutional constraint on bequests

but also all other choice variables (c1,n, and c2) are distorted.



       Notice that our concept of optimality here is considered from the

parent's point of view, namely,      the optimal allocation maximizes the


parent's utility function (subject to the economy's resource constraints).

Since the parent is altruistic towards her children,      the optimal

allocation may plausibly lead to a higher utility for children,      compared

to the laissez-faire allocation. In this case the optimal allocation

Pareto dominates the laissez-faire allocation.       However, this is not

always true.      It may well happen that the optimal allocation renders a

lower utility        (consumption) for children than the laissez-faire

allocation.      In this case the optimal allocation does not bring about a

Pareto-improvement over the laissez-faire allocation.

III.    Optimum versus Laissez-Faire: A Pareto Comparison

       As indicated in the preceding section, parent altruism toward

children does not necessarily imply that the optimal allocation dominates

in the Pareto sense the laissez-faire allocation. Namely, although the
                                             -8-


parent's utility is, by definition, greater at the optimum than at the

laissez-faire, children utility (consumption)             may be smaller.   To see the

factors at play in the movement from the laissez-faire to the optimal

allocation and, in particular, their effect on children consumption, let

us consider a simplified version of our model in which the number of

children n is exogenous.

     Notice that b is equal to zero at the laissez-faire allocation and

becomes negative at the optimal allocation. Therefore, to analyze the

difference between the laissez-faire and the optimal consumption per

child, let us parameterize b and consider the effect on c2 of lowering b

from zero to its optimal level.             That is, we first solve the problem

max          u(c1,n, c2)
c1,c2,e

s.t.:        c1 + n(e+b)       <   I
                       g(e) + bR

where b is treated as a parameter. We then consider the effect of

changing     b   on the solution for c2, denoted by       2   (b).

     A    straightforward comparative statistic analysis yields:

                                                     1
        .z —      1            2
                       ((R-g )n (u11- u13u1/u3)) +       (R u3g
        db

where

         —             -
                           2ng' u13 +           +
             n2u11                      u33(g')2 u3g"

is negative by the second-under conditions for utility maximization.

     Notice that the expression for dä2/db is composed of two terms.               The

first represents the real income (welfare) effect of relaxing the bequest

constraint.           Since the constraint is binding along the path from the
                                         .9-


laissez-faire to the optimum, then g'          >   R along this path.   Also, the

                       u13 u1/u3 is negative    when c2 is
                   -                                         a normal good, which is
expression ull

a plausible assumption.        Hence, the first-term is negative, working in the

direction of increasing C2 as the bequest constraint is relaxed. That is,

the real income effect works in the direction of increasing c2 as one

moves from the laissez-faire to the optimum.            Thus, the real income

effect,     as by itself, enhances Pareto-improvement,when moving from the

laissez-faire to the optimum.

     The second term in the expression for dä2/db is unambiguously

positive.     It stems from the fact that relaxing the bequest constraint

allows the parent to provide less consumption for each one of her

children.     Thus, the second term tends, as by itself,         to lower the utility

of children in the optimal allocation, making the laissez-faire and the

optimal allocations Pareto-noncomparable.            If the income effect on c2 is

relatively strong,       then it dominates     the second effect and the children

utility is higher in the optimal allocation than in the laissez-faire

allocation:     The optimal allocation Pareto-dominates the laissez-faire

allocation.     On the other hand, if the real income effect is relatively

small, the two allocations are Pareto-noncomparable.

     The above analysis was carried out under the assumption that the

number of children is exogenous. However,            it should be clear that the

same factors are at work when n is endogenous.            Indeed,   the children

utility may well be lower in the optimum than in the laissez-faire also

when n is endogenous. Appendix B provides such an example.

IV.   The Effect of the Beouest Constraint on Population Growth

      As was already mentioned earlier, a binding bequest constraint

forces parents to underinvest in the human capital of their children.                    It

may seem that this distortion will induce parents to bring an inadequate

number of children (i.e., n*          < n**),   because they face a binding limit on

the "financing" of children.

      This may indeed be the case.          The loss of utility due to the

institutional constraint on bequest may lead to a smaller number of

children in the laissez-faire solution relative to the optimum.                   To gain

some insight into the effects determining the difference between the

number of children in the two allocations, observe that the laissez-faire

allocation with a binding bequest constraint can be represented as a

solution to the following problems:

      max u*(c1,n)
(8)   (c1,n)

                          —
      s.t.   :
                 c1 + ne*

where u*(c1,u) —      u(c1,n,g(e*)).
The optimal allocation can be represented as a solution to the following

problem:

      max u**(c1,n)

(9)   c1+n(e**+b**)I,
where u**(cl,n) —      u(c,n,g(e**) + b**R).
      In both (8) and (9) only c1 and           n   are the choice variables, while

investment in human capital (e) and bequest              (b)   are set at their

predetermined solution levels (e* and b* — 0 for the laissez-faire

allocation;       e** and b**   <   0 for tha optimal allocation).      A   comparison
                                             - 11   -




between the above     two    consumer     optimization problems suggests two

differences.    First, the objective (utility) function is different.

Second, the "price" of        n    in the budget constraint is different. The

laissez-faire solution is suboptimal because the transfer of resources

from parents to children cannot be efficiently channeled via physical and

human capital investments. If the removal of the constraint on the

efficient allocation of investment between human and physical capital

leads to a larger total yield (i.e., c2* —                 g(e*) < g(e**)     +   b**R   —   c2**)
with a smaller total investment (i.e., e*                > e**   ÷   b**),   then it is

plausible that the laissez-faire rate of population growth is too slow

(i.e., n* <   n**).   To see this, refer to Figure 1.                  The laissez-faire

budget constraint AR' is steeper than the optimal budget constraint AR'
because the laissez-faire price of children is larger than the optimal

price of children (e* >        e**   +   b**).     If an increase in the quality of

children (i.e., c2 —        g(e)   + bR) changes preferences in (c,n)-space in

favor of number of the children (which is plausible) then the indifference

curves corresponding to u** are steeper than those corresponding to u*.

If furthermore u** implies that the number of children is not a Giffen

good, then the optimal allocation must yield a larger number of children

than the laissez-faire allocation.

    However, this is not always true.                   In fact, the existence of the non-

negativity constraint on bequest might have forced the parent to allow

more consumption per child than otherwise desired. Hence, the removal of

the constraint will, in this case,               lower the consumption per child, i.e.


c2** —   g(e**) + b**R   < g(e*) —       c2*     (see the preceeding section).           Since

investment is more efficiently channelled in the optimum, this will
                                    -   12   -




require    a smaller total investment in the optimum: e** +       b** <   e*.   If,

as before,, the decline in the quality of children changes preferences in

(c1, n)-space against number of children,         then the indifference curves

corresponding to u** are flatter than those corresponding to u* (see

Figure 2).    In this case, the optimal allocation can be either to the

right or to the left of point D, shoving that the optimal number of

children can be either smaller or larger than the laissez-faire number of

children. Appendix B presents an example in which the optimal number of

children is indeed smaller than the laissez-faire number of children.

V.   Corrective Policies

     The source of the market failure in the presence of an institutional

constraint on negative bequests is the inability of parents to transfer

resources from their heirs to themselves.         Such a transfer enables parents

to have an efficient number of children,         to invest efficiently in their

human capital and makes parents and, possibly, each one of their children

better off.2

     A    first-best remedy to this market failure may seem to be a per-

parent subsidy in the first period debt-financed by a head tax on children

in the second period.    However, notice that when fertility is endogenous

(as is the case here), a head tax on children is not neutral, because it

affects the "price" of children,    and thereby distorts parents' behavior,

In the absence of genuine second-period lump-sum taxes we therefore

examine second.best corrective policies.          Such policies are aimed to raise

the parent's utility beyond the laissez-faire level, but they cannot

attain the first-best level.
                                              - 13   -




           Consider then   a consumption tax at the rate         t   (in the two periods),

an education subsidy at the rate s', a child allowance of a', an income

tax at the rate t          in the second period, and a lump-sum tax          V   in the

first period.3         Observe that this menu of policy tools includes,            as a

special case, a social security scheme.                  Such a scheme obtains when t'>O

and T'<O, i.e. when children are taxed in order to provide a lump-sum

transfer to parents. The taxes modify the budget constraints (2) and (4)

faced by the parent to:

(10)                 (l+tc)cl+n(l5')e.a'fl           I-V
and

(11)                 (l+tc)e2     (l-t')g(e).

           In what follows we examine the effects of sufficiently small taxes at

the neighborhood of the laissez-faire allocation (tc*_s'*_a'*_t'*_T'*_O).

Since at this allocation, b* —           0,   we ignore inheritance taxes.       Dividing

(10) and (11) by (l+tc), we see that the consumption tax tc ;is redundant.

We therefore rewrite (10) and (11) as:

(l0a)                c1 + n(l-s)e   -    an    I-T




(ha)                 c2     (l-t)g(e),

where

1-s —       (l5')/(l+tc),
a —    a'/(l+tc),
1t     —
            (lt')/(l+t), and
1T     —    (IT')/(l+tc).
        The parent maximizes the utility function (5), subject to the budget

constraints   (lOa) and      (ha). The first-order conditions are given in

Appendix C.    Denote the solution to this problem by:

                  (a)    c1 —   C1(s,a,t,T)
                  (b)     n —   N(s,a,t,T)
(12)              (c)     e —   E(s,a,t,T)
                  (d)    c2 —   C2(s,a,t,T)
and the indirect utility function by:

(13)              v(s,a,t,T)    — u(C1(s,a,t,T),N(s,a,t,T),C2(s,a,t,T)).

The government, which can lend and borrow also over periods in which

parents and children do not overlap, faces the following present-value

budget constraint:

(14)              [aN(s,a,t,T)       + sE(s,a,t,T)N(s,a,t,T) - T)R

                                        -
                                             tN(s,a,t,T)g(E(s,a,t,T))             0.

       As mentioned before, we examine small changes in s, a, t and T around

the laissez-faire allocation (s*_a*_t*—T*—O). Totally differentiating                  v

with respect to s, a, t and T yields:

(15)              dv — v5ds + VadA + vtdt + VTdT

                        — p1NEds    +    p1Nda         -
                                                           p2g(E)dt   -
                                                                          p1dT.

(see Appendix C, equation (C6)).                   Totally differentiating the government's

budget constraint (14) with respect to s, a, t and T yields (at

       We now examine the welfare effects of changes in each one of the

distortionary taxes s, a and t, offset by a change in the first period

lump-sum tax T.     These revenue-neutral welfare effects are derived from

(15) and (16):

(17)              dv/ds       V5 + VTdT/dS
                          —   p1(NE       -
                                                  dT/ds) — 0;

(18)              dv/da   — p1(N      -
                                              dT/da)             —   0;
(19)              dv/dt — - p2g(E)                 -
                                                       p1dT/dt
                          —   -   (p2R        -
                                                  p1N)g(E)/R
                          — p3g(E)R                    0.

       Thus, (19) implies that a small income tax (in the second period)

which is financed by a first-period lump-ium subaidy (a negative T) is

welfare improving.     This is a sort of an old age social security scheme.

The rationale for this result is as follows. On the one hand                                such a

policy transfers resources from the children to the parent and thereby

alleviates the nonnegativity constraint on bequests and thus raises

welfare.    On the other      hand,    an income tax is distortionary because it

discourages investment in human capital.                              However, this distortionary

effect is of a second-order magnitude,                           since    in general a small tax has

only a second-order effect on welfare around the laissez-faire

equilibrium.     Therefore, a second-period income tax with a first-period

lump-sum subsidy increases welfare. Interestingly, an income tax is

justified here on pure efficiency grounds rather than on the more

conventional redistribution grounds. We also drew a similar conclusion in

Nerlove et al.     (1984, 1987, Chapter 8) in the context of differential

ability of children.

       As should be clear from the analysis of section III, since the parent

is altruistic, a policy which enhances the parent's welfare may improve

the children's welfare as well.                     Indeed,          employing similar methods to
                                               -    16    -




those     of section III and making use of (16), one can show that the effect

of our social security scheme on the children utility (consumption)                           is



                —    12    (g(u11-i ul3)(          -1)1   +

                                                                                   gg'']
where

                        2ng'u3 + gu3   +   u33(g')2       < 0,

by the second-order conditions for utility maximization.4                              As in section

III, there are two conflicting effects on                        c:       the income effect works in

the direction of increasing c2; but the second term reflects the desire of

the parent to lower c2, as the bequest constraint is effectively relaxed.

4hen the income effect is relatively strong, the social security scheme is

Pareto-improving.

         Equations (17) and (18) imply that a small education subsidy and a

child allowance have no first-order effects on welfare.                             This is obvius

since they do not play any role in intertemporal redistributions (since

they are financed by a lump-sum tax in the same period) and their

distortionary effect on welfare is, as in general, only of a second-order

magnitude.              Furthermore, due to this lack of any intertemporal

distribution role, one can show that a finite education subsidy/tax or a

finite child allowance/tax reduce welfare. To see this, observe that the

parent's choices of ci, n, c2, and e in the presence of s, a and T

satisfy the budget constraints:

(20)                      C1(sa,O,T)   + N(s,a,O,T)(l-s)E(s,a,O,T)
                                       -   aN(s,a,0,T)            I   -   T
and

(21)                      C2(s,a,O,T) <    g(E(s,a,0,T)J.
                                        -   17   -




Since    the government's budget constraint in this case is

(22)               ..N(s,a,0,T) +   uE(a,a,0T)N(a,a,0,T)    -   T — 0,

it follows from (20) and (22) that

(23)               C1(s,a,0,T) +    N(s,a,0,T)E(s,a,0,T)<I.
Thus, the bundle chosen in the presence of s,a, and T is affordable under

the laissez-faire budget constraints (compare (23) and (21) with (2) and

(4), respectively).      Therefore, an education tax or subsidy and a child

allowance or tax, financed by a first-period iump-sum tax or subsidy

cannot possibly increase welfare.           Such taxes or subsidies will usually

reduce welfare.

V.      Coriclusion3

        When institutional constraints to the transfer of resources from

children to their parents exists, welfare of the parents' generation may

be improved by some sort of an old age social security scheme:           a luxnp-suiu

subsidy to parents, financed by debt creation to be paid by the revenues

from an income tax on children.        Such an income tax is justified not by

income redistribution considerations, as is typically the case, but

rather on pure efficiency grounds. Due to its intergenerational-transfer

role, the social security scheme is Pareto-improving with altruistic

parents if, in addition,     the real income effect which tends to raise

children consumption is relatively strong.           If the model is extended to an

infinite overlapping generations model, the social security will not only

tax children when they are young but will also subsidize them when they

are old.     In such a setup, social security is more likely to be Pareto-

improving.
                                     - 18   -




     Other conceivably   corrective measures such as subsidies to parents'

expenditures on children's education or a tax on children are shown         o    be

welfare reducing.

     We also explore the implication of such a corrective policy for the

children welfare and for the rate of population growth.         We identified a

feature which can make this policy to improve the welfare of children.

This feature is a strong real income effect on children consumption.

Intuition suggests that population growth will be greater when bequest

constraints are eliminated,    or ameliorated.      However, this is not

necessarily the case due to income effects and because of the trade-offs

between numbers and welfare of children are altered.

                                  Aooendix      A
     In this appendix we describe a simple closed economy with overlapping

generations in which a parent is constrained in her ability to transfer

resources from the future back to the present, while the society is not.

Suppose an individual, whom we call Eve, lives for three periods.          Eve is

born in the first period in which she receives an education from her

parents and inherits b     0 from them at the end of this period.       In the

second period she works, consumes and saves for the third period.          In the

third and last period of her life Eve has children,        invests in their human

capital and bequeaths b'      0 to each of them.

     Now consider the third period of Eve's life.         In this period also a

person from another generation, Adam, who was born in the previous period,

is alive.   Adam is in the second period of his life in which he works and

can save.   Thus,   the society can transfer resources in the third period of

Eve's life from Adam to her.     Next period, Eve's children will be in the
                                                  19 -




second (working/saving) period of                their lives and society can transfer

reso4lrces from them back to Adam.               In this way, society is able to

transfer resources indirectly from Eve's children to herself (via Adam).

Eve, herself, cannot make such a transfer due to the nonnegativity

constraint on bequests.

and let g take the form

(B2)              g(e)
                          —   2eV2.
       The optimal allocation is obtained by maximizing (Bl) subject to

(Z2), (2) and (4).        The solution to a is given by g'(e) — R, implying that

(B3)              e** —    hR2.       g(e**) — 2/R.

Upon substitution, the optimal allocation can be found by solving

(B4)              Max [I-(l/R2+b)n+an-hn2/2+nlog(2/R+bR)].
                  (b,n)

The first-order conditions are:

(B5)              -l/R2-b+a-hn+log(2/R+bR)—              0.

and

(B6)              -l+R/(2/R+bR) —           0.
From (B6) we can find the optimal bequest:

(37)              b** —       (R2-2)/R2.
Assuming that R < 21/2 ensures that b** < 0.                  Substituting (37) into (35)

we can solve for the optimal number of children:

(B8)              n** —       (logR   +   l/R2+a-l]/h.
Substituting (87) and (83) into (4) yields the optimal level of c2:
                                             - 20   -




(89)                C2** — R.

        The laissez-faire allocation will have b*         — 0   in this case.    This

allocation can be found by solving the following optimization problem.

(810)               Max (I-en+an-hn2/2+nlog2e1/2J.
                    (e,n)

The first-order conditions are:

(811)               e+ahn+log2eV2 — 0,

and

(B12)               -l+l/2e —      0.

From (Bl2) we can solve for the laissez-faire quantity of investment in

human capital:

(813)               e* —    1/2.
Substituting (813) into (811) we can find the laissez-faire number of

children:

(814)               n* —    (-1/2+a+1og21/2)/h.

Substituting (813) into (4) yields the laissez-faire level               f C2:
(815)               c2* —    21/2.

        Comparing (88) with (814), we can see that if           R   is sufficiently small

so that    2(logR-i-1/R2)    <   l+log2,   then n* will be larger than n**.      Thus,

there is no presumption that a binding bequest constraint causes parents

to bring a fewer than optimal number of children.

        Comparing (89) with (814), we can see that since, by assumption,                 R   <

21/2,    then c2*   > c2**.        This result is in line with the analysis of

section III which suggests that when the real income effect on c2 is

relatively small, then c2 is lower in the optimum than in the laissez-

faire.     Indeed,       in this example c2 is a neutral good so that the real

income effect is zero.

                                                Appendix C

        The parent maximizes u(c1,n,c2) subject to the following budget

imply that

1.   A similar distinction between the intertemporal constraint faced by

the individual and by the economy exists also in a closed-economy when


generations overlap (see Appendix A).

2.   As shown in Section III, maximizing the altruistic parent's utility

will lead also to a higher children utility if the real income effect on

c2, arising from the effective relaxation of the bequest constraint,             is

relatively strong; see below.

3.   Since first-period income is exogenous, them an income tax in the

first period is essentially a non-distortionary lump-sum tax.

4.   As in Section III, n is assumed exogenous in the derivation of

dc2/dt.
