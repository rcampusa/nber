                                            ABSTRACT

This study provides the first nation-wide analysis of the labor market implications of occupational
licensing for the U.S. labor market, using data from a specially designed Gallup survey. We find that
in 2006, 29 percent of the workforce was required to hold an occupational license from a government
agency, which is a higher percentage than that found in studies that rely on state-level occupational
licensing data. Workers who have higher levels of education are more likely to work in jobs that require
a license. Union workers and government employees are more likely to have a license requirement
than are nonunion or private sector employees. Our multivariate estimates suggest that licensing has
about the same quantitative impact on wages as do unions -- that is about 15 percent, but unlike unions
which reduce variance in wages, licensing does not significantly reduce wage dispersion for individuals
in licensed jobs.

Introduction

     One of the fastest growing, yet least understood, institutions in the U.S. labor market is

occupational licensing. The movement to a service-oriented economy from manufacturing,

where unions and contracts were prominent, created a demand for a “web of rules” of the

workplace that licensing may have provided (Dunlop, 1958). While unions have declined,

occupational licensing has grown over the last fifty years (Kleiner, 2006).

       Occupational regulation in the U.S. generally takes three forms. The least restrictive form

is registration, in which individuals file their names, addresses, and qualifications with a

government agency before practicing their occupation. The registration process may include

posting a bond or filing a fee. In contrast, certification permits any person to perform the relevant

tasks, but the government—or sometimes a private, nonprofit agency—administers an

examination and certifies those who have achieved the level of skill and knowledge for

certification. For example, travel agents and car mechanics are generally certified but not

licensed. The toughest form of regulation is licensure; this form of regulation is often referred to

as “the right to practice.” Under licensure laws, working in an occupation for compensation

without first meeting government standards is illegal. In 2003 the Council of State

Governments estimated that more than 800 occupations were licensed in at least one state, and

more than 1,100 occupations were licensed, certified or registered (CLEAR, 2004).

       In this paper we use newly available data from a national survey conducted by the Gallup

Organization on our behalf to analyze the influence of occupational licensing in the labor market.

To determine if a worker is in a licensed position, the survey asks the question: “Does your job

require a license by a federal, state or local government agency?”




                                                  1
       This study is the first attempt to gather nation-wide data by asking individuals whether a

government license is required to do their work. We find that about twenty-nine percent of the

work-force is required to obtain a license from either the federal, state or local government to

work for pay. The information from the survey shows that licensing is more prevalent among

more highly educated workers, minorities, union members, and government workers. The impact

of licensing on wages, as judged from a cross-sectional regression, is similar to the influence of

unions on wages. Unlike the estimates of the impact of unions, that reduces the variation of

wages, licensing results show that there is little effect on wage variations. However, workers

who are licensed say they are more competent in doing their jobs, in contrast to what we find for

union members.

Why License?

       The simplest theory of occupational licensing emphasizes the administrative procedural

role of licensing. It perceives a costless supply of unbiased, capable gatekeepers and enforcers.

Friedman (1962) questioned the role of the government and professional associations as unbiased

gatekeepers and enforcers. Instead, he viewed licensing’s entry restrictions as creating

undesirable monopoly rents through greater barriers to entry. Friedman argued that licensing

systems are almost always run by and for incumbents, so that gatekeepers and enforcers are self-

interested. Their vested interests lead them to not only create monopoly rents through restrictions

on entry but also to limit complaints and disciplinary procedures against most incumbents.

       An alternative view is that licensing requirements can take the form of unspecified fixed

costs controlled by the licensing authority that is similar to the unbiased gatekeeper (Shapiro

1986). The skill and quality of the licensed worker affects the relative cost of producing high-

quality services, and licensing takes the more specific form of a minimal human capital



                                                 2
requirement. In practice the fixed costs would be requirements that entrants and incumbents take

job specific training programs, pass an exam or have long-term residency requirements. These

models resemble the ones above in predicting, typically, that both the average quality and the

average prices or earnings from the services within the regulated industry will rise as licensing

requirements are implemented or tightened, resulting in benefits for those who want higher

quality, but at a cost to those who are in lower quality service markets.

Growth of Regulation

       During the early 1950s, less than 5 percent of the U.S. work force was covered by

licensing laws at the state level (Council of State Governments, 1952). That grew to almost 18

percent by the 1980s—with an even larger number if federal, city and county occupational

licensing is included. By 2000, the percent of the workforce in occupations licensed by states

was at least 20 percent, according to data gathered from the Department of Labor and the 2000

Census.

       As employment shifted from manufacturing to service industries, which typically have

lower union representation, the members of the occupations established a formal set of standards

that governed members of the occupation. For a professional association, obtaining licensing

legislation meant raising funds from members to lobby the state legislature, particularly the

chairs of appropriate committees. In addition, the occupation association often solicits volunteers

from its membership to work on legislative campaigns. With both financial contributions and

volunteers, the occupational association has a significant ability to influence legislation,

especially when opposition to regulatory legislation is absent or minimal (Wheelan, 1998).

          Most prior studies gathered data to estimate the number of individuals who were in

licensed occupations at the state level, where most licensing occurs in the U.S. (Kleiner, 2006).



                                                  3
However, these estimates understate the regulation that also occurs at the federal and local level.

For this reason the Gallup Survey provides a more comprehensive assessment of the coverage of

occupational licensing. In Figure 1 we show trends in the growth of occupational licensing and

unionization from 1950 to 20061. Licensing data for earlier periods are only available at the

state/occupational level; the data gathered through the Gallup Survey are denoted with a dashed

line in the figure. Despite possible problems in both data series, it is clear that occupational

licensing is rising and unionization is declining. By 2006, 29 percent of workers said they were

required to have a government-issued licensed to do their job, compared with only 12 percent

who said they were union members.

The Gallup Survey

         The survey we use for our analysis was a national survey conducted by the Gallup

Organization from May to August of 2006. The random digit dial phone survey began with the

Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) American Time Use Survey (AUTS), and included Current

Population Survey (CPS) questions on demographics, industry, occupation, earnings, and

education. The response rate was 37 percent, which is reasonable for a private survey of this

kind.2 The total number of respondents in the survey was 3,982, and 2,037 of these individuals

were employed in the reference week. Due to missing data the totals for the analysis of wages

and perceived competence is generally lower. We examined the individual responses for those

who stated that they needed a license to do their work and found few surprises. When we

examined individual responses for accountants, teachers, and barbers, they typically stated they

  The method used to calculate the percent licensed prior to 2006 first involved gathering the listing of licensed
occupations in Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupation and Employment Survey. This was matched with occupations
in the 2000 Census. If no match was obtained the occupation was dropped. From the Census the number working
in the licensed occupation in each state was estimated and used to calculate a weighted average of the percent of the
workforce in U.S. that works in a licensed occupation.
2
  Sample weights were developed to adjust for non response. The pattern of time use closely matched the ATUS.
All of the results we present rely on weighted estimates.

needed a license to do their work. Similarly, factory laborers, carpenters, and economists stated

they did not need a license.

       In Figure 2 we show the distribution of licensed occupations by education, race, union

status, public or private sector, and gender. The results indicate that licensing increases with

education: more than 40 percent of those with post college education are required to have a

license, a contrast to 11 percent for those with less than a high school education. Both African-

Americans and Hispanics have a higher percentage of licenses than do Whites or Asians. In

panel C of Figure 2 the results show that union members are more likely to be licensed,

reflecting the large number of teachers and nurses who tend to be both union members and

licensed. Government workers are more likely to have a license than non-government workers,

and there is no difference in the licensing rate by gender.

Multivariate Estimates

       In Table 1 we summarize initial results of the impact of licensing on wages. Specifically,

we augment a standard human capital earnings equation to include a dummy variable measuring

whether a license is required for the worker’s job. We regard these estimates as mainly

descriptive as licensed workers may differ from unlicensed workers in unobserved ways, even

after we condition on education and occupation. If a licensed dummy is added to a standard

wage equation, having a license is associated with approximately 15 percent higher hourly

earnings (p-value < 0.001). The cross-sectional effect of licensing is remarkably similar to the

estimated effect of belonging to a union (see Lewis, 1986), and greater than an additional year of

schooling.

       Of course, jobs that require a license may also require higher skill, and thus may not be

directly comparable, even conditional on education, experience and other covariates variables in



                                                  5
the regression. We can partially adjust for unobserved factors by controlling for occupation

dummies. Within some occupations (e.g., electricians), identical jobs are licensed in some states

and not in others. In an alternative specification in column 2, we controlled for 306 detailed

occupation dummies. We continued to find an estimate of the licensing variable of around 15

percent, and the estimate continued to be statistically significant. The resilience of the licensing

wage effect to occupation controls suggests that the cross-sectional estimate is not severely

biased by omitted variables associated with licensing at the occupation level.3

         Does licensing reduce variability in wages similar to the impact of unions? To examine

the role of each labor market institution on the wage structure within large occupational

categories, we grouped workers into three large occupational groups: professional and technical

workers, managers and administrators, other occupations. Large occupational groups were used

to have sufficient observations for a meaningful analysis of wage dispersion in similar types of

jobs. We also looked within the full sample. For each sample we first regressed the log wage on

education, experience, and dummy variables indicating union status, occupational licensing

status, public sector employment and gender. We then used the squared residuals from this

regression to compare the mean squared residual in licensed and unlicensed jobs and in

unionized and nonunionized jobs. The results in Table 2 show that the dispersion of wages of

union members is significantly lower than for nonunion members, consistent with Freeman

(1982). Residual wage dispersion in licensed jobs, however, is about the same or only slightly

smaller, on average, than in unregulated ones. Unlike unions, the institution of occupational

licensing does not appear to result in lower wage dispersion.




3
 We also attempted to instrument for licensing by using the state licensing of an occupation such as electricians
plumbers and teachers but were not able find a robust instrument in our first stage estimates.

                                                          6
       If licensing is associated with increases in earnings, does it result in more competent

services? Our evidence here is sketchy and depends on subjective self assessments. We model

answers to a question that asked: “On a scale of 0 to 6, where 0 means not at all and 6 means

very much, how competent did you feel while you were at work yesterday?” Using responses to

this question as the dependent variable, we estimate a multivariate equation with standard human

capital and labor market variable as controls. Table 3 shows our results. We find that

individuals who have a license perceive themselves as being more competent. In contrast, union

members perceive themselves as less competent than other workers. Although a more precise

measure of quality would gather information from consumers or directly observe output, these

estimates show that self-reported abilities are higher for licensed workers. Moreover, the

contrast with union members suggests that the results are not merely the consequence of a wage

premium. If the results can be replicated for consumer outcomes, there may be support for the

Shapiro model of greater ability, quality, and costs of licensing for some consumers as a

consequence of licensing (Shapiro, 1986).

Conclusions

       Our study provides the first national analysis of labor market implications of workers

who are licensed by any agency of the government in the U.S. Using a specially designed

Gallup survey of a nationally representative sample of Americans, we provide a preliminary

analysis of the influence of this form of occupational regulation. We find that 29 percent of the

workforce was required to hold a license in 2006, which is a higher percentage than that found in

other studies that rely on state-level occupational licensing data or single states. Workers who

have higher levels of education are more likely to work in jobs that require a license. This

pattern suggests that our results are not spuriously reflecting driver’s licenses. Union workers



                                                 7
and government employees are more likely to have a license requirement than are nonunion or

private sector employees. Our multivariate estimates suggest that licensing has about the same

quantitative impact on wages as do unions -- that is about 15 percent. If this result holds up to

further scrutiny, occupational licensing would be a much more important phenomenon for the

distribution of income than labor unions.

       With the large and growing number of workers required to obtain an occupational

license, and the apparently large effect of licensing requirements on the labor market, we think it

would be prudent for the government to measure the extent of occupational licensing in a manner

similar to information that is collected for unions. To help this effort, we are in the process of

developing a small number of questions on occupational licensing that can be added to a labor

force survey, such as the Current Population Survey. These questions would help to answer

more fully how much regulation is optimal, the effect of licensing on wages and productivity,

and the type of regulation that is best suited for the emerging jobs in the workforce.
