                                             ABSTRACT

We use a forty-two country model of production and trade to assess the implications of eliminating
current account imbalances for relative wages, relative GDP's, real wages, and real absorption. How
much relative GDP's need to change depends on flexibility of two forms: factor mobility and the adjustment
in sourcing of imports, with more flexibility requiring less change. At the extreme, US GDP falls by
30 percent relative to the world's. Because of the pervasiveness of nontraded goods, however, most
domestic prices move in parallel with relative GDP, so that changes in real GDP are small.

       The United States’chronic current account de…cit will inevitably reverse, and the re-

versal could be quite sudden. What would this reversal mean for the United States itself

and for other countries? There are possibly major e¤ects on relative GDP’s, real wages,

and real absorption, not only across countries, but across individuals within countries.

       We explore this question using a gravity model of trade and production. Because it

represents the major component of trade, we focus on manufactures, asking what happens

if manufacturing is the sector that bears the burden of rebalancing trade. We pursue this

analysis using data for 2004 for the world, dividing it into forty-two countries. Table I

lists the countries, their GDP’s, and three di¤erent de…cit measures: the current account

de…cit, the overall trade de…cit, and the de…cit in manufactures.1

       In 2004 the United States ran a current account de…cit of $650 billion, nearly 6 percent of

its GDP.2 Aggregating the surpluses of the three largest surplus countries, Japan, Germany,

and China, gets us to only $370 billion, little more than half the U.S. de…cit. Note that

for each of these four countries with the largest imbalances, the manufacturing balance is

by far the largest component of the overall balance.

       We build on previous work that integrates factor-market equilibrium into a model of

international production and trade with heterogeneous goods and barriers to trade. Contri-

butions include Eaton and Kortum (2002), Alvarez and Lucas (2007), and Chaney (2008).

We pursue a particular speci…cation of gravity relationships which we introduced in Dekle,

Eaton, and Kortum (2007). Rather than estimating such a model in terms of levels, we
   1
       We describe how we created this sample and where our data come from in Section 3.1.
   2
       This number is not only very large absolutely, it’s large relative to U.S. GDP. Australia, Greece, and

Portugal have larger de…cit to GDP ratios. Some small countries run current account surpluses that are

much larger fractions of their GDP. The Bureau of Economics Analysis reports the US current account

de…cit in 2006 as $857 billion, 6.1 percent of GDP.

us to calibrate the model from existing data on production and trade shares. We thereby

…nesse having to assemble proxies for bilateral resistance (e.g., distance, common language,

etc.) or inferring parameters of technology. A particular virtue is that we do not have to

impose the symmetry in bilateral trade ‡ows implied by these measures but spurned by

the data. China, for example, runs the largest bilateral surplus with the United States,

while running substantial de…cits with some of her Asian neighbors, Japan in particular.

Our approach recognizes and incorporates these bilateral asymmetries.

   Our earlier work considered the e¤ect of eliminating current account de…cits in a world

in which factors could seamlessly move between manufacturing and other activities. While

this assumption might apply to the very long run, it probably fails to capture barriers to

internal factor mobility that are likely to loom large for some time. Here we pursue the

opposite extreme of treating factors as …xed in either manufacturing or nonmanufacturing

activity. For comparison purposes we present our results for the case of perfect factor

mobility as well.

   In either case we allow adjustment to take the form of changes in the range of goods that

countries exchange (the extensive margin) as well as changes in the amounts of each good

traded (the intensive margin). But adjustment at the extensive margin may take time.

Hence, to capture very short run e¤ects we consider a case in which both the allocation of

labor and the extensive margin are …xed.

   Both this paper and our previous one return to a venerable topic, the potential for

a secondary burden of a transfer. A question we can answer is the extent to which the

elimination of the giant U.S. current account de…cit entails a loss in real resources beyond

the loss of the transfer itself. Our model recognizes the importance of nontradability, so that


                                              2
it delivers Keynes’prediction that the elimination of a transfer entails a worsened terms

of trade. But since our model also incorporates nontraded goods whose prices decline, the

burden of paying more for imports is mostly o¤set by the bene…t of cheaper nontraded

goods. With an active extensive margin, the o¤set is nearly complete. Our numbers thus

come down on the side of Ohlin: The elimination of the transfer entails a loss in real

absorption of virtually the same magnitude.3

       This prediction emerges under either extreme assumption about factor mobility. But

factor immobility introduces a major additional consideration: The internal redistribution

of income implied by global rebalancing. We …nd that, with resource immobility, eliminat-

ing the current account de…cit raises the returns to U.S. factors working in manufacturing to

those working elsewhere by about 30 percent (with or without adjustment at the extensive

margin).

       Obstfeld and Rogo¤ (2005) also employ a static trade model to examine the implications

of eliminating current account imbalances. Their focus is on real exchange rates and the

terms of trade, rather than real wages and welfare, our interest here. They employ a stylized

three-region model. With labor mobility our results are closest to what Obstfeld and Rogo¤

call a “very gradual”unwinding, or a decade-long adjustment, while labor immobility (with

or without an operative extensive margin) connects better with their baseline scenario.4
   3
       While our framework can quite handily deal with a multitude of countries, its analytic essence derives

from the two-country model of trade and unilateral transfers of Dornbusch, Fischer, and Samuelson (1977).
   4
     Corsetti, Martin, and Pesenti (2007) develop a symmetric two-country model in which adjustment can

also occur across both the intensive and extensive margins. They examine the long-run consequences of

the e¤ects of improving net export de…cits of 6.5 percent of GDP in one country to a balanced position.

In the version of the model in which all adjustment takes place at the intensive margin, the authors …nd

that closing the external imbalance requires a fall in long-run consumption (of the country undergoing the



                                                       3
    We proceed as follows: Section 1 speci…es a world model of production and trade in

manufactures, allowing for both perfect immobility and perfect mobility of labor. How

we calibrate this model to data on production and trade shares is the topic of Section 2.

Sections 3 reports our results for various cases and Section 4 concludes.



1     A Model of the World

We consider a world of i = 1; : : : ; N countries. Country i is endowed with labor Li .5 Labor

is allocated between two sectors, manufacturing LM                       N
                                                 i and nonmanufacturing Li , with



      LM     N
       i + L i = Li :                                                                                    (1)

Throughout we assume that all production is at constant returns to scale and that all

markets are perfectly competitive.6



1.1     Income and Expenditure: Some Accounting

We relate production and trade in manufactures to aggregate income, expenditure, and

wages. We have to do some accounting to draw these connections.
adjustment) by around 6 percent and a depreciation of the real exchange rate, and the terms of trade by

17 percent and 22 percent, respectively. When adjustment can also occur at the extensive margin, there

is a much smaller depreciation in the real exchange rate, and in the terms of trade, of 1.1 percent and 6.4

respectively. The changes in consumption, and welfare, under the two versions of the model, however, are

similar.
   5
     To generalize our analysis to incorporate multiple factors of production one may think of Li as a vector

of factors.
    6
      See Eaton, Kortum, and Kramarz (2008) to see how the model could be respeci…ed in terms of mo-

nopolistic competition with heterogeneous …rms, as in Melitz (2003) and Chaney (2008). There are no

essential di¤erences for the conclusions we draw here.


                                                     4
   We denote country i’s gross production of manufactures as YiM of which a share        i

is value-added. With perfect competition, value added corresponds to factor payments

ViM = wiM LM          M
           i , where wi is the manufacturing wage.

   Similarly, wiN is the nonmanufacturing wage, so that nonmanufacturing value added is

ViN = wiN LN
           i and GDP is



     Yi = ViM + ViN = wiM LM    N N
                           i + wi Li :



If we de…ne the average wage as

            wiM LM    N N
                 i + wi Li
     wi =                  ;                                                           (2)
                   Li

then GDP is simply Yi = wi Li : Our notation is designed to admit: (i) sectoral labor

mobility, in which case LM      N                      M    N
                         i and Li are endogenous with wi = wi = wi and (ii) immobile

labor, in which case LM      N
                      i and Li are …xed with wages typically di¤ering by sector.

   We denote country i’s gross absorption of manufactures as XiM and its manufacturing

de…cit as DiM : They are connected with YiM via the identity:


     YiM = XiM        DiM :                                                            (3)


   Manufactures have two purposes, as inputs into the production of manufactures and to

satisfy …nal demand. We denote the share of manufactures in …nal demand as     i   so that

demand for manufactures in country i is:


     XiM =    i Xi   + (1     )(1   i )Yi
                                         M
                                                                                       (4)


where Xi is …nal absorption, equal to GDP Yi plus the overall trade de…cit Di ; and     is

the share of nonmanufactures (hence 1        the share of manufactures) in manufacturing

       Combining (3) and (4) we get:

                                                                        M
           i (Yi   + Di ) = [ (1                   i)   +         i ] Yi    + DiM :


Rearranging we get equations for manufacturing production and absorption:

                       i (wi Li + Di ) DiM
         YiM =                                                                                                                      (5)
                             (1   i) + i

                                                                                          M
                       i (wi Li      + Di )         (1              )(1               i )Di
         XiM =                                                                                :                                     (6)
                                        (1               i)   +       i

These equations will allow us to connect world equilibrium in manufactures to various

de…cits.



1.2        International Trade

Manufactures consist of a unit continuum of di¤erentiated goods indexed by j: We denote

country i’s e¢ ciency making good j as zi (j). The cost of producing good j in country i is

thus ci =zi (j), where ci is the cost of an input bundle in country i. Given the production

structure introduced above:

                                                              (1     )(1     i)
         ci =      i   wiM       i
                                     (wiN )   (1        i)   pi                   ;                                                 (7)


where pi is an index of manufacturing input prices in country i, to be determined be-

low. The term                i   is a constant that depends on ,                                  i,   and the productivity of labor in
   7
       More precisely the parameter                 i   captures both manufactures used in …nal absorption and manufactures

used as intermediates in the production of nonmanufactures. For simplicity, we ignore this feedback from

the manufacturing sector to the nonmanufacturing sector. As we discuss below, this feedback appears to

be small.



                                                                                       6
nonmanufacturing.8

      We make the standard assumption of “iceberg”trade barriers, implying that to deliver

one unit of a manufactured good from country i to country n requires shipping dni                                             1

units, where we normalize dii = 1. Thus, delivering a unit of good j produced in country i

to country n incurs a unit cost:

                        ci dni
        pni (j) =              :
                        zi (j)

1.2.1         Ricardian Specialization

Here we set up the model assuming that buyers purchase any good from its lowest cost

source, so that the extensive margin is active. We turn to what happens if this margin is

shut o¤ in Section 1.2.3.2 below.

      As in Eaton and Kortum (2002) country i’s e¢ ciency zi (j) in making good j is the

realization of a random variable Z with distribution:

                                                  Ti z
        Fi (z) = Pr[Z              z] = e


which is drawn independently across i: Here Ti > 0 is a parameter that re‡ects country i’s

overall e¢ ciency in producing any good and                                           is an inverse measure of the dispersion of

e¢ ciencies. The implied distribution of pni (j) is:

                                                  ci dni                        Ti (ci dni )   p
        Pr[Pni          p] = Pr Z                        =1                e                          :
                                                     p
  8
      If the unit cost function in nonmanufactures is wiN =ai ; re‡ecting productivity ai ; then:

                         (1   i)
                                                                (1   i)                                   (1   )(1   i)
          i   = (ai )              i

                                                                                7
Buyers in destination n will buy each manufacturing good j from the cheapest source at a

price:


         pn (j) = min fpni (j)g :

The distribution Gn (p) of prices paid in country n is

where:

                   X
                   N

          n    =         Ti (ci dni )          :
                   i=1


   The probability                ni   that country i is the cheapest source is its share of this sum:

                   Ti (ci dni )
          ni   =                       :                                                                              (8)
                             n


Invoking the law of large numbers, this probability becomes the measure of goods that

country n purchases from country i. Thus                                     ni   is a bilateral trade share measured by

numbers of goods. To obtain a trade share measured by expenditures we must specify

demand.


1.2.2      Demand for Manufactures

We assume that the individual manufacturing goods, whether used as intermediates or in

…nal demand, combine with constant elasticity                                     > 0. Spending in country n on good j is

therefore
                                           (       1)
                             pn (j)
         XnM (j) =                                      XnM ;
                              pn



                                                                         8
where pn is the the manufacturing price index in country n; which appeared previously in

expression (7) for the cost of an input bundle. We compute this price index by integrating

over the prices of individual goods:
                      Z   1                                    1=(    1)
                                       (    1)                                             1=
      pn =                     p                 dGn (p)                   ='          n              (9)
                      0


where:

                                   (            1)
      '=                                             :


and      is the gamma function, requiring                                  >                    1.

   We can express bilateral trade shares in expenditure terms mechanically as:
                                                      M
               XM                                ni X ni
         ni   = ni = PN                                   M
                                                               ;                                     (10)
               XnM                                   nk X nk
                                            k=1

              M
where X ni is average spending per good in country n on goods purchased from i.
                                   M
   To compute X ni we need to know the distribution Gni (p) of the prices of goods that

country n buys from country i since:
                               Z       1                 (   1)
        M                                       p
      X ni        =   XnM                                         dGni (p):
                                   0            pn

As shown in Eaton and Kortum (2002), among the goods that n buys from i, the distri-

bution of prices is the same regardless of source, so that write Gni (p) = Gn (p). It follows
         M
that X ni = XnM and hence (10) becomes:

        M
      Xni                                           Ti (ci dni )
          =               ni   =           ni   = PN                           :                     (11)
      XnM                                          k=1 Tk (ck dnk )


The two measures of the bilateral trade share reduce to the same thing.




                                                                                   9
1.2.3         Trade Elasticities

How do trade shares and prices respond to changes in input costs around the world? Say

that the costs of input bundles in each country k move from ck to c0k . We can represent

                                  ck = c0k =ck .
this change in terms of the ratio b


Extension Margin Operative We …rst consider the case in which a buyer can switch

to any new source country that can deliver a good more cheaply. The resulting bilateral

trade shares are:

                        Ti (c0i dni )                Ti (ci dni ) bci         ni b
                                                                                 c
         0
         ni    = PN             0
                                                 = PN                    = PN i       :
                       k=1 Tk (ck dnk )             k=1 Tk (ck dnk )  b
                                                                      ck    k=1 nk b
                                                                                   ck

The parameter determining how changes in costs translate into trade shares is , which

re‡ects the extent of heterogeneity in production e¢ ciency. It captures how changes in

costs bring about a change in international specialization in production and delivery to

various markets, the extensive margin.

   We also need to consider how price indices adjust to a change in costs around the world.

Starting from (9), with the extensive margin active, the price index resulting from a change

in costs is

Note that          is nowhere to be seen.


Extensive Margin Inoperative Say instead that after input costs change, countries

are stuck buying each good from the same source as before, so that adjustment is only

in how much is spent on each good, the intensive margin. To see what happens to trade



                                                                     10

Assuming that we started with a situation in which country n bought every good from the

lowest cost source, so that Gni (p) = Gn (p); the resulting trade shares simplify to:
                                            (       1)
            SR 0                  ni b

            ni        = PN                          (    1)
                                                              :                                                                                                     (13)
                              k=1       nk b
                                           ck

The parameter now determining how changes in costs translate into trade shares becomes

     1, as in the Armington model. Since                                              >              1, the e¤ective trade elasticity is lower

when we shut down the extensive margin.

   Parallel to (12) above, we also need an expression for the change in the price index in

each country that results from a change in input costs. To derive this expression, recall

that we can construct the price index from source-speci…c blocks:
                  "               Z                                         #   1=(       1)
                      X
                      N                1
                                                (        1)
          pn =               ni             p                 dGni (p)
                      i=1          0


Therefore, in response to a change in costs:
                       "                Z                                              #       1=(       1)              "                          #   1=(   1)
              0
                            X
                            N                   1
                                                                  (   1)
                                                                                                                             X
                                                                                                                             N
                                                                                                                                           (   1)
          pSR

                                                      ci )                 dGni (p)                               = pn             ni b
                                                                                                                                      ci                           : (14)
                            i=1            0                                                                                 i=1


The elasticity                    1 again replaces                          as the relevant parameter when we shut down the

extensive margin. In all other ways, the analysis is exactly parallel.

                                                                                      11
   We will return to this result in our simulations where we interpret                                                      1 as the short-

term trade elasticity. This interpretation is motivated by the dynamic 2-country analysis

of Ruhl (2005) in which …rms choose not to adjust their extensive margin in response to

temporary ‡uctuations in costs. In this case, all adjustment takes place via expenditure

per good resulting from changes in prices and incomes.

The size of the non-manufacturing sector (and hence of the manufacturing sector) is nailed

    World equilibrium is a set of wages and price levels wiM ; wiN and pi and labor allocations

LM        N
 i ; and Li for each country i that solve equations (1), (2), (16), (17), (18), and (19)

given parameters including labor endowments and de…cits, Di and DiM . To complete the

description of equilibrium, we have to take a stand on labor mobility.

    We consider the two extremes of internal labor market mobility. In the mobile labor

case, which we take as re‡ecting the long run, the wage equilibrates between sectors, so

that wiM = wiN = wi with LM      N
                          i and Li determined endogenously. In the immobile labor

case, which we take as re‡ecting the short tun, workers are tied to either manufacturing or

nonmanufacturing. For this case we take LM      N                         M      N
                                         i and Li as given and solve for wi and wi

separately.

    Our counterfactual experiments calculate the response of all endogenous variables to an

exogenous change in de…cits around the world.



2     Quanti…cation

We now turn to how we quantify the model.



2.1    Data

We created our sample of 42 countries as follows. We began with the …fty largest as mea-

sured by GDP in 2000, and combined the others into a “country”labeled ROW. Incomplete

data forced us to move Saudi Arabia, Poland, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Puerto Rico,

and the Czech Republic into ROW as well. Because of peculiarities in the data suggestive

of entrepôt trade, which our approach here is ill-equipped to handle, we combined (1) Bel-

gium and Luxembourg (which we pulled out of ROW), (2) China and Hong Kong, and (3)


                                              13
Malaysia, Philippines, and Singapore into single entities. The result is 42 entities, which

we refer to as countries, that constitute the entire world.

       To solve for the counterfactual, we need data on GDP (for Yi ), manufacturing value

added (for ViM ), gross manufacturing production (for YiM ); overall and manufacturing
                                                                            M
trade de…cits (Di and DiM ), and bilateral trade ‡ows in manufactures (for Xni ); including

purchases from home XiiM :

       Wherever possible we take data for 2004 with all magnitudes translated into US$billions.

We take GDP Yi and manufacturing value added ViM from the United Nations National

Income Accounts Database (2007). We calculate value added in nonmanufacturing as a

residual, ViN = Yi        ViM :

       The overall trade de…cit in goods and services Di and current account de…cits CAi ;

used for our counterfactual experiments below, are from the IMF (2006). We calculate

total …nal spending as Xi = Yi + Di .9

       Our handling of production and bilateral trade in manufactures is more involved. Our
                            M
goal is a matrix of values Xni of the manufactures that country n buy from i. We begin

with Comtrade data on bilateral trade from the United Nations Statistics Division (2006).

We de…ne manufactures as SITC trade codes 5, 6, 7, and 8. We measure trade ‡ows

between countries using reports of the importing country. We netted out trade within the

three entities containing multiple countries.

       Bilateral trade data do not contain an entry for the value of manufactures that country
   9
       We have to confront the problem that the data imply nonzero current account and trade balances for

the world as a whole. Our procedures can’t explain this discrepancy so we allocated the de…cits to countries

in proportion to their GDP’s. Since we use only importer data to measure bilateral trade in manufactures,

world trade in manufactures balances automatically.




                                                    14
i purchases from local producers, XiiM . We calculate these diagonal elements of the bilateral

trade matrix as follows: (1) For each country i we calculate the share of value added in

manufacturing         i   as the ratio of value added in manufacturing to total manufacturing

production for the most recent year for which each is available (and not imputed) from

the United Nations Industrial Development Organization Industrial Statistics Database

(2006).10 (2) We create a value of YiM for 2004 as YiM = ViM =                 i   using the 2004 value for

ViM . (3) We calculate XiiM = YiM             EiM where EiM is country i’s manufacturing exports
       P
EiM = n6=i XniM
                .

      With our bilateral trade matrix, we can calculate the trade de…cit in manufactures,

DiM . Except for the numbers used to calculate               i;   all data are for 2004, the most recent

year for which we could get complete data.



2.2          Calibration

In principle, computing the world equilibrium requires knowing the parameters dni ;                          i;


 i;     i;    ; Ti ; Li (LM      N
                          i and Li separately in the case of factor immobility); and                 (or    in

the case with no extensive margin) as well as the actual and counterfactual overall and

manufacturing de…cits Di , Di0 , DiM , and DiM 0 . However, since we only consider changes

from the current equilibrium, all we need to know about dni ; Ti ; and                 i   is contained in the

current trade shares         ni   while all we need to know about LM      N
                                                                   i and Li is contained in value

added ViM and ViN :

shutting down the extensive margin by replacing                        with     1. There are a wide range of

estimates of          that we might consider. Bernard, Eaton, Jensen, and Kortum (2003) …nd

that      = 3:79 (and         = 3:60) explains the size and productivity of advantage of U.S. plants

that export. Ruhl (2005) …nds that                 = 2:0 can reconcile the time series data regarding the

degree of adjustment in trade balances to temporary changes in relative costs. To create a

sharper contrast with simulations in which the extensive margin is active, and because our

approach here is inspired by Ruhl (2005), we go with the lower value.

       We calculate the share of nonmanufactures in manufacturing intermediates                         from

input-output tables. We don’t have enough input-output tables to calculate                          for each

country. Instead we calculate              = 0:43 from the 1997 input-output use table of the United

States, and apply this value for all countries (Organization of Cooperation and Develop-

ment, 2007).11

       Using (3) and (4), we calculate         i       as:

                   ViM + (1       i )Yi
                                       M
                                           + DiM
           i   =                                   :
                               Xi

       Table II presents the values of         i   and       i   for our 42 countries, along with data on the

share of manufacturing value added in GDP and the share of exports in manufacturing

gross production. Of our countries, Algeria has the smallest share of manufacturing value

added (at 0:06) and China/Hong Kong (henceforth China) the largest (0:38). Argentina

and Egypt have the least outwardly-oriented manufacturing sector (10 percent exported),

and Malaysia/Philippines/Singapore the most outwardly-oriented (94 percent exported).

The share of value added in manufacturing                         averages around a third, with India having

       As mentioned earlier, we do not take account of the use of manufactures as intermediates in the

production of nonmanufactures. According to the 1997 input output use table for the United States, the

share of intermediates in the gross production of nonmanufactures is 8.5%.

in …nal demand ranges from a low of 0:06 in Ireland to a high of 0:78 in China/Hong Kong.

In spite of these outliers, the values of     are each typically between 0:25 and 0:50.



2.3     Counterfactual De…cits

Our counterfactual is a world in which production and trade in manufactures has adjusted

to eliminate all current account imbalances. Not modeling nonmanufacturing trade, we

hold nonmanufacturing trade de…cits at their 2004 level as a share of world GDP. We thus

set for each country i:


      DiM 0 = DiM + CAi


where CAi is the 2004 current account surplus. We correspondingly set the new trade

de…cit at:


      Di0 = Di + DiM 0       DiM :


Table III reports the actual and counterfactual trade de…cits both overall and in manu-

factures. Notice that the United States must run a surplus in manufactures of over two

hundred billion dollars to balance its current account.



2.4     Formulation in Terms of Changes

As for Ti ;   i;   and dni ; direct observations are hard to come by. Instead of attaching num-

bers to them, and to Li as well, we reformulate the model to express the equilibrating

relationships in terms of aggregates of these parameters that are readily observable. We

then solve for the proportional changes in wages and prices needed to eliminate current

                                                 17
account de…cits. We use x0 to denote the counterfactual value of variable x and x
                                                                                b to denote

x0 =x. We will repeatedly use the fact that factor payments correspond to value added,

so that wik0 Lki = w

            i w        biN

2.5       Computation

Simple iterative procedures solve equations (20) through (24) for changes in wages, em-

ployment, and prices, with equations (26) and (25) employed appropriately for the case at

hand. With 42 countries, a good quality laptop running GAUSS can deliver the solutions

almost immediately. In this algorithm, world GDP is the numéraire,

         X
         N               X
                         N                  X
                                            N
               bi Yi =
               w               wi0 Li   =         wi Li = Y
         i=1             i=1                i=1


hence:

         X
         N
           Yi
                   bi = 1:
                   w
         i=1
               Y

    For each of our 42 countries we present the change in a set of outcomes, presented as

the ratio of the counterfactual value to its original value.

                                                                                  biM ;
    In the case of factor immobility, we present the change in manufacturing wage w

                      biN ; and the change in the overall wage w
nonmanufacturing wage w                                        bi , using (20). The change


                                                              19
in the overall wage corresponds to the change in GDP, since Yi0 = w
                                                                  bi Yi . With factor

                             bi .
mobility we simply solve for w

    Since we solve for the change in the manufacturing price index pbi , we can calculate the
                                                         1   i
change in the cost of living as pbLi = (b
                                        pi )   i
                                                   biN
                                                   w             . We can thus calculate the changes in

real wages and real GDP.

    Taking into account the static gain or loss of the transfers themselves, we get the change

in real absorption in country i as

      ci = wbi 1 + Di0 =Yi0
      W                     :
           pbLi 1 + Di =Yi

The counterfactual bilateral trade share of country i in n;             ni ;   can be constructed from the

original shares using the expressions (22). The counterfactual bilateral trade ‡ow of n’s

imports from i is

       0       0    n   (Yn0 + Dn0 ) (1     )(1              M0
                                                         n )Dn
      Xni =    ni                                                   :
                                  (1    n) + n


Finally, the change in the share of manufacturing value added in GDP is
                        Vb N
      VbiM    1 sN   i
                 i Ybi
            =          :
        Ybi    1 sNi


We now turn to the results.



3     Results

In discussing the results, we work backwards. Since it is conceptually simplest and relates

to our earlier work, we start with the longest run in which both the allocation of labor and

the extensive margin can adjust. We then look at a medium run in which labor is locked

into its initial sector, but the extensive margin still operates. We conclude with the very

                                                   20
short run in which neither margin can adjust: Labor is immobile and there is no change in

the set of goods that countries buy from each other, only how much they buy. Out tables

report all results in terms of relative changes, so that if a variable changed from x to x0 the

              b = x0 =x:12
table reports x



3.1        Labor Mobility

Table IV reports results for the mobile-factor case. With labor mobility, there is a single

national wage whose change equals the change in GDP. The changes in wages are reported

in the …rst column. As noted above they are calculated so that world GDP remains the

same.

       Note that relative wage changes are quite modest. Taking one of the largest swings

the U.S. wage (and hence GDP) falls relative to Japan’s by less than 8 percent. Because

most goods aren’t traded, price indices, reported in the second and third columns, move in

the same direction as wages, resulting in changes to real wages (equivalently real GDP’s),

reported in the fourth column, nearly always a fraction of a percent.

       In countries initially in de…cit, labor shifts from nonmanufacturing to manufacturing to

pay o¤ the de…cit. The change in the manufacturing share is shown in the …fth column.

Note that the shifts can be substantial, with the share for the United States rising by almost

23 percent (about 3 percentage points). The manufacturing sector in Japan declines by 8

percent.

       The last column of Table IV shows the change in real absorption. This change is

dominated by the primary burden of paying down the de…cit. The United States experiences

       In the text we refer to a percentage change in x as 100(b
                                                               x   1) and the percentage change in x2 relative

to x1 as 100 [(b
               x2 =b
                   x1 )   1] :

a 6 percent decline in real absorption while Japan’s and Germany’s rises by around 4

percent. The change in real absorption corresponds almost exactly to the change in the

transfers involved in eliminating current account de…cits. Quantitatively, then, Ohlin was

right. There is no discernible secondary burden to eliminating the transfer.

   To what extent could we have predicted the changes in wages (and GDP’s) from the

size of the current account surplus that had to be eliminated? Figure 1 plots the change in

the wage reported in the …rst column of Table IV against the initial current account de…cit

as a share of GDP (with country codes as listed in Table I). Note that there is a de…nite

negative relationship. Mexico and Canada are a bit below other countries with similar

de…cits, re‡ecting their proximity to the United States whose relative GDP has declined

substantially. There is also a systematic positive relationship between the initial de…cit

and the change in the size of the manufacturing sector. Figure 2 plots the change in the

size of the manufacturing sector (column 5 of Table IV) against the initial current account

as a share of GDP. These results closely match those in Dekle, Eaton, Kortum (2007).



3.2    Labor Immobility

Behind the mild price e¤ects of eliminating the de…cits just reported are big movements in

labor across sectors. What if instead a worker is stuck in the sector where she is initially

employed? The …rst two columns of Table V report the changes in relative wages that our

                                                                                     biM
model says are needed for manufacturing to balance current accounts, the results for w

    biN ; respectively. Again, these changes leave world GDP unchanged. The third column
and w

indicates what happens to GDP overall.

   Except for Canada, the GDP changes are always in the same direction as in the case

of mobile labor, but the magnitudes of the changes are much larger. The United States

                                            22
shrinks relative to Japan by 22 percent (as opposed to 8 percent in the previous case).

Figure 3 plots the change in GDP against the initial current account de…cit as a share of

GDP, using the same scale as Figure 1. Note that the relationship is again negative and

about twice as steep as in the case of labor mobility. Hence eliminating countries’ability

to reallocate resources requires substantially more adjustment in relative GDP’s.

   Nearly as systematic is the tendency of the wage in manufacturing relative to nonman-

ufacturing to rise in countries initially in de…cit with the opposite in surplus countries. In

the United States, the relative wage in manufacturing rises by 29 percent. The change for

Australia, another large de…cit country, is nearly as large. In Japan and Germany, the

largest surplus countries, the relative wage of manufacturing workers declines by around

10 percent. Looking across countries, changes in nonmanufacturing wages contribute much

more to changes in relative GDP. Figure 4 plots the change in the manufacturing share

against the initial current account de…cit as a share of GDP. Note the systematically posi-

tive relationship.

   Because of the pervasiveness of nontradedness, both the price index of manufactures

(reported in the fourth column of Table V) and the overall price index (reported in the

fourth column of Table VI) move in line with relative GDP. As a consequence, changes in

real GDP (reported in the third column of Table VI) are much smaller than the changes in

relative GDP. While the secondary burden of eliminating current account de…cits is about

twice what it was with labor mobility, it remains a tiny percentage of the initial de…cit.

   Although aggregate changes are small, the redistributional e¤ects are substantial. Col-

umn 1 of Table VI shows real gains to labor in the manufacturing sector in countries that

are initially in de…cit. In the United States, the real wage in manufacturing rises by 24

percent but declines by 4 percent outside manufacturing. In Japan, the real manufacturing


                                             23
wage declines by 9 percent with a 2 percent gain in nonmanufacturing. In every country

the real wage moves in opposite directions in the two sectors.



3.3    No Extensive Margin

Sticking with a situation of labor immobility, we now take the further step of eliminating

the extensive margin of adjustment. We interpret this case as applying to the very short

run. Implementing this case amounts to replacing      with       1 in our solution algorithm

described above. As mentioned, we follow Ruhl (2005) in setting           = 2:0. There are

thus two interpretations of what we are doing in this case. One is that the parameter

  = 8:28 is as above, but with no adjustment on the extensive margin, the parameter

  = 2 becomes the relevant one governing adjustment. Another interpretation is that we

are simply repeating the immobile labor case, now using the much lower value of       = 1.

   The results are shown in Tables VII and VIII. Focussing on relative GDP changes (in

column 3 of Table VII), we see that they are magni…ed considerably when the extensive

margin is inoperable. U.S. GDP falls by about 30 percent, while Japan’s rises by 26 percent

relative to the world. Figure 5 plots the change in GDP against the initial de…cit as a share

of GDP, again using the same scale as Figure 1. Note that the relationship has become

twice as steep again as that portrayed in Figure 3. Note also that U.S. neighbors Canada

and Mexico have fallen further below the rest.

   As in the previous case, most of the GDP adjustment occurs through the nonmanu-

facturing wage. Figure 6 plots the change in the manufacturing share against the initial

current account de…cit. It looks very similar to Figure 4.

   Again, prices tend to move in line with relative GDP, so that changes in real GDP are

small. They are, nonetheless, substantially larger than in the previous two cases. Note

                                             24
that U.S. real GDP falls by about 2 percent, about a third of the initial de…cit. Hence with

a very low response of trade shares to costs, a nontrivial secondary burden appears.

    Qualitatively the consequences of adjustment for real wages are much as in the previ-

ous case, with the manufacturing real wage rising in de…cit countries and falling in surplus

countries. For the United States, at least, the burden of the inability to adjust at the

extensive margin is born by workers outside manufacturing. The increase in the manufac-

turing real wage is as in the previous case, but the decline in the nonmanufacturing wage

is greater.



4     Conclusion

We have revisited the question of the secondary burden of transfers using a forty-two coun-

try gravity model of international production and trade in manufactures. Our motivation

is to assess the implications for relative wages, relative GDP’s, real wages, and real absorp-

tion in the major countries of the world should the current transfers implied by existing

current account de…cits come to a halt. How much relative GDP’s need to change depends

on ‡exibility of two forms, factor mobility between manufacturing and nonmanufacturing

and the ability of trade to adjust at the extensive margin. With perfect mobility and an

active extensive margin the GDP of the United States (running the largest de…cit) must

fall about 8 percent relative to that of Japan (running the largest surplus). Without mobil-

ity, however, the decline is 22 percent. If there is no adjustment in supplier sourcing (the

extensive margin) either, the decline is 44 percent.

    Because of the pervasiveness of nontraded goods, however, prices move largely in sync

with relative GDP’s so that aggregate real changes are much more muted. Regardless of


                                             25
the degree of labor mobility, the decline in U.S. real GDP is only 0.4 percent if the extensive

margin is operative. Without an extensive margin, the drop rises to 2 percent of GDP. So

only with extreme in‡exibility does a secondary burden of eliminating the transfer inherent

in the U.S. current account de…cit show up.

   While the overall real e¤ects are small, with factor immobility redistributional e¤ects are

substantial. Regardless of whether the extensive margin is operative, eliminating current

account de…cits leads to a rise in the U.S. wage in manufactures relative to nonmanufactures

of around 30 percent, re‡ecting a 24 percent real increase for manufacturing workers and a

decline of around 5 percent for nonmanufacturing workers. In the long run in which labor is

mobile, this wage di¤erence induces an increase in the manufacturing share of employment

of 23 percent.
