                   Do Wages Rise With Job Seniority?



                                 ABSTRACT




      The extent to which wages rise with the accumulation of seniority
 (tenure) in a firmafter  one controls for total labor market experience is a
fundamental question about the structure of earnings. A variety of studies
have found a large, positive partial effect of tenure on wages. This paper
re—examines the evidence using a simple instrumental variables scheme to deal
with well known estimation biases which arise from the fact that tenure is
likely to be related to unobserved individual and job characteristics
affecting the wage. We use the variation of tenure over a given job match as
the principal instrumental variable for tenure. The variation in tenure over
the job, in contrast to variation in tenure across individuals and jobs, is
uncorrelated by construction with the fixed individual specific and job match
specific components of the error term of the wage equation. Our main finding
is that the partial effect of tenure on wages is small, and that general labor
market experience and job shopping in the labor market account for most wage
growth over a career. The strong cross section relationship between tenure
and wages is due primarily to heterogeneity bias.

                          Do   Wages Rise   With   Job Seniority ?

  1. INTRODUCTION

      This   paper measures the partial effects of labor market experience and job

 seniority (tenure) on wages. Prior researchers (see Mincer and Jovanovic

 (1981), Bartel and Borjas (1981), Borjas (1981), Cline (1979a) and Mellow (1981)

 among others) have established that tenure has a strong positive
                                                                         relationship
 with wage rates in a cross section or a cross section—time series of

 individuals.
                 Furthermore, tenure has a strong negative association with job

 separation rates, quits, and layoffs (Mincer and Jovanovic, Cline (1979b),

 Borjas and Rosen (1981) among others). For example, Mincer and Jovanovic obtain

 coefficients of .0305 and —.0007 on tenure and tenure2 in a cross sectional

 regression for the log wage over a sample of white males after controlling for

 the effects of labor market experience and
                                                   schooling. They estimate the partial
 effects of tenure and tenure2 on the separation probability to be —.0149 and

 .0004.* The decline of separations with tenure is about equally divided into a

drop in the quit rate and a drop in layoffs.

     The extent to which wages rise with tenure is important for several

reasons. First and foremost, the wage—tenure profile is a fundamental question

about the structure of earnings over careers.         Second, it is a key determinant
of the extent to which the earnings power of individuals is tied to specific

jobs and thus is important for assessment of issues such as the losses suffered

by "displaced" workers (Hamermesh (1984)). Third, evidence that wages rise with

job tenure has been used as an explanation for the decline in
                                                                     quits with tenure,
since the wage growth on the current job lowers the probability that the worker

                                                                     upon the
 1976 cross section of white, out of school men under 64 from the Panel Study
of Income Dynamics. The authors obtain slightly lower estimates of the tenure
slope of wages when heterogeneity is controlled for using an index of prior
job changes. They also report detailed results for the NLS samples of young
and older men and obtain somewhat flatter tenure slopes for the sample of
older men. Mellow's estimates of the tenure slope of wages from a sample
based upon the Current Population Survey are also large.

will locate a superior alternative. In the theory of specific human capital (Oi

(1962), Becker (1962), Mincer (1974), Parsons (1972), Kuratani (1973), and

Hashimoto (1980)) the growth of wages with tenure (holding experience constant)

is attributed to worker financed investment in skills which are specific to the

firm. At the same time, firm financed investments in specific skills produce an

increase in productivity relative to wages with time on the job and thus provide

an explanation for the fall in the layoff probability with job tenure.

     More recently, a number of alternative explanations have been offered for

the apparent growth of wages with tenure.   In Lazear's (1981) supervision model

of wage growth firms defer compensation as a means of inducing workers not to

shirk duties, given that it is difficult to measure the output of workers

directly. Freeman (1977) and Harris and Holmstrom (1982) provide an explanation

for wage growth based upon an insurance motive. Harris and Holmstr assume

that workers are equally productive in all firms, mobility costs are zero, and

the productivity of a given worker In future periods is uncertain. They show

that firms will insure workers against low productivity outcomes later in their

careers. The expected value of the wage in later periods exceeds the expected

value of marginal product, and this gap is financed by an excess of expected

marginal product over wages in early periods. Guasch and Weiss (1980, 1982)

present an adverse selection model of wage growth. They assume that individuals


   The evidence that wages rise with tenure isimportant in implicit contracts
models of wages and employment. As Grossman (1977) pointed out and Rosen
(1984) emphasizes in a recent survey article, contracts which insure workers
against adverse swings in demand are feasible only if the worker cannot easily
break the contract when conditions improve. The returns to the firm and the
worker from shared investments in specific human capital would provide both
parties with an incentive to maintain the job match despite fluctuations in
marginal product and the alternative wage relative to the contract wage. It
is clear from Hall(1982) and Mincer and JovanovIc (1981) that many workers end
up in jobs which last for a long period of time. It is unclear whether this
is due to a sharing in the rents from a good job match (see Jovanovic , 1979),
a sharing in the returns from job specific training, or other barriers to
quits and layoffs.

 know more about their ability than do firms at the time that they are hired, and

 productivity is costly to observe. They show that in equilibrium firms may

 offer wages below marginal product in the initial period, during which workers

 are evaluated (at a cost), and a wage above marginal product in subsequent

 periods to those who meet a performance standard. The wage structure serves to

 discourage workers who know that they are relatively unproductive from

 applying .

     Although discussion of the link between these alternatives to the human
 capital model and empirical evidence have focussed on studies relating wages to

 total labor market experience, such as Mincer (1974), for the most part they

offer an explanation for the partial effect of tenure on wages when experience

is controlled for, rather than for the partial effect of total experience when

tenure is controlled for. For example, within Lazear's supervision model firms

should pay newly hired workers who have changed jobs after accumulating tenure

in another firm a wage that is closer to that for new entrants. In Harris and

Holmstrom's model, firms have no incentive to honor the wage guarantee the

worker had with another firm if the worker's productivity (the same in all

firms) turns out to be below the guarantee level. Starting wages may rise with

prior experience, but only because the decline in the number of years until

retirement and the decline in the residual uncertainty about the worker's

productivity imply that the amount of insurance that the worker "buys" in the

initial years on a job falls with experience. Presumably, this effect is

small. The upshot is that the empirical basis for these models as important


1See also the related adverse selection models of Salop and Salop (1976) and
Nickel! (1976), in which the increase of wages with time on the job serves as a
means of sorting out workers with a high propensity to quit. Parsons (1984)
provides an excellent survey of the rapidly growing theoretical literature on
of wage growth. Note
                      that all three of the theories mentioned predict a
decline in quits with tenure, as wages available in the firm rise above those
available outside of the firm.

explanations of earnings patterns over the lifecycle restsheavily on the

evidence that tenure has a substantial effect on wages.*    Thus, a careful re-

examination of whether wages do in fact rise with job tenure complements recent

efforts by Medoff and Abraham(1980, 1981), Brown (1983), Mincer(1984) and others

(see the conclusion) to provide more direct tests of the human capital model

against alternatives which do not Imply an increase in productivity with

experience.

      In summary, job tenure is a key variable in models of earnings

determination. However, the studies of growth of wages with seniority have been

accompanied by widespread recognition that unobserved heterogeneity across

individuals and across job matches may produce large biases In estimates of the

effect of tenure on wages as well as turnover. (See for example, Mincer and

Jovanovic (1981), and Heckman (1981)). Indeed, the job matching models of

Jovanovic (1979) and Johnson (1978) have stimulated a growing theoretical

literature in which job match heterogeneity plays a central role in both

turnover and wage growth.* Since tenure is a simple function of past quit and

layoff decisions,**it will be positively correlated with characteristics of

 individuals or of jobs which lead to lower quits and layoffs. These same

characteristics are likely to be positively related to worker productivity and,



 *
     Human capital theory and the other models mentioned are contributions to
 the search for a sound economic theory for why older workers are paid more
 than younger workers. The notion that they are paid more for cultural reasons
 would be particularly difficult to square with a finding that most of the
 increase is due to general labor market experience rather than tenure.
 Provided workers stay in the same job, the nonnegative profit condition does
 not tightly constrain the experience profile of wages. With mobility, it
 difficult to understand why firms are willing to pay a large experience
 premium to newly hired older workers (as the data indicate they routinely
       if older workers are not more productive than younger workers.
  Flinn (1982) implements the Jovanovic model for a sample of young men and
 finds that job match heterogeneity plays an important role in wage growth and
 mobility during first few years of work experience.

 in a competitive labor market, to wages.

      The chief contribution of this paper is the development and implementation

 of a simple instrumental variables scheme for dealing with the problem of

 "heterogeneity bias" in analysis of the effects of tenure on wages. We use the

 variation of tenure over a given job match (along with the levels of the other

 variables which appear in the wage equation) to form an instrument for tenure.

The variation In tenure over the job, in contrast to the variation in tenure

across individuals and jobs, is uncorrelated with the fixed individual and job

match components of the error term of the wage model. The methodology is

inspired in part by Hausman and Taylor's (1981) treatment of analysis of

covariance models in an instrumental variables framework. The approach is

implemented for a sample of male heads of household from the Panel Study of

Income Dynamics.

     We also experiment with an error components type GLS version of the

instrumental variables procedure to account for correlation in the wage errors

for each person arising from the individual specific and job match specific

component of the wage error. Use of the GLS versions of the instrumental

variables and least squares procedures is complicated by the fact that the

sample is unbalanced, with a large variation in the number of years of data on

each individual and on each job match, and to our knowledge has never been

implemented in such a situation. A secondary contribution of the paper is the

derivation (in Appendix 1) of a simple formula to compute these estimators in

the case of unbalanced data.

     Our main finding Is that the effect of seniority on wages (with the effects

of general labor market experience and secular wage growth held constant) is

small. The estimates from the instrumental variables procedure indicate that

the first year of tenure raises wages by about 5 %, but additional years of
                                     —6—



tenure years of tenure contribute little to wage growth. The co.€ficient on the

linear tenure term is actually slightly negative and the overall effect of the

first 10 years of job tenure is to raise wages by only 3%. In contrast, general

labor market experience results in a wage increase of 32% over the first 10

years and 87% over the first 30 years. It accounts for the lion's share of wage

growth during a career,' although these estimates combine the wage effects of

experience arising from general skill accumulation, which are stressed in human

capital theory, and the wage increases due to labor market search, which are

stressed in search and job matching models. The instrumental variables

estimates of the tenure profile of wages are much flatter and the experience

slopes are steeper than estimates based upon least squares or upon use of an

index of prior job separations to control for individual heterogeneity.

     Unfortunately, the Instrumental variables estimates of the tenure slope are

probably biased downward by job heterogeneity despite the fact that variance of

tenure within a job is uncorrelated with the permanent component of the job

match. As is explained below, the bias arises indirectly through the

correlation of the job match component with labor market experience. Biases may

also arise from measurement error in the tenure variable. Much of the empirical

analysis is devoted to assessing the importance of these biases. We show that

they are probably small.

     We also present separate estimates for union and nonunion workers and for

blacks as well as whites. Union—nonunion differences in the tenure profile of

wages are dramatically reduced when heterogeneity is accounted for. Finally, we

provide evidence that both the individual specific and match specific error

components of the wage have negative associations with quits, layoffs and



    A time trend is used to control for secular growth in the economy, which
is also an important factor in wage growth over the life of a worker.

separations, which tends to confirm a role for heterogeneity bias in least

squares estimates of the wage equation.

        The paper is organized as follows. Section 3 presents the econometric

methodology. Section 4 (and Appendix 2) discusses the data. Section 5 presents

the empirical analysis. The concluding section suniniarizes the results and their

implications for models of wage growth and turnover over the work life, and

provides an agenda for research. We begin with a brief review of why tenure is

endogenous in the wage equation.




2.    THE KNDOZNEITY OF ThNURE IN THE WAGE EQUATION

       Assume that the wage of individual i   who   is job j   in period t is determined

by the following equation.

(1)                  b0x1 j(t)t + f( Tjj(t)t ) +
           Wjj(t)t
The variable Wjj(t)t is the log of the real wage, Xij(t)t is a vector

characteristics of the person and the job and includes labor market experience,

Tjj(t)t is the number of years of person i has held job j as of time t, the

function f(.) is the tenure profile of wages, and        cij(t)t is the error term.

In general, Cij(t)t may consist of serially correlated components that are

specific to worker i, job j(*')and the match between I and j(t).** The fact that

worker i may change jobs during the sample period has been made explicit by

writing the job subscript as j(t). For notational convenience we will often

refer to j(t) simply as j.

       Least squares estimates of the tenure profile will be biased upward if

is positively correlated with Eijt. To see that this is likely to be the case,


**    Without
            observations on several individuals in a given firm, it is not
possible to decompose the job effects into firm effects (received by all
workers in the firm) and job match effects. Below we use the term job match
to refer to the sum of these separate effects.

consider the following simple model for Tjjt            One may show that Tjjt is related

to labor market experience and past quits and layoffs through the identity

                                  [1 —   (Qik + LIk)1


where the quit indicator           is 1 if the individual quit in period k and 0

otherwise, the layoff indicator Lik is 1 if the individual was laid off In

period k and 0 otherwise, and EXPIt is the labor market experience of person i

In t.    Workers quit if their best alternative is more valuable (In an
intertemporal sense) than their present job given the option of future quits and

expectations about future wages, nonpecuniary characteristics, mobility costs,

and layoff behavior. Firms base layoff decisions upon a comparison of current

and expected future wages to the current and future productivity of the worker

plus the direct and indirect costs of terminating the him, given that the firm

has the option of laying off the worker in the future and the worker has the

option of quitting. We avoid detailed structural models of these decisions

since they are not essential to our purposes and simply express the relationship

between the arguments of the wage equation and              and 4k as follows.

(3)      Qik =       If UIj(k)k = B0 Xjj(k)k +     g(Tj(k)k)   +
                                                                   Ujj(k)k < 0
                 0           otherwise

(4)      Lik = 1 if Vjj(k)k = 00 Xij(k)k +         G(Tjj(k)k) + Vjj(k)k < 0
               = 0           otherwise




Ujj(k)k is the worker's valuation of job j(k) in period k relative to the

worker's best alternative In k net of moving costs. The composite error

component ulj(k)k is a function of the unobserved characteristics of the

individual, the job match and the worker's best alternative in period k.

 Vjj(k)k is the firm's valuation of the option of keeping the worker. It depends

 on the composite error component
                                    vij(k)k.
       Equations (2), (3) and (4) together imply that Tijt depends upon the

 distribution of past values of the quit and layoff error components 1j(k)k and

Vij(k)k and thus will be endogenous in the wage equation if these values are

 correlated with the wage error          This is likely to be the case for a number
of reasons.:

     i) Unmeasured individual differences in the quit propensity (due, for
example, to differences across workers in the value of nonmarket time relative
to the mean of their wage profile or to differences in drive and perseverance)
are likely to be negatively correlated with the individual specific component in
the wage equation. One would also expect low (high) productivity workers
                                                                          boh
to receive lower (higher) wages and to be more (less) susceptible to layoffs

     ii) Individual differences in the value of leisure time are likely to be
positively associated with quit rates into unemployment or out of the labor
force. They are likely to be negatively related to productivity (through effort
on the job and absenteeism) and wage rates.

     iii) Optimal selection of jobs by workers in the presence of firm specific
and match specific error components in the wage function will result in
biases. Jovanovic (1979) argues that differences in the complementarity of the
skills of workers with the requirements of particular jobs which are observable
only through experience on the job results in substantial variation in the
productivity and wages of workers across jobs. Noncompetitive elements in the
wage structure or differences across firms in the optimal compensation policy
(arising from differences in hiring costs, supervision costs, and other factors
(see Pencavel (1972)) may also mean that workers face a distribution of wages
for their skills. Workers who receive high wages relative to their alternatives
will not quit, inducing a positive correlation between tenure and wages in a
cross—section (see Jovanovic (1979)). Match heterogeneity in the layoff
probability is also likely to be associated with match heterogeneity in the wage
equation. On the other hand, workers will quit to take an alternative job if
and only if the alternatives are sufficiently high to compensate for the effect



*
    This
       would be the case if total compensation, including wages and fringe
benefitsj does not vary one for one with productivity within a particular class
of jobs.
    Although we expect this to result in an overstatement of the tenure
profile due to unmeasured productivity differences, workers with a given set
of skills who enter job matches with high layoff probabilities might be
expected to receive a compensating differential for layoff risk, especially in
the presence of moving costs. This would tend to bias downward the estimates
of the tenure slope. Note that the formal matching models such as
Jovanovic(1.979a) do not distinguish between layoffs and quits.
                                    —10—



on wages of lost tenure. This results in a downward bias in the estimated wage—
tenure profile. Use of a fixed effects or first differencing procedure to
control for individual heterogeneity may amplify this downward bias, since with
such a procedure changes in tenure associated with job changes identify the
effect of tenure on wages.

     Alternative means of dealing with these problems include the use of

information on prior mobility as a control for individual heterogeneity (Mincer

and Jovanovic (1981)), instrumental variables techniques, procedures to correct

for sample selection (Borjas and Rosen (1981)), fixed effects procedures (Cline

(1979a) and differencing (Bartel and Borjas (1981)). None of the earlier

studies has simultaneously dealt with both individual heterogeneity and job

heterogeneity. Ultimately, a joint analysis of quits, layoffs and wages rates

which allows for both individual heterogeneity and job heterogeneity would be

the most satisfactory way to deal with the endogeneity of tenure in the wage

equation. However, there are many obstacles to such an analysis, including the

lack of an accepted model of layoffs, and the econometric difficulties of

estimating models based upon (3) and (4) once individual heterogeneity and job

heterogeneity are admitted. For this reason, we focus upon single equation

estimators for the wage equation.



3. USE OF VARIATION IN TENURE WITHIN THE JOB AS AN INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE

     We address the problems of both individual and job heterogeneity in the

wage equation using an instrumental variables estimator, which we refer to as

1V1. The principal instrumental variable for tenure is the deviation of tenure

around its mean for the sample observations on a given job match. The appeal of

this variable is that it is uncorrelated by construction with both the

individual specific error component of the wage equation and with the permanent

job match component.

     The details of the procedure and its formal justification are as follows.
                                          —11—



It is always possible to decompose wage error term            into the sum of a fixed

individual effect Cj, a fixed job match component €ij(t), and a transitory

disturbance            which may or may not be serially correlated, so that

       Cut     Ci + Cij(t) + ujt
One may decompose the transitory component       it as
       nut — Uit + Uijt + Ut

where u1 is an individual specific transitory error component that is

uncorrelated across individuals, Ui. is a transitory match component that is

uncorrelated with Uj, and u is an economy wide wage disturbance. The

individual specific component uj and the general time component u may be

freely correlated over time. However, we assume that the transitory match

component         is serially uncorrelated and/or has a small variance, an

assumption which we will discuss below. After substituting for            and writing

the tenure profile f(Tij) as the sum of terms involving Tijt, Tit2 and a dummy

variable for tenure greater than 1, the wage equation (1) may be rewritten as



(5)       =            + biTit + b2Tijt2 + b30LDJOBijt + Ci + Cij(t) + Ul + Uj +

would be expected to have a positive coefficient if specific capital investments

associated with orientation and hiring are large and a substantial amount of

information on the quality of the job match is revealed in the initial months on

the job, or if investment in job specific skills is especially rapid at the

beginning of a job. A large positive coefficient would also be consistent with

Guasch and Weiss's emphasis on testing during the early months on the job.

      Let Tij(t) be the mean of tenure for individual I over the sample

observations on the individual I in job j, where the fact that the job may

change is again made explicit by writing j as a function of t. For example, if

a person has been in a job for 3 years when the person enters the survey

(t1968) and remains on the job for 3 more years, then Tjj(t) = [3+4+5+6]/4 as t

ranges from 1968 to 1971.

       Define Tit to be the deviation of Tjt from the job mean, with Tt =          Tjjt
—             We now consider whether Tit Is a valid instrumental variable for
    Tij(t).
          Note that Tjt sums to 0 over the sample years in which the person is in

job j. Consequently, It is orthogonal by construction to the error components

£1 and ij(t), which are constant during job j and which embody permanent

individual and job heterogeneity.        That is, Tjjt is unrelated to permanent

heterogeneity across individuals and across job matches in the determinants of

wage rates. If the transitory component              is serially uncorrelated, then it

will have only a weak relationship to Tjjt and                since Tjjt depends upon

past quit and layoff decisions, and a wage disturbance lasting only one period

should have little weight in a mobility decision. Serial correlation in the

individual specific and labor market wide subcomponents u and             should not

pose a problem either, since in this case the resulting variation in the

composite error        will not be related to movements in T1 around its mean

for a given job match. It follows that Tt is a valid instrumental variable

for Tj as well as T2j and OLDJOB1. Basically, the tenure coefficients are

estimated from the growth of tenure within each job. The same argument

justifies use of (Tjt)2 =            —                                  —

after removal of individual effects.

       It is natural to compare the 1V1 estimator to estimation using a fixed

effect for each job match. This is equivalent to regressing the deviation of

       from the sample mean for job match ij on the deviations of the right hand

side variables from their means for the match. The fixed job match effects

estimator removes bias due to presence of     and cj(t). However, this is not

feasible because the deviations from means of tenure and experience are

perfectly correlated. Both advance by one each year during the course of a

job. Consequently, the tenure and experience coefficients are not separately

identified.

3.1 Potential Sources of Bias in the 1V1 Estimates

       In this section we discuss problems which may arise if (1) experience is

correlated with cjj(t) (2) tenure is measured with error, (3) the tenure slope

varies across people and job matches, or (4) the assumption that the transitory

part (ujjt) of the match specific component of wages is serial uncorrelated or

has a small variance is false.

       Unfortunately, the fact that Tijt Ti2. and OLDJOBIt are uncorrelated

with       is not sufficient to guarantee the consistency of the estimates of the

tenure slopes given the presence of other variables in the model. Labor market

experience will be correlated with cl(). As a result, the 1V1 estimates of

the experience slope of wages, as well as least squares estimates, combine the


  Our approach should be applicable to other problems in addition to the
estimation of wage functions. One example is the analysis of the effects of
time in residence and age of structure on the rental price of housing. The
estimator falls within the general class of estimators considered by Hausman
and Taylor (1981). They show how to estimate variance components models with
endogenous time invariant right hand side variables using 1) exogenous time
invariant right hand side variables and 2) the means and deviations from time
means of exogenous time varying right hand side variables as instrumental
variables. Note that they use their procedure to solve an identification
problem which arises (in estimating the effects of schooling on wages) with a
fixed effects approach.
                                    —14—



effects of general skill accumulation on wages as well as the average change

with time in the mean of ij(t) Jovanovic's(1979) job matching model and more

conventional search models (eg. Burdett(1978)) imply that Cjj(t) is likely to be

positively correlated with time in the labor market, since more experienced

workers have had more time to locate and move to good jobs.* This positive

effect is probably offset to some extent by the fact that a substantial fraction

of job changes are layoffs (about 40% in our sample) or are motivated by

nonpecuniary considerations and thus are not the response of workers to an offer

of a job with a better match component in the wage. Nevertheless, the

instrumental variables estimate of the coefficient on experience is likely to be

upward biased as an estimate of the partial effect of experience (with Eij(t)

held constant) on wages. Unfortunately, the upward bias in experience is likely

to induce a downward bias in the estimates of the tenure slope, since Eij(t)

does not in fact increase unless the job changes.** The downward bias arises as

a partial correction for the overstatement of the effects of additional labor

market experience on wages during years in which the job remains the same.



*
   Much of the rise in wages with experience that is associated with moves
through a sequence of jobs during a career is best interpreted as accumulation
of general human capital rather than information on comparative advantage
across jobs. A job may provide (worker financed) training that is more useful
in a wide variety of alternative jobs than in the present job. See Rosen
972). Apprenticeships are an extreme example of this phenomena.
     One might hypothesis that total labor market experience will be correlated
with     if fixed individual characteristics which are negatively related to
productivity are positively related to the amount of time persons spend out of
the labor force or unemployed. We checked this possibility using the IV
procedure by treating the terms involving experience (EXP, EXP2, EXP2 an
EXPEDUC in Table 1) as endogenous variables along with the tenure variables
in the wage equations and substituting (age — education + 5)education and a
cubic in (age — education + 5)                                 for the
variables involving experience in the first stage equations. The results are
very similar to the 1V1 estimates reported in the table. We feel safe in
ignoring possible bias in the coefficient on union status, health status, and
other control variables in the wage equatiqn arisin from c becuse these
variables are approximately orthogonal to T1t '

present evidence on the quantitative significance of the problem in Sections 5.4

and 5.5 below.

     A second potential problem with the 1V1 concerns measurement error in the

tenure variable. For the years prior to 1975 the tenure measure is bracketed.

Also, since employer tenure is not asked in all years, It has been necessary to

interpolate between some years using information on employer tenure for other

years, reasons for job changes, evidence of changes of industry, and other

variables. (See AppendIx 2.) The resulting measurement error in the tenure

variables is likely to bias downward both the least squares and the 1V1

estimates of the tenure profile. But the bias is likely to be more severe In

the case of the 1V1 procedure, since removal of Tjj(t) in the construction of
Tjjt will amplify the relative importance of measurement error in the total
variance of the instrument for Tjt used to estimate the wage equation.#

Sections 5.4 and 5.6 present evidence on the size of the bias from measurement

error.

     Thus far the discussion has Ignored the possibility that the tenure profile

of wages varies across people and jobs. Such variation might arise from

differences in the amount of worker financed specific human capital which is

appropriate given the characteristics of the job and the individual (See Borjas

(1981) and Jovanovic (1979b)). This would add the component b1 Tijt to the

error term of the wage equation, where bi is the deviation of the tenure slope

for the match ij around b1, and b1 is redefined as the mean of the tenure slope

b1 over all job matches weighted by their relative frequency and duration (i.e.,



     This discussion assumes that the measurement error is not strongly
serially correlated. Error in the level of tenure which is consistent from
year to year within each job match will have little effect on the 1V1 and GLS—
1V1 estimates and a potentially strong (negative) effect on the OLS
estimates. See Griliches (1984) for a recent survey on measurement error and
other data problems.
                                     —16—



the tenure slope of an observation chosen at random from the sample.) One would

expect the level of tenure to be correlated with        as workers in jobs which

are suitable for large specific investments are more likely to stay in those

jobs. Thus, if one estimates by OLS and ignores this component, the result Is a

biased estimate of the mean of the tenure slope. Unfortunately, one may show

that the 1V1 estimate of the mean tenure slope is also likely to be upward

biased.* We have not investigated remedies for this problem, in part because

the very modest estimates of tenure slope based upon the 1V1 procedure indicate

that the upward bias is not quantitatively important.

      Finally, we discuss the assumption (pg. 11) of no serial correlation in

        There is reason to believe that some serial correlation will be

present. For example, wages may vary with firm specific changes in product

demand (especially with monopolistic competition in the product market) or

production technology. Or serially correlated industry—wide productivity shocks

may not affect the wages of workers in their present job (because of implicit

contracts which smooth wages) but may alter the wages available to them

*
   In the simplified case in which Tjt is the only variable which enters the
wage equation, one may show that the estimate of b1 is equal to b1 plus
Z a1b1, where the summation is over ij pairs, the weights a1 are
proportional to 1j(t)t' and the latter summation is over the values of t
corresponding to the job match ij in the sample. One may show that Tjj(t)t is
approximately equal to (l112)(n11—l)3 + (lI4)(ni_l)2+(l/6)(njj_l) where n1j
is the number of sample observatons corresponding to match ij. Thus, the
weight a1 on the tenure parameter specific to match ij rises faster than the
number of observations corresponding to lj. Since n1j is positively related to
the duration of the job, and since almost any reasonable model of quits
implies (ceteris paribus) that jobs with steeper tenure slopes have lower quit
rates, we conclude that the estimate of b1 is biased upward as an estimate of
the tenure slope for an observation chosen at random from the sample. (The
expression for ETIj(t)t Is not exact because the starting date for jobs need
not correspond exactly to the time of the survey, and because the time between
surveys is not exactly one year. In deriving the above expressions one uses
the facts that

              k = n(n+l)/2 and              k2 = n(n+l)(2n+l)/6
for   any positive integer n.)

elsewhere .   A decline in       increases the probability that the worker will

find a better alternative and quit, although the effect of a given change in

     on the worker's valuation of his job is small unless          has a strong

positive correlation. To see the implications of this for the estimate of the

tenure profile, note first that the size of the decline in         necessary to

trigger a quit (for any given value of the alternative offer received) increases

with Tjjt if wages rise with         This implies that the expected value of

conditional on continuation of the job declines with Tijt. Consequently, over

the course of the job (i.e., conditional on no quit) Tjjt is negatively

correlated with the conditional expectation of         Least squares estimates

(with or without controls for individual heterogeneity) of the tenure slope will

be downward biased. Part of this correlation will carry over to Tjjt and bias

downward the instrumental variables estimates of the tenure slope. On the other

hand, a similar argument suggests that selection due to layoffs is likely to

produce bias in the other direction, and so the two effects are partially

offsetting. An analysis of the residuals does not provide evidence of strong

positive autocorrelation in the residuals once individual and job effects have

been taken into account, although it should be kept in mind that the residuals

are affected by the selection process.& While there is no strong theoretical or


  However, Altonji, Mincer and Shakotko (1984, ch. 4) find only minor
differences by tenure level in the effect of the aggregate unemployment rate,
state employment changes, or county unemployment rates on wages.
   The autocovariance function of residuals for the same individual across
years in which the job is not the same is

empirical presumption that this bias is important, further analysis is needed.

3.2 Treatment of Correlation of Errors Across Individuals and Jobs

    Even if one assumes that ij is serially uncorrelated, the composite error

term of the model is correlated over time as a result of the individual

component and the job match components. Consequently, the 1111 procedure is

inefficient relative to a GLS (generalized least squares) version of the

procedure. The same limitations apply to the OLS estimates of the model. Use

of the GLS versions of the IV and OLS procedures is complicated by the fact

that the sample is unbalanced, with a large variation in the number of years of

data on each individual and on each job match, and to our knowledge GLS has

never been implemented in such a situation.   The necessary formulae to compute

GLS versions of the least squares and 1V1 procedures for the case of unbalanced

data are derived in Appendix


covariance functions provides information on cov(uit,ujJt_k), which plays a
role only in the covariance of residuals over the same job. In making the
comparison, one should keep in mind that the covariance of residuals across
different jobs is overstated at lag 1 because the hourly wage variable is an
average over the calendar year, and may combine information on the two jobs.
Thus, the drop in the covariance between the first and second lags (.110 to
.085) is overstated. The fact that the patterns of decay in the two
autocovariance functions are very similar after the first lag suggests that
is either white noise, a random walk, or has a very small variance. A
regression analysis of squared residuals from wage equations in columns 3, 6, 9,
and 12 of Table 1 indicates that if anything the error variance actually falls
somewhat with tenure, which is inconsistent with the hypothesis that      is a
random walk. Thus, subject to the important caveat that the residuals
themselves are affected by the job selection process discussed in the text, we
find little evidence that uj plays an important of a role in the evolution of
ages.
   The key to computation of the GLS versions of the least squares and 1V1
estimators is the analytical formula for the inverse of the covariance matrix
of the wage errors for each individual in the sample, which we have derived
under the assumption that      is serially uncorrelated over time and across
people. This inverse is a function of the number of observations on the
individual in the sample, the number of jobs held, the number of years in each
of the jobs, the covariances of the      across time periods on the same job
and across different jobs for the same individual, and the variance of
Given the formula for the inverse of the covariance matrix, computation o the
GLS versions of the least squares and 1V1 procedures is straightforward. We
have ignored the effect of the common error component u on covariance
                                    —19—



     In interpreting the GLS results below, readers should keep in mind that the

standard justification for use of GLS is to improve efficiency and provide

asymptotically valid standard errors rather than to reduce bias in the

estimates. Since the calculated standard errors of the OLS estimates are very

small (and are not likely to be understated by a large amount), large changes in

the OLS results are not expected unless the wage model is misspecified. If the

failure to control for heterogeneity is an important misspecification, then

there is reason to expect substantial differences between the OLS and GLS

estimates. To see this, note that when the instruments are not used in place of

the tenure measures, the GLS estimator may be thought of as least squares

applied to the wage model after subtracting from each of the variables in the

equation: (1) a weighting factor times the average value of the variable for the

sample years in which the person is in a given job, and (2) a second weight

times the individual specific mean of the variable. The weighting factors

depend in a complicated way upon the covariances mentioned above, the length of

the job, the number of jobs held by the individual, and the number of years that

the person is in the sample. Thus the GLS procedure uses less of the variation

in the data across individuals and across jobs than does OLS. It is

intermediate between use of an individual or job fixed effects procedure and

OLS.* Consequently, the GLS estimates of the model may differ sharply from the

OLS estimates if heterogeneity produces important biases in the OLS results. At

the same time, one would expect the 1V1 and 1V1—GLS to give similar answers,



structure given that a time trend is added to the model and year dummies
xplain very little of the wage variance.
 We were unable to derive an explicit formula relating the GLS procedure to
these procedures. Our argument is by analogy to Maddala (1971), who provides
an exact formula relating the GLS estimator to the OLS and fixed effect
estimators for case of a fixed individual specific error component that is
uncorrelated across people and a person specific serially uncorrelated
transitory component, and the same number of observations per person.
                                      —20—



since the 1V1 procedure is not sensitive to individual heterogeneity or job

heterogeneity. The bottom line of this discussion is that we use the GLS

version   of the various estimators both to provide an informal specification test

for heterogeneity bias and to improve efficiency.



4.   TA
      The sample is based upon the 1968—1981 waves of the Panel Study of Income

Dynamics. Most of the results below are for white male heads of households,

although some findings for a corresponding sample of blacks are also

presented. For a given year the sample contains individuals who were between

the ages 18—60 iclusive, who were employed, temporarily laid off, or unemployed

at the time of the survey, and who were not retired, permanently disabled, self

employed, employed by the government in the current or past year, or from Alaska

or   Hawaii. Observations with missing data on the variables in wage equation are

excluded for the particular sample year. The effective sample for whites covers

the calendar years 1968—1980 and contains 15138 observations m 2163 individuals

and 4334 job matches.

       Most of the variables are standard. However, it is important to point out

that there are ambiguities in the quit and job tenure measures, especially in

the early years of the sample. This is because the questions about job changes

in the early years do not distinguish clearly between promotions and quits, the

tenure variable is bracketed in the early years, and in some years the tenure

variable does not distinguish clearly between tenure with an employer and tenure

in a position. We have used a number of cross checks to try to solve these

problems, but some measurement error undoubtedly remains. The possibility that

measurement error in the tenure variables has a serious effect on the results is

investigated (and rejected) in Section 5.4 below.
                                        —21—



     The real wage measure is the log of labor earnings during the year divided

by annual hours and is converted to real terms using the GNP implicit price

deflator for consumption. The variables T, T2 and OLDJOB and union status refer

to the time of the survey in the corresponding year (typically in March or

April).        The variable N/EXP is a measure of the number of jobs held by an

individual up to the current year (N) divided by labor market experience (EXP).

Table A.l presents descriptive statistics on most of the variables used in the

analysis. Appendix 2 provides additional discussion of the data.

5. RESULTS

     The results are organized as follows. Section 5.1 presents the least




*
   Since the earnings and hours questions refer to the previous calendar year,
this data was matched to information on union status and tenure from the prior
survey. The quit, layoff, and separation indicators refer to the 12 months
prior to the current survey and are matched to data on union status and tenure
 om the previous survey.
   Note that for those who change jobs during the year the wage is presumably
an average of the wage on each of the jobs weighted by the portion of the year
spent in each. Thus, use tenure at the time of the survey rather than the
average of tenure over the calendar year may lead to an understatement of the
effect of the first year of tenure on wages. One alternative is to construct
a weighted average from tenure in adjacent survey years. Preliminary analysis
using such a measure lead to results very similar to those reported below.
The second alternative is to use the reported hourly wage for the job held at
the time of the survey as the wage measure. The main disadvantages of this
variable are (1) it only available for hourly workers prior to tFE 1976 survey
(2) it is truncated at $9.98 prior to 1978, and (3) it underestimates wage
growth to the extent that paid vacations and holidays rise with tenure and
experience. The truncation of the data and the fact that the mean of the
average hourly earnings of hourly workers is 25.7% below the corresponding
figure for salary workers will bias to some extent the experience and tenure
coefficients. When these factors are taken into account the results using the
reported wage are very similar to those using the average hourly wage. For
example, when the sample is restricted to the years 1978—1981 (when neither of
the first two problems are present), the parameter estimates (with uncorrected
standard errors) corresponding to column 6 of Table 1 are

squares and 1V1 estimates of the wage equation for white males. Section 5.2

examines whether both individual heterogeneity and job heterogeneity are

present. Section 5.3 discusses the GLS versions of the least squares and IV

estimators. Section 5.4 compares the OLS and IV methods from the standpoint of

predictive accuracy. Sections 5.5 and 5.6 assessApossibility of biases in our

estimates. Section 5.7 compares results for blacks and whites and union and

nonunion workers. Section 5.8 shows that both       and        have a strong

positive association with the quit and separation probabilities. Our main

conclusion is that job tenure plays only a small role in the wage equation, and

that heterogeneity bias dominates the cross—sectional relationship between

tenure and wages.

5.1 Basic OLS and 1V1 Estimates of the Wage Equation for White Males

     Table 1 reports various estimates of the coefficients on years of

education, experience, and tenure. To reduce the possibility of bias in the

tenure and experience profiles from an overly restrictive specification of the

education—experience polynomial, we include education, educatkn2, EXP, EXP2,

and EXP3, and the product of education and EXP. The equations also contain

controls for marital status, union membership, health status, city size and

residence in an SMSA, time, and region, although the parameter estimates for

these variables are not displayed.* Most previous studies have used either T or

T and T2 as the specification of the tenure profile. We report results for

these specifications but focus the discussion on the results with T, T2 and the

dummy variable OLDJOB,      7s   defined to be 1 If T > 1 and 0 otherwise, all

included in the equation.

     The OLS estimates (columns 1—3) and the 1V1 es timates (columns 4—6) of the

wage parameters tell very different stories about the tenure profile of

vages.* The OLS estimates indicate that OLDJOB has a large positive effect on

wages, with a point estimate of .111 (Col. 3) and a standard error of .012. In

contrast, the 1V1 estimate of the OLDJOB coefficient is only .050 with a

standard error of .009. The 1V1 coefficient estimates for T and T2 are —.0041

and .002 with small standard errors. (See col. 6; note that T has a

coefficient of .0016 with a t—value of 1.14 when It is entered by itself.) The

corresponding OLS estimates are .0178 and —.0003 with tiny standard errors.

     In general, the OLS estimates are typical of those obtained from cross

sectional analyses of the wage equation. They Indicate a substantial growth of

wages with tenure, with much of the growth occurring in the first year on the

job. By constrast, the 1V1 estimates indicate substantially smaller first year

growth and a virtually flat tenure profile thereafter. The relationship between

tenure and wages is usefully summarized by calculating the effect of the first

10 years of tenure on the wage. This Is reported at the bottom of the columns

of Table 1. The 1111 e timates Imply that the accumulation of the first 10 years

of tenure (including the first year effect) results in a wage increase of .0268

(with a standard error of .016). Since the wage is in logs this corresponds to

a percentage increase of 2.7%. This is only 1/11th of the corresponding OLS

estimate of the contribution of 10 years of tenure to wages (30%). These

results indicate that the strong correlation between wages and tenure observed

in previous studies is primarily due to heterogeneity bias. Evidently, the

permanent individual component of wages is positively correlated with the

on the same job match arising from the error components c and Ejj().TheY are

propensity to quit or suffer layoffs, and/or individuals who enter into job

matches which are at the low end of the wage distribution (for the individual)

quickly move on to other positions. The findings are consistent with

Jovanovic's matching model as well as with a potentially large role for

individual heterogeneity.

     Accompanying the much smaller lV1 as timates of the tenure slope is an

increase in the estimated experience profile. This is expected since the strong

positive correlation between experience and tenure implies that the upward bias

in the tenure profile resulting from heterogeneity will result in a downward

bias in the experience profile. The OLS estimates indicate that total labor

market experience raises wages by 31.7% during the first ten years of work and

48.2% during the first 30 years. (Note that these estimates are very precise.)

The corresponding figures based upon the 1V1 estimates are 53.7% and 86.6%.

Since the tenure effects on wages must be multiplied by approximately .25 or .3

(the derivative of the mean of tenure with respect to experience) to estima

the contribution of tenure to growth in wages over a career, the 1V1 estimates

indicate that the role of tenure is trivial relative to labor market experience

in explaining the gross increase in wages with labor market experience.

     It is useful to compare the 1V1 results with those based upon the addition

of N/EXP, the ratio of prior separations to experience, to the wage equation as

a control for individual heterogeneity. The results for this approach to the

problem of heterogeneity bias, which is due to Mincer and Jovanovic (1981), are

reported in columns 10—13 and are similar to the OLS results discussed above.*


*C       columns 10—12 with 1—3. The variable makes less of difference in our
results than in Mincer and Jovanovic's, who used th 1976 panel from the PSID,
measure   as the number of separations between 1968 and 1975, and work with N
directly or with the product of N and experience. This is not surprising,
since the link between curren.t tenure and number of separations in the
previous 8 years is closer to being definitional than the link between tenure
and our estimates of the total number of prior separations divided by

The estimated tenure profile over the first 10 years is about 10 times steeper

than that using 1V1. The prior separation index does not appear to be an

adequate control for heterogeneity bias. One possible reason is that N/EXP

variable does not control for job match heterogeneity. A second reason is that

N/EXP the variable is a noisy control for individual heterogeneity. In part,

this may be due to problems with the measure of N, and in part it is due to the

fact that for any given true separation probability the observed separation rate

has a considerable variance when EXP is low. The noise in NIEXP may have a

complicated effect on the results because of the presence of EXP, EXP2 and EXP3

in the model and the fact that EXP is correlated with T.

5.2 Extensions: Individual Heterogeneity Versus Job Heterogeneity

      An interesting alternative estimator is obtained by adding the deviation of

Tij(t) from the individual mean        to the list of instrumental variables

(1V2). TjJ(t) —       will   be uncorrelated

with the wage disturbance if the job effects                are 0 or are not related to

separations. Note that since TjjtTj =
                                               Tj    + Tjj(t) —   Ti,   use of both Tt
and Tjj(t) — T1 in the first stage equations is similar to estimation using Tj

—                                                    and OLDJOBiJ(t) — OLDJOBi to the

experience. They report a reduction in the tenure profile of about 15% when
N EXP is added. They find virtually no reduction for the NLS sample of
young men lnria 40% reduction for the NLS sample of older men. Note that the
experience coefficients in columns 10—12 are not comparable with those in 1—3
because N/EXP falls over the lifetime for a typical worker. See Mincer and
Jovanovic and Mincer(1984) for a detailed analysis of this variable.

first stage equations for the tenure variables. (The first stage equations for

the 1V2 e stimator are reported in columns 4—6 of Table A2.)

    The 1V2 parameter estimates are displayed in columr 7—9 of Tabl3 1.

predicted values. The use of the variation in the tenure means across jobs

leads to a modest changes in the estimates of the tenure slopes when          Tt
and h_i)Jbiit are all present in the wage equation (compare columns 6 and 9).

The extra effect of the first year of tenure rises to .073, and the overall

effect of 10 years of tenure is about 7.5%. This exceeds the 1V1 estimate of

2.7 by about 3 standard errors, but is far below the OLS estimate of 30%. A

formal Hausman type test of the null hypothesis of exogeneity of
                                                                    ij(t) —   1,

Tjj(t)2 —   Ti   and OLDJOBij(t) — 0LDJOBi lead to rejection the hypothesis at the
.001% level .

     In   summary, both the 1V1 and 1V2 results indicate that tenure plays only a

modest role in wage growth, with general labor market experience accounting for

most of the growth. The tenure estimates lie considerably below estimates based

upon least squares and use of a prior mobility index as a control for individual



*
    Following Newey (19811, pg.6) we performed the exogeneity test by testing
for the joint significance in the wage equation of the residuals from
regressions of the three additional instrumental variables against the
maintained set of instrumental variables. The covariance matrix of the
parameter estimates of the wage equation used in forming the test statistic
was calculated using the 1V2 (Tab1 1, column 9) estimate of the residual ari nce
 and with the correlation in the error        across observations on the same
                                              -


individual and the same job match taken into account.
   The fact that the 1V2 a stimates of the tenure profiles are much closer to
the 1V1 results than to the OLS results does not provide clear evidence on the
relative Importance of individual heterogeneity and job match heterogeneity in
biasing the OLS results. To see this, note that about 1/2 of the observations
come from individuals who held only one job during the years in which they are
in the sample. For these observations, the additional instrumental variables

 [Tij(t) —  T ,Tjj(t)2 — T12 , NewJobi.() —NewJob1l used in the 1V2 procedure
are identically 0 and add nothing to te instruments for the tenure
variables. Adding the deviations from individual means has little impact on
the R2's of the first stage equations for the T and T2 but does make a
substantial difference in the equation for OLOJOB. See Table A2.

heterogeneity.

5.3 GLS Estimates

       The columns of Table 2 report GLS estimates which correspond to the OLS

results in columns 1—3 and 10—13 of Tabla 1 as well as 1V1—GLS and 1V2—CLS

estimates which correspond to the 1V1 and 1V2 e stimates of columns 4—6 and 7—

9. The estimates of the covariance matrix of the residuals for each individual

used in the GLS calculations are based upon the correlation of the wage

residuals for a given individual across different jobs and upon the correlation

for a given individual in the same job. These estimates equal 0.46 and 0.59

respectively and were calculated from the IV1 equation estimate in column 6 of

Table 1. Wry similar estimates were obtained using the residuals from the OLS

estimates,* and so we have employed the same residual correlation matrix in

computing all of the results in Table 2.

       Comparison of columns 3 and 12 of the two tables indicates that GLS

produces a dramatic reduction in the least squares estimates of the wage—tenure

profile, regardless of whether one controls for prior job mobility. For

example, OLS estimates of the model with T, T2, and OLDJOB imply that 10 years

of tenure are associated with an increase in wages of about 30%, while the



*
    Using the 1V1 equation from Table 1 (Col. 6), the corresponding correlation
estimates are 0.42, 0.57). Using the 1V2 equation (Col. 9), the correlation
estimates are (0.45, 0.59). Using the N/EXP equation (Col. 12), the
correlation estimates are (0.42, 0.58).For the 1V1 equation, the estimates of
the variances of ijt' Cj and      are .069, .077, and .022.
(The estimate of the variance of      is exaggerated by the presence of
serially uncorrelated measurement error in the wage, although this has no
bearing on estimation of the wage of equation.)    Thus, the job match
component accounts for substantial fraction of the error variance. This is
consistent with Cline(1979a). Note that the estimates above as well as the
estimates for nonunion workers and blacks used in correcting the standard
errors of tabl 5 and 6 are based upon the residual variance, the average of
the cross products of residuals between periods in which the individual held
different jobs, and the average of the cross products between periods in which
the individual held the same job. The variance decomposition is based upon
the assumption that      is serially uncorrelated.
                                        —28—



correspondirg GLS   estimate   is only 13.1%. The GLS estimates of the coefficients

on T and OLDJOB are .0044 and .074 (respectively), which are well below the OLS

estimates of .0178 and .111. The reduction in the estimated tenure slope is

accompanied by a large offsetting increase in the experience slope.

     The impact of GLS is far too large to be explained by sampling error.

As was explained earlier, it is fully consistent with the presence of strong

heterogeneity bias in the OLS estimates. This interpretation is strongly

supported by comparison of the 1V1 e stimates in columns 4—6 of Table 1 with the

1v1—GLS results in columns 4—6 of the TabIr 2. The GLS     transformation   has only

a small effect on the 1V1 estimates, although the point estimates of the

coefficients on individual coefficients in the education—experience polynomial

change somewhat. The tenure coefficients are virtually unchanged. The 1V1—GLS

estimate in column 6 implies that 10 years of tenure produces a wage increase of

2.2%, while the corresponding 1v1 estimate is 2.7%. The experience profiles are

also very close. Since the 1V1 procedure does not use variation in tenure

across jobs and across individuals to identify the tenure effect, it is less

sensitive to CLS. The 1V2 estimates using deviations from individual means as

well as deviations from job means as instrumental variables also change by only

a small amount.

5.4 Evaluating the Performance of OLS and 1V1 in Predicting Wage Changes.

     The most natural check on the OLS and 1V1 e stimates of the tenure slope is

to compare their performance in predicting the change in the wage across years

in which the job does not change (stayers) and for observations with a job

change (movers). If the 1V1 tenure slope is correct, then one would expect the

predicted wage changes based on the OLS coefficients to be greater than the

actual wage changes for stayers, and to be less than the actual wage changes for

job changers. The 1V1 estimates should be accurate for both groups.
                                       —29—



Furthermore, the OLS prediction errors should be systematically related with the

change in tenure from year to year. Roughly speaking, this is what we find.

     Tabi 3 reports the difference between the actual and predicted values of

         as a function of tenure in period t—l. For purposes of comparison, Table

3 also reports OLS and 1V1 estimates (based upon the tenure coefficients in

Table 1) of the contribution of the change in tenure between t—l ciivri t to the

expected value of         given tenure in period t—i. On average, the OLS

equation predicts that         will equal .046, while the mean of       is .026,

an overprediction of .020. Furthermore, a comparison of columrs 3 and 4 reveals

that the prediction errors are systematically related to the estimated

contribution of tenure to the wage change. On the other hand the 1V1 procedure

slightly overestimates wage growth for stayers. The 1V1 prediction errors are

small at all tenure levels.

     For movers, OLS dramatically underpredicts          The average prediction

error is .095, which compares to the average value of         is .058. Since the

tenure coefficients have little effect on the average of the predicted wage

change for persons with T1jt_i between 0 and 1, ituseful to compute the average

prediction error for persons with Tjjt_l greater than 1. For this group, OLS

underpredicts W1j by .169. Comparison of columtE 3 and 4 reveals that the

prediction error is systematically related to the OLS estimate of the

contribution of the change in tenure to the wage growth. In contrast, the 1V1

prediction errors average only .029 and are not systematically related to tenure

level.

     Table 3 also reports separate results for quits and layoffs. They show

that the OLS equation performs very poorly for both groups, and that the

prediction errors are systematically related to the OLS estimate of the

contribution of the change in tenurthe wage change. The 1V1 estimates perform
                                         —30—



much better than the OLS estimates for both quits and layoffs, although the 1V1

estimates   underpredict by .058 and .015 for quits and layoffs respectively.

(The latter figure is not significantly different from zero.) The prediction

errors are not systematically related to Tt_i.

     In summary, the results of the prediction tests are basically favorable to

the 1V1 e stimates and indicate that the OLS estimates of the tenure slope are

seriously overstated. These tests cast serious doubt on the view that

measurement error in the tenure variable is responsible for the difference

between the OLS and 1V1 results. The sample means of the changes in tenure for

each initial tenure level underly the predictions. Random measurement error in

the tenure variables should have little effect on these. However, the fact that

1V1 e stimator tends to underpredict for quits by a constant amount is consistent

with the notion that the job shopping process leads to an increase in ej()

with experience. As was explained earlier, the resulting correlation of Cij(t)

with experience would produce a downward bias in the tenure slope which offsets

an upward bias in the experience slope. It seems unlikely that these biases are

large given the poor performance of the OLS equation, the fact that the 1V1

prediction errors are not related to tenure level and are very small for

layoffs, and the fact that the the 1V1 procedure actually overpredicts wage

growth (slightly) for stayers. In any event, we provide additional analysis of

the possible biases which arise from job shopping and from measurement error in

the next two sections.

5.5 Analysis of Bias from Qnission of Eij(t)

     Let the 1V1 instruments for            Tjt and 0LDJ0B1 be denoted by T1t

     and OLDJOBjJt respectively, and let L.i' denote     the vector [Tj Tjt
0LDJJ0Bt]. jt' is determined by the system of first stage equations
            =
                Xijti +   [Tit,   jt'   0LDJoB1]rr2

whei 1I and      are the matrices of coefficients of the first, stage equations for

Tjjt, 'ft and OLDJOBj reported in Table A2. From the Theil—Griliches

formula for the analysis of bias due to an omitted variable (See Theil (1971),

Ch. 12), the bias Bblas in the coefficients of the wage equation which arises

from the presence of ejJ()     in   the error term of the model, is equal to the

column vector

(6) 3bias =

where Zjj       [Xjjt, Lijtl
     In most niultivariate contexts, one cannot even sign the elements of Bbias,

which is the cross product of the included regressors with the omitted variable

and is required to evaluate the bias formula.

     In the present case, however, one may infer a great deal about these cross

products. First, and most important,                   and OLDJOBjjt are orthogonal to

Elj(t) by construction. Consequently,

         !ijtl'EiJ(t) reduces to [xijt Lhh1]'eiJ(). Second, many of the
elements of        such as schooling, region, SMSA are not likely to directly

influence tlj(t), given that ij(t) is defined to be net of the fixed individual

characteristics such schooling. The problem of bias arises primarily because

£jj(t) is correlated with experience as a result of job shopping over the course

of a career. For this reason, we assume that correlations of £ij(t) with the

other variables in the model arise only to the extent that they are correlated

with experience. In this case, one can estimate the crossproducts between

       and the explanatory variables in the model if one can estimate the

conditional expectation of €ij(t) given experience, which we denote by

[cjj(t)IEXPit]. If [E1j(t)EXPjt]
                                       is   known, one may then compute Bbias as
                                    —32—



(7) Bbias = P     m[.[(Zjjt ij)1]1
    We obtain a set of estimates of [rj3(t)EXPit] by combining information on

the experience profile of quits with a range of assumptions about the expected

value of the wage change resulting from a quit. The very small errors of the

1V1 estimator in predicting wage growth for 'those who quit, and evidence on the

total growth in wages arising labor market experience over a career provide a

check on the plausibility of the assumptions about wage gains per quit. We

ignore layoffs under the conservative assumption that on average they result in

a zero change in cjj(t). If they are associated with negative changes, then

consideration of layoffs would result in even smaller estimates of the bias than

those reported below.

     Let Jobsit equal the expected number of times a typical worker has quit

conditional on the experience EXPIt of the worker in time t. Jobsit may be

approximated as

     Jobsit it PQ(X)
where PQ(X) is the probability that a worker with experience X will quit during

the year. We estimate PQ(X) from a logit model relating the quit probability to

a constant, EXP, EXP2, and gp3•* Finally, we estimate [ejj(t)EXPjt] as the

product of Jobs1t and an assumed value for the average change in tjj(t) per

quit and use (6) to compute Bbias   The assumed value for the change in

ranges from .025 to .100. We consider .100 to be an upper bound for the change

in tij(t) per quit for two reasons. First, if one assumes that the average

change in tlj(t) associated with layoffs is less than or equal to zero, then the

difference .046 (with a standard error of .023) between the means of the actual

change in tW1j for quits and for layoffs provides an upper bound on the average

  The implied probability of a quit in the first, 5th, 10th, 20th, and 30th
years in the labor market are .394, .191, .120, .056 and .035 respectively.
                                             —33—



gain in rl(t) associated with a quit. (This comparison requires the assumption

that the sample distributions of quits and layoffs by experience and tenure

levels are the same, which is approximately true.) In view of this figure, our

preferred estimate of the gain per quit is .05. Second, as we shall see

momentarily, the assumption that the average gain per quit is .100             implies   that,

for the average worker, 55.9 % of the gain in wages associated with labor market

experience is due to increases in Eij(t) resulting from job shopping and 44.1 %

is due to the direct effect of experience.

       The upper panel of Table 4 reports estimates of Bbias under the various

assumptions about the average gain per          quit.   If the gain is .05 , then the bias

in the estimate of the returns to 10 years of tenure on the log wage is biased

downward by .0375. The "corrected" coefficients on T, T2 and ULDJOB are .0005,

.0012, and .0435 respectively, and the "corrected" estimates of the effects of

10 years of tenure and 30 years of experience on the log wage are .0643 and

.4405. The implied average growth in cij(t) over 30 years of experience is

.1835. When       the   gain per quit is assumed to be .100, the "corrected" estimates

of the effect of 10 years of tenure and 30 years of experience are .1019 and

.2570 respectively, and the average growth in cij(t) over 30 years is .325.*

        In summary, the analysis of bias in the 1V1         arising   from the correlation of

experience with ejj(t) suggests that the percentage gain in the wage from 10

years    of tenure might     be   as large as 10.7 %,   although   our preferred estimate is

6.6 %.

        An   alternative   way to analyze the important of bias arising froa failure to

control for Cij(t) is to compare the 1V1            estimates   to estimates obtained using a

   *
        If one
            were to assume the gain is .150 per quit, the revised estituate of
the effects of 10 years of tenure is only .139, which is still only half of
the OLS estimate in in Table 1, column          3. e do not consider this case in the
text in part because the it implies a corrected estimate for the direct effect
of 30 years of experience and growth in cij(t) equal to only .074.
                                        —34—



fixed effect for each job to control for both cij(t) and r. As was noted

earlier, only the sum of the coefficients on EXP, T, and the time trend are

identified when the "job effects' estimator is used. However, one may use the

test procedure suggested by Hausman and Taylor (1981) to compare the subset of

experience and tenure parameters which are identified using the job effects

estimator with the corresponding 1V1 estimates. In practice, we use the 1V1—GLS

estimates in place of the 1111 estimates in performing the test, since we were

unable to find a way to adopt 1-lausman and Taylor's test to the case in which

neither estimator is efficient under the null hypothesis. The relevant subset

of the coefficient estimates from the 1V1—GLS and the job effects procedures are

displayed below.

The point estimates are very close relative to the standard errors, and a formal

test of equality of the coefficient vectors passes.# It should be noted that


    The standard errors of the job effects estimates reported in the text are
based upon an estimate of the variance of the transitory error component
which equals .047. (The loss of degrees of freedom which arises from additon
of the job constants to the model was taken into account in calculating this
figure.) This estimate is well below the corresponding estimate based upon
the 1V1 and 1V1—GLS procedures. We do not have a good explanation for why the
variance estimates differ. It may be related to the fact jobs lasting only
one period have no effect on the job effects estimator of the residual
variance. As a result, two of the diagonal elements in the difference betieen
the covariance matrices of the job effects estimator and the 1V1—GLS estimator
are actually negative if one uses the .047 figure to compute the covariance
matrix of the subset of job effects parameter estimates used in the test.
Unfortunately, the specification test is based upon
                 c1, where c1 is the difference in the job effects and 1V1—GLS
 C1' [E1 — Z2]1
parameter estimates reported in the text and     and E2 are the covariance
matrices of the lob effects and 1V1—GLS parameter estimates (respectively ).
estimate [S1 — Si] of the covariance of c (a problem which frequently arises
in computing H?usman test statistics) and computes the test statistic, one
obtains 6.8, which is not significant at tl-e 10   level. We used the IV1_GL
estimate of the variance of hut in computing S1. In this case, all diagona
elements of [S1—S2] are positive and the test statistic is 2.99.
                                     —35—



this test may not be sufficiently powerful to detect a small degree of bias in

the 1V1—GLS estimates, especially since the downward bias in the linear tenure

term is likely to be offset by an upward bias in the linear experience term.

Also, the point estimates from the Job Effects and the 1V1   estimators   do not

match up quite as closely. Nevertheless, Job Effects estimates are additional

evidence that the 1V1 and 1V1—GLS results are in the right ballpark.

5.6 Analysis of Effects of Measurement Error in Tenure

     As was explained earlier, a second potentially important source of bias in

the 1V1 estimates is measurement error in the tenure variables. The fact that

the GLS estimates are based on partial differencing of the wage equation is

likely to make them more sensitive than the OLS estimates to the problem of

measurement error for the same reasons that they are less sensitive to upward

bias due to heterogeneity.

     The results of the prediction tests in Table 3 are strong evidence against

the hypothesis that measurement error offers an alternative to heterogeneity

bias as the main explanation for the large reduction In tenure slopes when 11,71

is used and when GLS Is substituted for OLS. However, we have performed a

additional checks on the measurement error problem in an attempt to improve upon

the 1V1 estimates. First, the wage equations were re—estimated with

observations for years prior to 1975 (the years in which tenure was bracketed)

excluded. The results for both OLS and the IV procedure are very close to those

In Table 1*. Second, an analysis of the frequency of the first difference of

*   For example, the estimates of the effect of 10 years of tenure on the log
wage data implied by the OLS, 1V1 and 1V2 results for post 1974 sample are
.2654, —.0252 and .0392 respectively. The corresponding values for the full
sample (from Table 1, col. 3, , and 9) are .2627, .0268, and .0741.
                                     —36—



     indicates that most of the observations lie in a plausible range. Third,
when the sample is restricted to observations over the post 1975 sample for

which the change in Tt is between .9 and 1.1 (unless a separation took place

between surveys)**, the coefficients on T, T2 and OLDJOB are —.0083, .00013, and

.0439. These are very close to the corresponding 1V1 estimates on the full

sample in Table 1, col 6, as are the implied estimates of the effects of 10

years of tenure and 10 years of experience. These results suggest that the

effects of measurement error are small.

     In addition, an attempt was made to construct T1 using information only

on the number of sample observations corresponding to a particular match the

number of years between observations, and that fact tenure on a continuing job

should rise by one each year.   It is not necessary to know the level of tenure

in a given year to construct Tjjt, since displacement of the tenure values in

all of the years by a constant makes no difference in Tjj. For the most part,

this information is based on whether or not an individual indicated that he had

been on his current job for less than a year.     It does not depend directly on

the specific number of years reported for tenure, although some dependence will

arise as a result of the procedures used to impute tenure values (see Appendix

2). Hopefully, measureiiient error in the alternative Tj measure will be weakly

related to measurement error in           Unfortunately, it is necessary to know

the tenure level to construct (T13)2 and 0LDJUB. We used OLDJOBIJt as is,

since measurement error in OLDJOBIjt should not be much more of a problem for

the 1V1 procedure than for OLS. To construct (T1)2 we took the tenure

observations corresponding to a given job and fit a least squares regression of



     **This excludes some good observations on individuals who started jobs
less than .9 years before the survey and who were unemployed at the time of
the prior survey.
                                      —37—



tenure against an intercept and time, with the time slope constrained to 1.

Separate regressions were run for each job match in the sample. The squares of

the predicted values of tenure from the reqressions were used as measures of

        for purposes of constructing (T3t)2. The 1V1 procedure was implemented

using the new measures of        and (Ti)2 and the old measure of 0LDJ01t as

instrumental variables for the tenure variables. The coefficients on T, T2, and

OLDJOB for the specification corresponding to Table 1, Col 6 are —.0024, .00017,

and —.046. These estimates imply that wages rise by 4% after 10 years of

tenure, which is slightly above the earlier estimate of 2.7%.

     Finally, it is important to keep in mind that even if the 1V1 estimates are

biased downward by a. factor of 3, (with measurement error accounting for 2/3 of

the variance in the 1V1 instrument for tenure), most of the difference between

the 1V1 and OLS estimates of the tenure profile would remain. The evidence

above suggests that the bias from measurement error is small.

5.7 Differences between Blacks and Whites and Union and Nonunion Workers

     Columns 1 and 2 of Table A4 report OLS estimates of the wage equation for

samples of white men and black men respectively, and Column 3 reports the

difference between the two groups in the coefficients. Corresponding 1V1

estimates are reported in columns 3—6. The OLS results suggest that the tenure

profile of wages is about a 15% less steep for blacks than for whites. The

growth of wages with experience in the labor market is less than half as steep

for blacks than for whites.

        The small racial differential in the tenure profile disappears when the 1V1

is used to correct for heterogeneity, and both groups have very flat tenure

profiles. Thirty years of experience results in a wage increase of            for


If one triples the 1V1 estimate of the effect of 10 years of tenure on the
log of the wage, one oStains .084. This compares to the OLS estiuate of
.263.
                                     —38—



whites and 35.5% for blacks.   In summary, the evidence is that the effects of

tenure are relatively small for both groups and are much less important than

differences in wage growth with labor market experience in explaining racial

differences in wages.

     Table 6 compares estimates of the wage equation for the samples of union

and nonunion white workers. The OLS results indicate that the OLDJOB effect on

wages is smaller for union than nonunion workers (.03 eid .09 respectively).

The tenure slope for union workers Is also significantly flatter, which confirms

earlier studies. As shown in the Table 6 these estimates imply that during

the first ten years on the job wages rise by about 24% for nonunion workers and

10% for union workers, and this difference is highly significant. The

experience profiles are very similar.

     Once again, the 1V1 results tell a different story. The estimates of the

tenure profile decline sharply for both groups, but the decline is much larger

for nonunion workers than for union workers. No significant difference in the

effects of tenure on wages remains once heterogeneity is controlled for using

the 1V1 procedure. The decline in the estimated difference in the tenure

profile is accompanied by a substantial increase in the experience profile for

both groups. The effect of 10 years of experience on wages is very similar for

the two groups, but 30 years of experience is associated with a 89.7 % increase

for nonunion workers and a 70.2% increase for union workers. It reflects an

increase in the estimated experience profile for nonunion workers when IV is
                                         —39—



used.

        The differential impact of 1V1   on the union and nonunion samples is
consistent with the notion that union jobs and union workers are more

heterogenous than nonunion jobs and workers. The mean squared errors of the 1V1

wage equations in Tables 4 are about .109 for the union sample and .185 for t

nonunion sample. It may also be attributed to the fact that union jobs are more

desirable than alternative jobs for broad classes of workers, which reduces

heterogeneity bias resulting from quits in the first few years on the job by

workers for whom the job is a poor match. Finally, it is consistent with the

notion that union contracts (1) restrict the extent to which wages received by

individual workers reflect the quality of the job match and (2) restrict the

extent to which employers may selectively layoff workers who are below average

in productivity.*

5.8 Effects of Individual Specific and Match Specific Wage Components on Quits,

Layoffs and Separations



   Note that the effect of education on the wage for union workers is much
smaller than for nonunion, which is consistent with many previous studies.
The coefficient on the interaction of education and experience is positive for
nonunion members and negative for union members. The overall similarity of
the OLS estimates of the experience profiles for union and nonunion workers is
somewhat surprising, since other studies (for example Freeman (1980, Table 3)
using CPS data on blue collar workers without controls for tenure, Mincer
(1983, Table 12) using the 1968—1978 PSID data with controls for tenure) have
obtained a flatter experience slope for union workers. The difference between
our results and Mincer's are related to the fact that Mincer obtains a flatter
tenure slope for nonunion workers than for union workers, while we obtain a
much steeper nonunion slope when OLS is used. Most prior studies (See Mellow
(1981) and Block and Kushkin) obtain flatter tenure profiles for union than
for nonunion workers. There are many differences between Mincer's study and
ours, but we do not have a good explanation the difference in these results.
When we exclude tenure from the model and estimate by OLS, the nonunion
experience slope is indeed steeper than the union slope. As is discussed in
the text, the 1V1 results indicate that the experience slope is steeper for
onunion than union workers.
 Freeman (1980) provides evidence that unions reduce wage dispersion
associated with both observed and unobserved characteristics of jobs and
workers.

     Table 7 provides some direct evidence on the role of unobserved

heterogeneity in the job mobility equations. The fact that consistent estimates

of the wage parameters may be obtained using the 1V1 procedure permits

estimation of the individual component c as the mean    of the wage residuals

for a given individual and estimation of cij(t) as the deviation of the wage

residuals over a given job match from the individual mean c. The estimates c1

and Cjj(t) are then added to logit models for quits, layoffs and separations to

see if the individual components and job components are in fact related to job

mobility, both with and without controls for tenure. The table reports the

implied estimates of the partial derivatives of the quit, layoff and separation

probabilities with respect to these variables (evaluated at the mean quit,

layoff, and separation probabilities). The point estimates should be treated

with caution for a number of reasons. Both    and dI() are subject to

sampling error from the averages of the transitory wage component         Since

relatively few job spells are observed for most individuals, the estimate of

is subject to sampling error due to the match components ci(). Finally, the

tenure coefficients may be biased by heterogeneity which is not control for by

individual specific and job specific wage components.

     Despite these problems, the qualitative results are quite interesting.

has a negative coefficient in the quit, layoff and separation equations. A one

standard deviation (0.33) increase in this variable is associated with a fall of

0.05 in the separation rate when tenure is not controlled for .032 when it is

controlled for. Cjj(t) has a large negative coefficient in the quit and

separation equations, a smaller negative coefficient in the layoff equation.

Overall, the results indicate that the individual component and job match


  Note that the effect of        on layoffs reflects variation across matches
in wages relative to produc.ivity since unobserved productivity differences
are not controlled.
                                    —41—



components are both negatively related to the separation rate and thus

positively correlated with job tenure. These findings support our earlier

conclusion that the OLS estimates of the tenure profile suffer from a

substantial upward bias.



6. CONCLUDING REMARKS

     The instrumental variables estimates of the wage equation indicate that

tenure has a modest effect on wage growth, with total labor market experience

accounting for most of the growth during a career. Holding the effect of total

experience constant, wages rise by slightly under 5 percent in the first year on

the job and decline slightly thereafter. The accumulation of 10 years of tenure

is responsible for a wage increase of 2.7 ¼. Our analysis indicates that this

estimate is probably downward biased as a result of correlation between

experience and the job match error component and as a result of measurement

error in tenure. We would not rule out the possibility that the true effect of

10 years of tenure is 2 or 3 time as large as tIm 2.7% figure and would use

choose 6.6% as our preferred estimate. However, it is clear that heterogeneity

bias is responsible for the much larger least squares estimates of the tenure

profile discussed in the introduction. The evidence indicates that positive

bias in the least squares estimates arises from individual heterogeneity and job

match heterogeneity. The large change in the least squares estimates when CLS

is used, the fact that the results for nonunion workers (presumed to be more

heterogenous and in more heterogenous jobs) are more sensitive to the estimation

procedure, and the fact that the estimates of the individual specific and job

match specific error components are negatively related to mobility is further

evidence that heterogeneity is important. Our findings are fully consistence

with the fact that estimates of the tenure slope based upon the relationship
                                        —42—



regressions with fixed effects for each individual and regresssions of the

change in the wage upon the change in tenure and the usual controls are almost

always well below those obtained by regressing the level of the wage against

tenure, although the individual fixed effects and first difference methods do

not deal adequately with job heterogeneity.

       Our results have important implications for models of wage growth and job

mobility. First, they suggest that worker specific financed investments in

human capital may be too small to explain the decline.                       in quits

with tenure that is observed in simple least squares or logit estimates of the

quit function. However, they leave open the possibility that most of the

returns to the investments are received as fringe benefits rather than wages,*

and that the tenure slope of total compensation is sufficiently steep to explain

most of the drop in quits. The results also leave open the possibility that

firm   financed   specific human capital investments are large, since such

investments would not show up in wage growth, and thus the small tenure effect

on wages does not speak directly to the issue of whether the strong negative

partial correlation of tenure and layoffs is due to heterogeneity bias. A drop

in the layoff probability is likely to increase the value a worker places on his

job and thus to reduce the quit probability as well. Conclusions about the role

of specific capital accumulation in the layoff and quit profiles will require

further research.

       Second, the estimates of the effects of total labor market experience are

consistent with the view that worker financed investments in general training


 Studies by Mitchell (1984) and Bartel(1982) indicate that fringe benefits
rise with time on the job and that these play a role In the quit decision. We
have not consider these factors, in part, for lack of data.   This is an
important research question. Note that in assessing the links among tenure,
fringe benefits, and mobility it will be necessary to deal with the problems
of individual heterogeneity and job heterogeneity which have been the focus of
this study.

are important.

     Third, our finding that most wage growth is associated with total labor

market experience rather than seniority contradicts the supervision, sorting,

and risk aversion models of wage growth discussed in the introduction. This is

because these theories are primarily explanations for an increase in

compensation for the current job relative to the worker's alternatives.

Consequently, the results tend to support growth in productivity with

experience, as emphasized in human capital theory, as the dominant explanation

for overall effect of experience on earnings, although they are consistent with

an important role for job matching and labor market search.

     A long research agenda remains. A number of limitations of the present

study have been mentioned in the text. It would be desireable to attempt to

encorporate unobserved differences in experience and tenure slopes (this will

not be easy) and to implement the procedures using an alternative data set.

Recent studies by Brown (1983), Duncan and Hoffman (1979) and Mincer (1984) have

used information on the occurrence of training on the job to study directly the

links among training, experience, and wages. The results indicate that growth

in wages on a given job is much higher during the training period than after,

lending support to the human capital hypothesis. The findings of the present

study are consistent with these training effects only if most of the wage growth

carries over to other jobs (the training Is general).* This remains to be

determined.** It is also unclear whether our results or those of the above



*Duncan and Hoffman's(1979) finding that black men are less likely to be
receiving training than white men is consistent with the finding that the
perience profile for these workers is flatter than that of white workers.
   Mincer finds a negative association between the training measure and
mobility. Taken at face value, this result suggests that some of the training
is firm specific. However, it is possible that it Is due to heterogeneity
bias may explain it. Reference should also be made to the work of
Bishop(1979).
                                    —44—



studies can be reconciled with the work of Medoff and Abraham (1980, 1981), who

find that wages of workers within the same grade level improve with seniority

and prior experience while performance evaluations do not. Techniques similar

to the instrumental variables procedures of the present study may provide a

useful way to address possible biases due to Individual heterogeneity and job

heterogeneity in sorting out the effects of training on the current and

subsequent jobs.

     Finally, It would be usefulgo beyond the limited evidence presented In

Tab 3 of the paper and decompose our estimates of the returns to total

experience for the average worker into the direct effects of experience and the

gains from job matching and search. Our results are consistent with a

substantial role for both. However, a full solution to this problem would seem

to require joint estimation of the wage model, a quit model, and a layoff

model. This will be a difficult undertaken given the complexity of the quit and

layoff decisions and the severe econometric problems arising from job

heterogeneity and Individual heterogeneity.

Appendix 1 :        Inversion of the Error Covariance Matrix

      A standard result in matrix algebra is that for
(A.1) H=A+BDC,
H, A, and D all being square, non-singular matrices, then
(A.2)       H' = A' - A1B(D               +   A1B)1CA1

It is apparent that this forrtula for the analytic inverse of a sum of
matrices is rrost useful when the inverse of A is known (or easily calculated),
and when D is of sufficiently small dinension to make                    evaluation   of the
second term in (A.2) relatively easy. Indeed, this formula is a corner-
stone   of traditional variance components analysis, such as that                   developed
by   Wallace and Hussein (1969), for example. In its absence, the computational

requireirents   for   GLS in these rrde1s would be too               onerous   to be generally

practical.

      Henderson and Searle (1981) investigate special cases and                   extensions
of (A. 1) in terms        of    identifying the inverse, and         particularly those   special

cases which have statistical applications, Our purpose in this appendix is

to derive the inverse for one of the cases not considered by Henderson and

Searle, but one which has wide applicability in analyses of panel data.

Suppose a particular            individual    i in. a panel is observed to hold J different

jobs over a period of T years. Suppose                 further   that the residual in a

wage equation can be written as the sum of three mutually independent com-

Appendix    Data
     The data are from the 1968—1981 Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics
individuals tape. A few variables are based upon other sources, which are
identified below. Two working data sets were constructed, one for white male
heads of households and one for black male heads of households. The data sets
contain one observation for each person in each year the person was in the
sample. Although the survey starts in 1968, many individuals entered the
survey in later years. Individuals were excluded entirely if they were not
household heads in 1979, 1980 and 1981. Data for an individual were included
for a given year only if the following criteria were met:
    1) The individual was employed, temporarily laid off, or unemployed in
    that year, and had been employed, temporarily laid off, unemployed, a
    student, or not in the survey in the previous year;

    2) The individual was not soley self—employed, a government worker, or
    from Alaska or Hawaii in the current year or in the previous year;

    3) The individual was between the ages of 18 and 60, inclusive.

Persons with missing data on the variables in the wage equation were excluded
from the wage equation for that year.

NOTES ON THE VARIABLES
     1) Education: Number of grades completed. This variable can take on
values from 0 to 17. Due to a programming error, education in 1975 was left
out of the data set. For this year it was assigned the mean of education in
1974 and 1976. Education was bracketed in the Michigan survey prior to
1975. Consequently, an individual's value of education in 1976 was assigned
to all earlier years if the individual was over 28 years old in 1976.

     2) Experience: Number of years worked since age 18. The Michigan Survey
asked this question only from 1974 to 1981, and asked it only of new heads of
households in 1975 and 1977—1981. Experience was imputed for years in which
it was missing in the following way. First, an individual was imputed to have
a year of work experience if hours worked in that year was greater than 100.
Then, years worked since age 18 was computed by counting backwards or foriards
from a year in which the experience question was actually asked. For example,
if an individual reported 20 years of experience in 1974, and reported 500
hours of work in 1973, experience tn 1973 was given a value of 19. Also,
experience was set to missing if it was greater than (age—education—5).

     3) Union Membership: The variable is equal to 1 if the individual is a
member of a labor union, and 0 if not. This variable is missing from the data
in 1973; it was imputed for this year by averaging the 1972 and 1974 values,
or by assigning the non—missing value if either the 1972 or 1974 value was
missing.

     4) Marital Status: 1=Married, 0=Single, Widowed or Divorced.

     5) Health Limitation: This variable is equal to 1 if the individual
indicates that he has a health problem which affects his ability to work, and
is equal to 0 if not.

     6) Wage Measure: This variable is the log of annual earnings divided by
                                  A2 -2



annual hours on the person's main job. The measure is deflated by the
personal consumption fix—weight price index (Source: 1983 Economic Report of
the president) and put into log form.

     7) Quit, Layoff, and Separation Indicators: The PSID contains information
on tenure and separations for the years 1968—1981. However, the questions
relating to these items and the coding of the responses are not consistent
over the years, making it necessary to re—construct accurate measures of
employer tenure, quits and layoffs. Three major problems with the data
required attention. First, tenure levels are bracketed from 1968—1974. This
presents a problem for individuals with higher tenure levels, since the
bracketing at higher levels is coarse. Second, in the years 1969—1974, quits
are not distinguished from promotions. Third, the tenure question refers to
tenure with employer only in 1968, 1976, 1977, 1978 (for individuals under the
age of 45), and 1981. In the other years, the tenure question relates to
tenure "on the job" (1969—1975) or tenure in position (1978 for individuals 45
or older, 1979—1980).
     A lengthy computer program was written to handle these problems. The
program, which will be provided upon request, filled in missing tenure data,
separated quits form promotions by cross—checking against other variables, and
constructed measures of employer tenure in years when this information was not
available. The following comments summarize the more important sections of
the program:
    I. Tenure levels in 1968—1974 are set to the midpoints of the brackets.
    A response of "over 19—1/2 years" is set to 23.

    II. Tenure levels in 1978 (for individuals over 45 years and older),
    1979, and 1980 are imputed by adding 1 to the previous year's tenure if no
    separation between years was indicated, and setting tenure to .5 if a
    separation was indicated. This process is performed sequentially, using
    1977 tenure to impute 1978 tenure, then 1978 tenure to impute 1979 tenure,
    etc.

    [II. For individuals who reported quits/promotions in 1969—1974, the
    following method is used to determine whether a quit or promotion had
    occurred. A promotion is inferred if no unemployment had occurred in the
    previous year, if there had been no change in the major industry group
    reported by the individual, and if at least one of the following
    conditions was true:

           1) Employer tenure reported in 1976 is greater than 2 plus the number
           of years between the survey year and 1976. For example, if an
           individual reported a quit/promotion in 1973, but reported in 1976
           that tenure with employer was greater than 5, it is assumed that the
           individual had been promoted in 1973.

           2) Employer tenure reported in 1977 is greater than 2 plus the number
           of years between the survey year and 1977.

           3) The tenure reported in the year following the survey year is
           greater than 3.

           4) The tenure reported two years after the survey year is greater
           than 4.
                               A2 -3




    IV. Next, any missing data for tenure is filled in. First, if the missing
    value for tenure occurred in a year in which the person was employed, and
    if tenure reported in the following yar is greater than 1, current tenure
    is set to next year's tenure minus 1.   Second, if last year's tenure was
    not missing and if the individual was in the labor force in the current
    year, had experienced no unemployment in the previous year, and did not
    indicate that a separation had taken place between the last and current
    year, current tenure is set to last period's tenure plus 1. If a
    separation had been indicated, or if the individual had been out of the
    labor force or experienced unemployment in the previous year, current
    tenure is set to,5.

    V. Next, for years in which "tenure with employer" is not specifically
    asked, a check Is made to see whether reported tenure represents time in
    position or time with employer. An imputed value for tenure is created
    for the years in which tenure with employer was not asked by extrapolating
    backwards from years in which tenure with employer was asked. The imputed
    tenure value is created simply by letting current imputed tenure equal
    next year's imputed tenure minus 1. For example, since 1976 tenure
    represents years with employer, tenure in 1975 is set to tenure in 1976
    minus 1, and imputed tenure in 1974 is set to imputed tenure in 1975 minus
    1. Since tenure with employer must be greater than or equal to tenure in
    position, a value of imputed tenure which is greater than reported tenure
    in any "non—employer tenure" year serves as an indication that reported
    tenure represents time in position rather than time with employer. If
    imputed tenure is greater than current tenure plus 2, current tenure is
    set to imputed tenure. If a separation had occurred between the current
    year and the next year in which an employer tenure question was asked,
    imputed tenure would lie below reported tenure and so reported tenure
    would not be changed.
          This procedure also partially takes care of the problems created by
     the bracketing of tenure in 1968—1974. Individuals with higher tenure
     levels in these years will have large jumps in tenure as they move from
     one bracket to the next. These jumps in tenure will be smoothed out.
    However, the procedure does not compeletely smooth out tenure when an
     individual stays in the same bracket for several years; tenure will be
     smoothed only when it lies more than two years below imputed tenure.

    VI. The last step of the program creates the separation, quit and layoff
    variables. The separation variable is given a value of 1 if the
    individual worked at least 200 hours in the previous year, and if one of
    the following conditions is true:



*
    A?lly,    tenure is set to next year's tenure minus one only if next
    year's tenure is greater than 1, and either no separation occurred in the
    between the current and last year or next year's tenure was less than 2.
    If a separation occurred between the last and current year, the missing
    value for tenure would get filled in by the next step of the procedure.
    Likewise, a tenure value of less than 2 in the next year indicates that
    the individual is in a new job in the current year, and so the missing
    value would get filled in the second step of the procedure.
                              A2-4




        1) Tenure is less than 2 and the question "what happened to your last
        job?"1 has a non—missing response which is other than "promoted"
        (including "inferred promotion" created in step III of the program)
        or "no previous job".

        2) The individual is currently unemployed or out of the labor force
        and the question "what happened to your last job?" has a non—missing
        response other than "no previous job".

         3) Tenure is between 0 and 1 and the question "what happened to your
         last job"2 has a missing value.
     Finally, for those who report that their job ended due to a quit or a
layoff and who are unemployed at the time of the survey there is some
ambiguity as to whether the separation occurred within the previous 12
month. For example, an individual may have been laid off 2 years ago and
suffered a long spell of unemployment, which raises the possibility that the
same layoff may be counted in two consecutive surveys. To minimize this
possibility, we employ a variety of checks using separations, unemployment,
and hours worked in prior years.

     The quit variable is given a value of 1 if the separation variable is
equal to 1 and the reason for the separation is either "quit" or "was self—
employed before this". The layoff variable is given a value of 1 if a
separation is indicated and the reason for the separation is given as
"business failure", "strike, lockout", "laid off, fired", "other, incuding
military" or "seasonal or temporary job". Finally, if tenure was greater than
experience, it was set to missing.

     8) Area Dummy Variables: The area indicators refer to residence in the 9
Census regions. Areal is the Pacific region. Area2 is the Mountain region.
Area3 is the West North Central region. Area4 is the East North Central
region. Area5 is the West South Central region. Area6 is the East South
Central region. Area7 is the South Atlantic region. Area8 is the Mid
Atlantic region. The omitted category is New England.




1   This question is asked of currently employed individuals with raw tenure
    of less than 1. Possible responses are: 1) business failure, 2) strike,
    lockout, 3) laid off, fired, 4) quit, was self—employed before (1975—
    1981), 5) no previous job, 6) was self—employed before (1968—1974), 7)
    other, including military, 8) seasonal or temporary job, 9) don't know,
    10) promoted (1975—1981), 11) inferred promotion (1968—1974, created in
    step III of program).
2   This question was asked of individuals currently unemployed or out of the
    labor force. The coding is the same as given in footnote 1, except codes
    10 and 11 are not possible.

                 endogenous in columns 3 and 4. 7h instrumental variables include all variables in wage equation (except
      T,    and New Job) and the deviations of T, I and New Job from their respective means over the sample observations
      on the worker's current job. Other variables in the equations are a time trend, dummy variable for 8 Census regions,
      disability, residence in an SKSA, and residence in a city with more than 500,000 people.  The    is for columns
      1, 2, 4, and 5 are .38, .35, .34 and .33. The standard errors are .40, .43, .41 and .44. The White and black
      samples contain 15138 and 6551 observations respectively. The coefficient standard errors have been calculated under
      the assumption that the error structure consists of a fixed job component, a fixed indiv1dual component, and a serially
      uncorrelated component.

for a particular job match and the individual mean
     The partial derivatives of the quit, layoff, and separation probabilities are based upon the
logistic regression parameters. They were evaluated at the mean quit, layoff and separation probabilities
respectively. The point estimates should be treated very cautiously given the measurement problems
mentioned in the text and the endogeneity of tenure. The detailed logit results are available from the
authors.
