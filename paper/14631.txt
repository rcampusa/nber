                                           ABSTRACT

This paper is an empirical investigation of the role of government actions and interventions in the
financial crisis that flared up in August 2007. It integrates and summarizes several ongoing empirical
research projects with the aim of learning from past policy. The evidence is presented in a series of
charts which are backed up by statistical analysis in these research projects.

         What caused the financial crisis? What prolonged it? Why did it worsen so dramatically

more than a year after it began? Rarely in economics is there a single answer to such questions,

but the empirical research I present in this paper strongly suggests that specific government

actions and interventions should be first on the list of answers to all three. I focus on the period

from the start of the crisis through October 2008 when market conditions deteriorated

precipitously and rapidly. I draw on research papers, speeches at central banks, and

congressional testimony I have given on the crisis during the past two years.1

         This paper is based on the keynote lecture delivered in Ottawa on November 14 at a

conference in honor of David Dodge, former Governor of the Bank of Canada. Following an

approach to policy advocated by David Dodge throughout his distinguished career in public

service, I try to use empirical evidence to the maximum extent possible and explain the analysis

in the simplest possible terms, including by using a series of illustrative graphs.



1. What Caused the Financial Crisis?

         The classic explanation of financial crises, going back hundreds of years, is that they are

caused by excesses—frequently monetary excesses—which lead to a boom and an inevitable

bust. In the recent crisis we had a housing boom and bust which in turn led to financial turmoil in

the end of the paper.
the United States and other countries. I begin by showing that monetary excesses were the main

cause of that boom and the resulting bust.



1.1 Loose Fitting Monetary Policy

        Figure 1 was published in The Economist magazine in October 2007 as a simple way to

illustrate the story of monetary excesses. The figure is based on a paper [1] that I presented at

the annual Jackson Hole conference in August 2007. It examines Federal Reserve policy

decisions—in terms of the federal funds interest rate—from 2000 to 2006.

        The line that dips down to one percent in 2003, stays there into 2004, and then rises

steadily until 2006 shows the actual interest rate decisions of the Federal Reserve. The other line

shows what the interest rate would have been if the Fed had followed the type of policy that it

had followed fairly regularly during the previous 20 year period of good economic performance.

The Economist labels that line the Taylor rule because it is a smoothed version of the interest rate

one gets by plugging actual inflation and GDP into a policy rule that I proposed in 1992.2 But

the important point is that this line shows what the interest rate would have been if the Fed had

followed the kind of policy that had worked well during the historical experience of the Great

Moderation that began in the early 1980s.

  When he was President of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, William Poole presented a similar chart covering
a longer period and without the smoothing in “Understanding the Fed,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Review,
January/February, 2007, Vol. 89. No. 1, pp. 3-14



                                                        2
     Figure 1. Chart from The Economist, October 18, 2007



Figure 1 shows that the actual interest rate decisions fell well below what historical experience

would suggest policy should be. It thus provides an empirical measure that monetary policy was

too easy during this period, or too “loose fitting” as The Economist puts it. This was an

unusually big deviation from the Taylor rule. There was no greater or more persistent deviation

of actual Fed policy since the turbulent days of the 1970s. So there is clearly evidence that there

were monetary excesses during the period leading up to the housing boom.

       The unusually low interest rates decisions were, of course, made with careful

consideration by monetary policymakers. One can interpret them as purposeful deviations from

the “regular” interest rate settings based on the usual macroeconomic variables. The Fed used

transparent language to describe the decisions, saying, for example, that interest rates would be

low for “a considerable period” and that they would rise slowly at a “measured pace,” which

were ways of clarifying that the decisions were deviations from the rule in some sense. These

actions were thus effectively discretionary government interventions in that they deviated from




                                                 3
the regular way of conducting policy in order to address a specific problem, in particular a fear of

deflation as had occurred in Japan in the 1990s.



1.2 The Counterfactual: No Boom, No Bust

       In presenting this chart to the central bankers meeting in Jackson Hole in August 2007 I

argued that this extra easy policy was responsible for accelerating the housing boom and thereby

ultimately leading to the housing bust. To support such an argument empirically I provided

statistical evidence that the interest rate deviation shown in Figure 1 could plausibly bring about

a housing boom. I did this by using regression techniques to estimate a model of the empirical

relationship between the interest rate and housing starts, and I then simulated that model to see

what would have happened in the counterfactual event that policy had followed the rule shown in

Figure 1. In this way an empirical proof was provided that monetary policy was a key cause of

the boom and hence the bust and the crisis.

       Figure 2 summarizes the results of this empirical approach. It is a picture of housing

starts in the United States during the same period as Figure 1; it is drawn from that same 2007

Jackson Hole paper [1]. The jagged line shows actual housing starts in thousands of units. Both

the housing boom and the housing bust are very clear in this picture.




                                                   4
        Figure 2. The Boom-Bust in Housing Starts Compared
        With the Counterfactual. (The line with shorter dashes
        shows model simulations with the actual interest rate.)


The line labeled “counterfactual” in Figure 2 is what a statistically estimated model of housing

starts suggests would have happened had interest rates followed along the rule in Figure 1;

clearly there would have not been such a big housing boom and bust. Hence, Figure 2 provides

empirical evidence that the unusually low interest rate policy was a factor in the housing boom.

One can challenge this conclusion, of course, by challenging the model, but an advantage of

using a model and an empirical counterfactual is that one has a formal framework for debating

the issue.

        Not shown in Figure 2 is the associated boom and bust in housing prices in the United

States. The boom-bust was evident throughout most of the country, but was worse in California,

Florida, Arizona and Nevada. The only exceptions were in states like Texas and Michigan where

local factors offset the monetary excess stressed here.




                                                 5
       Though the housing boom was the most noticeable effect of the monetary excesses, they

also could be seen in more gradually rising overall prices: CPI inflation, for example, averaged

3.2 percent at an annual rate during the past five years, well above the 2 percent target suggested

by many policy makers and implicit in the policy rule in Figure 1. It is always difficult to predict

the exact initial impacts of monetary shocks, but housing was also a volatile part of GDP in the

1970s another period of monetary instability before the onset of the Great Moderation. The

monetary policy followed during the Great Moderation had the advantages of keeping both the

overall economy stable and the inflation rate low.



1.3 Competing Explanations: A Global Saving Glut

       Some argue that the low interest rates in 2002-2004 were caused by global factors beyond

the control of the monetary authorities. If so, then the interest rate decisions by the monetary

authorities were not the major factor causing the boom. This explanation is potentially appealing

because long term interest rates remained low for a while even after the short-term federal funds

rate started increasing. This alternative explanation focuses on global saving. It argues that there

was an excess of world saving—a global saving glut—which pushed interest rates down in the

United States and other countries.

       The main problem with this explanation is that there is actually no evidence for a global

saving glut. On the contrary, as Figure 3 shows in very simple terms, there seems to be a saving

shortage. This figure, which was produced by staff at the International Monetary Fund in 2005,

shows that the global saving rate—world saving as a fraction of world GDP—was very low in

the 2002-2004 period especially when compared with the 1970s and 1980s. So this alternative

explanation does not stand up to empirical testing using data that have long been available.




                                                 6
Figure 3. Global Saving and Investment as a Share of World GDP
Source: World Economic Outlook, IMF Sept 2005, Chapter 2, p. 92,


       To be sure, there was a gap of saving over investment in the world outside the United

States during 2002-2004, and this may be the source of the term “saving glut.” But the United

States was saving less than it was investing during this period; it was running a current account

deficit which implies that saving was less then investment. Thus the positive saving gap outside

the United States was offset by an equal sized negative saving gap in the United States. No extra

impact on world interest rates would be expected. As implied by simple global accounting, there

is no global gap between saving and investment.



1.4 Monetary Policy in Other Countries: Central Banks Looking at Each Other?

       Nevertheless there are possible global connections to keep track of when assessing the

root cause of the crisis. Most important is the evidence that interest rates at several other central

banks also deviated from what historical regularities, as described by a Taylor rule, would

predict. Even more striking is that housing booms were largest where the deviations from the




                                                  7
rule were largest.3 For example, within Europe the deviations from the Taylor rule vary in size

because inflation and output data vary from country to country. The country with the largest

deviation from the rule was Spain, and it had the biggest housing boom, measured by the change

in housing investment as a share of GDP. The country with the smallest deviation was Austria; it

had the smallest change in housing investment as a share of GDP. The very close correlation is

shown in Figure 4 which plots the sum of deviations from the policy rule on the horizontal axis

and the change in housing investment as a share of GDP on the vertical axis.




        Figure 4. Housing Investment Versus Deviations From the
        Taylor Rule in Europe (Source: See footnote 3.)


An important question, with implications for reform of the international financial system, is

whether these low interest rates at other central banks were influenced by the decisions in the

  R. Ahrend, B. Cournède and R. Price provide a fascinating analysis of the experiences in OECD countries during
this period in their paper "Monetary Policy, Market Excesses and Financial Turmoil", OECD Economics
Department Working Papers, No. 597, March 2008. They show that the deviations from the Taylor rule explain a
large fraction of the cross-country variation in housing booms in OECD countries.



                                                        8
United States or represented an interaction among central banks that caused global short interest

rates to be lower than they otherwise would have been. To test this hypothesis, I examined the

decisions at the European Central Bank in a paper [2] for a talk in Europe in June 2007. I

studied the deviations (or the residuals) of the ECB interest rate decisions from the same type of

policy rule used in Figure 1, but using Euro zone inflation and GDP data. The interest rate set by

the ECB was also below the rule; in other words there were negative residuals. To determine

whether those residuals were influenced by the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions, I ran a

regression of them during 2000-2006 on the federal funds rate shown in Figure1. I found that the

estimated coefficient was .21 and that it was statistically significant.

        Figure 5 gives a visual sense of how much of the ECB interest rate decisions could be

explained by the influence of the Fed’s interest rate decisions. It appears that a good fraction can

be explained in this way. The jagged looking line in Figure 5 shows the deviations of the actual

interest rates set by the ECB from the policy rule. (I have not smoothed out the high frequency

jagged movements as in Figure 1). By this measure, the ECB interest rate was as much as two

percentage points too low during this period. The smoother looking line shows that a good

fraction of the deviation can be “explained” by the federal funds rate in the United States.

        The reasons for this connection are not clear from this statistical analysis, and are a

fruitful subject for future research in my view. Indeed it is difficult to distinguish statistically

between the ECB following the Fed and the Fed following the ECB; similar regressions show

that there is connection the other way as well. Concerns about the exchange rate, or the influence

of the exchange rate on inflation, could generate such a relationship. So could third factors such

as changes in the global real interest rate.

1.5 Monetary Interaction with the Subprime Mortgage Problem

       A sharp boom and bust in the housing markets would be expected to have had impacts on

the financial markets as falling house prices lead to delinquencies and foreclosures. These

effects were amplified by several complicating factors including the use of sub-prime mortgages,

especially the adjustable rate variety which led to excessive risk taking. In the United States this

was encouraged by government programs designed to promote home ownership, a worthwhile

goal, but overdone in retrospect.

       It is important to note, however, that the excessive risk taking and the low interest

monetary policy decisions are connected. Evidence for this connection is shown in Figure 6

which plots housing price inflation along with foreclosure and delinquency rates on adjustable

rate subprime mortgages. The figure shows the sharp increase in housing price inflation from


                                                 10
mid 2003 to early 2006 and the subsequent decline. Observe how delinquency rates and

foreclosure rates were inversely related to housing price inflation during this period. During the

years of the rapidly rising housing prices, delinquency and foreclosure rates declined rapidly.

The benefits of holding onto a house, perhaps working longer hours to make the payments, are

higher when the price of the house is rising rapidly. When prices are falling, the incentives to do

so are much less and turn negative if the price of the house falls below the value of the mortgage.

Hence, delinquencies and foreclosures rise.




Figure 6. Housing Price Inflation and Subprime ARM Delinquencies and Foreclosures



       Mortgage underwriting procedures are supposed to take account of the actual realizations

of foreclosure rates and delinquency rates in cross section data. The procedures would therefore

have been overly optimistic during the period when prices were rising unless they took account

of the time series correlation in Figure 6. Thus there is an interaction between the monetary

excesses and the risk-taking excesses. It is an illustration of how unintended things can happen


                                                11
when policy deviates from the norm. In this case, the rapidly rising housing prices and the

resulting low delinquency rates likely threw the underwriting programs off track and misled

many people.



1.6 More Complications: Complex Securitization, Fannie, and Freddie

       A significant amplification of these problems occurred because the adjustable-rate sub-

prime and other mortgages were packed into mortgage-backed securities of great complexity.

The risk of these was underestimated by the rating agencies either because of a lack of

competition, poor accountability, or most likely an inherent difficulty in assessing risk due to the

complexity. It led to what might be called the “Queen of Spades problem” corresponding to the

game of Hearts. In the game of Hearts you don't know where the Queen of Spades is; you don't

want to get stuck with the Queen of Spades. Well, the Queens of Spades—and there are many of

them in this game—were the securities with the bad mortgages in them and people didn't know

where they were. We didn't know which banks were holding them 14 months ago, and we still

don't know where they are. This risk in the balance sheets of financial institutions has been at

the heart of the financial crisis from the beginning.

       In the United States there were other government actions at play here. The government

sponsored agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were encouraged to expand and buy mortgage

backed securities, including those formed with the risky sub-prime mortgages. While legislation,

such as the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005, was proposed to control

these excesses, it was not passed into law. These actions of these agencies should be added to

the list of government interventions that were part of the problem.




                                                 12
2. What Prolonged the Crisis?

       The financial crisis became acute on August 9 and 10, 2007 when the money market

interest rates rose dramatically. Figure 7 illustrates this using a measure which has since become

the focus of many studies. The measure is the spread between three-month Libor and the three-

month Overnight Index Swap (OIS). The OIS is a measure of what the markets expect the

federal funds rate to be over the three-month period comparable to three month Libor.

Subtracting OIS from Libor effectively controls for expectations effects which are a factor in all

term loans, including three-month Libor. The difference between Libor and OIS is thus due to

things other than interest rates expectations, such as risk and liquidity effects.

       Figure 7. The Libor–OIS Spread During the First Year of the Crisis



If you look at the lower left of Figure 7 you see a spread of about 10 basis points. If you

extended that further to the left, you would see a similarly steady level of about ten basis points.

On August 9th and 10th of 2007 this spread jumped to unusually high levels and has remained


                                                    13
high ever since. In our research [3] on this episode, John Williams and I called the event “A

Black Swan in the Money Market,” because it appeared to be so unusual. Observe that Figure 7

focuses on the first year of the crisis. The worsening situation in September and October 2008 is

covered in the next section.

       In addition to being a measure of financial stress, the spread affects the transmission

mechanism of monetary policy to the economy because trillions of dollars of loans and securities

are indexed to Libor. An increase in the spread, holding the OIS constant, will increase the cost

of such loans and have a contractionary effect on the economy. Bringing this spread down

therefore became a major objective of monetary policy, as well as a measure of its success in

dealing with the market turmoil.



2.1 Diagnosing the Problem: Liquidity or Counterparty Risk?

       Diagnosing the reason for the increased spreads was essential, of course, for determining

what type of policy response was necessary. If it was a liquidity problem then providing more

liquidity by making discount window borrowing easier or opening new windows or facilities

would be appropriate. But if the issue was counterparty risk then a direct focus on the quality

and transparency of the bank’s balance sheets would be appropriate, either by requiring more

transparency, dealing directly with the increasing number of mortgage defaults as housing prices

fell, or looking for ways to bring more capital into the banks and other financial institutions.

       In the fall of 2007 John Williams and I embarked on what we thought would be an

interesting and possibly policy relevant research project [3] to examine the issue. We

interviewed traders who deal in the interbank market and we looked for measures of counterparty

risk. The idea that counterparty risk was the reason for the increased spreads made sense




                                                 14
because it corresponded to the Queen of Spades theory and other reasons for uncertainty about

banks’ balance sheets. At the time however, many traders and monetary officials thought it was

mainly a liquidity problem.

        To assess the issue empirically, we looked for measures of risk in these markets to see if

they were correlated with the spread. One good measure of risk is the difference between

interest rates on unsecured and secured interbank loans of the same maturity. Examples of

secured loans are government-backed Repos between banks. By subtracting the interest rate on

Repos from Libor, you could get a measure of risk. Using regression methods, we then looked

for the impact of this measure of risk on the Libor spread and showed that it could explain much

of the variation in the spread. Other measures of risk gave the same results.

        The results are illustrated in Figure 8 which shows the high correlation between the

unsecured-secured spread and the Libor-OIS spread. There seemed to be little role for liquidity.

These results suggested, therefore, that the market turmoil in the interbank market was not a

liquidity problem of the kind that could be alleviated simply by central bank liquidity tools.

Rather it was inherently a counterparty risk issue, which linked back to the underlying cause of

the financial crisis. This was not a situation like the Great Depression where just printing money

or providing liquidity was the solution; rather it was due to fundamental problems in the

financial sector relating to risk.

But this was not the diagnosis that drove economic policy during this period. While it is difficult

to determine the diagnosis of policy makers because their rationales for the decisions are not

always explained clearly, it certainly appears that the increased spreads in the money markets

were seen by the authorities as liquidity problems rather than risk. Accordingly, their early

interventions focused mainly on policies other than those which would deal with the fundamental

sources of the heightened risk. As a result, in my view, the crisis continued.

2.2 Three examples

       As evidence I provide three specific examples of the interventions that prolonged the

crisis either because they did not address the problem or because they had unintended

consequences.



2.2.1 Term Auction Facility

       To make it easier for banks to borrow from the Fed, the term auction facility (TAF) was

introduced in December 2007. With this new facility, banks could avoid going to the discount

window; they could bid directly for funds from the Fed. Similar facilities were set up

simultaneously at other central banks. The main aim of the TAF was to reduce the spreads in the

money markets and thereby increase the flow of credit and lower interest rates. Figure 9, which

is drawn from my paper with John Williams, shows the amount of funds taken up (on the right

scale) along with Libor and OIS spread (on the left scale). Recall that this chart does not go

beyond mid September 2008.

          Figure 9. The Term Auction Facility Had Little Impact on the Spread



          Soon after the introduction of the TAF in December 2007, the spread came down a bit

and some policy makers suggested that it was working. But soon the spread rose again, and if

you look at Figure 9, it is hard to see any effect on the spread during this whole period. This

visual impression is confirmed with detailed regression analysis. The TAF did not seem to make

much difference. If you think of the reason for the spread as counterparty risk as distinct from

liquidity, this is not surprising.



2.2.2 Temporary Cash Infusions

          Another early policy response was the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 passed in

February. The major part of this package was to send cash totaling over $100 billion to



                                                18
individuals and families in the United States so they would have more to spend and thus jump-

start consumption and the economy. Most of the checks were sent in May, June, and July. While

not a purely monetary action because the rebate was financed by borrowing rather than money

creation, like the liquidity facilities it was not focused on the underlying causes of the crisis.

        Moreover, as would be predicted by the permanent income theory of consumption,

people spent little if anything of the temporary rebate, and consumption was not jump-started as

had been hoped. The evidence is in Figure 10, which is drawn from research reported in [4]. The

top line shows how personal disposable income jumped at the time of the rebate. The lower line

shows that personal consumption expenditures did not increase in a noticeable way. As with the

earlier charts, formal statistical work shows that the rebates had no statistically significant

increase in consumption.

2.2.3 The Initial Cuts in Interest Rates through April 2008

       A third policy response to the financial crisis was the sharp reduction in the federal funds

rate in the first half year of the crisis. The federal funds rate target went from 5-1/4 percent when

the crisis began in August 2007 to 2 percent in April 2008. The Taylor rule also called for a

reduction in the interest rate during this early period, but not as sharp. Thus the reduction was

more than would be called for using the historical relation stressed at the start of this paper, even

adjusting for the Libor-OIS spread as I suggested [5] in a speech at the Federal Reserve Bank of

San Francisco and in testimony at the House Financial Services Committee in February.

       It is difficult to assess the full impact of this extra sharp easing, and more research is

needed. The lower interest rates reduced the size of the re-set of adjustable rate mortgages and

thereby was addressed to some of the fundamentals causing the crisis. Some of these effects

would have occurred if the interest rate cuts were less aggressive.

       The most noticeable effects at the time of the cut in the federal funds rate, however, were

the sharp depreciation of the dollar and the very large rise in oil prices. During the first year of

the financial crisis oil prices doubled from about $70 per barrel in August 2007 to over $140 in

July 2008, before plummeting back down as expectations of world economic growth declined

sharply. Figure 11 shows the close correlation between the federal funds rate and the price of oil

during this period using monthly average data. The chart ends before the global slump in

demand became evident and oil prices fell back.




                                                 20
       Figure 11. The Sharp Cut in Interest Rates Was Accompanied by a Rapid Increase
       in Oil Prices Through the First Year of the Crisis. (Last observation is July 2008)


       When the federal funds rate was cut, oil prices broke out of the $60-$70 per barrel range

and then rose rapidly throughout the first year of the financial crisis. Clearly this bout of high oil

prices hit the economy hard as gasoline prices skyrocketed and automobile sales plummeted in

the spring and summer of 2008. In my view, expressed in a paper [6] delivered at the Bank of

Japan in May, this interest rate cut helped raise oil and other commodity prices and thereby

prolonged the crisis.

       Econometric evidence of the connection between interest rates and oil prices is found in

existing empirical studies. For example, in early May 2008, the First Deputy Managing Director

of the International Monetary Fund John Lipsky said: “Preliminary evidence suggests that low

interest rates have a statistically significant impact on commodity prices, above and beyond the

typical effect of increased demand. Exchange rate shifts also appear to influence commodity

prices. For example, IMF estimates suggest that if the US dollar had remained at its 2002 peak



                                                  21
through end-2007, oil prices would have been $25 a barrel lower and non-fuel commodity prices

12 percent lower.”4

        When it became clear in the fall of 2008 that the world economy was turning down

sharply, oil prices then returned to the $60-$70 range. But by this time the damage of the high oil

prices had been done.



3. Why Did the Crisis Worsen So Dramatically More Than a Year After It Began?

        Figure 12 shows, using the same Libor-OIS measure of tension in the financial markets

as in Figure 7, how dramatically the financial crisis worsened in October 2008. Recall that in our

research paper on the subject, John Williams and I called the jump in spreads in August 2007 “A

Black Swan in the Money Market.” The October 2008 events were even more unusual. Not only

was the crisis prolonged for more than a year, it worsened, according to this measure, by a factor

of four. It became a serious credit crunch with large spillovers, seriously weakening an economy

already suffering from the lingering impacts of the oil price bout and the housing bust. Notice the

close correlation between our measure of counterparty risk and the Libor-OIS spread, which

demonstrates convincingly that all along the problems in the market were related to risk rather

than liquidity.

Figure 12. Evidence of the Crisis Worsening Dramatically
Fourteen Months after It Began




3.1 An Event Study

        Many commentators have argued that the reason for the worsening of the crisis was the

decision by the U.S. government (more specifically the Treasury and the Federal Reserve) not to

intervene to prevent the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers over the weekend of September 13 and

14. It is difficult to bring rigorous empirical analysis to this important question, but it is

important that researchers do so because future policy actions depend on the answer. Perhaps the

best empirical analyses we can hope for at this time are “event studies” that look carefully at

reactions in the financial markets to various decisions and events. Such an event study,

summarized below, suggests that the answer is more complicated than the decision not to

intervene to prevent the Lehman bankruptcy and, in my view, lies elsewhere.

        Figure 13 focuses on a few key events from September 1 through mid October—the last

few observations in Figure 12. Since mid October a host of new policy interventions have taken


                                                      23
place—including implementation of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), guarantees by

the FDIC, Federal Reserve support for the commercial paper market, similar actions in other

countries—and conditions have improved somewhat as seen in the graph. But the question here

is what led to the worsened conditions, which have so severely affected the economy and

generated so many unprecedented clean-up actions.




Figure 13. Event Study of the Dramatic Worsening of the Crisis



       Recall that for the year previous to the events in Figure 13, the spread had been

fluctuating in the 50 to 100 basis point range which was where it was through the first half of

September 2008. You can see that the spread moved a bit on September 15th, which is the

Monday after the weekend decisions not to intervene in Lehman Brothers. It then bounced back


                                                24
down a little bit on September 16 around the time of the AIG intervention. While the spread did

rise during the week following the Lehman Brothers decision, it was not far out of line with the

events of the previous year.

       On Friday of that week the Treasury announced that it was going to propose a large

rescue package, though the size and details weren't there yet. Over the weekend the package was

put together and on Tuesday September 23, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke and

Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson testified at the Senate Banking Committee about the TARP,

saying that it would be $700 billion in size. They provided a 2-1/2 page draft of legislation with

no mention of oversight and few restrictions on the use. They were questioned intensely in this

testimony and the reaction was quite negative, judging by the large volume of critical mail

received by many members of the United States Congress. As shown in Figure 13 it was

following this testimony that one really begins to see the crises deepening, as measured by the

relentless upward movement in Libor-OIS spread for the next three weeks. Things steadily

deteriorated and the spread went through the roof to 3.5 per cent.



3.2 The Lack of a Predictable Framework for Intervention

       The main message of Figure 13 is that identifying the decisions over the weekend of Sept

13 and 14 as the cause of the increased severity of the crisis is questionable. It was not until

more than a week later that conditions deteriorated. Moreover, it is plausible that events around

September 23 actually drove the market, including the realization by the public that the

intervention plan had not been fully thought through and that conditions were much worse than

many had been led to believe. At a minimum a great deal of uncertainty about what the

government would do to aid financial institutions, and under what circumstances, was revealed




                                                 25
and thereby added to business and investment decisions at that time. Such uncertainty would

have driven up risk spreads in the interbank market and elsewhere. Some evidence of the

uncertainty is found in a survey taken later (November 5) by the Securities Industry and

Financial Markets Association (SIFMA); it showed that 94 percent of securities firms and banks

found that the TARP lacked clarity about its operations.

       The problem of uncertainty about the procedures or criteria for government intervention

to prevent financial institutions from failing had existed since the time of the Bear Stearns

intervention in March. The implication of that decision for future interventions was not made

clear by policymakers. This lack of predictability about Treasury-Fed intervention policy and

recognition of the harm it could do to markets likely increased in the fall of 2008 when the

underlying uncertainty was revealed for all to see. What was the rational for intervening with

Bear Stearns, and then not with Lehman, and then again with AIG? What would guide the

operations of the TARP?

       Worries about the lack of clarity were raised in many quarters. At a conference on The

Future Role of Central Banking: The Urgent and Precedent-Setting Next Steps held on the

Stanford campus in July to address the new interventions, I argued [7] that the U.S. Treasury and

the Fed urgently needed to develop a new framework for exceptional access to government

support for financial institutions. I made analogies to a reform put in place at the IMF in 2003

which clarified the circumstances under which the IMF would provide loans to countries

experiencing crises. After these IMF reforms were put in place, the eight year emerging market

crisis period that had begun in 1995 came to a close.

       Analogously, a new exceptional access framework would describe the process that the

U.S. and other governments would take when intervening and providing loans to an institution.




                                                 26
It would work like the IMF’s exceptional access framework (EAF) which indicated the

procedures the IMF should take when providing loans to a country. The more policy-makers

could articulate the rationale and the procedures the better.



Conclusion

         In this paper I have provided empirical evidence that government actions and

interventions caused, prolonged, and worsened the financial crisis. They caused it by deviating

from historical precedents and principles for setting interest rates, which had worked well for 20

years. They prolonged it by misdiagnosing the problems in the bank credit markets and thereby

responding inappropriately by focusing on liquidity rather than risk. They made it worse by

providing support for certain financial institutions and their creditors but not others in an ad hoc

way without a clear and understandable framework. While other factors were certainly at play,

these government actions should be first on the list of answers to the question of what went

wrong.

    What are the implications of this analysis for the future? Most urgently it is important to

reinstate or establish a set of principles to follow to prevent misguided actions and interventions

in the future. Though policy is now in a massive clean-up mode, setting a path to get back to

these principles now can be part of the clean-up, including

        Returning to the set of principles for setting interest rates that worked well during the

         Great Moderation.

        Basing any future government interventions on a clearly stated diagnosis of the problem

         and a rationale for the interventions.




                                                  27
      Creating a predictable exceptional access framework for providing financial assistance to

       existing financial institutions. The example of how the International Monetary Fund set

       up an exceptional access framework to guide its lending decisions to emerging market

       countries is a good one to follow.

Some of these reforms require a rethinking of the international financial architecture and others

are purely domestic. For example, to keep policy interest rates on track in a globalized economy

it would help to introduce the notion of a global inflation target [3]. This would help prevent

rapid cuts in interest rates in one country if they perversely affect decisions in other countries.

Policy makers could then discuss global goals for inflation and the impact that one central bank

might have on global inflation. In contrast, developing exceptional access frameworks for

central banks and finance ministries could be done in each country without a global structure.

Similarly setting controls on leveraging at the financial institutions could be done in each

country.

       Finally I want to stress that the research presented in this paper must be considered

preliminary. We are still in the middle of the crisis and more data need to be collected and

analyzed. There are and will continue to be differences of opinion. Carefully documented

empirical research is needed for sorting out these differences. We should be basing our policy

evaluations and conclusions on empirical analyses not ideological, personal, political, or partisan

grounds.

Summary of Empirical Research Projects

The empirical research projects that I integrated and summarized for this paper are found below.

[1] “Housing and Monetary Policy,” in Housing, Housing Finance, and Monetary Policy Federal

Reserve Bank of Kansas City. This paper reported on research completed in the summer of 2007

before the August flare up in the financial markets. It focuses on the relationship between

monetary policy and the housing boom. It was delivered at a policy panel at the annual Jackson

Hole conference, August 30 - September 1, 2007.

[2] “Globalization and Monetary Policy: Missions Impossible,” in Mark Gertler and Jordi Gali

(Eds.) The International Dimensions of Monetary Policy, National Bureau of Economic

Research. This paper summarized research on globalization and monetary policy pointing to the

potential problem caused by central banks following each other either directly or indirectly. This

provided on explanation for why several central banks held interest rates too low in the 2002-

2004 period. The paper was prepared for a talk at an NBER conference in Girona, Spain on June

11, 2007.

[3] “A Black Swan in the Money Market,” with John C. Williams, American Economic Journal

Macroeconomics, January 2009. This is the final revision of research we started in the fall of

2007 on whether the unusual jump in interbank lending rates in August 2007 was caused by

liquidity problems or counterparty risk. A working paper (No. 2008-04) with the same title was

issued by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco in April and another working paper,

“Further Results on a Black Swan in the Money Market” was issued in May by the Stanford

Institute for Economic Policy Research.

[4] “The State of the Economy and Principles for Fiscal Stimulus,” Testimony before the Senate

Budget Committee, November 19, 2008. This testimony reports on a project to estimate the




                                                29
impact of the tax rebates of 2008 on the economy, with more formal econometric evidence in a

paper prepared for the American Economic Association meeting in San Francisco, January 2009

[5] “The Costs and Benefits of Deviating from the Systematic Component of Monetary Policy,”

keynote address at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco conference on Monetary Policy

and Asset Markets, February 22, 2008 and “Monetary Policy and the State of the Economy,”

testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, February 26, 2008. These items

examined whether monetary policy rules should be adjusted for the increased spread in the

money markets.

[6] “The Way Back to Stability and Growth in the Global Economy,” Institute for Monetary and

Economic Studies, Discussion Paper 2008-E-14, was presented as the inaugural Mayekawa

lecture at the Bank of Japan in May 2008. It discussed the impact of the sharp monetary easing

on oil and other commodity prices and proposed the idea of a global inflation target as a means

of preventing central banks’ interest rate decisions to spread to other central banks.

[7] “Toward a New Framework for Exceptional Access,” is a presentation for the policy

workshop on The Future Role of Central Banking Policy: Urgent and Precedent-Setting Next

Steps, held at Stanford University on July 22, 2008. This presentation laid out the case for

developing a more systematic approach to Fed’s interventions and bailouts of financial

institutions or their creditors. It followed the Bear Stearns intervention but was before the

Lehman bankruptcy.
