           Sources of Macroeconomic Imbalance in the World Economy:

                            A Simulation Approach




                                     ABSTRACT

       This paper uses a global macroeconomic simulation model to

  identify the factors that have contributed to global trade and

  financial imbalances in the l980s. After investigating the properties

  of monetary and fiscal policies in the model, we examine whether the

  budgetary shifts in the OECD economies in the l980s can account for

  the bulk of trade and exchange rate movements.         Our conclusions are
  mixed.    The combination of sharply higher fiscal deficits in the

  United States and sharply reduced deficits in Japan goes far to

  explain the movements of the trade balances and exchange rates of the

  two economies.    However, the drop in the dollar vis-a-vis the Yen

  since late 1985 is not well explained by the model.               We also
  investigate the prospects for a reduction of the U.S. trade deficits

  if U.S. budget deficits are in fact reduced, as well as the possible

  role for Japanese monetary and fiscal policies in reducing the trade

  imbalances of the two countries.

        Sources of Macroeconomic Imbalances in the World Economy:

        A Simulation Approach




        During the 1980s, there have been several striking developments

in world trade and financial patterns.        As shown in Table 1, the

United States shifted from a trade deficit of about 1 percent of GNP

at the end of the l970s to a trade deficit of over 3 percent of CNP in

1985.      Japan, on the other hand, shifted from a small surplus to a

surplus in excess of 4 percent of GNP in the same period. The non-oil

developing countries also experienced a dramatic change, with their

large trade deficits at the end of the 1970s being virtually
eliminated by 1985.

        The financial counterparts of these trade changes are well known

and equally dramatic.     The U.S., which in 1980 was the world's large

net creditor country, is now the largest net debtor country, while

Japan has replaced the U.S. as the world's preeminent creditor

country.      At the same time, most non-oil developing countries

virtually lost their access to market borrowing in the early 1980s,

and many of the largest borrowers in the late 1970s became net
repayers of debt in the mid-1980s.

     The trade and financial imbalances in recent years have generated

enormous political pressures in the United States for measures to

"restore balance".     Different interpretations of the reasons for the

imbalances have led to differing emphases in the policy proposals.

Many U.S. politicians, for example, ascribe the Japanese trade

surpluses to unfair Japanese trading practices.      The policy proposal

 most closely identified with this interpretation is the Gephardt

Amendment, which calls for U.S. tariff increases against foreign

 countries that have large bilateral trade surpluses vis-a-vis the

U.S., and are certified by the U.S. International Trade Commission to

be engaging in unfair trade practices against U.S. goods. 1

     Many business analysts and some economists see the U.S. trade

deficits     as     resulting   from   a   long-term   decline   in   U.S.

"competitiveness", resulting from poor management practices, old-
fashioned labor-relations procedures, a lack of entrepreneurship, or

other factors that have contributed to slow productivity growth.

Advocates of this point of view have urged a new industrial policy in

the United States, usually with some variant of labor-management-

government cooperation to overcome structural problems in the U.S.

economy.

     Most economists, however, regard the trade imbalances as deriving

from macroeconomic causes, and therefore look to macroeconomic
             2
solutions.        The most common interpretations of the U.S. and Japanese

imbalances stress the role of expansionary U.S. fiscal policies and

contractionary Japanese fiscal policies.       The differing movements in

included in the Omnibus Trade Bill passed by the U.S. House of
Representatives.   The trade legislation is now under consideration by
the U.S. Senate.    The President has stated that he will veto a trade
bill that includes the Gephardt Amendment in its current form.


2. It is possible, of course, to agree with the diagnosis that there
has been an important productivity slowdown in the U.S. economy, while
at the same time interpreting the trade balance developments as
resulting from other macroeconomic factors rather the productivity
slowdown itself.
                                        3

the budgets of the two countries, as measured by changes in the

structural inflation-adjusted (full-employment) budget deficit, can be

seen in Table 2.     Between 1979 and 1985, the U.S. structural budget

deficit widened by 4.4 percent of potential GNP in the U.S., while the

Japanese deficit was reduced by 3.7 percent. In the rest of the OECD,

Germany also reduced its structural deficit, by 3.3 percent of GNP,

while the smaller economies generally had a small increase in their

deficits.     In the most common interpretation of the trade imbalances

(and one     that is largely supported in this paper), the U.S. fiscal

expansion cum Japanese fiscal contraction raised U.S. interest rates

relative to Japanese rates, induced a capital inflow from Japan, and

caused a      dollar appreciation and a worsening of the U.S. trade

imbalance.

     Other economists put less weight on fiscal policy, and argue that

the dollar exchange rate had a "life of its own" in the 1980s, with

much of the appreciation of the dollar between 1980 and 1985 resulting

from speculative movements that pushed the dollar well above
"fundamental" levels, and thereby inducing a U.S. trade deficit.

Movements in the real exchange rate of the U.S. vis-a-vis other

countries are shown in Table 3 (real exchange rates are measured there

as the nominal exchange rate adjusted for relative consumer price

level changes). Whether the 24 percent real appreciation of the dollar

vis-a-vjs the Yen between 1978-80 and 1985, and the 39 percent

appreciation vis-a-vis the rest of the OECD, are explained by budget

deficits or by a speculative bubble, there is little doubt that the

exchange rate movements played an important role in generating the

trade imbalances of the early 1980's. Note that the model ideally

should explain both the appreciation of the dollar up to 1985, and the

sharp depreciation afterwards.

      Other economists suggest that the U.S. experienced an investment

boom in the 1980s due to a favorable economic climate and         high
business confidence. They argue that the trade deficits in the U.S.

are a sign of investment strength and economic vigor rather than

economic weakness.     Some go so far as to aver that apparent
relationship of the budget deficit and trade deficit is purely

coincidental, and that the real story of the U.S. trade imbalance is

not a fall in national savings (coming from larger public sector

deficits), but rather a rise in national investment.

     Each of these differing macroeconomic interpretations leads to a

distinct policy recommendation.   Those who stress the fiscal sources

of the trade imbalances usually stress the need for fiscal actions in

the major industrial countries as the way to reduce the trade
imbalances.   A standard view is that the U.S. should have a fiscal

contraction, while Japan and Europe should engineer an offsetting

fiscal expansion. Economists emphasizing the independent role of the

exchange rate stress the need for coordinated management of the

exchange rate, in addition to any fiscal actions which may be
warranted.    The dollar should be "talked down", or pushed down if

necessary by foreign exchange intervention policies or relatively

expansionary U.S. monetary policies.   Finally, those who see evidence

of an investment boom in the data argue that nothing particular needs
                                        5

to be done.    International capital is simply flowing to the economy

with the most exceptional investment opportunities.

     The goal of this paper is to present a simulation model of the

world economy to examine the fiscal policy interpretation of the trade

imbalance.    The argument for such an approach is that the issues at

hand require quantitative evidence that can best be adduced in the

context of a structural macroeconomic model. We can be confident, for

example, that the fiscal actions in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, have

contributed to the trade imbalances in recent years.       But is it

reasonable to attribute most or all of the observed imbalances to this

factor? Do we have to invoke additional factors, such as speculative

exchange rate movements, or declining U.S. productivity, to account

for the large shifts that have occurred in recent years?          The

simulation model presented in this paper can provide a quantitative

assessment of such issues.

     The simulation results in the paper suggest that the combination

of fiscal policies in the OECD and the cutoff in lending to the LDCs

in the early 1980s can account for most of the trade balance movements

of the U.S. and Japan, and some though not all of the exchange rate

movements since 1980.        However, there remain    major areas of

uncertainty, especially in explaining the extraordinary drop in the

dollar in the past year. The model also suggests several interesting

points regarding the international     transmission of policy changes.

Most importantly, the international linkages among the major economies

are probably not strong enough to justify the recent intense pressures

from the U.S. for "international policy coordination." U.S. economic
                                        6

growth and trade imbalances, for example, will be little affected by

the fiscal policy choices made by         Japan and Europe.   Even the

direction of effect of one country's monetary and fiscal policies on

other countries is often contrary to the conventional view.    Perhaps

most important, the use of monetary policies in the U.S. and abroad to

induce a further depreciation the dollar would, by itself, do little

to reduce the U.S. trade deficits.

     The model is described briefly in Section II (the model equations

are listed in Appendix A to the paper).     A more detailed description

of the model will soon be available in McKibbin and Sachs (1987). The

basic policy simulation results are described in Section III, where a

comparison is made with the standard Mundell-Fleming two country

model.      In Section IV, the model is used to track several of the

developments in the period since 1980, and is used to make some

forecasts of the next few years. In Section V, we underscore several

limitations of the model and descibe some extensions that are now

underway.



II. The MSG2 Model of the World Economy



     The model in this paper, which we term the MSG2 model, is a

further development of the McKibbin-Sachs Global (MSG) model, which

has been decribed elsewhere (see especially Mckibbin and Sachs (1986)

and Ishii, McKibbin, and Sachs (1986) for discussion of the earlier

version).     The new model extends the earlier version by including a

more satisfactory treatment of aggregate supply and investment
                                          7

behavior.      The new model, however, is still very much in a

developmental stage,      and we are indeed dissatisfied with the
specification of some of the key relations in the present version.



     A. An Overview of the Model



     The MSG2 is a dynamic general equilibrium model of a six-region

world economy, divided into the United States, Japan, Canada, the rest

of the OECD economies (denoted ROECD, and constituted mainly by OECD

Europe), and non-oil developing countries (LDCs), and OPEC. The model

is of moderate size (about three dozen behavioral equations per

industrial region).     It is distinctive relative to most other global

models in that it solves for a full intertemporal equilibrium in which

agents have rational expectations of future variables. In theoretical

conception, therefore, the model is close in design to intertemporal

dynamic models of fiscal policy in Lipton and Sachs (1983) and Frenkel

and Razin (1986).     Those studies, like the present simulation model,

examine     fiscal   policy   in   an   intertemporal   perfect-foresight

environment, with considerable attention given to intertemporal

optimization and intertemporal budget constraints. Frenkel and Razin

are noteworthy in being able to derive analytical results from their

model, rather than relying on simulations, as in the current study.

     The model has a mix of Keynesian and classical properties by

virtue of a maintained assumption of slow adjustment of nominal wages

in the labor markets of the U.S., Canada, and the ROECD (Japan is

treated somewhat differently, as described below).
                                         8

        The model is solved in a linearized form, to facilitate policy

optimization exercises with the model, and especially to use

linear-quadratic dynamic game theory and dynamic programming solution

techniques.     The global stability of the linearized model can be

readily confirmed by an analysis of the model's eigenvalues. At this

point, the model      is parametrized by choosing parameters based on

existing econometric      research in the literature, rather than by

undertaking our own econometric estimation of the model parameters.

The procedure of        relying on other research estimates for key

parameters represents, in our opinion, a healthy division of labor

between those who focus on general equilibrium modelling and those who

focus on the econometric         study of particular aspects of the

macroeconomy.

        Speaking broadly, the model has several attractive features.

First, all stock-flow relationships are carefully observed.       Budget

deficits cumulate into stocks of public debt; current account deficits

cumulate     into net foreign investment positions; and physical
investment cumulates into the capital stock.       Underlying growth of
Harrod-nuetral productivity plus labor force growth is assumed to be 4

percent per region.    Given the long-run properties of the model, the

world economy settles down to the 4 percent steady-state growth path

following any set of initial disturbances.




3. In general, quantity variables are linearized around their levels
relative to potential GDP, while price variables are linearized in log
form.
                                        9

     A second attractive feature is that the asset markets are

efficient in the sense that asset prices are determined by a
combination of intertemporal arbitrage conditions and rational

expectations.   By virtue of the rational expectations assumption and

the forward-looking behavior of households and firms, the model can be

used to examine the effects of anticipated future policy changes, such

as the sequence of future budget deficit cuts called for by the

Cranim-Rudman legislation in the U.S.   Indeed, one of the difficulties

of using the MSG2 model is that every simulation requires that the

"entire" future sequence of anticipated policies be specified.       In

practice, forty year paths of policy variables, or endogenous policy

rules, must be specified.

     A third attractive feature of the model is the specification of

the supply side.    There are several noteworthy points here.    First,

factor input decisions are based (with a few exceptions) on

intertemporal profit maximation by firms.       Labor and intermediate

inputs are selected to maximize short-run profits given a stock of

capital which is fixed within each period.       The capital stock is

adjusted according to a "Tobin's q" model of investment, derived along

the lines in Hayashi (1984).      Tobin's q is the shadow value of

capital, and evolves according to a rational expectations forecast of

future post-tax profitability.

     Another point of interest regarding the supply side is the

specification of the wage-price dynamics in each of the industrial

regions.   Extensive macroeconomic research has demonstrated important

differences in the wage-price processes in the U.S., Europe, and
                                       10

Japan, and these differences are incorporated in the model.         In

particular, the U.S. and Canada are characterized by nominal wage

rigidities arising from long-term nominal wage contracts.    In Japan,

on the contrary, nominal wages are assumed to be renegotiated on an

annual, synchronized cycle, with nominal wages selected for the

following year to clear the labor market on average.     In the ROECD,

nominal wages are assumed to be more forward looking than in the U.S.

and Canada, though real wages adjust slowly to clear the labour market.

        A third feature of the supply side of some interest is the

assumption regarding trade prices.      Many observers have recently

pointed out the fairly significant lag in the passthrough of exchange

rate changes into import price changes in the U.S. economy (and
probably in the other economies as well, which have been less

extensively examined).   The appreciation of the dollar during 1981-85

did not bring about an instantaneous and equivalent fall in U.S.

import prices, and the recent depreciation of the dollar has not

brought about an equivalent rise in prices. To capture part of this

effect, we assume that exporters into the U.S. market set their prices

in dollars one period in advance, in order to equate the export price

with the expected home market price in the following period. If the

dollar then unexpectedly appreciates, the importers into the U.S. reap

an unanticipated windfall, in that the price that they receive in the

U.S. market, expressed in local currency at the spot market exchange

rate, exceeds the domestic price of output.    This divergence will be

eliminated, on average, in the following period, when the trade prices

are reset.   There are of course other reasons for the failure of
                                          11

exchange rate movements to pass through into prices, most of which

involve imperfect competition in trade (see Dornbusch(1986) or Krugmari

(1986)     for details).     We plan to incorporate such imperfect
competition features into a later version of the model.



       B. A more detailed look at MSG2



       The complete MSG2 model is presented in Appendix A, and a

complete technical description will be found in McKibbin and Sachs

(1987).      Here we will merely sketch out some of the key structural

features of the model.

       Each of the regions in the model produces a good which is an

imperfect substitute in the production and spending decisions of the

other regions.     Each industrialized region produces one final good

which is used for investment and consumption purposes in that region

and in all of the other regions. LDC and OPEC each produce one good

which is a primary input in the production processes of the industrial

regions. Demands for the outputs of LDC and OPEC are therefore derived

demands for the production inputs.       The U.S., Europe, and Canada are

also      each assumed to produce an exogenous amount of domestic oil,

which is a perfect substitute for imports from OPEC.

       In the model version in this paper, only the four industrial

country regions are fully modelled with an internal macroeconomic

structure.     In LDC and OPEC, only the foreign trade and external

financial aspects are modelled (we are now upgrading the model to

include an internal macroeconomic structure for LDC).       Note that in
                                       12

referring to variables of the various regions, we will use the

following notation: U.S. (U); ROECD (R); Japan (J); OPEC (0); and LDC

(L). The currency of the ROECD will be termed "ECU", though in fact the

countries included in the ROECD and in the actual ECU are not exactly

the same.

      To understand the model, it is best to consider one bloc of the

model, that of the U.S., and to indicate where necessary any
differences in the modelling of the other OECD regions.            The

cornerstone of aggregate supply in the model is a representative firm

which maximizes income by producing a single output Q at price P,

subject to a two-input production function (for simplicity, potential

growth is ignored in the equations that follow, even though a constant

underlying potential growth rate of 4 percent is included in the

model). Thus, aggregate production is given as:



(1)       Q—Q(V,N)

Gross output Q is a produced with value added V, and primary inputs N.

In turn, V is produced with capital K and labor L, while N is produced

with the imports from OPEC (net of domestic oil production) N0 and the

LDCs NL



(2)       V=V(K,L)

(3)       N = N

                                            13

The capital stock changes according to the rate of fixed capital

formation J and the rate of geometric depreciation 6:



(4)      Kt+l =      + (1-6)


J is itself a composite good, produced with a Cobb-Douglas tecnology

that has as inputs the domestic goods and the final goods of Canada,

Europe, and Japan.         The price of J is simply a weighted sum of the

prices of the home goods P (pt for the U.S.) and the dollar import

prices            i = R, J, C) of goods from the other OECD regions




(5)       J = (QU)81 (QR)92 (QJ)03 (QC)04

      As is customary in modern models of investment, it is assumed

that the investment process is subject to rising marginal costs of

installation, with total nominal investment expenditures I equal to

the value of direct purchases of investment P*J, plus the per unit

costs of instalation.       These per unit costs, in turn, are assumed to

be a linear function of the rate of investment J/K, so that adjustment

costs are P'*J [(/2)(J/K)]. Total investment expenditure is
therefore:
                                                  14

(7)          I     [       +   P' (/2) (J/K)J J




           The goal of the firm is to choose inputs of L, N, and J to

maximize interteniporal net-of-tax profits. In fact, the firm faces a

stochastic problem, a point which is ignored in the derivation of the

firm's behavior (in other word's, the firm is                    assumed to hold its

estimates of future variables with subjective certainty). The firm's

deterministic problem, formally stated, is:




(8) max E (l+RY1 [ Q - (W/P)                L -        /P) N -   P   I]




where (l÷R) is a discount factor equal to:


      1
                       1
      II     (1+ r.)
      i=t



and r. is the period i short-term real interest rate.

           The solution to this problem is now well known (see Bruno and

Sachs, 1985, as an example).              There are three key points.         First,

inputs of L and N are hired to the point where marginal productivities

of these factors equal their factor prices.                This leads to equations

for the derived demand for L and N of the form:



(9)          L =   L ( W/P,           K
                                                15

 (10)       N         N (W/P,           K



Cross fixed capital formation can be written in terms of Tobin's

"marginal q, in the following manner:



(11)            J =   [(q-l)/   ]   K



Third, q (the shadow value of new investment) equals the discounted

value of future profits, with q given by:




(12)        q /       =         (1 + R)1 (FK +



Here Fk is the marginal product of capital in the production function,

and             is the marginal product of capital in reducing adjustment
costs in investment.

        In the specific application in the model, the gross output
production function is taken to be a two-level CES function in V and

N, with V a Cobb-Douglas function of L and K, and N a CES function of

oil and non-oil primary inputs.             The investment function derived in

(11) is also modified, for empirical realism, by              writing J as a
function not only of q, but also of the level of flow capital income

at time t, and the change in the level of gross output, along standard

investment accelerator lines. The modified investment equation is of

the form:
                                             16



 (11')       =   9   [(q -l)/     K+ (1-9) [Q - (W/P) L -        N] +


                 +6        -




         Total   private consumption spending is written as a function of

labor income net of labor taxes (rL is the labor income tax rate), and

total nominal financial wealth P*F, as in:



(13) PCCC [WL (1- rL)} +CK (P*F)


This equation is certainly the most problematic of the model.            The

equation is an ad hoc compromise between alternative conceptions of

aggregate consumption, in line with the empirical evidence that

consumption is partly determined along life-cycle lines,                with

considerable intertemporal consumption smoothing, and partly along

simpler Keynesian lines (perhaps because of liquidity constrained

households).         Thus, we specify that spending is a fixed proportion of

current net-of-tax labor income (with no consumption smoothing of the

labor income flow), as in standard Keynesian models, and a fixed

proportion of wealth, as in standard life-cycle models with infinite-

lived individuals.         We are now experimenting with other variants of

the consumption function, that include at least some degree of

consumption smoothing of post-tax labor income.

     Once pc* is determined, it is divided into purchases of the

domestic good, and imported final goods from Canada, ROECD, and Japan.
                                                 17

The division of PC*C is made to maximize an instantaneous utility

function of CES form.              The result is demands for home goods and

imported goods of the form:



(14)     C1        C               pipU, pR/p *          * C)




         with          * C    =         *C   +        * CC   +   * CU


                                   +     * CR



         where     i = J,     C, R, U



Note that P signifies the import price paid by U.S. consumers for

imports from country i.

       We assume that the government divides spending C among the final

goods in the same proportion as does the private sector                  (this

assumption is for convenience only), so that:



(15) G1 /     GU   =   C' /   CU          for i = C, R, J



       The price of imports is derived as follows. U.S. imports from

ROECD, Canada, and Japan are invoiced in dollars, according to an

equation which makes the invoice price in period t+l equal              to the

(rationally) expected dollar price of the output of country i               in

period t+l:
                                               18



                   i
                              =     i                  i
               t(pW )                      +
(16)
                        t+l       tp t+l       t
                                                   e
                                                        t+l



where      X41 signifies the period t rational expectations of variable

X at time t+l. (16) holds that the (log) price in period t+1 of a U.S.

import from country i is determined in period t, as the sum of the

(log) expected exchange rate and the (log) price of output in country

i in period t+l.        On average, the import price will equal the U.S.

dollar price of output in country i. However, if the actual exchange

rate of the dollar in period t+l turns out to be stronger (weaker)

than expected, the import price in the U.S. market will be higher

(lower) than the price of country i            output converted at the actual

exchange rate.

       The U.S. is in fact the only major market in which import prices

are invoiced in the importers currency.                    In most other markets, the

imports are invoiced in the exporter's currency, so that exchange rate

changes of the importing country are quickly passed through into

import prices.     Thus for all exports of final goods by country i to

country k other than the U.S., (k = R, J, C), the price of imports in

country k is given by the contemporaneous P1 multiplied by E1k, the

contemporaneous exchange rate between currency i and k.

       For the primary goods of OPEC and the LDCs, there is a single

uniform world price of goods which applies in all markets at all times

(i.e. the law of one price holds). Letting P0 be the dollar price of

OPEC goods, we assume that P0 is a variable markup over a basket of

OECD goods, so that:
                                               19




(16)     P0 — p0 (pU, EJ *      p', R * R               * pC) *   h   (X°)




with h' > 0.



Note that E1u is in units of dollars per unit of currency i. The

function P     (.,.,.,.)   is   linear homogenous and increasing in            the

prices of the OECD goods. The function h(X°) makes the OPEC markup an

increasing function of the total demand for OPEC exports X0 to the

other regions.      A similar equation governs the                    price of LDC
commodities.     The local currency price of OPEC goods in a non-U.S.
                                0       U   * P0 ,
region j is then given by P             E            according to the law of one
price. A similar equation applies for the LDC commodity export.

       The supply side of the U.S. block of the model is completed with

the wage equation, which makes the nominal wage change a function of

past consumer price (nc) changes, rationally expected future price

changes, and the level of unemployment in the economy, according to a

standard Phillips curve mechanism:



                           c        c                   c         c            f
(17) (w+1w)=a(p -p1)+(l-a) (tPt+1-Pt)+(L/L)

where L represents the inelastically supplied full-employment stock

of labor. The parameter a in (17) determines how much weight is given

to backward-looking versus forward-looking price expectations.

       As already noted, we allow for differences in the wage dynamics

of the different regions. In Japan, we specify that wages are set one
                                                      20

 period ahead at their expected market clearing levels. Thus, let

 (w+1) be the wage expected to clear the labor market at time t+l,

 in the sense that tt+l L. Then:



 (18)            wJ         =     J    f
                      t+l       (w t+l

        The rest of the model can be quickly stated. Prices in the U.S.

 (and the other OECD regions) are fully flexible within each period, so

that demand for U.S. output (domestic demand plus export           demand)

equals output supply. Money demand equations are specified for each

OECD region in a standard Goldfeld-type transactions demand equation.

Asset markets are assumed to be perfectly integrated across the OECD

regions. Expected returns of loans denominated in the currencies of

the various regions are equalized period to period,        according to the

following interest arbitrage relations:



(21)       i1
             t
                      i3t +
                                t(er.)
                                  jt+l     -   e1.
                                                 jt
Thus, we do not allow for risk premia on the assets of alternative
currencies. We choose the assumption of perfect capital mobility and

zero risk premia in light of the failure of the empirical exchange

rate literature to demonstrate the existence of stable risk premia

across international currencies.

        For the U.S., Canada, Japan, ROECD, and OPEC, the current account

is determined under the assumption that domestic agents have          free

unrationed access to international borrowing and lending at the
                                       21

international interest rate.    It is assumed for simplicity that all

international borrowing and lending takes place in dollar denominated

assets. For the LDCs, in distinction, the scale of borrowing is set

exogenously, under the assumption that the amount of loans available

to the LDCs is rationed by country risk considerations. One of the

experiments that we study later is an exogenous shift in the amount of

lending made available to the LDCs.

     The model is parametrized using estimates of behavioral and

technological parameters from the econometrics literature.       Thus,

elasticities of demand for home and foreign goods, the elasticities of

demand for money balances, the factor shares in the production

function, etc., are taken from other studies.            The only real

calibration that takes place using actual data is in the trade bloc,

where the free parameters of the utility function are selected to

reproduce the patterns of trade among the various industrial regions

as of 1986.     Thus, by choice of utility function parameters, the

baseline of the model exactly reproduces the direction of trade among

the various regions in the first half of 1986. Choosing 1986 as the

basis for linearization is of course a bit problematic for simulations

of the 1981-86 period, but we chose to use the 1986 base to give a

better picture here of the current policy multipliers.



III. Simulation results for monetary and fiscal policies



    We now employ the model to try to understand the reasons for the

shifts in global trade and financial imbalances in recent years, and
                                        22

to understand better the nature of the international transmission of

macroeconomic policies.     We begin with standard simulations of the

effects of monetary and fiscal policy, and then turn to the policy

changes of the period 1980-85.



     A. Fiscal policy in the U.S. and Japan



     Various simulation results for fiscal policies are shown in the

next few tables.      Before discussing these results, however,   it is

important to understand the precise experiment that is            being
undertaken.      In line with rational expectations modelling,    policy

experiments must define an entire future path of policies, and not

just a change in during the simulation period. In the case of fiscal

policy, it is important that tax and spending policies be consistent

with the intertemporal budget constraint of the     public sector.   In

particular, starting from any initial stock of        public debt, the
discounted value of current and future taxes must equal the discounted

value of government spending plus the initial value of outstanding

public debt.

     In our case, a permanent fiscal expansion, as shown in Table 4,

is treated in the following way. The basic experiment is a sustained

rise in   government spending (later we consider a cut in taxes).

Government final expenditure rises permanently by 1 percent of

potential GDP.     Initially, the tax schedule remains unchanged, with

taxes increasing only to the extent that the fiscal expansion raises

output and thereby induces an endogenous tax increase (in other words,

 the cyclically adjusted budget deficit rises by one percent of GDP,

 the full amount of the spending increase). The actual fiscal deficit

rises by about 0.85 of 1 percent of GD? following the 1 percent of GD?

rise in government spending, because of the induced increase in taxes

of 0.15 percent of GDP.       The deficit is financed entirely by the

issuance of public debt, with the money stock held constant.

       If the tax schedule were not subsequently altered, the stock of

public debt would eventually rise without bound, at an explosive

geometric rate.     To prevent this, we assume that labor income taxes

are increased each year by enough to cover the increasing interest

costs on the rising stock of public debt.            Letting B0 be the pre
expansion stock of debt, the tax rule is therefore:



(22)
         Tt
              T + rL (W/P L) + TK [Q - (W/P)   L -          N] + T



Here, TL is the average tax rate on labor income, and                is the

average tax rate (corporate and personal) on capital income. T5 is a

shift term in the tax shedule that rises along with the increase in

interest payments on the public debt, rB -               It is assumed that
                                               r0B0.
       falls entirely on labor income (this assumption is made for

convenience only, and will be modified in a later version of the

model). T is an exogenous tax shift parameter.

       In this way, the overall deficit remains fairly constant at about

1 percent of GNP following a rise in government spending (it
fluctuates slightly due to fluctuations in real economic activity).

The primary deficit (government spending net of interest payments,
                                        24

minus total taxes), given as     (G -    T)   ,   eventually turns to a
surplus, as is necessary to prevent an explosive growth in debt.

Since the level of debt eventually stabilizes given the way that we

have conducted this experiment, while the real economy grows at its

potential rate of 4 percent in the long run, the debt to GNP ratio in

fact eventually falls to zero after an initial increase following the

rise in government spending.

     Consider now the effects of a permanent rise in U.S. government

spending shown in Table 4. All variables are expressed as deviations

from an initial baseline.       Output is recorded as a percentage

deviation from the initial baseline, while consumption, investment,

exports, imports, and the trade balance are all reported as deviations

from the baseline in percent of potential GDP.    Thus, in 1986, private

consumption falls relative to the baseline by 0.22 of one percent of

U.S. GDP. Labor input (total manhours in the economy), is measured as

a percentage deviation from the baseline.         Inflation and interest

rates are measured as percentage point deviations from the baseline.

Thus, inflation in the first year of the fiscal expansion falls by 0.04

percentage points, while short term interest rates increase by 0.86

percentage points.    The three bilateral real exchange rates are

reported as    percent changes from baseline values.       Note that a

negative value for the exchange rate indicates an atrnreciation of the

dollar, since the exchange rates are measured as dollars per unit of

foreign exchange.

     How do the simulation results compare with our expectations from

the simple Mundell-Fleming model of policy transmission under flexible
                                          25

exchange rates? According to the standard model, we should expect a

bond-financed fiscal      expansion,    in the presence      of perfect
substitutability of home and foreign financial assets, to result in a

rise in domestic income, an appreciation of the exchange rate, a rise

in short and long term interest rates, and a worsening of the trade

balance.     Tobin's q might rise or fall.      On the one hand higher

interest rates will tend to depress q, while on the other hand, higher

output (and greater profits) will tend to raise q, with the overall

effect being ambiguous. We see from Table 4 that the model behaves in

line with these expectations.    Output rises, though with a multiplier

considerably less than 1.     The dollar appreciates in real terms by

3.85 percent vis-a-vis the ECU, 4.20 percent vis-a-vis the yen, and

2.66 percent vis-a-vis the Canadian dollar. Short-term interest rates

rise by 0.86 percentage points, and long-term rates rise by 0.59

percentage points. The trade balance deteriorates by 0.34 percent of

potential GDP in the first year, and that deterioration persists for

the next several years.     Note that Tobin's q in fact falls, by 3.15

percent.     Investment nonetheless does not fall in the first year of

the fiscal expansion because of the accelerator effect (which operates

in addition to q) while investment is depressed relative to baseline

in the later years.

     Let us next turn to the international transmission effects.

Importantly, the Mundell-Fleming model, when extended to allow for

endogenous    wages and prices,        teaches that   the   international

transmission effect of a fiscal expansion on foreign output is

ambiguous. On the one hand, the U.S. expansion raises world interest
                                            26

rates, which tends to depress investment abroad. On the other hand,

the expansion causes an appreciation of the dollar, which tends to

raise net exports abroad.          Europe, Japan, and Canada benefit from a

trade boom, but suffer a drop in domestic investment. The net effect

on output is therefore ambiguous, despite a tendency of many
commentators to assume that foreign fiscal expansions are necessary

stimulative of the domestic economy.

     As described in Bruno and Sachs (1985, Chapter 5), and in Oudiz

and Sachs (1984), the transmission is more likely to be negative if

foreign wages and prices rise rapidly in response to the depreciation

of the foreign currencies vis-a-vis the dollar.         If foreign nominal

wages are perfectly fixed, as in the original Mundell-Fleming model,

then the U.S. fiscal expansion must raise output abroad. The simple

version of the Mundell-Fleming model is probably the source of the

misconception that            fiscal expansions are always transmitted

positively.

     As can be seen in Table 4, for Japan and the rest of the OECD,

the transmission is positive in the first year, but then negative in
              4
later years       .   Note that net exports indeed expand everywhere abroad

as expected, but that both foreign consumption and investment tend to

get crowded out by the U.S. expansion. The negative effect on foreign

consumption derives from the adverse effect of the fiscal expansion on

the value of foreign Tobin's q.         As q falls   abroad, not only does

investment decline, but so too does consumption,         due to a negative



4. Only for Canada, whose results are not shown in the tables,is there
an uninterrupted positive transmission from the U.S..
                                            27

wealth effect.         Since Canada is so dependent on U.S.      trade, the

expansionary trade effects dominate the contractionary effects on C

and I.       In the ROECD and Japan, however, the negative       effects on

domestic spending dominate the export stimulus.

        Table 5 records the dynamic adjustments to a permanent fiscal

expansion in Japan.        Note that by the assumption of wage setting in

Japan, the rise in Japanese employment following the fiscal expansion

can last just one period.          By the second period, Japanese wages
exactly enough to restore exact full employment in the labor market.

As in the U.S., the Japanese fiscal expansion raises output, depresses

Tobin's q at home and abroad, appreciates the Yen vis-a-vis the other

currencies, and worsens the Japanese trade balance.           Indeed,   the

adverse effect on the trade balance is even larger than in the U.S. as

a percent of own GDP, with the trade balance falling by 0.63 percent

of GDP.

        The Japanese fiscal expansion has a contractionary effect on the

U.S. economy after the first year.        Inflation rises, and output goes

down.     It is true that the trade balance improves, but by a miniscule

$3-4 billion (    in   1987 $ US) for each 1 percent of GNP Japanese fiscal

expansion.     This improvement in the trade balance is more than crowded

out by a drop in investment and consumption.          Many observers have

stressed the     need for a Japanese fiscal expansion to help stabilize

growth in the U.S. Table 5 should give them pause.

    The result that a Japanese fiscal expansion appreciates the Yen

and causes a very large trade deficit may be surprising to Japanese

observers whose assessments of policy were formed during the pre-1980

period of low international capital mobility and strong capital
controls.     As a counterfactual experiment it is useful to consider a

permanent Japanese fiscal expansion under the assumption of complete

immobility of capital, as an approximation to the Japanese policy

enviromnent before the liberalization of portfolio investment flows in

1980.      The results are shown in Table 6.   The importance of capital

mobility to the earlier results is immediately evident. With capital

immobility, the fiscal expansion crowds out a much large share of

investment and consumption, rather than net exports. Japanese short

term interest rates rise by 1.28 percentage points, much more that

the rise of 0.38 percentage points observed in Table 5. The Yen now

depreciates after the first year, as it required to maintain current

account balance in the      face of a fiscal expansion.   The results of

Table 6 will be noted again when we consider the sources of the trade

imbalances in the 1980s. The large Japanese trade surpluses of recent

years would have been virtually impossible without the liberalization

of Japanese capital outflows in the 1980.



        B. Monetary Policy in the U.S. and Japan



        As with fiscal policy, the international transmission of monetary

policy to foreign output has a theoretically ambiguous sign.           A

domestic monetary expansion almost surely raises home output
temporarily, but it may raise or lower output abroad, depending on the

strength of two competing channels.       On the one hand, the monetary

expansion tends to depreciate the domestic currency, thus shifting

demand away from foreign goods and towards home goods. On the other

hand, the monetary expansion lowers real interest rates and raises

Tobin's q abroad as well as at home, and thereby spurs investment and

consumption spending.      In the simple Mundell-Fleming model with

nominal wage rigidity, the (adverse) exchange rate effect dominates,

so that foreign output falls when the home country expands the money

supply.      In more general models, with more flexible wages, the

direction of effect can readily be reversed.

     Monetary policy also has an ambiguous effect on the domestic

trade and current account balances.     Higher domestic money improves

international competitiveness by depreciating the exchange rate.
Assuming that the usual Marshall-Lerner conditions hold (as is true in

MSG2),    the exchange rate effect tends to raise output, national

savings, and the trade and current account balances.     On the other

hand, the fall in real interest rates and the rise in Tobin's q tend

to spur investment demand, thereby worsening the current account and

trade balances. Since both savings and investment tend to rise, the

effect on the balance of savings minus investment (i.e., the external

balance) is ambiguous theoretically.

     Let us now examine these issues in the model.    Table 7 reports

the results of a permanent increase in the U.S. nominal money stock of

1 percent.    The monetary expansion in the U.S. causes output to rise

by 0.73 percent in the first year, and causes the nominal exchange

rate vis-a-vis the Yen to depreciate by 1.33 percent on impact while

the real exchange rate depreciates by 1.06 percent.    U.S. inflation

increases by 0.28       percentage points in the first year, and 0.20

percentage points in the second. Note that there is far more inflation

per unit of output increase than was found with the fiscal expansion

in Table 4.      A 2.7 percent of GDP increase in G raises U.S. CD? by

1.0 percent in the first year, and lowers inflation by 0.11 percentage

points. A 1.37 percent monetary expansion also raises first period

output by 1 percent, but raises       inflation by 0.38 percent.    The

differential effects on inflation of monetary and fiscal policy of

course result from their opposite effects on the dollar exchange rate:

fiscal policy induces a currency appreciation, which reduces import

prices, while monetary policy      induces a depreciation, which raises

import prices.

     Remarkably, there is almost no effect of the dollar expansion on

the U.S. trade balance, or on output and the trade balances in the

other regions.       This is a striking, and seemingly robust result of

this model: monetary policy can be pursued by each region
independently, without spillovers on the trade balance or level of

economic activity in other regions.      The reason for the absence of

spillovers has already been noted.      Monetary expansion in the U.S.

depreciates the dollar, which tends to reduce aggregate demand abroad,

but it also lowers real interest rates abroad (and raises Tobin's q),

thereby spurring aggregate demand abroad.     Morover, while the dollar

depreciation spurs U.S. exports, the fall in U.S. real interest rates

spurs U.S. spending and U.S. imports, keeping the trade balance almost

exactly unchanged.

    As can be seen from Table 8, the results on U.S. monetary policy

also apply to a Japanese monetary expansion. Once again, the monetary
                                         31

expansion raises output, depreciates the currency,         lowers real

interest rates, and has little effect on the trade balance or the rest

of the world.     Because of the rapid labor market clearing in the case

of Japan, the domestic effects of the monetary expansion on the real

economy are dissipated by the second period.         According to these

results, the U.S. stands to benefit little or lose little from an

easier monetary policy in Japan (or in the ROECD).



     C. Policy mix effects and miscellaneous simulations



     The simulation experiments in parts A and B of this section

are often not the most useful way to consider fiscal or monetary

policy changes.     In present discussions in the United States, for

example, it is widely recognized that cuts in the deficit will make it

possible (and desirable) for the Fed to easy monetary policy.         A

plausible policy goal might be to tighten fiscal policy and ease
monetary policies in tandem in order to hold employment constant.

Tables 9 and 10 in this section report the results of such a policy

mix in the United States and Japan.

     Since the model is linear, the effects of a policy mix are simply

the sum of the effects of the underlying component policies. However,

modelling an employment-neutral fiscal expansion cum monetary
contraction is not quite as easy as combining the results of Tables 4

and 7, or Tables 5 and 8.    The reason is that with a permanent change

in government spending, the whole path of monetary policy must be

altered in order to stabilize employment. Of course, the maintained
                                        32

assumption is that from the beginning of the policy shift, the

economic agents take into account the change in the entire path of the

future money supply in making their production, spending, and
portfolio decisions.

     Comparing Tables 4 and 9, and Tables 5 and 10, we have the

intuitive result that a fiscal expansion with monetary offset leads to

a larger appreciation of the currency, a greater rise in long term

interest    rates and a greater crowding out of consumption        and

investment, than does a fiscal expansion alone.      The trade balance

effect of the fiscal expansion is basically the same whether or not

the monetary authorities lean against the expansion.        This is a
reflection of the earlier finding that monetary policy changes have

little effect on the trade balance.

     Before proceeding to the analysis of the policy shifts in the

early 1980s, it is useful to study two more cases. First, we consider

in Table 11 the implications of an exogenous decline in the
availability of financing for the non-oil LDCs.      When country risk

considerations lead to a drying up of new capital for the LDCs, as

occurred in 1982, the current account position of the LDCs must

force improve. Table 11 shows the effects of a sustained 10-year drop

in new financing equal to 1 percent of U.S. potential GDP. For each

OECD region, the effect of this shock is like a contraction of bond-

financed fiscal spending in the rest of the world.

    Thus, the effect on the U.S. of the cut in financing for the LDCs

is akin to a reduction in government spending in Japan (the effects of

a fiscal reduction in Japan can be read from Table 5, simply by
Table 9.

reversing the signs of all variables).        U.S. interest rates go down,

the trade balance deteriorates, and U.S. investment and consumption

are "crowded in", while net exports are "crowded out".         Indeed the

cutoff in lending to the LDCs is even more contractionary to the U.S.

than an equal-sized reduction in Japanese government spending, since

the LDCs have a higher marginal propensity to spend on U.S. goods than

does the Japanese government.

       One argument sometimes made concerning the rise of the dollar in

the early l98Os is that the cutoff in finance to the LDCs induced a

net capital inflow into the U.S. that caused a large dollar

appreciation.    This argument is fallacious, as shown by the results of

the simulation. The cuttoff in lending induced a reversal of capital

outflows from the OECD as a whole to the LDCs, but there is no reason

why such a cutoff should be of first-order importance for exchange

rates within the OECD.      Nor is it important that most of the LDC

lending     was coming from U.S. banks, if in fact the OECD capital

markets are indeed highly integrated.         As we see from the Table, a

cuttoff of      lending of 1 percent of U.S. GDP induces a dollar
appreciation of a mere 1 to 2 percent.          The cuttoff that actually

occurred was on the     order of 1.4 percent of U.S. GDP, so that the

resulting dollar appreciation from this effect was probably under 3

percent.

     We are now ready to ask whether the model can help us to
understand the sources of the trade and international financial

patterns noted at the beginning of the paper: the large U.S. trade

deficits and Japanese trade surpluses, the sharp appreciation of the

dollar during 1981-85, the rise in real interest rates, and the

subsequent sharp fall in the dollar beginning in 1985 and accelerating

in 1986.    We divide the analysis in two stages, 1980-85, and 1986

onward (with forecasts until 1992). This division marks off two policy

phases in both the U.S. and Japan. During the first period, the U.S.

fiscal deficit widened significantly, while in Japan there was a

steady reduction in the structural deficit. In the second period, the

U.S. deficit is projected to decline, while the Japanese deficit is

expected to stabilize, or even increase slightly.

     In approaching the simulation exercise, we are more ambitious in

some ways and less ambitious in others than other simulation studies

that have been made.    On the one hand, we go far beyond the common

partial equilibrium approach of tracking trade balance developments

for exogenously given paths of growth, exchange rates, etc. (for
approaches along these lines, see for example Richardson (1987) of the

OECD, and the Brookings Project summarized by Bryant and Holtham

(1987)). We seek to explain the movements in growth, exchange rates,

and so on, according to more fundamental shifts in policies.

    On the less ambitious side, we do not propose at this point to

track the year-to-year historical experience during 1981 to 1985, but

rather to examine the overall changes between 1980 and 1985.      Our

reason for this more modest approach relates in part to the nature of
                                        35

rational expectations modelling.    In order to understand year-to-year

changes, it is necessary to model the expectations of future policies

as of each year.    This is a worthwhile exercise, but is beyond the

scope of the present paper. Also, in modelling year-to-year changes,

the timing of particular policy actions also become extremely
important: when does a tax cut go into effect?; what is "old" versus

"new" capital investment from the point of a corporate tax change?;

what are the short-run lags on monetary policy? A third reason for

avoiding a year-to-year analysis is the added difficulty of modelling

the recession of 1981-82, which came in the wake of the anti-inflation

policies of the OECD monetary authorities.      By comparing 1980 and
1985, we can abstract from cyclical movements in economic activity.

It is a separate, and interesting question as to whether the model

could in fact track the recession period, but one that we leave for a

later date.



     A. The period 1980-85



     Our strategy is to consider the shifts in the trade balance,

exchange rates, etc.,   as resulting from five distinct factors, and to

see whether the combined effect of these changes can explain the

observed phenomena. The five shifts are as follows (see Table 2):



     -   A rise in the U.S. structural deficit of approximately 4.4

percent of U.S. GNP;
                                       36

     -    A reduction in the Japanese structural budget deficit of

approximately 3.4 percent of GNP;

     -     An    increase in the structural deficit in Canada of
approximately 2.2 percent of GNP, and an increase in the structural

budget surplus in the ROECD of approximately 0.5 percent of GNP;

     -   An exogenous reduction in the net flow of new borrowing (i.e.

the current account deficit) of the LDCs in the magnitude of 1.4

percent of U.S. GNP;

     -   An assumed offset of monetary policy in Canada, Japan, the

United States and the rest of the OECD to maintain an unchanged level

of employment.

     The combined effect of these changes (as a deviation from a

baseline) is shown in Table 12, where we see that the effect of the

package is that the dollar     appreciates sharply and the U.S. trade

balance worsens significantly as a percent of GNP. In Table 13, we

compare the predicted effects on the trade balance, dollar exchange

rate, and the short-term real interest rate with the actual effects

observed in comparing the 1978- 80 with the year 1985. As noted

earlier, the model does quite well in explaining the shifts in the U.S.

and Japanese trade balances and the Yen-dollar exchange rate. It does

much more poorly with the ROECD. In Table 14, we apportion the overall

predicted shift in the U.S. trade balance and real bilateral exchange



5. The current account balance of the non-oil LDCs was as follows (as
percent of U.S. CNP in parentheses): 1978, $33.2b (1.5); 1979, $49.7b
(2.0); 1980, 74.4b (2.8); and 1985 28.7b (0.7). The average deficit
during 1978-80 was 2.1 percent of U.S. GNP, so that the shift from
1978-80 to 1985 was on the order of 1.4 percent of U.S. GNP.

rates to the various underlying disturbances.   Not surprisingly, the

largest factor in explaining the U.S. and Japanese trade balance

changes is the fiscal policy in the own country.         Cross-country

effects play a small role for the U.S., though a fairly important role

for Japan. In both cases, the cutoff in lending to LDC's accounts for

about 20 percent of the trade balance shift in the evolution each

country's trade imbalances.

     There are several puzzles not explained by the simulation model.

Most importantly, while the model tracks the appreciation of the

dollar vis-a-vis the Yen during the period, it fails to track the

larger appreciation of the dollar vis-of-vis the ROECD. We fear that

part of the problem here is one of aggregation. The ROECD is a varied

mix of countries with a quite varied mix of policies during this

period.   At the center of the ROECD we have West Germany, which

pursued highly contractionary fiscal policies (see Table 2), and thus

should be expected to have a large real depreciation vis-a-vis the

dollar, as in fact occurred. On the other hand, most of the little

OECD countries included in ROECD pursued mildly expansionary fiscal

policies, and thus should not have experienced as large a real

depreciation vis-a-vis the dollar as in fact occurred.     The dollar

rate vis-a-vis the overall ROECD however, seems to behave more in line

with what would be predicted from German fiscal policy, rather than

overall ROECD policy.   This might be explained by the fact that many

non-German ROECD countries peg their currencies to the Deutsche mark,

and by the fact that much of the non-German ROECD has relatively
                                          38

closed capital markets (in which case a fiscal expansion leads to a

depreciation).

     One of the ironies in the 1980-85 period is that Japan
liberalized its capital account in 1980 just as it started to tighten

fiscal policy, and just as the United States started to run large

budget deficits.      Without the capital market liberalization, Japan

would not have generated such enormous trade surpluses in response to

the fiscal shifts in the United States and Japan, because the Yen

would have appreciated in response to the trade surpluses.

Presumably, the political pressures now being felt by Japan would
thereby have been largely avoided.

     To examine this conclusion, the package of fiscal and financial

changes just discussed can be simulated under the counterfactual

assumption of zero international capital mobility in Japan, as is done

in Table 15.      With zero capital mobility and freely floating exchange

rates in       Japan, the Japanese economy must be in current account

equilibrium at all times. We see from Table 15 that if Japan had not

liberalized its capital account, the result would have been a smaller

Yen depreciation in the period, and a much smaller trade surplus. The

surplus would have risen by 1.26 percent of GDP, instead of the

2.88 percent reported in Table 12, and the 3.2 percent that actually

occurred.

    Note, also, the effects on the U.S.         Without the benefit of

Japanese savings, the U.S. interest rates (both short and long term)

would naturally have been higher, and investment would have been

reduced, but the effect found by the simulation is smaller than is

often supposed. The reason is that Japan provides only a modest share

of OECD savings, despite the fact that Japan's current account surplus

is by far the largest in the OECD. Under the maintained assumption of

this model that flj]. OECD savings are potentially available for

international capital flows, the contribution from Japan is simply not

overwhelming. To the extent that the bilateral trade surplus of Japan

is reduced, the trade surpluses of Canada and the ROECD are increased.

 As the financial counterpart, of course, the U.S. gets more of its net

international investment flows from the other two areas. It is possible

that this simulation result understates the              consequences of

eliminating Japan's capital outflows, if on average Japan allows more

international capital outflow than do the other countries in the OECD.

To the extent that much of the ROECD is cut off from world capital

markets (as is true of France, Italy, and much of Scandinavia), then

Japanese savings would represent a larger fraction of the pool of total

savings available to finance U.S.       current account deficits, even

though Japanese savings represent a modest fraction of total OECD

savings.

     There is other direct evidence in support of the proposition that

fiscal policies, rather than an investment boom, lie behind the U.S.

trade deficits in recent years.   Table 16 shows the evolution of the

private savings and investment rates in the United States during

1980-85.   As predicted by the model,        the rise in the U.S. current

account deficit is accounted for by the deterioration in the budget

deficit, rather than a    rise in the investment rate. There       is no

evidence in the data for the proposition that households in the U.S.
                                         40

have raised their private savings in anticipation of higher future

taxes resulting from the large current U.S. budget deficits.



        B. The period 1986-1992



        Since 1985, there have been some significant changes in the

economic outlook, as well as large swings in exchange rates.       Most

importantly,     there are increased prospects for a significant
improvement in the U.S. fiscal situation.          Those prospects are

reflected in the legislative commitment in the Crarnm-Rudman-Hollings

(hereafter, GRE) law to a balanced budget by 1992. The questions in

this section are twofold. First, can the shift in the fiscal outlook

account for the dramatic decline in the dollar since mid-1985?

Second, would implementation of the GRIt targets be sufficient to

restore trade balance in the United States?

        The real depreciation of the dollar between 1985 and 1986 was

shown in Table 3.        For the cases of the European currencies, the

dollar decline began in early 1985, and has continued apace since

then.     For the Yen, most of the dollar decline has occurred since the

Plaza meeting of finance ministers of the G-5 in September 1985.

There are at least three interpretations of the recent exchange rate


6. Recently Robert Barro has suggested that the decline in U.S.
national savings may be overstated since household purchases of
consumer durables, which have risen as a share of GNP in the U.S.,
should be classified as investment spending rather than consumption
spending. Even when that correction is made, however, the decline in
the overall U.S. national savings rate and slight change in the U.S.
investment rate is still found in the data. See Poterba and Summers
(1986) for evidence on this point.

movements.    The first is that the decline has come from a shift in

macroeconomic policies, both current and anticipated.     The second is

that decline reflected a bursting of a speculative bubble that had

been building since 1981. The third is that private portfolio holders

have begun to demand a larger risk premium for holding dollar assets,

following a saturation of private portfolios with dollar claims in

recent years.      If the third interpretation is correct, the shift in

required risk premium must have been unanticipated to explain the fact

that the dollar first rose sharply then fell.

      Unfortunately, the simplest interpretation, of a pure policy
shift, is hard to reconcile with the magnitude of the recent dollar

decline.     In Table 17, we simulate the effects of a 1986 shift in

public expectations about the future course of U.S. budget deficits.

Specifically, we assume that the time path of deficit reductions

called for in GRE is taken as the public's new expectation of U.S.

fiscal policies.        It is further assumed that the Federal Reserve

Board will accomodate      the fiscal contraction with easier monetary

policy, as necessary, in order to stabilize employment.

     The results are interesting for several reasons.       First, the

dollar depreciates, as expected, but only by about 10 percent in real

terms on impact.     The long-term interest rate falls by more than 2

percentage points, though the short-term nominal interest rate rises.

Inflation increases because of the dollar depreciation.   The U.S. is



7. Actually, since the fiscal year 1986 target was already missed by
1986, we look at a modified GRE schedule, which catches up with the
legislative schedule by fiscal year 1988.

forced to give up some of the low-inflation dividend that it enjoyed

during the period of dollar appreciation though the inflation effect is

modest.

     The problem with the second interpretation of the exchange rate,

i.e. a bursting of a speculative bubble, is that the dollar
appreciation during 1981-85 seems to be well explained, at least vis-

a-vis the Yen, by the fiscal policy shifts studied earlier. There was

some evidence of a speculative excess in the appreciation of the

dollar vis-a-vis the ROECD currencies, but not against the Yen.

     The third interpretation, of a shifting risk premium, is the most

problematic, and is difficult either to refute or accept. A portfolio

balance effect is surely plausible, but should have been enough to

limit the appreciation of the dollar in the first place, since

portfolio holders could have foreseen the enormous buildup of U.S.

dollar liabilities that would result from the projected U.S. current

account deficits.    It is possible that part of the story of the

exchange rate is that the liberalization of the Japanese capital

market led to a one-time stock shift in demand for dollars during

1981-86, which is now over because Japanese portfolio holders are

saturated with U.S. assets. However, this story does not explain very

well the movements of the dollar-DM rate, since the German capital

market has been open during the past fifteen years.

     Supposing that the recent depreciation of the dollar in fact

reflects a portfolio shift against the dollar, we can introduce that

into the simulation model by assuming that portfolio holders now

demand a positive risk premium to hold dollar assets. In Table 18, we

assume that the risk premium required to hold dollars rises
permanently from zero in 1985 to 3 percentuage points in 1986 and

after. The result is a dollar depreciation of     7 to 10 percent, and

a rise in the U.S. long-term interest rate of 2 percentage points.

Somewhat surprisingly, even a large shift in the risk premium (too

large, no doubt!) seems to produce a modest movement of the dollar,

that does not well explain the 30-40 percent depreciation in 1986.

     Using these results, let us now turn to the second question, the

prospective evolution of the trade deficit of the United States.

Would Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, by itself or together with the portfolio

balance shift, be enough to restore trade balance in the United States

by the early 1990s? The answer is that by itself GRE! is unlikely to

restore trade balance, at least not along a full-employment path for

the U.S. economy. According to the results underlying Table 17, even if

there is a complete elimination of the budget deficit by 1992, the

improvement in the trade balance (at full employment) reaches 1.27

percent of GDP,   leaving a trade deficit on the order of 1.8 percent

of potential GDP (the equivalent of $ 70 b in 1987). Thus, CR11 would

have to be combined with a significant rise in the risk premium on the

dollar, a further shift to budget surpluses, or some other unaccounted

for shifts in savings and investment in the United States to restore

trade balance. A recession might be another way to restore the trade

balance.

     Why is it that a complete elimination of the U.S. budget deficit

would be insufficient by itself to restore trade balance at full

employment?    There are three main reasons.    First, even before the
                                          44

buildup of the U.S. fiscal deficit after 1980, the U.S. was running a

trade deficit on the order of 1 - 1.5 percent of CDP. Second, part of

the worsening in the U.S. trade balance resulted from the cutoff in

LDC financing, an event which is not likely to be reversed in the near

terni.      And   third, about     percent of CDP of the trade deficit

resulted from the contraction of Japanese fiscal policies, which is

also not likely to be reversed entirely (if at all).

         Note finally that the simulation model is emphatic on two major

points. First, monetary policies alone can do little, if anything, to

rectify trade imbalances. Remembering the results in Tables 7 and 8,

monetary policy shifts may depreciate or appreciate currencies, but

will not by themselves contribute to major changes in the external

balance. Second, fiscal or monetary expansions in Japan and the ROECD

will do little or nothing for U.S. economic growth rates. A major

Japanese fiscal expansion would raise world interest rates at the same

time that it spurred U.S. export growth.        The net effect on U.S.

aggregate demand would be small and of uncertain sign.



VI. Conclusions and some possible extensions



     The simulation model reported in this paper was able to account

for most of the observed movements in the trade balances of the U.S.

and Japan during 1980-85 according to shifts in fiscal policies, and

the decline in lending to the developing countries.       The model did

well in tracking the trade balance movements of the U.S. and Japan, as

well as the Yen- dollar rate through 1985. The model does much less
                                         45

well in accounting for the recent decline in the dollar vis-a-vis the

Yen and European currencies. The shift in expectations regarding U.S.

budget deficits seems to be insufficient to account for the decline in

the dollar of       more than 30 percent since 1985.       Other possible

explanations for the     dollar depreciation, such as a rise in the

required risk premium on the dollar, can be examined in the model, but

cannot be explained by the model, especially in view of the maintained

assumption of perfect asset substitutability among the OECD financial

assets.

     The model is deficient in several important ways, so that the

conclusions must allow for a considerable margin of error.        Let us

mention some of the key areas where the model needs strengthening.

First, the private-sector consumption function should be respecified,

to allow for some partial smoothing of labor income and labor-income

taxes.      Second, the ROECD should be dissagregated, most usefully

between areas with and without capital controls.         Third, imperfect

competition in international trade should be introduced explicitly, to

allow for the slow and incomplete passthrough of exchange rate changes

into import and export prices.

     Fourth, and perhaps most important, the assumption of perfect

capital mobility should be reassessed.        It will probably be wise to

allow for some degree of imperfect asset substitutability, even though

the empirical evidence on stable risk premia is virtually non-

existent.    Surely portfolio holders these days must care about the

buildup of dollar denominated claims in their portfolios, even if the

expected returns on dollars and other currencies are equalized.
                                       46

     Fifth, we should pay closer attention to the long-term trend

decline in U.S. productivity growth.   As Krugman and Baldwin (1987)

have stressed, this long-term decline probably helps to explain the

secular decline in the U.S. real exchange rate that is consistent with

U.S. external balance. In our model, there is an implicit assumption

that long-term U.S. balance is consistent with a stable, not

depreciating, real exchange rate.

     Sixth, we should give more attention to the apparent secular

decline in the private Japanese savings rate, which should have

important implications for the Japanese current account deficit in the

next decades.   If in fact the Japanese private savings rate is in

steady decline, as Horika (1986) among others has argued, then the

appearance of unrelenting Japanese external surpluses may be
exaggerated.

     Seventh, and finally,     it will be useful to provide some
disaggregation of the supply side in the U.S. and Japan, particularly

since both economies will soon have to undergo important structural

changes to adapt to the large swing in the exchange rate.         The

Naeyakawa Commission recommendations in Japan, for example, note that

domestic led growth in Japan can best be facilitated through the

deregulation of land, and the liberalization of agricultural trade. A

niultisectoral model of the Japanese economy will be necessary to give

adequate attention to such issues.
