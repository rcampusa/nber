Macroeconomics of Persistent Slumps

                                          ABSTRACT

In modern economies, sharp increases in unemployment from major adverse shocks result in long
periods of abnormal unemployment and low output. This chapter investigates the processes that
account for these persistent slumps. The data are from the economy of the United States, and the
discussion emphasizes the financial crisis of 2008 and the ensuing slump. The framework starts
by discerning driving forces set in motion by the initial shock. These are higher discounts applied
by decision makers (possibly related to a loss of confidence), withdrawal of potential workers
from the labor market, diminished productivity growth, higher markups in product markets, and
spending declines resulting from tighter lending standards at financial institutions. The next step
is to study how driving forces influence general equilibrium, both at the time of the initial shock
and later as its effects persist. Some of the effects propagate the effects of the shock---they
contribute to poor performance even after the driving force itself has subsided. Depletion of the
capital stock is the most important of these propagation mechanisms. I use a medium-frequency
dynamic equilibrium model to gain some notions of the magnitudes of responses and propagation.

              Table 1: Unemployment in the Four Serious Slumps since 1948

   Beginning in 2008, output and employment in the United States dropped well below
its previous growth path. Eight years later, unemployment is back to normal but output
remains below the growth path. Japan has been in a persistent slump for two decades. And
many of the advanced economies of Europe are in slumps, several quite deep. This chapter
reviews the macroeconomics of slumps taking the American experience as a leading example.
   The adverse shock that launches a slump generally triggers a rapid contraction of output
and employment, with a substantial jump in unemployment. This phase—the recession—is
usually brief. It ended in mid-2009 in the recent case. The recovery from the trough often
lasts many years. The slump is the entire period of substandard output and employment
and excess unemployment. In the recent U.S. case, the slump lasted from late 2008 until
around the end of 2014. Dating the end of a slump is challenging, because some of the state
variables accounting for depressed output, notably the capital stock, take many years to
return to normal. Output in 2014 was well below its earlier trend path.
   Persistent slumps did not begin with the one that originated from the financial crisis of
2008. The Great Depression remains much the deepest and longest slump in the American
record since the beginning of national income accounting. Table 1 shows that the persistence
of unemployment was about equally high in the four major slumps that occurred after
the introduction of the household unemployment survey in 1948. Normal unemployment
in the U.S, measured as its average over the period starting in 1948, is 6.0 percent. In
all four slumps, unemployment remained above normal three years following the peak of
unemployment, and in only one slump, the milder one associated with the recession of 1990-
91, did unemployment drop below normal four years after the peak of unemployment.

1     The Slump Following the 2008 Financial Crisis
This section provides the factual foundation for the chapter by describing events in the
U.S. economy around the time of the 2008 crisis, through to 2014. I provide plots of key
macroeconomic variables with brief discussions. The rest of the chapter considers the ideas
and models that seem most relevant to understanding those events.
    Figure 1 shows that real GDP fell dramatically right after the crisis and remained below
its prior growth path even six years after the crisis. Plainly the crisis had a persistent effect
on the total output of goods and services. Figure 2 shows that real consumption expenditures
behaved similarly to real GDP, with no sign of regaining its earlier growth path over the
period following the 2008 crisis. Figure 3 shows persistent shortfalls from the growth path of
employment. Figure 4 shows that unemployment rose to a high level and returned to its long-
run average of 5.8 percent at the end of 2014, six years after the crisis. The unemployment
rate is the only major macroeconomic indicator that returned to normal within the six-year
period considered here. Figure 5 shows that the labor force shrank after the crisis, relative
to the working-age population, and that no recovery of the labor force occurred during the
recovery. Figure 6 shows that average real compensation per household, which had grown
briskly through 2000, flattened before the crisis, fell sharply just after the crisis, and only
regained its previous level in 2014. Figure 7 shows that the business capital stock—in the
sense of an index of capital services available to private businesses—grew much less rapidly
than normal immediately after the crisis. Its growth rate returned closer to normal, but
left a considerable shortfall in capital relative to trend, as of 2014. Figure 8 shows that
private business total factor productivity grew rapidly from 1989 through 2006. A dip in
productivity began in 2007. Though productivity grew at normal rates during the recovery,
it did not make up for the cumulative decline just after the crisis. Figure 9 shows the index
of the share of the total income generated in the U.S. economy that accrues to workers,
including fringe benefits. It tends to have a high level in recession years, to fall during the

first half of the ensuing expansion, then rise back to a high level at the next recession. But
superimposed on that pattern is a general decline that cumulates to about 10 percent over
the period. Like the general declining trend in earnings, the decline in the share seems to
have started around 2000.


2     Driving Forces
I use the term driving force to mean either an exogenous variable or an endogenous variable
that is taken as an input to a macro model. An example of the latter case is a rise in
the discount rate for investment and job creation, triggered by a financial crisis. There is
no claim that the discount increase is exogenous. Rather, the hypothesis is that a process
outside the model—say a collapse of house prices—influences the model through a higher
discount rate. The same process outside the model may enter the model through more than
one driving force. For example, the collapse of housing prices may also affect consumption
demand by lowering borrowing opportunities of constrained households.
    Here I provide an informal review of the driving forces that macroeconomics has identified
to account for persistent slumps.

2.1    Labor-force participation
A discovery in recent U.S. experience has been the importance of a major decline in labor-
force participation. In past slumps, participation remained close to unchanged—the economy
has not had a consistent tendency for the labor force to shrink when job-finding became more
difficult. As of 2015, the U.S. labor market had returned to normal tightness, as measured
by job-finding and job-filling rates, yet a large decline in participation starting around 2000
has not reversed. The decline in participation is an important contributor to the divergent
behavior of output and employment, on the one hand, and labor-market tightness, on the
other hand. Judged by the latter, the slump triggered by the financial crisis of 2008 is over,
yet output and employment are far below the paths expected just prior to the crisis.
   Movements in participation not directly tied to labor-market tightness need to be added
to the list of phenomena associated with episodic slumps. Even if a major shock did not
cause a subsequent decline in participation, if a decline happens to occur during a slump,
the shortfall in employment and output will be negatively affected.
   Elsby, Hobijn and Şahin (2013) is a recent investigation of the decline in participation.
Autor (2011) describes the disability benefits that may be a contributor to that decline.

2.2    The capital wedge
A key fact in understanding the slump following the financial crisis is the stability of business
earnings. Figure 10 shows the earnings of private business (the operating surplus from the
NIPAs, revenue less non-capital costs) as a ratio to the value of capital (plant, equipment,
software, and other intangibles, from the Fixed Assets account of the NIPAs). Earnings fell
in 2007 from their normal level of just over 20 percent, but recovered most of the way by
2010, when output and employment remained at seriously depressed levels.
   A basic question is why investment fell so much despite the continuing profitability of
business activities. Macroeconomics has gravitated toward an analysis of wedges as ways
of describing what seem to be failures of incentives. The capital wedge is the difference
between the measured return to investment and the financial cost of investment. I take the
latter to be the risk-free real interest rate. The risk premium is one component of the wedge
between the return to business capital and the risk-free interest rate. Other components are
taxes, financial frictions, and liquidity premiums. To measure the total wedge, I calculate
the annual return to capital and subtract the one-year safe interest rate from it. Later, I

               Figure 10: Business Earnings as a Ratio to the Value of Capital

decompose the total wedge into one component, interpreted as an extra discount on risky
capital earnings not explained by finance theory, and a second, interpreted as an extra
premium on safe returns not explained by finance theory.
   The calculation of the return to capital uses the following thought experiment: A firm
purchases one extra unit of investment. It incurs a marginal adjustment cost to install the
investment as capital. During the year, the firm earns incremental gross profit from the
extra unit. At the end of the year, the firm owns the depreciated remainder of the one extra
unit of installed capital. Installed capital has a shadow value measured by Tobin’s q.
   Installation incurs a marginal cost at the beginning of the period of κ(kt /kt−1 − 1). Thus
the shadow value of a unit of installed capital at the beginning of the year is
                                                    
                                             kt

                                            kt−1
units of capital. From its investment of a unit of capital at the beginning of year t together
with the marginal installation cost—with a total cost of qt pk,t —the firm’s nominal return
ratio is the gross profit per unit of capital πt /kt plus the depreciated value of the capital in
year t + 1, all divided by its original investment:
                                                                       

Gross profit includes pre-tax accounting profit, interest payments, and accounting depreci-
ation. In principle, some of proprietors’ income is also a return to capital— non-corporate
business owns significant amounts of capital—but attempts to impute capital income to the
sector result in an obvious shortfall in labor compensation measured as a residual. The
reported revenue of the non-corporate business sector is insufficient to justify its observed
use of human and other capital. Note that business capital as measured in the NIPAs now
includes a wide variety of intangible components in addition to plant and equipment.
   The implied wedge between the return to capital and the risk-free real interest rate rf,t
is the difference between the nominal rate of return to capital and the one-year safe nominal
interest rate:
                                            rk,t − rf,t .                                      (3)

This calculation is on the same conceptual footing as the investment wedge in Chari, Kehoe
and McGrattan (2007), stated as an interest spread. Note that the wedge is in real units—the
rate of inflation drops out in the subtraction.
   Figure 11 shows the values of the business capital wedge for two values of the adjustment
cost parameter κ, calculated from equation (3), combining plant, equipment, and intellectual
property. On the left, κ is taken as zero and on the right, as 2. The former value accords with
the evidence in Hall (2004) and the latter with the consensus of other research on capital
adjustment costs. The value κ = 2 corresponds to a quarterly parameter of 8.
   The two versions agree about the qualitative movements of the wedge since 1990, but
differ substantially in volatility. The wedge was roughly steady or falling somewhat during
the slow recovery from the recession of 1990, rose to a high level in the recession of 2001,
declined in the recovery, and then rose to its highest level after the crisis. The two calculations
agree that the wedge remained at a high level of about 18 percent per year through 2013.
   Hall (2011a) discusses the surprising power of the financial wedge over general economic
activity. The adverse effect of the wedge on capital formation cuts market activity in much
the same way as taxes on consumption or work effort.
   One branch of the recent literature on the propagation of financial collapse into a corre-
sponding collapse of output and employment emphasizes agency frictions in businesses and
financial intermediaries. The simplest model in the case of an intermediary—completely
dominant in this literature though not obviously descriptive of the actual U.S. economy—
grants the intermediary the opportunity to abscond with the investors’ assets. Absconding

takes place if the intermediary’s continuation value falls short of the value of absconding,
taken to be some fraction of the amount stolen from the investors. If the intermediary’s
equity falls on account of a crisis—for example, if mortgage-backed securities suffer a large
capital loss—the investors need to restore the intermediary’s incentive to perform by grant-
ing a larger spread between the lending rate the intermediary earns and the funding rate it
pays to the investors. Hence spreads rise after a financial crisis. This view is consistent with
the actual behavior of the spread between the return to capital and the risk-free rate.
   The same type of agency friction can occur between a non-financial business and its
outside investors. Depletion of the equity in the business will threaten the investors’ capital.
They need to raise the rents earned by the business to increase the continuation values of
the insiders, and again spreads will rise.

2.3    Discounts and confidence
A second branch of the literature linking financial collapse to rising spreads considers widen-
ing risk premiums in crises and ensuing slumps. Cochrane (2011) discusses the high volatility
of the risk premium in the stock market, measured as the discount rate less the risk-free rate.
Lustig and Verdelhan (2012) document the tendency for discounts to rise in slumps.
   A basic property of the stock market is that, when the level of the stock market is low,
relative to a benchmark such as dividends, discounts are higher—see Campbell and Shiller
(1988). Normalized consumption is another reliable predictor of returns. Figure 12 shows
the equity premium for the S&P stock-price index from a regression of annual returns on
those two variables (see Hall (2015) for further discussion and details of its construction).
The risk premium spiked in 2009. Notice that it is not nearly as persistent as the slump
itself—the premium was back to normal well before unemployment fell back to normal and
long before investment recovered.
   Macroeconomics and finance are currently debating the explanation for the high volatility
of discounts. In principle, high discounts arise when the marginal utility of future consump-
tion is high. Generating this outcome in a model is a challenge. Marginal utility would need
to be highly sensitive to consumption to generate observed large movements in discounts

from the modest expected declines in consumption that occur even in severe contractions.
Contractions in consumption appear to be almost completely surprises. If a model implied
that occasional drops in consumption occurred as surprises, and consumption then grew
faster than normal to regain its previous growth path, the discount rate would fall after a
crisis, because marginal utility would be lower in the future.
   Figure 13 shows the history of the growth of real consumption of nondurable goods per
person from 2001 through 2014. The largest decline was in 2009, at 2.5 percent, about
3.5 percent below its normal growth. With a coefficient of marginal utility with respect
to consumption of 2 (elasticity of intertemporal substitution of 0.5), the effect on marginal
utility would be a substantial 7 percent. But this applies to a fully foreseen decline. The
process for consumption change is close to white noise, so the hypothesis of a large negative
expected change seems untenable.
   Bianchi, Ilut and Schneider (2012) propose a mechanism to overcome the problem that
expected increases in marginal utility are inconsistent with the observed behavior of con-
sumption. They disconnect discounts from rational expectations of changes in marginal
utility by invoking ambiguity aversion. Investors form discounts based on their perceptions
of a bad-case realization of marginal utility. During periods when investors have unusually
pessimistic views, discounts are high.

                                             14
   Angeletos, Collard and Dellas (2014) overcome the problem in a related way. Investors
form expectations about the future state of the economy based on biased beliefs about
beliefs of other decision makers. When these second-order beliefs are unusually pessimistic,
investors believe that their own future consumption will be lower and their future marginal
utility higher, and thus apply higher discounts. The authors use the term confidence to refer
to optimism in second-order beliefs.
   In general, if a financial crisis or other salient event causes investors to shift their beliefs
toward higher future marginal utility, discounts will rise. To the extent that the mean of
future marginal utility rises, the safe real rate will increase along with the discounts applied
to risky returns. To harness the mechanism to explain the decline in the safe rate in the
Great Slump along with the rise in the risky discount, the change in the distribution of future
marginal utility needs to lower the mean but raise the expected product of marginal utility
and the payoffs that govern the levels of employment and output.
   The spreads between yields on risky and safe bonds of the same maturity are informative
about variations in discounts. Philippon (2009) argues that the bond spread may be more
informative. Because the difference in the values of a risky bond and a safe bond is sensitive
only to shocks that alter payoffs conditional on default, and default is relatively rare for
bonds, the bond spread encodes information about the rare, serious events that could account
for high discounts on business income and low discounts on safe payoffs. Figure 14 shows
the option-adjusted spread between BBB-rated bonds and Treasurys of the same maturity.
   The spread widened dramatically in 2009, supporting the hypothesis that the perceived
probability of a collapse of business cash flow had increased substantially. But the widening
was transitory. The spread returned to historically normal levels in 2010 and remained there
subsequently. It would take a powerful propagation mechanism for the change in perceptions
to account for the persistent slump after 2010.
   Gilchrist, Sim and Zakrajek (2014a), Figures 2 and 3, show IRFs for a spread shock,
derived from a vector autoregression. These show relatively little persistence in the shock,
but substantial persistence in investment and GDP responses. See also Cúrdia and Woodford
(2015).

and Weiss (2015). A related topic is the role of fluctuations in uncertainty as a driving
force—see Ludvigson, Ma and Ng (2015) for cites and discussion.

2.4    Productivity
A decline in TFP growth was an important factor in the shortfall of output during the
post-crisis U.S. slump. Fernald (2014) makes the case that the productivity slowdown was
unrelated to the crisis. Rather, he argues, it was a slowdown only relative to rapid TFP
growth in the late 1990s and early 2000s, associated with adoption of modern information
technology. The episode illustrates the importance of TFP growth as a driving force of
medium-term fluctuations, even though TFP is not a consistent driver of sharp contractions.

2.5    Product-market wedge
Market power in product markets creates a wedge that has been discussed extensively as a
driving force of fluctuations, mainly in the context of the New Keynesian model. Rotemberg
and Woodford (1999) discuss how sticky product prices result in cyclical fluctuations in
markups—in a slump, prices fall less than costs, so market power rises. In almost any
modern macro model, the market-power wedge has a negative effect on employment and
output. Nekarda and Ramey (2013) question the evidence supporting this view, with respect

                                            16
to shocks apart from productivity. Bils, Klenow and Malin (2014) defend the view, using
new evidence.
    Gilchrist, Schoenle, Sim and Zakrašek (2014b) show that firms facing higher financial
stress after the crisis raised prices (and thus the wedge) relative to other firms, a finding
that supports the idea that the product-market wedge rose in general when overall financial
stress worsened. The likely mechanism is different from the one in Rotemberg and Woodford
(1999)—it is an idea launched in Phelps and Winter (1970). Financially constrained firms
borrow, in effect, by raising prices relative to cost and shedding some of their customer bases.
    Chari et al. (2007) provide a comprehensive discussion of wedges in general. See also
Gourio and Rudanko (2014)

2.6       Household Deleveraging
Survey data also show a belief that lending standards to households tightened, for mortgages,
loans against home equity, and unsecured borrowing (mostly credit cards). Mian and Sufi
(2010) use detailed geographic data to argue that household credit restrictions caused declines
in consumption. Mian and Sufi (2012), Mian, Rao and Sufi (2013), and Dynan (2012)
document the relation between economic activity and household debt. Bhutta (2012) uses
household data to show that families did not repay debt more quickly than usual during
the slump. Rather, they took on less debt as it became more difficult to qualify for loans,
thanks to rising lending standards and declining equity for existing homeowners who prior
to 2008 were using cash-out refinancing and home-equity loans. See also Blundell, Pistaferri
and Preston (2008), Petev, Pistaferri and Eksten (2012), and De Nardi, French and Benson
(2011).


3     Propagation Mechanisms
3.1       Capital
The capital stock is an important source of propagation in slumps, a point that has escaped
analysis in the cycle-around-trend view of fluctuations. Investment falls sharply in slumps,
leaving a depleted capital stock in a slump that lasts several years. Capital depletion also
helps account for the divergent behavior of output and labor-market tightness. See Gilchrist
et al. (2014a) and Gomme, Ravikumar and Rupert (2011).



                                              17
3.2    Unemployment dynamics
In the standard search-and-matching model, calibrated as in Shimer (2005), the unemploy-
ment rate is a fast-moving state variable. With job-finding rates around 50 percent per month
even during slumps, unemployment converges to the stationary level dictated by tightness
and the job-finding rate within a few months. Unemployment dynamics have essentially
nothing to do with the persistence of slumps.
   Some facts about the U.S. labor market call this view into question. Hall (1995) observed
that research on the experiences of workers who lost jobs after gaining substantial tenure
gave a quite different view of unemployment. Davis and von Wachter (2011) summarize more
recent results with the same conclusion and emphasize the discord between the quick recovery
from job loss implicit in the basic search-and-matching model and the actual experience of
workers with three or more years of tenure following job loss. That experience involves
an extended period of low employment—much greater loss than a 50-percent per month
re-employment rate—and years of loss of hourly earnings. Jarosch (2014) confirms this
view. The aggregate implications are that a wave of layoffs from a major shock, such as the
financial crisis, results in an extended period of unemployment and a much longer period
of lower productivity of the higher-tenure workers who lose jobs from the shock. Ravn
and Sterk (2012) develop a model with two kinds of unemployment to capture this type of
heterogeneity among the unemployed.
   Some progress has been made in reconciling high monthly job-finding rates with the low
recovery from high unemployment following a shock. Hyatt and Spletzer (2013) show that
short jobs are remarkably frequent—the distribution of job durations is utterly unlike the
exponential distribution with a constant separation hazard usually assumed in search-and-
matching models. This finding explains the high job-finding rates found in the CPS—there
is a huge amount of churn in the U.S. labor market. Hall and Schulhofer-Wohl (2015) show
that job-finding rates over year-long periods are well below what would be expected from
monthly job-finding rates. The obvious explanation of this finding is that job-seekers often
take interim jobs during much longer spells of mixed unemployment and brief employment.
   Shimer (2008) discusses the labor-market wedge as a convenient summary of the effects
of labor-market frictions.

3.3    The zero lower bound
The policy of every modern central bank is to issue two types of debt: reserves and currency.
The bank pays interest or collects negative interest on reserves. No direct force constrains
the rate on reserves. It is impractical to pay or collect interest on currency. Central banks
keep currency and reserves at par with each other by standing ready to exchange currency
for reserves or reserves for currency in unlimited amounts. If the bank sets a reserve rate
below the negative of the storage cost of currency, owners of reserves will convert them to
higher-yielding currency. A number of European central banks have experimented recently
with increasingly negative reserve rates.
   The lower bound on the real interest rate is the bound on the nominal rate less the
expected rate of inflation. Figure 15 shows three time series relevant for measuring expected
inflation. The top line is the median expected rate of inflation over the coming year for
the Michigan Survey of Consumers. The line starting in 2007 is the median forecast of the
average annual rate of change of the PCE price index over the coming 5 years, in the Survey
of Professional Forecasters of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank. The bottom line is the
breakeven inflation rate in the 5-year TIPSs and nominal 5-year note—the rate of inflation
that equates the nominal yields of the two instruments. See also Fleckenstein, Longstaff and
Lustig (2013) on extracting expected inflation from inflation swaps.
   The three measures agree that essentially nothing happened to expected inflation over
the period of the post-crisis slump. All recorded a drop around the time of the crisis, but

then returned to close to pre-crisis levels despite high unemployment. This finding pretty
much eliminates an idea that permeated macroeconomics over the past 50 years, that slack
more or less automatically results in lower inflation. Some combination of factors in 2008
prevented the collapse of the price level that occurred, for example, in the much deeper
slump following the contraction of 1929 to 1933.
   Had expected inflation declined by the amounts that occurred in the earlier slumps of
the past 50 years, the influence of the zero lower bound on the real interest rate would have
been more severe. And if deflation at the rate experienced in 1929 to 1933 had occurred, a
catastrophe similar to the Great Depression would probably have occurred. Good fortune
kept expected inflation at normal levels and avoided high real interest rates and their likely
adverse effects on output and employment.
   In view of the importance of the inflation rate in determining the real interest rate
corresponding to a zero nominal rate, the complete absence of a model of inflation is a
considerable shortcoming of current macroeconomic thinking. About the best that macro
modeling can do is to take expected inflation as an exogenous constant, currently around
two percent. It is common for macroeconomists to say that “inflation is firmly anchored
at the Fed’s target of two percent” as if that amounted to a model. But it’s not—at best



                                                20
it is an observation that expected inflation has remained at about that level despite large
changes in output, employment, and other macro variables.
   With exogenous, constant inflation, the bound on the nominal interest rate places a
bound on the safe real rate at the nominal bound minus the rate of inflation—minus two
percent in the recent slump if the nominal bound is zero; minus three percent if the nominal
bound is minus one percent.
   Stock and Watson (2010) study the joint behavior of inflation and unemployment with
conclusions similar to those stated here. Ball and Mazumder (2011) argue in favor of the
conventional view that inflation has a stable relation to slack.

3.3.1   Incorporating the zero lower bound in macro models

Hall (2011b) discusses the issues in modeling an economy with a safe real rate fixed above
the value that would clear the output market under normal conditions. In brief, the high
real rate creates the illusion of an opportunity to defer consumption spending when deferral
is actually infeasible. Because of the mispricing of the benefit of saving, consumers create
congestion as they try to save and defer spending. Congestion arises from the same force
that slows traffic on a highway that is underpriced, so more drivers try to use it than its
capacity. As a practical matter, the congestion appears to take the form of low job-finding
rates and abnormally high unemployment.
   Modeling of the congestion resulting from the mispricing of saving is still at a formative
stage. To frame the issue, consider a simple frictionless general-equilibrium macro model
with a unique equilibrium. The model will describe an equilibrium value of the short-term
safe real interest rate. Now implant a central bank in the model with a policy of setting that
rate at a value above the equilibrium value. In particular, suppose that the bank’s interest
rate is elevated by the zero lower bound. What happens in the model? It cannot have an
equilibrium—its only equilibrium is ruled out by assumption. One solution in macro theory
is to disable one equation. Then the model has one less endogenous variable, the interest
rate (made exogenous by the zero lower bound), and one less equation. One example is to
drop a clearing condition for the labor market and to interpret the gap between labor supply
and labor demand as unemployment. When the central bank sets a rate above equilibrium,
labor demand will fall short of labor supply and unemployment will be above its normal
level. This approach has some practical appeal and often gives reasonable answers.



                                              21
   A closely related approach is to place the demand gap in the product market. Krugman
(1998) and Korinek and Simsek (2014) are examples of that approach. Farhi and Werning
(2013) present a general analysis of demand gaps, where any set of prices and wages can be
jointly restricted and gaps can occur in any market.
   The New Keynesian tradition takes a different and more subtle approach to this issue by
adding the price level as another endogenous variable without any corresponding equation.
The model has demand gaps in the product market associated with temporarily sticky prices
that adjust over time to close the gaps. Eggertsson and Krugman (2012) and Christiano,
Eichenbaum and Rebelo (2011) apply the NK model to the zero lower bound issue. One
branch of the NK literature—notably Walsh (2003), Gertler et al. (2008), and, most recently,
Christiano et al. (2016)—uses the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides framework to describe the
labor market, so the only role of demand gaps is in the product market.
   Hall (2016) tackles the congestion issue directly, in the DMP setup. Both the output
and labor markets suffer from congestion when the central bank elevates the real rate above
the market-clearing level. The central bank’s acceptance of deposits at the elevated real
rate creates an outside option in the product-price bargain that creates slack according to
standard DMP principles.
   In general, a model that combines the DMP view of unemployment with a real interest
rate held above its market-clearing level will incorporate an additional variable, analogous to
congestion in the highway case, that changes the DMP unemployment rate and the demand-
gap rate until they are equal. To be concrete about that variable, suppose it is matching
efficiency. A decline in efficiency increases hiring cost, raises the cost of labor, lowers the
demand for labor, and raises demand-gap unemployment. The decline in efficiency lowers
the job-finding rate and raises the DMP unemployment rate. The second effect is robust
in the DMP model and presumably exceeds the effect on demand-gap unemployment. In
equilibrium, unemployment is less than demand-gap unemployment would be at normal
matching efficiency but higher than DMP unemployment would be at normal efficiency. The
model would need to tie matching efficiency to the spread between the bank’s interest rate
and the rate that cleared the output and labor markets. Though this mechanism is attractive
because matching efficiency did fall after the 2008 crisis, I do not have a model embodying
variations in matching efficiency. The model in Hall (2016) is rather more complicated and
invokes DMP principles in both product and labor markets.



                                              22
   If the effect of congestion in the labor market on labor demand is small enough to be
neglected, the gap between labor supply and labor demand controls unemployment. In
this case, the traditional view that ignores DMP-type considerations applies. In that case,
the general-equilibrium model simply omits the DMP-based equations. In the background,
labor-market congestion fluctuates to bring unemployment into line with the level dictated
by product demand. In the model later in this chapter, I take this approach as an interim
solution pending development of fully articulated models of congestion induced by above-
equilibrium real interest rates.
   Michaillat and Saez (2014) build a model of labor- market congestion that differs from the
DMP model in one crucial respect—it lacks a resource decision to control the tightness of the
market. In the DMP model, recruiting effort determines the tightness of the labor market.
Employers expand recruiting effort until the payoff to creating an incremental vacancy equals
the expected recruiting cost. In a simple real business-style macro model with a DMP labor
market, equilibrium is determinate. By contrast, in the model of Michaillat and Saez, the
corresponding basic model is indeterminate. It has a continuum of equilibria indexed by the
real interest rate, with tightness depending on that rate. A monetary intervention that sets
the real interest rate picks out one of those equilibria. Adding that monetary intervention
to the DMP-based model would make it over-determined.
   This discussion presupposes that the central bank can set any path it chooses for the real
interest rate. Friedman (1968) reached the opposite conclusion. In his view, a bank that
tried to keep the real rate below the market-clearing level would cause exploding inflation
(the case that concerned him in 1967), and a policy aiming to keep the real rate above the
market-clearing level presumably would cause exploding deflation. Recent experience does
not bear his prediction out—the lower bound froze the safe real rate at around minus two
percent because expected inflation remained unchanged at around two percent per year. Our
lack of understanding of inflation stands in the way of fully satisfactory modeling of central
bank policies that control the real interest rate.

3.3.2   The zero lower bound and product demand

The zero lower bound, together with low expected inflation, has prevented central banks from
lowering interest rates as much as would seem appropriate. Lower rates should stimulate
output and employment. The Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan have kept rates
slightly positive since the crisis, while the European Central Bank did the same until recently,
when it pushed the rate just slightly negative. All three economies had combinations of
high unemployment and substandard inflation that unambiguously called for lower rates,
according to standard principles of modern monetary economics. Under normal conditions,
fluctuations in product demand are not a source of important fluctuations in output and
employment, because interest rates change as needed to clear those markets. Under almost
any view of purposeful monetary policy, the central bank adjusts its policy rate to in response
to those demand fluctuations. But the zero lower bound is an exception to that principle.
Economies with low inflation rates and low equilibrium real interest rates run the danger of
episodic slumps when the lower bound is binding.
    In the slump that began in 2008, three driving forces for product demand appeared to
be important: rising discounts, tightening lending standards to businesses, and tightening
lending standards to households. All three of these declines may also reflect the rising
importance of another driving force, financial frictions. Other sources could be declining
government purchases and transfers and declining export demand. In the recent slump,
government purchases fell slightly relative to trend, transfers rose dramatically, and exports
fell.

3.3.3   Discounts

As documented elsewhere in this section, discounts applied to future risky cash flows ap-
peared to rise dramatically during and immediately after the financial crisis. Basic principles
of investment theory hold that purchases of new capital goods decline when discounts rise.
In fact, all three major categories of investment fell sharply: (1) business purchases of new
plant, equipment, and intellectual property, (2) residential construction, and (3) autos and
other consumer durables. Eggertsson and Krugman (2012) describe how a rise in discounts
pushes the economy into a regime where the zero lower bound binds.




                                              24
3.3.4    Lending standards to businesses

Survey data show unambiguously that bank officials believe that they tightened lending
standards after the crisis. It remains controversial whether the tightening is an independent
driving force or just a symptom of other adverse forces. Chodorow-Reich (2014), using
data on individual bank-borrower relationships, argues for a separate role for tightening
standards. Tighter standards may also be a driving force for the sharp decline in residential
construction, given the dependence of major house-builders on bank lending.

3.3.5    Lending standards to households

I noted earlier that rising lending standards and declining equity resulted in cutbacks in
consumption because families who had previously financed high consumption levels in part
by taking on more and more debt could no longer qualify for those loans.


4       Fiscal Driving Force and Multiplier
The multiplier is the derivative of total GDP or a component, such as consumption, with
respect to an exogenous shift in product demand. The obvious source of such a shift is
government purchases, but the same multiplier describes the propagation of other shifts in
product demand, notably those induced by changes in household access to credit.
    Ramey (2011a) is a recent survey of the literature on the multiplier, and her chapter in this
volume also treats the subject in detail. See also Coenen, Erceg, Freedman, Furceri, Kumhof,
Lalonde, Laxton, Lind, Mourougane, Muir, Mursula, de Resende, Roberts, Roeger, Snudden,
Trabandt and in’t Veld (2012), Shapiro and Slemrod (2009), Spilimbergo, Symansky and
Schindler (2009), Hall (2009), Barro and Redlick (2011), Parker, Souleles, Johnson and
McClelland (2011), Kaplan and Violante (2014), and Ramey (2011b).


5       Other Issues
5.1     Decline in the labor share
Economists have pursued multiple explanations of the decline, but no consensus has formed.
Rognlie (2015) provides a comprehensive discussion of this topic. See also Karabarbounis
and Neiman (2014).

5.2       Time Use
Some indication about the changing balance between work and other uses of time comes from
the American Time Use Survey, which began in 2003. Table 2 shows the change in weekly
hours between 2003 and 2013 in a variety of activities. For men, the biggest change by far is
the decline of 2.5 hours per week at work, a big drop relative to a normal 40-hour work week.
A small part of the decline is attributable to higher unemployment—the unemployment rate
was 6.0 percent in 2003 and 7.4 percent in 2013. The decline for women is much smaller, at
0.8 hours per week. For both sexes, the big increases were in personal care (including sleep)
and leisure (mainly video-related activities). Essentially no change occurred in time spent in
education. Women cut time spent on housework. See also Aguiar, Hurst and Karabarbounis
(2013).


6     A Model
Many macro-fluctuations models omit slower-moving driving forces and are correspondingly
estimated or calibrated to data filtered to remove slower movements. Growth models gener-
ally omit cyclical and medium-frequency driving forces. A small literature—notably includ-
ing Comin and Gertler (2006)—deals explicitly with medium-frequency driving forces and
corresponding movements of key macro variables. That paper focuses on technology and
productivity. The model developed here considers other medium-frequency driving forces,
such as labor-force participation and discounts. Hall (2005) discusses evidence of the impor-
tance of medium-frequency movements and argues against the suitability of superimposing
a high-frequency business-cycle model on an underlying growth model. Instead, a unified
model appears to be a better approach.




                                             26
    The model is inherently non-stationary–its labor force grows randomly and so does pro-
ductivity. Solution methods widely used for stochastic macro models, either near-exact
solutions using projection methods or approximate solutions based on log-linearization, re-
quire that models be restated in stationary form. I take a different approach. The model
has random driving forces that are functions of a Markov discrete state. Over a finite hori-
zon the model has an event space with a large but finite set of nodes. Models with this
structure are widely used in finance and banking. I find essentially exact solutions for the
contingent values of continuous state variables and other key macro variables at each node.
Finance models, such as the binary option-pricing model, have backward-recursive solutions,
but macro models require solving the entire model as a system of simultaneous equations.
Recursive models are highly sparse, and solution methods that fully exploit the sparsity are
fast.

6.1     Specification
The equations of the model are the familiar first-order conditions for optimization by the
decision makers in the model and laws of motion of the state variables, together with initial
and terminal conditions. The framework does not require that the model be recursive,
though the model here is actually recursive—it can be expressed in equations that consider
only three dates: Now (for example, k), Soon (for example, k 0 ), and Later (for example, k 00 ).
Each value Now branches stochastically into Nt values in the Soon period and Nt2 values in
the Later period. Here Nt is the number of states in the discrete Markov process in period
t. The economy operates for T periods.

The driving forces of the model are:
a: increment to total factor productivity
l: increment to the labor force
dk : discount or confidence with respect to capital
dn : discount or confidence with respect to job creation
df : discount or flight to safety factor with respect to safe one-year returns (found to be
negative, implying a safety premium)
z: product-market wedge arising from market power
g: government purchases of goods and services, serving as a proxy for shifts in product de-

mand arising from forces not considered explicitly in the model



The continuous state variables are:
k: physical capital stock (endogenous)
A: total factor productivity (exogenous)
L: labor force (exogenous)


Endogenous variables that are functions of the state variables are:
y: output
n: employment
c: consumption
q: Tobin’s q, the value of installed capital
r0 : the realized return to holding installed capital from now to later
rf : the safe real interest rate from now to later, known now
m: the stochastic discounter, not including dk , dn , and df
x: the marginal revenue product of labor



6.2     States
An integer-valued state s governs the outcomes of random influences on the economy. It
follows a Markov process:
                                          Prob[s0 |s] = πs,s0 .                         (4)

6.3     Technology
Output at the beginning of a period combines labor and capital services according to a
Cobb-Douglas technology:
                                           y 0 = A0 n1−α k α .                          (5)

Installation of capital incurs quadratic adjustment costs. The marginal cost of adjustment,
q, is
                                                   k0
                                                        
                                      0
                                      q =κ            − 1 + 1.                          (6)

Total factor productivity evolves as

                                           A0 = exp(as0 )A.                             (7)

Here as0 is a state-dependent log-increment to TFP. The law of motion of the capital stock
is
                                   k 0 = (1 − δ)k + y 0 − c0 − g 0 .                    (8)

Here δ is the rate of depreciation of capital.

6.4     Financial markets
The realized rate of return to holding capital is
                                                0
                                           α zy0 k + (1 − δ)q 0
                                   rk0   =                      − 1.                    (9)
                                                     q
Here z is a product-marked wedge. The economy’s normal stochastic discount factor is
                                                0 −1/σ

                                                c
The pricing condition for the return to capital is

                                     E [(1 + rk0 )m0 ] − dk = 1.                       (11)

Here dk is a distortion of the discounter for the return to capital, interpreted as loss of
confidence or increased pessimism, that lowers the perceived present value of the future
payoff to capital.
     The pricing condition for the risk-free rate is

                                    E [(1 + rf )m0 )] − df = 1.                        (12)

Here df is a distortion of the discounter for the safe real return, whose negative value is
interpreted as a liquidity premium or flight to safety premium.

6.5     The zero lower bound
The model does not embody a bound on the short safe interest rate. Rather, it identifies
conditions when the rate is low–generally negative. Times of negative rates are times when
the lower bound would be binding, and the model’s equilibrium would not actually hold. As

                                                    29
noted earlier, macroeconomics has yet to provide a coherent account of equilibrium with a
binding lower bound. All the literature simply assumes that a demand gap implies output
and employment gaps, without further explanation of why economic behavior results in gaps.
The predictions of the demand-gap model may well be correct—the point is that models don’t
meet normal standards of explanation imposed on modeling other economic phenomena. See
Hall (2016) for further discussion of this point.

6.6    Initial and terminal values of the capital stock
The capital stock grows stochastically along with growth in TFP, A, and the labor force, L.
I calculate the initial capital stock and the stock at each terminal node as
                                                       1/(1−α)
                                  ∗        ∗       αA
                                k = (1 − u )L ∗                  .                        (13)
                                                 r +δ
Here u∗ is the normal unemployment rate. The quantity r∗ is the constant discount rate
equivalent to actual stochastic discounting, including the extra discount dk . I pick the value
of r∗ that generates roughly constant growth of capital. If r∗ is below that level, the capital
stock grows more rapidly at first until it reaches the stochastic turnpike path, then shrinks
back to the terminal condition toward the end. The stock sags below its initial level and
grows extra-rapidly at the end of the period if r∗ is too high.

6.7    The labor market
The model incorporates the idea that hiring is a form of investment, as in the Diamond-
Mortensen-Pissarides model of the labor market. As with other forms of investment, the
discount rate influences hiring, as discussed with citations in Hall (2015). The equation also
takes the marginal revenue product of labor as the measure of the benefit of a hire—subject
to variation through changes in market power as in Rotemberg and Woodford (1999), stated
in DMP terms in Walsh (2003).
   DMP employment depends on the present value of the ratio, x0 /x̄0 of the actual future
marginal revenue product of labor to the normal level based on future technology A0 and
current capital k. The numerator is
                                                                 α
                                     0              0        k

and the denominator is                             α
                                      0            k0

6.8     Timing
Timing is easiest to understand in the non-stochastic case, where Nt = 1 for all periods t.
In period 1, capital is at its specified initial value kI . No consumption occurs in period 1. In
period T , capital is at its specified terminal value, kT . No employment occurs. Consumption
cT is an unknown to be determined. Thus there are T − 2 values of capital to be determined,
k2 through kT −1 , and T − 1 values of consumption, c2 through cT . Given candidate values
for these, and the exogenous variables At and Lt , one can calculate corresponding candidate
values of the other variables, yt , qt , rk,t , mt,t+1 , xt , nt , and ut . The T − 1 residuals of the
material balance condition,

7       Application to the U.S. Economy
7.1      States of the economy
The model operates at an annual frequency. I constructed its states by the k-cluster method
with 6 clusters, based on the following variables measured over the period from 1953 through
2014:

    • TFP growth, from Fernald (2012), without utilization adjustment

    • The discount implicit in the S&P stock-market index, measured as the expected real
        return based on the Livingston survey.

    • The annual growth rate of the civilian labor force

    • The unemployment rate

Table 3 shows the discrete states of the model, in terms of the values of the four variables. It
also shows the classification of years by state. Each of the four variables defining the states
has six state-dependent values. In a row in the table, Low refers to the two lowest values
of a variable across the states, Med to the middle two values, and High to the upper two
values. Table 4 shows the state-contingent values of the variables that define the states. The
states are:

    1. Strong economy with low discount, low unemployment, high growth of labor force,
        high productivity growth

    2. Strong economy with medium TFP growth

    3. Mediocre economy with low TFP growth

    4. Mediocre economy with high discount and low TFP growth

    5. Slump with average TFP growth

  6. Slump with high TFP growth

   Table 5 shows the annual transition matrix among the four states together with the
ergodic probabilities of the states. Figure 16 illustrates the persistence of the six states.
It shows the expected value of the unemployment rate starting in each of the six states
and evolving toward the ergodic distribution over a 10-year period. For example, the curve
labeled 6 shows unemployment starting at the state-contingent level for state 6, which is over
8 percent. The rate falls quickly, dropping slightly below its ergodic value before converging
back to that value. In the first few years, the dynamics of these impulse response functions
differ, corresponding to the differences in the rows of the transition matrix. In later years, the
paths are similar, because they are all controlled by the largest eigenvalue of the transition
matrix.
   The model starts in period 1 with initial values of TFP and the labor force both equal
to one. In the base case, the distribution of the state in period 2 is the ergodic distribution.
For four years, the transition matrix governs the succeeding states. In year 5, the economy
has 64 = 1296 possible configurations. For the next ten years, the economy continues to
evolve, but no further random events occur. The exogenous variables—TFP and the labor
force—grow at constant rates equal to the average of the state-contingent rates, weighted
by the ergodic distribution. The model has 1 + 6 + 36 + 216 + 1296 + 10 × 1296 = 14, 515
nodes, each with distinct values of all the variables of the model.

7.2    State-based driving forces
Two of the variables used to define the states are also treated as driving forces in the model.
These are the increments to TFP and the labor force. Another two driving forces are

but this value does not feed back into the rest of the model, so it is not a driving force,
provided no bound on the rate is binding. Table 6 shows the state-contingent values of the
driving forces.
   TFP growth varies substantially across the economy’s states. It is generally higher in
the better, lower-numbered, states, but is highest in state 6. The reason is that most of the

years classified into state 6 are in the later years of slumps, when the economy is recovering.
Historically, recoveries enjoyed high measured TFP growth because of improving utilization
(recall that the model uses Fernald’s TFP measure without his utilization adjustment).
Labor-force growth, a driving force omitted from most models of fluctuations, also shows
substantial variability across states, in a pattern similar to TFP. The capital discount is
high, definitely in excess of almost all measures of the equity premium. The reason is that
it includes factors that cause the return to capital to exceed the payout to owners that are
not normally included in the equity premium. These include corporate taxes and agency
frictions. The capital discount is higher in the favorable, lower-numbered states, again with
the exception of state 6, so it is not much of a contributor to the business cycle. The table
shows the calculated values of the liquidity discount, though it is not actually a driving
force. The negative of the discount is a safety premium, associated with liquidity services
and, in the bad states, a flight to safety. The most negative value of the discount is in the
rare state 5 when the economy is in an unusually bad condition. That fact is important for
the model’s message about the conditions when the zero lower bound on the safe rate will
matter. Finally, the labor discount, calculated from the unemployment rate, naturally tracks
unemployment perfectly, because the other determinant of unemployment in the model, the
product-market wedge, is taken to be the same in all states, for want of a reliable basis for
computing it.
   Two additional driving forces are present in the model, but do not have empirical coun-
terparts. These are the product-market wedge, z, and the variable g, interpreted as a shift
in product demand. The product-market wedge plays a central role in the New Keynesian
model, but measurement has proven controversial. Shifts in product demand resulting from

tightening financial constraints on consumption have played a big role in understanding the
financial crisis of 2008 and its aftermath, but again measurement of the shifts has proven
controversial. The model tracks the effects of z and g, but its base case does not include
their actual movements as driving forces in the economy. They both play important roles in
the application of the model to the crisis of 2008 and the ensuing slump.

7.3    Parameters
Table 7 shows the parameter values used in the model. All are standard except for rk∗ , which
is special to this framework, to ensure that the model’s initial and terminal capital are close
to its turnpike level of capital in relation to TFP and the size of the labor force.

7.4    Equilibrium
An equilibrium of the model is a complete set of values of the variables at every node.
Figure 17 provides some basic information about the equilibrium—it shows the means and
standard deviations of the two exogenous variables, TFP and the size of the labor force, and
two key endogenous variables, consumption and the unemployment rate, in each year. The
distributions are conditional on the state of the economy in the first year. The standard
deviations are calculated across the nodes for each year. Each should be interpreted as the
standard deviation of the corresponding variable, conditional on the state of the economy in


                                                      38
year 1, defined by the initial values of TFP, the labor force, and the capital stock. Because the
capital stock is chosen to start the economy on its (stochastic) turnpike path, the subsequent
values of the variables are distributed symmetrically around the path as time passes. Some
of the variables grow and some have stable distributions around constant means. The upper
left graph shows the distribution of TFP, A, which is close to a random walk. Its mean grows
smoothly and its standard deviation fans out, rising approximately as the square root of the
year number. The size of the labor force, L, shown in the upper right, behaves similarly, but
its growth rate is somewhat higher and its conditional standard deviation is smaller. The
variables in the lower part of Figure 17 are not defined in period 1, but, again, the figures
show the distributions conditional on the state of the economy in period 1. The conditional
standard deviation of consumption, shown in the lower left, evolves by the same square-root
principle as the ones for TFP and the labor force. The unemployment rate, shown in the
lower right, has a stationary distribution along the turnpike path.
   Table 8 compares the volatility of some of the model’s variables to the volatility of the
corresponding data. In the case of variables that share the random-walk character of TFP
and the labor force, the table describes rates of growth. The left column shows the standard
deviations of the variables in the original annual data. The middle column shows the standard
deviation, calculated using the model’s ergodic distribution, of the state-contingent averages
calculated from the original annual data. The right column shows the standard deviations
in year 5 of the equilibrium. Comparison of the middle to the left column shows the success
of the state setup in capturing the volatility of the corresponding variable. By necessity,
the state setup falls short of full success. In most cases, the standard deviation across the
states, weighted by the ergodic distribution, is around half of the actual standard deviation.
Employment, unemployment, output, consumption, and investment do better than half,
while labor-force growth, and the return to capital fall short. Comparison of the right
column to the middle column of Table 8 shows the success of the model in matching its
target, the state-contingent values in the middle. For TFP growth, labor-force growth, the
capital wedge, and the employment wedge, the match is perfect by construction. The match
is reasonably good for the other variables.

7.5    Effects of the driving forces
The popular vector-autoregression framework emphasizes shocks as the starting point for
dynamic macro models. Shocks are uncorrelated with each other contemporaneously and
uncorrelated with all lagged variables. See Valerie Ramey’s chapter in this handbook for a
discussion of these assumptions. The framework of this chapter is different. Each year, a
new value of the underlying state, s, occurs. Its probability distribution is known from the
transition probabilities of the Markov process, but the realization from that distribution is a
shock. The realization determines the new values of the driving forces. These movements are
mutually correlated. Because the model incorporates the hypothesis of rational expectations,
adjusted by the known state-dependent distortions, the model incorporates the notion that
rational actors respond to the surprise elements of current realizations.
   In this framework, it is interesting but challenging to answer questions about the separate
effects of the driving forces. Because those forces are correlated, the variance decomposition
often presented along with a VAR model is not available—potentially large components of
the variance of a given endogenous variable arise from the covariance of a pair of driving
forces, so their distinct contributions are not defined. The position of the VAR modeler, as
Ramey explains, is that shocks must be uncorrelated, because otherwise they would not have

distinct contributions. The approach in this chapter is that driving forces are fundamental
and that their correlation is a matter of measurement, not assumption.
   One way to understand the roles of the driving forces is to consider a set of counterfactual
economies, each with only one driving force. Table 9 shows the results of that exercise. The
top row shows the standard deviations of annual output growth for the base case, with all four
driving forces in action, and for the four counterfactuals, with single driving forces. Table
10 shows the correlation matrix of the driving forces, based on the state-contingent values,
using the ergodic probabilities (the one-period-ahead correlation matrix is state-dependent).
Two correlations stand in the way of even an approximate allocation of explanatory role:
The capital wedge is correlated 0.83 with TFP growth and the labor wedge is correlated
−0.89 with the labor-force growth.
   Table 9 suggests that all four driving forces have important roles in economic fluctuations.
An economy with only TFP fluctuations has substantial fluctuations in all of the variables
except unemployment. An economy with only labor-force fluctuations has moderate volatil-
ity of investment growth—but recall that this driving force is not well captured by the states


                                                         42
of the model, so this finding probably understates the importance of labor-force fluctuations.
An economy with only a capital wedge has some volatility of consumption, quite a bit of
volatility of the return to capital, and a lot of volatility of investment. An economy with
only a labor wedge has substantial volatility of all the variables.
    In addition to the ambiguities associated with the correlation among the four observed
driving forces, the results in Table 9 need to be interpreted in the light of the inability to
measure other driving forces, notably fluctuations in product demand. The large role of the
labor wedge in the table may actually reflect effects operating through shifts of consumption
and investment from forces not included in the model. A later section of this chapter on the
forces unleashed by the 2008 crisis shows the potential importance of the product-demand
and product-market-wedge driving forces.
    The model takes a simplified view of the role of confidence, ambiguity aversion, and
other factors that may discourage economic activity in ways not included in traditional
macro models. Both the capital wedge and the labor wedge are modeled as extra discounts
that have adverse effects, but the labor wedge appears to be much the more important
of the two. In the model, a decline in confidence and corresponding increase in the labor
discount dn has a direct effect on job creation through the mechanisms associated with the
DMP model. Lower job creation results in lower job-finding rates and higher unemployment.
The result enters the rest of the economy as an adverse shift in net labor supply resulting
in declines in output, shared between consumption and investment. As Table 9 shows, in
the base model, there is no effect on unemployment from other driving forces—the rise in
unemployment in bad times is entirely assigned to a decline in confidence among businesses
that cuts back their job-creation flows. Obviously this property is an over-simplification,
but the macro-labor research community has made more progress recently in demonstrating
the near-irrelevance of driving forces of unemployment such as productivity than in finding
driving forces to account for fluctuations in unemployment as responses to other forces. The
later section on the crisis shows how the product-market wedge influences unemployment.


8     Crisis and Slump
This section explores the model’s properties when the driving forces are tuned to data from
the years 2009 through 2012, the years of the maximum effects of the crisis of late 2008
and its aftermath. This exercise assigns those four years to an altered state 5 with more

negative effects, including values of the two driving forces not measured for the base model
covering all the years starting in 1953. Table 11 shows the values for the six driving forces.
TFP growth retains its value from the base case, which was close to actual growth over the
four years. Labor-force growth is much lower than normal, just above zero. The capital
discount is well above its actual value in any state in the base case, reflecting the belief that
agency frictions and a loss of confidence occurred during the immediate post-crisis years.
The liquidity discount for the safe one-year interest rate is lower than in any state in the
base case, reflecting an unusual flight to safety after the crisis. The labor discount is 0.4
percentage points higher than in state 5 in the base case, corresponding to an unemployment
rate (with no product-market wedge) around 9 percent, that actually occurred after the crisis.
The product-market wedge is taken at the hypothetical value of 3 percent and the product
demand shift at minus 5 percent.
   Table 12 shows the average effects of the driving forces over the four years of adverse
shocks, in comparison to an economy that stayed all four years in a different version of state
5 in which the driving forces all had the average of their values from the base case. Thus
the figures in the table are the effects of the crisis in the sense of the differences in the
outcomes between an economy with the special crisis driving forces and one with driving
forces typical of the US economy historically in normal times. The left column shows the
average with all the crisis-specific driving forces in action. The rise of 4.54 percentage points
of unemployment resembles the actual behavior of the economy. The decline in output is
substantial but falls short of the actual decline of about 10 percent. But the positive numbers
for consumption and investment are dramatically the opposite of the actual sharp decline in
consumption and collapse of investment. This result is not a failure of the model, but rather
a consequence of the model’s implication of a huge decline in the safe interest rate. This

                                                       44
decline could not have occurred, because of the zero lower bound. The story of the table
is that the decline in the interest rate unhindered by the lower bound would have brought
about an increase in interest-sensitive consumption and investment that would more than
offset the direct decline in the spending shift g and the adverse effects of other driving forces.
   The right panel of Table 12 breaks down the effects by the driving forces. Because
the model is nonlinear, the sum of the effects on the right side is slightly different from
the combined effect on the left. The increase in the capital discount had no effect on un-
employment, moved a small amount of spending from investment to consumption, lowered
output modestly, and depressed the safe interest rate. The rise in the labor discount raised
unemployment substantially, and cut output by 1.84 percent, 1.33 percent of output from
consumption and 0.51 percent from investment. The rise in the liquidity-safety premium for
the short rate had an effect only on that rate, as there is no direct feedback from changes
in that rate induced by changes in the premium in the model. The adverse effect of the
crisis on the labor force cut output by 1.30 percent. Consumption fell by 1.72 percent of
normal output while investment rose by 0.43 percent. The rise in the product-market wedge
accounted for 1.61 percentage points of the rise in unemployment, by raising market power
and lowering the marginal revenue product of labor and thus cutting the incentive to cre-
ate jobs. The spending shift, modeled as a decline in government purchases, resulted in
increases of 2.51 percent of output in consumption and 1.77 percent in investment, thanks
to the income effect of lower implied taxes and the induced decline in the safe short rate of
3.20 percentage points.

8.1    The zero lower bound
Obviously the main lesson of Table 12 is the central importance of the zero lower bound
for the severity of the post-crisis slump in the U.S. economy. Although the model does not
implement a lower bound on the safe real rate, the results are informative about the incidence
of the bound and, to some extent, about the magnitude of adverse effects that would have
resulted from the bound. During the slump following the 2008 crisis, the short safe nominal
rate was essentially zero, at its bound as perceived by the Federal Reserve, and the expected
inflation rate was around two percent—see Figure 15—so the corresponding bound on the
real rate is around minus two percent.

    In the model, the normal value of the safe real rate during the years after 2008 is about
three percent. According to the lower left figure in Table 12, with all driving forces active at
the levels in Table 11, the rate would have been about 11 percent lower, or minus 8 percent.
Most macroeconomists would probably agree that the effects of a monetary force that raised
the safe real rate 8 percentage points above its equilibrium would be severely contractionary.
More than half of that is the direct result of the depression of the safe rate on account of the
flight to safety hypothesized in the crisis-slump scenario. The other big negative force is the
downward shift in product demand, shown in the lower right corner of Table 12. The model
supports the idea that the collapse of house prices and tightening of bank lending battered
the economy by discouraging consumption and investment. The third-biggest contributor to
the decline in the safe rate was the capital discount, good for about 1.5 percentage points of
decline. The labor discount, on the other hand, had only a small effect—it is a supply effect.
Whereas demand effects are more than fully offset by the decline in the safe rate, reductions
in supply cannot be offset that way.


9     Persistence
Effects lasting longer than the driving forces themselves operate through the model’s state
variables. It has two exogenous state variables, TFP and the labor force, and one endogenous
state variable, the capital stock.

9.1    Exogenous Persistence
In the model, each shock to the labor force has permanent effects. Where the shocks operate
through births and immigration, this property is a reasonable approximation. Whether
the substantial decline in the labor-force participation of existing individuals that occurred
during the slump will ultimately reverse itself is an open question. As of early 2016, there
was no sign that the return to essentially normal conditions in the labor market would result
in a restoration of any of the large decline that accompanied the slump. Figure 18 shows
the path of the labor force as a percent of its initial normal value in the hypothetical crisis
slump studied in the previous section. With 4 consecutive large incremental shortfalls in the
labor force during years one to four, the cumulative shortfall in the labor force in year four
is about six percent. Though the labor-force growth rate returns to normal in year five, the
cumulative shortfall continues to become larger, because the growth process is multiplicative
and is always at a lower base, post-crisis.

9.2    Endogenous Persistence
Endogenous persistence occurs through the capital stock. The effect of the capital discount
is concentrated on investment, as shown in Table 12. An increase in that discount causes


                                                                 47

businesses to place a lower value on the future payoff to capital formation, so capital falls
further and further below its normal growth path during a period of higher discount. The
effects on output and other variables persist beyond the time when the discount declines back
to normal. The capital stock returns only gradually to its normal growth path. Figure 19
shows the effects of the 4-year period of increased capital discount described in Table 11 on
the capital stock and on output. The figure shows the difference between the expected values
of those variables conditional on the crisis values of the capital discount and the expected
values with normal, non-crisis values of the discount. The effects on both variables cumulate
during the four years with the higher crisis discount and then begin to return toward zero.
Five years after the end of the crisis values, the effects remain strong.
   Similar results apply to the other driving forces that have negative effects on investment
in Table 11. These are the labor discount, which cuts investment by reducing the effective
supply of labor, and the product-market wedge, which lowers the marginal revenue product
of capital.

10     Concluding Remarks
This chapter is complementary to Ramey’s chapter in this volume. Most of her discussion
relates to empirical evidence from VARs and other econometric specifications, or to the
properties of New Keynesian structural models, though she does also consider structural
models more closely affiliated with the tradition of the real business cycle model. She focuses
extensively on monetary shocks—departures of monetary policy from its usual relation to
current developments in the economy. No monetary shocks occur in the economy considered
in this chapter. The central bank never pushes the short rate away from its equilibrium value
to restore inflation to its target rate. In the context of the literature that includes monetary
policy and monetary non-neutrality, the model here reveals the values of the interest rate and
other variables that would prevail in the absence of sticky prices and wages. Both chapters
consider government purchases as a driving force. In the empirical work Ramey considers,
the focus is on the purchases multiplier, as revealed by the empirical relation between output
and purchases. She finds that the multiplier is around one but with considerable dispersion
across studies. In this chapter, Table 12 shows a multiplier of 0.53, the value in the row
for output and the column for the spending shift. The lower value may be the result of the
model’s assumption of full monetary response to government purchases, letting the interest
rate track the change in its equilibrium value. The sample period for the model includes
times when, for example, monetary policy kept the interest rate constant in the face of an
increase in purchases, which would considerably amplify the response of output. On the tax
side of fiscal policy, Ramey considers taxes as explicit driving forces. Taxes have a role in
this chapter because they are one of the sources of historical shifts in the capital discount.
But I do not consider tax changes as special driving forces of the post-crisis slump. Ramey’s
chapter includes a detailed treatment of the measurement of technology shifts and their
effects, as measured in empirical work. To measure TFP growth, she concludes in favor
of measures with utilization adjustments. This chapter uses Fernald’s measure without
that adjustment. She also discusses, in detail, measures of technological change apart from
TFP, relating to investment. She briefly mentions oil-price changes, credit conditions, policy
uncertainty, fluctuations in the labor force, and the labor wedge as additional driving forces.
She does not mention the product-market wedge as a driving force.
   The importance of total factor productivity as a determinant of medium-term growth and
economic performance is widely agreed among macroeconomists today, and is confirmed in


                                              49
the results of this chapter—Table 9 shows that, historically, movements of TFP by themselves
would account for a standard deviation of output around 75 percent of the total of all driving
forces. A decline in productivity growth occurred during the slump that began in 2008 and
contributed to the shortfall in output, consumption, and capital formation during the slump.
Whether the crisis of 2008 contributed to the decline in productivity growth is unresolved.
   On the other hand, fluctuations in the size of the work force relative to the working-age
population—the labor-force participation rate—are about as big as fluctuations in produc-
tivity and have similar effects. Research on medium-run fluctuations has neglected this
driving force, even though research on participation itself has been extensive. The continua-
tion during the recent slump of a major decline in participation that began in 2000—and is
not the result of demographic shifts—worsened the slump. The evidence seems to point in
the direction that the decline in participation was not the result of the crisis and resulting
explosion of unemployment.
   Evidence from financial markets appears to confirm the proposition that discounts applied
to risky investments rose as a result of the crisis even as the safe rate fell to zero. In normal
times, without the zero lower bound, higher discounts result in lower output and employment.
There is an interesting unresolved question about the role of discount increases when the real
rate is held fixed by the zero lower bound on the nominal interest rate and the immovability
of inflation.
   Models that attribute some of the depth and persistence of the response of the economy
to financial shocks hold that the shocks cause increases in agency frictions within financial
intermediaries or non-financial businesses. Financial wedges develop to ensure that managers
deprived of equity still have continuation values sufficient to prevent misconduct. The evi-
dence of widening wedges between the return to capital and the safe short rate is convincing,
as is the sharp but transitory rise in the spreads between risky private bonds and Treasurys
of the same maturity. The model in this chapter assigns a moderate but important role to
financial frictions, as part of the driving force called the capital discount.
   The New Keynesian model has called attention to the product-market wedge—the markup
of price over cost—as the transmission mechanism of shocks to economic activity. With sticky
prices, an increase in demand raises cost but not price, so the markup declines. The econ-
omy expands because the product-market wedge functions like a tax wedge in depressing
activity and the decline in markups relieves that adverse effect. An interesting debate has



                                               50
yet to resolve the issue of the importance of the product-market wedge in the depth and
persistence of slumps.
   Finally, the model confirms earlier findings about the multiplier effects of shifts in product
demand. As an important cause of declining consumption demand, household deleveraging
has been assigned a major role in the recent slump and is an obvious candidate for explaining
the persistence of the slump. In the model, an exogenous decline in product demand results
in a large decrease in the interest rate, which stimulates consumption and investment. Rather
than collapsing, the economy undergoes a large reallocation of resources. But with the zero
lower bound in effect, the reallocation fails to occur. Instead, output and employment fall.
As yet, the profession has not come forth with a well-founded model of that failure.
