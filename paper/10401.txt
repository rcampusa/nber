In this paper we show that omitted variables and publication bias lead to severely biased estimates

of the value of a statistical life. Although our empirical results are obtained in the context of a study

of choices about road safety, we suspect that the same issues plague the estimation of monetary

trade-offs regarding safety in other contexts.

                 ESTIMATING THE VALUE OF A STATISTICAL LIFE:
          THE IMPORTANCE OF OMITTED VARIABLES AND PUBLICATION BIAS

                    By ORLEY ASHENFELTER AND MICHAEL GREENSTONE∗

        Measures of public preferences toward risk are critical to evaluations of public policies on many

safety, environmental, and health issues. In this paper we provide a method for measuring the revealed

preferences for safety risks from state level public choices about speed limits. The idea is to measure the

value of the time saved per incremental fatality that results from the voluntary adoption of an increased

speed limit. Since adopters must have valued the time saved by greater speeds more than the fatalities

created, this ratio provides a convincing and credible upper bound on the value of a statistical life (VSL).1

        Although there have been a number of creative attempts designed to estimate the value of a

statistical life, there have been few opportunities to obtain estimates based on the public’s willingness to

accept an exogenous and known safety risk and to do this for multiple independent decision makers.2 The

empirical analysis we report here exploits the opportunity that the federal government gave the states in

1987 to choose a speed limit for rural interstate highways that was higher than the uniform national

maximum speed limit then in existence.

        This institutional change allows us to address two key conceptual problems that have plagued

previous attempts to estimate the VSL. First, most methods for assessing the VSL from labor market data

are not based on choices made in the face of exogenous safety risks. This results in estimates of the VSL

that often are not based on credible identification assumptions or suffer from serious potential omitted

variables bias.3 For example, we demonstrate that conventional ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation

indicates that speeds and highway fatality rates are uncorrelated, presumably due to drivers’ optimizing

decisions. To avoid this problem of omitted variables, we use states’ decisions about adopting a higher

speed limit in response to the 1987 law as an instrumental variable (IV). In sharp contrast to the OLS

results, this IV estimation strategy indicates that speeds and fatalities are highly correlated and that

adopters received approximately $1.5 million (1997$) per marginal fatality.

        Second, our estimates of the tradeoff between the value of time saved and fatalities can be made

from comparisons of rural interstates and other highways within states that adopted increased speeds, as
well as from comparisons with roads in non-adopting states. This statistical design permits us to obtain

separate estimates of this tradeoff for each of the states with complete data that changed speed limits.

Consequently, we can also examine how “publication bias” might lead to “consensus” estimates of the

VSL being determined by a selected sample of the estimated tradeoffs. Since only “successful” analyses

are likely to be published, we implement several of the most likely “publication rules” and show that the

consensus estimate is likely to be significantly upward biased by publication bias.4



                                               I. Design of the Study

        The first U.S. laws imposing restrictive speed limits on motor vehicles were passed in 1901 in

Connecticut. With the exception of a Second World War emergency limit of 35 mph, the setting of speed

limits remained the responsibility of the state and local governments until 1974 when Congress enacted

the Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act. This bill, intended as a fuel conservation measure,

required, among other things, a national maximum speed limit of 55 mph. This new national speed limit

was lower than the existing maximum daytime speed limit in all 50 states.

        The Federal Highway Administration was empowered to enforce the new speed limit by the use

of financial sanctions.   By 1987 dissatisfaction with the federally imposed (and enforced) national

maximum speed limit led Congress to modify the law to permit states to set speed limits of 65 mph on

rural interstate highways only. Forty states immediately exercised this option. Even with the end of the

concern for fuel conservation, the national maximum speed limit was retained in some form until repeal

in 1995. By the end of 1997 only three states maintained a 55 mph speed limit on rural interstates: 20

states had rural interstate speed limits of 65 mph, 16 were at 70 mph, 10 at 75 mph, and Montana had no

daytime speed limit, returning to its policy in 1973.

        In this paper we study 21 of the 40 states that chose to raise their speed limits to 65 miles per hour

on rural interstate highways by 1988. The remaining states had no rural interstate highways (3), did not

change their speed limit (7), or were states for which we could not obtain reliable data (19). Uniform and

reliable data on the post-1995 period is unavailable at this time, but we hope to extend our analysis to this

period when possible.


                                                        2
          Our operating hypothesis is that the legislative decisions about speed limits can be used to infer

the VSL of an individual whose preferences are important for maximizing societal welfare. This requires

that: (a) lawmakers were aware of the tradeoffs associated with a higher speed limit; and, (b) the

legislators’ adoption decisions reflect the preferences of a driver/voter toward the center of the

distribution of preferences

          We find both of these assumptions plausible. First, there was considerable evidence available to

legislators in 1987 on the effects of higher speed limits on average speeds and fatality rates. Importantly,

this evidence was collected and summarized in a widely disseminated report by the National Research

Council (NRC 1984). Second, there is ample anecdotal evidence that in choosing a speed limit states aim

to maximize societal welfare. For example, an Indiana Department of Transportation report states:
           “Speed limits represent trade-offs between risk and travel time for a road class or
           specific highway section reflecting an appropriate balance between the societal
           goals of safety and mobility. The process of setting speed limits is not merely a
           technical exercise. It involves value judgments and trade-offs that are in the
           arena of the political process” [italics added] (Khan, Sinha, and McCarthy, 2000,
           p. 144).

Further, one might expect that if the 1987 adoption decisions were in conflict with driver/voter

preferences that states would reverse their decisions over time. Notably, none of the states exercised this

option.



                                       II. What is Being Measured?

          Assuming that decisions to increase speed limits reflect informed voter preferences, there still

remains the question of what part of the distribution of preferences is measured by our empirical analysis.

To study this problem, it is essential to distinguish between (a) the technical constraint that connects

speeds to fatalities and (b) the preferences of voters as between speed and fatality risks. We may observe

the technical constraint, but we can only infer voter/driver preferences from their choices.

          To understand the issues, suppose the median driver/voter in state i is offered the opportunity to
increase the speed limit from S i to S i’ through the political process. Associated with this offer is a

decrease in the cost of travel time of w∆hi, which is measured as the product of the value of time (w, the




                                                      3
wage) and the amount of time saved (measured in hours, h). Also associated with this offer is an increase

in the fatality rate (f) of ∆fi, so that we may display the heterogeneity in this offer by writing

        (1)               Vi = -w(∆hi/∆fi).

The left hand side of equation (1) is a discrete measure of the value of time saved (V) as a result of the

speed limit change. We use the 1987 law to estimate the Vi’s, as well as their mean.

        The value of a statistical life, Vi*, reflects the preferences toward safety (the rate of substitution

between money and risk) of the determining driver/voter in state i.5 A higher speed limit will be adopted

if Vi > Vi*, for in this case the time costs saved by the increased speeds that result from the higher speed

limit will be greater per fatality than the value of the determining statistical life, Vi*. The probability that

the higher speed limit is adopted is thus:

        (2)               Pr (Adoption) = Pr (Vi > Vi*).

        It is apparent from (2) that the average value of Vi amongst adopters, E(Vi|Adoption) =

E(Vi|Vi>Vi*), must be at least as great as E(Vi*|Adoption), the average value of a statistical life among

adopters. Thus, the measured average value of time costs saved per marginal fatality from the adoption of

an increased speed limit is generally greater than the mean value of a statistical life among adopters and

provides an upper bound on that quantity. In addition in the special case where the value of a statistical

life is constant across states (i.e., Vi* = V*), the estimated average value of the time saved per marginal

fatality from an increased speed limit is upward biased compared to what it would be for both adopters

and non-adopters because the left hand side of equation (1) is only observed for adopters.6



                                    III. Data and Econometric Methods

        Data Sources. To conduct the analysis, we collected a data file on vehicle miles traveled (VMT),

traffic fatalities, and vehicle speeds that covers the years 1982-1993 for urban and rural interstate

highways and for rural arterial roads. States were allowed to increase the speed limit to 65 mph on rural

interstates. They were prohibited from increasing the limit on the other two. Since these other roads

generally had speed limits of 55 mph in 1987 and design features that closely resemble those of rural

interstates, these two road types provide an important source of intra-state variation.7


                                                       4
        VMT is readily available by state and road type from the Federal Highway Administration’s

Highway Statistics.8 Total fatalities by road type are available from the Fatal Accident Reporting System,

which provides a census of all fatal vehicle crashes in the United States.                By contacting all state

departments of transportation, we obtained speed data for 21 of the 40 states that increased rural interstate

speed limits. Thus, these 21 states along with the seven that retained the 55 mph limit form our 28 state

sample.9

        Econometric Methods. The equation used to estimate how individuals trade off time spent

traveling against the probability of a fatality is:

        (3)      ln (Hours of Travel)srt = β ln (VMT)srt + θ ln (Fatalities)srt + υsrt,

where υsrt = αsr + ηrt + µst + νsrt. Here, s references state, r indicates roadtype, and t indexes year. The

dependent variable is the natural logarithm of hours of travel (that is, the reciprocal of the average speed

multiplied by VMT) and ln (VMT)srt, the natural logarithm of vehicle miles of travel, is a control. Thus

the parameter of interest, θ, measures the elasticity of time spent traveling with respect to fatalities,

holding constant VMT.

        There are a number of potential sources of bias that we can control with state, year, and roadtype

dummy variables and many of their interactions. Even with the inclusion of the multitude of fixed effects

indicated in υsrt, however, θ is not robust to time varying state-roadtype determinants of fatalities. As an

example, it is possible that individuals drive more slowly when there is poor weather or heavy road repair

precisely due to safety concerns. Our solution to this identification problem is to find a variable that

affects speeds and that only affects fatalities through its effect on speeds. As Ashenfelter and Greenstone

(2004) demonstrate, a plausible instrument is whether the 65 mph speed limit was in force.



                                                      IV. Results

        Table 1 reports results from the estimation of equation (3). In column (1) the sample is limited to

data from the rural interstate roads and the specification includes year-roadtype and state-roadtype fixed

effects. In column (2) the sample is enlarged to include observations on urban interstates and rural

arterials, allowing for the addition of state-year indicators to the specification. The first panel presents


                                                          5
results from ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation, while the second panel uses an indicator for whether

the 65 mph speed limit was in force as an instrumental variable as outlined in the previous section. For

each regression, the table reports the parameter estimate on the fatalities variable and the heteroskedastic

consistent standard error in parentheses. The implied estimate of V, the monetary value of the time saved

per marginal fatality, is calculated by multiplying the elasticity by the ratio of hours traveled to total

fatalities on rural interstates in adopting states from 1982-86 (6.122 billion/5,187) and by the 1986

average wage rate in adopting states ($12.33 in 1997$) and is presented in brackets.

        The OLS regressions indicate that speeds and fatalities are virtually uncorrelated. Although this

may seems puzzling at first, it is not very surprising. After all, people will choose to travel more slowly

in order to reduce the likelihood of a fatality when a road is unsafe (e.g., due to poor weather).

        The IV estimates paint a very different picture. In particular, the two estimates of θIV indicate

that a 10% increase in fatalities is associated with a 1% to 1.1% reduction in travel times and these

estimates would be judged statistically significant by conventional criteria. The similarity between the

results in columns (1) and (2) indicates that in this setting state-year unobservables are not an important

source of bias. The associated estimate of the IV monetary value of time saved per marginal fatality is

approximately $1.5 million (1997$).

        Overall, Table 1 has two primary findings. First, the OLS results illustrate the difficulty of

making causal inferences when there is no exogenous variability in the data. In particular, the results in

the top panel are consistent with the possibility that OLS will produce estimates of θ that are biased

upwards due to individuals’ compensatory behavior. Second, the use of the introduction of the 65-mph

speed limit as an instrumental variable appears to mitigate this bias, if not entirely remove it.

        We now undertake separate analyses for each of the 21 adopting states. Table 2 presents state-

by-state estimates and standard errors of the IV elasticity between time saved and fatalities (cols. (1) and

(2)) and the monetary value of time saved per marginal fatality (col. (3)). These are obtained from fitting

versions of equation (3) that include the logarithm of VMT interacted with roadtype and state-roadtype,

roadtype-year, and state-year fixed effects as controls. The sample for each of these regressions includes




                                                      6
observations on rural interstates, urban interstates, and rural arterials from the 7 states that retained the 55

mph limit and the state for which the estimate applies.

        The entries reveal that 19 of the 21 IV elasticities have the expected negative sign. Notably, only

3 (Colorado, Iowa, and South Dakota) of the elasticities would be judged statistically significant at

conventional levels. The estimated value of time saved per marginal fatality ranges from -$1.12 million

(Arkansas) to $9.71 million (Wisconsin). As we report below, however, this enormous variability is

entirely consistent with sampling error in the estimates.

        Figure 1 provides an opportunity to assess the extent of the variability in the estimates in the

context of their precision. It plots the state-specific estimated values of time saved per fatality on the y-

axis against the t-statistics of the IV elasticities on the x-axis. Each state is denoted with its two letter

abbreviation. The letters “s” and “f” in parentheses indicate that the reduced form relationships between

the instrument and hours spent traveling (i.e., the inverse of speed) and fatalities, conditional on the same

set of covariates as the Table 2 specification, is statistically significant at the 5% level, respectively. It is

evident that the extreme estimates, both negative and positive, are the ones where the elasticity is

estimated with the least precision. For example, all of the estimates with associated t-statistics greater

than 1.4 are in the relatively narrow range of $1.2 million to $3.2 million. To more systematically assess

the variability of these estimates, we implemented an F-test of the hypothesis that the 21 elasticities are

equal and failed to reject the null (p-value = 0.24).

        To explore what might happen if each state in our data were studied separately, with publication

of each study determined by the standard peer-review process, we provide the analysis in Table 3. Here,

we consider each state-specific estimate of V a separate study that could have been undertaken by a

researcher, submitted to a journal, and considered for publication by reviewers and the editor.10 We

further assume that the 21 adopting states with complete data form the universe of states that raised the

speed limit. The different panels report the weighted mean and standard error (in parentheses) of the Vi’s

from alternative “publication rules,” where the weight is the inverse of the IV elasticity’s standard error.

Each of these rules leads to an estimate of V that is based on a different subsample of the universe of Vi’s.




                                                        7
        The first panel reveals that the weighted average of all 21 state-specific estimates of V is $1.14

million. This estimate serves as the basis of comparison for the alternative publication rules. In the

second panel, we impose the rule that to be published a study must have an IV elasticity with an

associated p-value < .05. This is believed to be a common basis for determining a study’s value. Three

of the estimates meet this criteria and their weighted average is $2.31. Thus, this publication rule

produces an estimate of V that is more than twice as large as the one based on the universe of estimates.

This is especially notable in a setting where the hypothesis that the treatment effect is homogeneous

cannot be rejected. The third and fourth panels impose publication rules that require p-values < .05 for

the reduced form relationships between the instrument and fatalities and speed, respectively. They also

produce upward biased estimates of V, although the bias is smaller.



                                               V. Conclusions

        This study has demonstrated that omitted variables and publication bias can lead to severely

biased estimates of the monetary value of time saved per marginal fatality. As a result, estimates of the

value of a statistical life that do not account for these factors will also be severely biased. Although our

empirical results are obtained in the context of a study of choices about road safety, we suspect that the

same issues plague the estimation of the value of a statistical life in other contexts.

Notes: For each row the entries report the results from separate
regressions where the sample includes observations on rural interstates,
urban interstates, and rural arterials from the 7 states that retained the 55
mph limit and the state for which the estimate applies.                  The
specifications regress ln (Hours of Travel) on ln (Fatalities), and the
controls are ln (vehicle miles of travel) interacted with roadtype and
state-roadtype, roadtype-year, and state-year fixed effects. An indicator
for whether the 65 mph speed limit was in force is an instrumental
variable for ln (Fatalities). Columns (1) and (2) report the parameter on
ln (Fatalities) and its heteroskedastic-consistent standard error (in
parentheses). Column (3) reports the estimated value of time saved per
marginal fatality, which is calculated by multiplying the IV elasticity
(column (1)) by the state-specific ratio of hours traveled to total fatalities
and the state-specific mean hourly wage. See the text and Ashenfelter
and Greenstone (2004) for further estimation details. * indicates
significance at 5% level and ** indicates significance at 1% level

    There are easily implemented econometric methods for use with meta-analyses of multiple studies of the

VSL to test and correct for publication bias problems. See Hedges (1992) and Ashenfelter, Harmon and

Oosterbeek (1999).

    In this special case, E(Vi|Adoption) is greater than V*, the value of a statistical life that is common

among both adopters and non-adopters.

     Both rural and urban interstate roads have multiple lanes, with traffic separated by direction and

controlled access. Rural arterials generally have one lane in each direction, but they have wide lanes and

shoulder lanes. Access to them is less controlled than to interstates, but more than to any other type of

road. See National Research Council (1984).
