                                          ABSTRACT

This paper examines the relationship between the timing of SNAP benefit payments and
participation in school lunch and breakfast using the National Household Food Acquisition and
Purchase Survey (FoodAPS). An event study approach examines participation over the five-day
window before and after the SNAP payment. We find that school lunch participation decreases 17
to 23 percentage points immediately after the SNAP payment among 11-18 year olds while
breakfast drops 19 to 36 percentage points. The decline begins the day prior to payment. We find
no effects for 5-10 year olds. Models examining participation over the full SNAP month using
individual fixed effects yield similar findings. Among teenagers, participation in school lunch and
breakfast decline in the first two weeks of the SNAP month, increasing afterwards. Non-school
meals show the opposite pattern. Overall, results indicate SNAP households rely more on school
lunch and breakfast toward the end of the SNAP month. Adolescents substitute away from school
meals to non-subsidized meal options earlier in the SNAP benefit cycle.

 1. Introduction

        In 2016, approximately 16% of households with children in the United States (U.S.) were

food insecure. This means that a significant number of Americans, at some point, were unable to

cover their food and nutrition needs (Coleman-Jensen et al., 2017). Children are not exempt from

experiencing food insecurity. In 2016, children were food insecure in roughly 8% of these

households (Coleman-Jensen et al., 2017). There are several programs in the country to help

families and their children meet their nutrition and food needs. Two of the largest are the

Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the National School Lunch Program

(NSLP). There is evidence that these programs contribute to ameliorate food insecurity (i.e.

Hoynes and Schanzenbach, 2015), however, much remains to be learned about their

effectiveness, and how households use them. Further, while many families with children are

likely to use both SNAP and school lunch, little research documents the relationship between

them.

        According to a recent report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers

(2015), monthly SNAP payments are insufficient to cover a family’s food needs for the entire

month. Persuasive empirical evidence shows that, indeed, food consumption, purchases and

caloric intake decrease toward the end of the SNAP benefit cycle, especially during the last week

of the SNAP month (Shapiro, 2005; Hoynes and Schanzenbach, 2015). That is, there is a “SNAP

gap” at the end of the month. Is there a countervailing increase in school lunch participation? To

what extent does the NSLP ameliorate this exhaustion of benefits, that is “close the SNAP gap”?

        This paper answers these questions using newly available data from the National

Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS), a nationally representative survey

that tracks food acquisitions for all members of a household – including children – for seven



                                                                                                 2
days. We take advantage of the longitudinal nature of FoodAPS and construct a child by day

dataset with measures of SNAP participation, days since SNAP payment, and measures of daily

school and non-school meal participation. 2 We use two distinct empirical strategies. First, we use

an event study approach leveraging the subset of FoodAPS households that received their SNAP

payment during data collection week. For this analysis, we compare school meal participation

for children in these households in the five weekdays before SNAP payment to participation in

the five weekdays after the SNAP payment. This strategy yields an estimate of the short-run

effect of SNAP on school meal participation. Second, we examine the evolution of participation

in school meals over the full SNAP month exploiting the panel nature of our data to estimate

models with individual fixed effects.

        To preview our findings, short-run models show a decline in both school lunch and

breakfast right after SNAP payment among 11-18 year olds. Specifically, lunch participation

drops by 17 percentage points and breakfast participation declines by 20 percentage points for

this age group. We find some evidence of an “anticipation effect” in which school meal

participation decreases 18 percentage points the day before SNAP pay and continues to drop

following benefit receipt (23 percentage points). School breakfast also declines – 25 percentage

points the day before SNAP pay rising to 36 percentage points in the days after payment. Finally,

among 11-18 year olds, non-school breakfast increases substantially after SNAP benefits.

Younger children seem less responsive. There is no significant change in school meal

participation for 5-10 year olds around the SNAP payment date, although non-school breakfast

acquisitions decrease after SNAP payments.

        Full month models yield similar results. We find that 11-18 year olds drop school meal


2
 We will refer to our main outcome variables as measuring participation in school or non-school meals, but because
FoodAPS only records food acquisitions we do not know if children actually ate the meal they acquired.

                                                                                                                 3
participation in the first two weeks of the SNAP benefit cycle. On days 11 to 15, teenagers are 23

percentage points less likely to acquire lunch and 22 percentage points less likely to have

breakfast relative to days 26 to 30 of the SNAP month. For all school meals, participation

increases after that. We observe the opposite pattern for non-school meals. As before, results for

5-10 year olds are generally not significant.

       In sum, this paper provides evidence that school meals may offset declines in food

consumption at the end of the SNAP month, especially for teenagers who are less likely to

participate in school meal programs. This group, however, substitutes away from school meals

early in the SNAP month. We test the robustness of our findings in a number of ways. The

findings are encouraging. Specifically, our results are robust to the inclusion of calendar week

controls to account for the receipt of other forms of payment, and to the inclusion of an indicator

for SNAP payments that occur on a weekend. Further, stratifying the sample by “school level”

(elementary school vs. middle and high school) rather than age group yields similar results.

Finally, we note that we do not observe the same patterns in meal participation (both school and

non-school) over the calendar month among children in non-SNAP households.

       The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature and

develops a theoretical framework. Section 3 describes the FoodAPS data, our measures, and

sample. Section 4 outlines the empirical strategy. We discuss results and robustness tests in

section 5 and conclude in the last section.

 2. Literature Review and Theory

Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)

       In 2008, SNAP became the new name of the Food Stamp Program to reflect the increased

emphasis on nutrition as well as higher benefit amounts. In 2016, close to 23 million households



                                                                                                     4
participated in the program making it the largest food assistance program in the U.S. To qualify

for SNAP, households need to meet either categorical eligibility or certain income, resource, and

employment requirements. 3 SNAP recipients redeem their benefits electronically using an

Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card to purchase eligible food items. In 2016, there were

260,115 stores authorized to accept SNAP. In 2015, the SNAP participation rate for all eligible

individuals was 83%, while the participation rate of employed poor persons was lower at 72%

(Farson Grey and Cunnyngham, 2017). Overall, households below the poverty line participate

more than those above but still eligible, as do households with children (Farson Grey and

Cunnyngham, 2017). In 2015, over 40% of SNAP participants were 18 years old or younger and

the vast majority reside in urban areas. That same year, the average income of SNAP participants

was $786, and SNAP benefits averaged $254.

SNAP and food consumption

          A large and rich body of work documents the relationship between SNAP and various

outcomes including spending and consumption (Hoynes and Schanzenbach, 2009; Gundersen

and Ziliak, 2003), food security and nutrition (Castellary et al., 2016; Hoynes and Schanzenbach,

2015) and health (Gibson, 2003; Seligman et al., 2014). A subset of this literature focuses on

children, and, among these, many study the effects of SNAP on BMI and obesity (Gibson, 2004;

Schmeiser, 2012). More recently, attention has shifted to investigating how the timing of SNAP

benefits influences behavior and consumption. This is an important issue, especially for

households with children because of the consequences for food security. Indeed, in 2009, most

households with children had exhausted at least half of their SNAP benefits within two weeks,

                                                                                                               5
and nearly 50% had used almost all of their benefits (Castner and Henke, 2011). This exhaustion

in benefits has consequences for a household’s food consumption.

       In an earlier study, Wilde and Ranney (2000) find that consumption decreases during the

SNAP month, suggesting this drop is the result of households making larger shopping trips at the

beginning of the month, possibly due to transportation constraints. Using survey data, Shapiro

(2005) finds a decline in caloric intake at the end of the SNAP month. Contrary to Wilde and

Ranney (2000), he finds no difference, however, for households that make frequent trips. More

recently, Todd (2015) finds decreases in the consumption of certain products such as milk,

vegetables and meat especially in the period before the benefit increase of the American

Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. Benefit increases reduce this cyclicality but

do not completely eliminate it (Todd 2015; Todd and Gregory 2018).

       SNAP recipients also report purchasing and eating a greater variety of foods at the

beginning of the month (Darko, Eggett, and Richards, 2013; Seefeldt and Castelli, 2009).

Castellari and colleagues (2016) use the Nielsen Homescan Consumer Panel Dataset (NHCPD)

to examine consumption patterns of bread, milk, beer, soft drinks, and tobacco throughout the

SNAP month. They find that purchases are higher on benefit receipt dates, and total consumption

is affected by whether benefit payments happen on a weekend.

       Other behaviors are affected as well. For example, SNAP recipients are more likely to

shop at grocery stores and “big box” stores and more likely to eat at home earlier in the SNAP

month than later when they are more likely to shop at convenience stores (Damon, King, and

Leibtag, 2013). Using FoodAPS, Smith et al. (2016) find that SNAP households spend more

money on food at home on the day of benefit receipt, and this spending declines in the days after.

That is, SNAP households are more likely to make large food purchases at the start of the benefit



                                                                                                 6
cycle than later in the month.

         While current research shows that household food purchases and consumption of certain

goods decrease at the end of the SNAP month, evidence of the effects of SNAP benefit

exhaustion on child food consumption is limited. Most research focused on children examines

the effect of the timing of SNAP payments on health and school outcomes. Two recent studies

estimate the relationship between the timing of SNAP payments and academic outcomes.

Gassman-Pines and Bellows (2018) find a curvilinear relationship between the timing of SNAP

payments and test scores. Test scores peak around day 17 and start decreasing after that. Cotti, et

al. (2018) show that math test scores decrease toward the end of the SNAP month, and especially

in the four days after receipt of SNAP payments.

National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and National Breakfast Program (SBP)

         The NSLP is a federal program that provides low-cost or free lunches to eligible children

in schools and other childcare institutions. Created in 1946 through the National School Lunch

Act, it is the second largest food assistance program in the country. In its first year of operation it

provided meals for over 7 million children. The number of children served has increased

substantially since then, and by 2016, more than 31 million children received school lunches at a

cost of $13.6 billion. The NSLP defines students as eligible for free lunch if their family income

is at or below 130 percent of the poverty threshold and eligible for a reduced-price lunch if

family income is between 130 and 185 percent of the poverty threshold. The price of lunch for

all other students is established by local food authorities (USDA, FNS, 2017). 4


4
  Lunches served under this program must meet certain federal nutrition requirements including the availability of
fruits and vegetables, and whole grains. Attention to the nutritional value of school meals increased with the Healthy
Hunger Free Kids Act of 2010. There are specific limits on calories and sodium content. The decision of what food
items are served remains with local food authorities, and schools and districts that participate in these programs get
reimbursed for each lunch served (reimbursable meals).


                                                                                                                    7
       Some schools participate in the School Breakfast Program (SBP), founded in 1966 by the

Child and Nutrition Act and administered by the USDA. Unlike the NSLP, not all schools

participate in the SBP. USDA (2017) reports that in 2016 over 100,000 schools and other

childcare institutions participated in the NSLP, while only about 87,000 schools participated in

the SBP. Accordingly, while more than 31 million students participated in the NSLP, less than

half as many (14.6 million) participated in the SBP in 2016. We focus on the larger program –

NSLP – but we also examine school breakfast.

School meal participation and child outcomes

       Not all eligible children participate in NSLP or SBP and utilization varies among those

who participate, due to a variety of factors. First, some students will not utilize school breakfast

because their school does not participate in the program. Second, participation and utilization

may be dampened by stigma associated with these subsidized meals. Using data from the Panel

Study of Income Dynamics, Mitcherva and Powell (2009) find a positive correlation between the

share of students eligible for free lunch and school meal participation. Marples and Spillman

(1995) report that high school students are more likely to eat school lunch if their friends do.

Finally, students may prefer other meal options. For example, schools may offer competing

options through “a la carte” menu items that are preferred (Gundersen, 2015).

       Research examining the effects of school meals on child nutrition and obesity has yielded

mixed findings. While some studies find school lunch improves child nutrition and obesity

(Gleason and Suitor 2003; Gundersen et al. 2012), others find little evidence that the NLSP

improves diet (Campbell et al. 2011; Battacharya, Currie, and Haider 2004) and it may even

increase child obesity (Schanzenbach, 2009; Millimet, Tchernis, and Husain, 2010). Nord and

Romig (2006) suggest the NSLP can improve food insecurity. Few of these studies, however, are


                                                                                                       8
recent enough to reflect the changes in the NSLP induced by the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act

of 2010.

       As for school breakfast, Battacharya, Currie, and Haider (2006) find positive impacts of

participation on dietary quality, Millimet, Tchernis, and Husain (2010) find improvements in

child obesity, and Imberman and Kugler (2014) document positive impacts of Breakfast in the

Classroom (BIC) on test scores in a large urban school district in the Southwest of the United

States. In contrast, Corcoran et al. (2016) find no evidence that BIC reduces obesity or improves

academic performance in New York City. Similarly, Schanzenbach and Zaki (2014) analyze

experimental data and find little evidence that BIC improves health or academic achievement, as

well as little improvements on nutrition.

       So far, research on school meal programs is mixed and research that examines the school

lunch program tend to consider it independently of the overall food safety net. Indeed, there is

little evidence of how school meal participation, nutrition, and consumption of school meals vary

with a family’s resources throughout the month, in particular for SNAP participants. This paper

adds to the literature by examining the relationship between SNAP and school meals. We

improve on existing studies using a detailed dataset that allows us to track the food acquisitions

of children in SNAP households for a period of seven days. Since households are surveyed at

different points of the SNAP benefit cycle we are able to provide insight into how families use

school lunch and breakfast over the SNAP month, that is, into whether (or how much) there is

substitution between SNAP and the NSLP and the SBP.

Why might school meal participation change after SNAP payments?

       If there is complete consumption smoothing for SNAP families in anticipation of regular

benefit receipt, there may be no change in school meal participation over the SNAP month, as


                                                                                                     9
families balance out of school purchases and in school consumption. That is, the timing of SNAP

benefits may not affect school meal participation if families do not increase school lunch to

compensate for low balances toward the end of the SNAP month. However, existing evidence

indicates consumption smoothing is not complete (Wilde and Ranney 2000; Shapiro 2005; Todd

2015; Todd and Gregory 2018). Families employ different strategies to compensate for this

exhaustion in SNAP benefits. Schenck-Fontaine, Gassman-Pines, and Hill (2017) surveyed

African-American families in Durham, North Carolina, finding that SNAP households are more

likely to borrow money from social networks starting in the third week of the SNAP month. Use

of food banks comes after borrowing and not until the last week of the cycle.

       While these papers do not explore school meals, they suggest they may have a role in

supporting food consumption when SNAP benefits run low. Families may increase reliance on

school lunch at the end of the SNAP month as benefits are exhausted and then reduce reliance

after the SNAP payment (the beginning of the SNAP month) opting to bring lunch from home,

or purchase from other vendors. That is, school lunch participation may decline at the start of the

SNAP month compared to later in the benefit cycle. Notice, however, that the precise timing of

this change may be ambiguous. Studies on behaviors in and around payday for individuals

receiving social security (also a fixed income with a regular payment schedule) show sharp

increases in expenditures on the day of benefit receipt and days after pay. For total expenditures,

those increases begin two days before peaking on payday (Stephens, 2003). Changes in school

meal participation might begin the day before the SNAP payment day in an “anticipation effect”.

       Further, the relationship between SNAP and school lunch may vary by student age.

Middle and high school students have lower school meal participation rates than elementary

school students (Mirtcheva and Powell, 2009) which may be due to greater sensitivity to stigma



                                                                                                 10
or greater access to competing options (including open campuses). For example, recent

qualitative evidence shows that middle school students report buying breakfast in convenience

stores on the way to school rather than eating school breakfast and that other students often make

fun of children eating school breakfast (Bailey-Davis et al., 2012). Thus, we stratify all our

models by age.

    3. Data and Measures

         The main source of data for this paper is FoodAPS, a nationally representative survey of

4,826 households co- sponsored by the USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) and the Food

and Nutrition Service (FNS). FoodAPS is a rich and detailed dataset with information on food

acquisitions during seven days for the primary respondent, and for the other members of the

household, including school-age children. In addition, FoodAPS includes information about

participation in other nutrition programs, in particular for children who participate in school

lunch (breakfast), as well as detailed information on what items were acquired as part of a meal,

where the acquisition took place (such as home or school), and the meal’s nutritional

information. 5 The survey was administered between April 2012 and January 2013. Data

collection was a multi-step process that consisted of an initial interview with the primary

respondent. 6 This interview took place prior to the first day of data collection. During the week

of data collection, all members of a household aged 11 or older recorded food acquisitions in a

food book, while the primary respondent recorded meal acquisitions for those aged 10 or

younger and completed the Meals and Snack Forms (M&SF). The M&SF indicate for all survey

  FoodAPS is composed of household level data, individual level data, food at home and food away from home
event, item, and nutrient data. For more details on the structure and different datasets that are part of FoodAPS see

  The primary respondent is the household’s main food shopper or meal planner (FoodAPS User’s Guide, November

                                                                                                                  11
participants in the household whether they acquired breakfast, lunch, dinner or snacks on a given

day of the data collection week. In addition to the initial interview, there were three follow-up

phone interviews and a final interview with the primary respondent after the last day of data

collection (day seven). Financial incentives were provided for respondents to complete

interviews or assigned tasks. 7 In order to ensure the validity of reported food acquisitions food

book entries were verified during the three phone interviews, and to the extent possible all data

discrepancies (i.e. duplicate entries, partial entries) were resolved.

Building a child-day dataset

         We begin by identifying children in FoodAPS individual dataset (FI). There are a total of

3,338 school-age children (5 to 18 years old). We match these with the FoodAPS household

dataset (FH) to identify children that are poor (in household with incomes less than 185% of

poverty threshold), in households currently receiving SNAP (1,445) and enrolled in K-12. 8

         We obtain data on meal acquisitions from FoodAPS’ Food Away From Home dataset

(FAFH). These meal-level data include all food acquisitions recorded by children in their own

food books (age 11-18) or reported by the primary respondent (age 5-10). The data also provide

information about the type of meal (e.g. lunch), date, and place of the acquisition (e.g. school)

among other information. Because these data only record acquisitions that happened away from

home, and some meals may occur in the home or are prepared at home to eat at school, we

supplement the FAFH data with the M&SF. Recall that these data only indicate whether a child

had a lunch, breakfast, dinner, or snack on a given day of data collection and it is filled out by



7
  The primary respondent received a base incentive of $100, and a $10 gift card for each of the three follow up
interviews. Children aged 11 to 14 years old received a $10 gift card if they filled their food books or reported their
food acquisitions to the primary respondent. Respondents aged 15 or older received a $20 gift card (FoodAPS
User’s Guide, November 2016).
8
  Thus, we exclude children that do not attend school, dropped out, are not old enough to be in school, are home
schooled or in some other type of school (not K-12).

                                                                                                                     12
the primary respondent. This means that the M&SF data do not contain any additional details

regarding the location of the meal.

         Our final dataset includes child-day observations that have lunch (breakfast) information

from one of these two data sources. We drop child-day observations with no lunch (breakfast)

recorded on either dataset. Further, for our main analyses we restrict our sample to children

interviewed when school was in session, excluding those interviewed during summer and other

breaks. 9 These sample restrictions result in a total of 1,173 children amounting to 7,532 child-

day observations and 5,529 child-day weekday observations with lunch, and 5,242 child-day

weekday observations when school was in session for breakfast. (Of 6,314 weekday child-day

observations when school was in session, lunch (breakfast) data was missing from both the

FAFH and M&SF for 785 (1,072). We see no differential missing data rates between younger

kids and older kids.) 10

         Table 1 shows demographic characteristics of the resulting sample by SNAP status. As

shown, the 794 children in SNAP households differ from the 379 poor children in non-SNAP

households. Specifically, SNAP children are more likely to be non-white or live in public

housing, and less likely to live in a rural area, and in a household with a car than poor children in

non-SNAP households. Further, SNAP children are more likely to participate in school lunch.

Specifically, they are 13 to 16 percentage points more likely to get a school lunch and

correspondingly 14 to 18 percentage points less likely to have a non-school lunch than non-

SNAP kids, but we see no differences in school and non-school breakfast participation. 11


9
  We exclude 2,613 observations due to this restriction. The full sample including children interviewed during
summer and when school was in session includes 9,427 observations and 1,468 children.
10
   Of the observations with missing lunch 10 percent (334) are aged 11-18 and 15.1 percent (451) are aged 5 to 10.
As for breakfast, 15.6 percent (520) of 11 to 18 year olds report no breakfast data and 18.5 percent (552) of 5 to 10
year olds do so.
11
   These results come from a regression of school and non-school meal participation indicators on a dummy equal 1
if child i is in a SNAP household and 0 if she is not. These models include demographic controls and day of the

                                                                                                                   13
Measures

        Our key measures capture daily participation in school lunch and breakfast as well as

non-school lunch and breakfast. “School lunch” equals one if the child or primary respondent

reported acquiring lunch on a given day at school in the FAFH dataset or if lunch was classified

as a school lunch based on the items acquired (FAFH-item dataset) 12, and if lunch was free and

part of a reimbursable meal. 13 It is zero if the child did not acquire a school lunch (but acquired

another type of lunch reported in the FAFH-event data or in the M&SF), or if she or he report

having no lunch at all in the M&SF. Similarly, our non-school lunch measure equals one if the

child or primary respondent reported getting lunch on a given day of data collection, and lunch

was not coded as a school lunch. We create school and non-school breakfast measures similarly.

Unfortunately, FoodAPS does not provide daily attendance data, so we are unable to isolate meal

acquisition on days attending school only.

        Overall, lunch participation is high. On an average day, 90% of children have a lunch and

79% a breakfast. There are some differences by age level. Roughly, 88% of 5-10 year olds have

lunch and 84% breakfast. In contrast, 92% of 11-18 year olds have lunch and 74% breakfast. 14

 4. Empirical Strategy

        We exploit two plausibly exogenous sources of variation. One is the timing of SNAP

benefit receipt, and the other is the timing of FoodAPS data collection. We take advantage of the



week and interview month fixed effects. Sample limited to children interviewed when school was in session. Results
reported in table A1 in the appendix.
12
   According to the FAFH Item data codebook, food items were identified as part of a school meal using the School
Nutrition Dietary Assessment Study (SNDA-IV) collected during 2009-2011. Thus, the FAFH-item dataset includes
variables that classified items as part of a school meal, indicating whether those items are part of a reimbursable
meal or not. We use the variables MENUID and MENUGRP as well as NONSCHLITEM to identify subsidized
school meals from non-school meals that may have happened at school.
13
   We also created an alternative measure that equals 1 for free school lunch and school lunches that cost between
$0.3 and $0.4 and would qualify as reduced-price meals. There are very few observations in this group (93 overall)
and all results reported in the paper are not sensitive to using this measure. Results available from authors.

   All reported means weighted by household sampling weights.

                                                                                                                14
fact that in most states the date of SNAP benefit receipt is assigned based on the social security

number, case number, or first letter of recipients’ last name, 15 and so the precise timing is

credibly exogenous and uncorrelated with other key variables. (See Figure A1 for the distribution

of SNAP pay dates in our data.) Second, we use the timing of FoodAPS data collection relative

to the SNAP benefit cycle, which is also random. The implication is that we have variation in the

time of SNAP payments that is uncorrelated with relevant household characteristics in the

survey. (See Figure A2 for the frequency distribution by days since SNAP pay in our data.)

        We use two distinct empirical approaches. The first estimates a short-run effect of SNAP

on school lunch and breakfast participation. The second explores patterns of participation over

the entire SNAP month. Our first analyses focus on the households that received a SNAP

payment during data collection week (days one to seven). 16 There are a total of 170 school-aged

children in these households amounting to 1,008 kid-day weekday observations and 806 kid-day

observations when school was in session. For most children in this sample we have observations

both before and after SNAP pay, however, for those in households that received payments on the

first (last) day of data collection we only have data for their post (pre) SNAP pay period. 17

        We estimate the following baseline specification for lunch participation and breakfast

participation separately:

                𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑋𝑋′𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝜃𝜃 + 𝛿𝛿𝑑𝑑 + 𝜇𝜇𝑚𝑚 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

Sets. https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/snap-policy-data-sets/
16
   Note that we use ERS cleaned variable of days since SNAP payment, which assumes for current SNAP
households a 30-day benefit cycle.
17
   Of the 806 kid-day observations there are a total of 305 observations before SNAP pay and 501 after SNAP pay.
While we observe most children for five days that is not the case for all of them. To be exact we observe 84.4% of
kids for all seven days of data collection, and over 90% for at least four days. Also note that because we include
children that receive SNAP pay from day one to seven of the data collection week we may observe some children
for five days after SNAP pay and for no days before, while we may observe others for five days pre SNAP pay and
no days after. The rest will have at least one day pre SNAP pay and at most four days post SNAP pay.

                                                                                                                 15
where meal equals 1if i had a “school lunch” (breakfast), or a “non-school lunch” (breakfast) on

day d interview month m. “Post SNAP pay” equals 1 on the day of SNAP pay and every day

after SNAP, and it is zero for all days before SNAP pay. X is a vector of individual and

demographic indicators capturing gender, race, whether i attends a traditional public school, and

whether the household lives in a rural area, in public housing, or has a car. 𝛿𝛿 and 𝜇𝜇 are day of

the week and interview month fixed effects. 𝛽𝛽 is the coefficient of interest and it captures the

short-run effect of SNAP payments on meal participation within a five-day window around the

SNAP payment. It provides a causal estimate of the effect of SNAP payment on school (and non-

school) meal participation if the timing of SNAP payments within the data collection window is

random.

        To test this condition, we performed a balance test comparing the demographic

composition of children before and after SNAP pay. To do so, we regress the “Post SNAP pay”

indicator on the set of individual and household level demographic characteristics. The model

also includes day of the week and interview month fixed effects. We then test for the joint

significance of demographic controls. Result from this test (in table A1) show that demographic

controls do not predict SNAP payment and that the two samples are comparable.

        We estimate an extended specification of this model in which we break the “Post SNAP

pay” dummy into a series of dummy variables indicating: two days pre SNAP pay, one day pre

SNAP pay, day of SNAP pay and post SNAP pay for all days after benefit receipt. In this model

the reference group are days 3 to 5 prior to SNAP payments. This extended specification will

shed light on the existence of pre-trends in participation, and especially on the possibility of an

“anticipation effect”. All models are weighted using household sampling weights. 18


18
  Standard errors are computed using Taylor series linearization that account for the complex structure of the
survey. We also computed standard errors using the household replicate weights and jackknife repeated replication

                                                                                                                16
         The second analyses examine participation over the full SNAP month in a model linking

participation to a set of indicator variables capturing the number of days since the household

received the SNAP payment in five-day intervals. These models use all 1,173 children in the

sample. 19 Individual fixed effects 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 address concerns with unobserved time-invariant individual

heterogeneity. The rest of this model is as before. Specifically, we estimate:

      𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝐷𝐷1𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡5𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝐷𝐷6𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡10𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽4 𝐷𝐷11𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡15𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽5 𝐷𝐷16𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡20𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

D1to5 is an indicator variable taking a value of one for observations in the first five days

following the SNAP payment, and zero otherwise. D6to10 identifies observations in the

following five days, and D11to15, D16to20 and D21to25 are defined accordingly. The

reference period is the last five days in the SNAP month, D26to30. Regressions are weighted

using the household sampling weights, and standard errors are clustered at the household level.

For ease of interpretation, we estimate all regressions using linear probability models. 20

Coefficients should be interpreted directly as percentage point changes in the probability of

school (non-school) meal participation.

 5. Results

Short-run effect of SNAP on meal participation

         We begin by showing demographic characteristics of the different analysis samples in

table 2. Overall, the event study and the full sample look similar. However, children in the event

study sample are more likely to live in a rural area (36.6% versus 18.7%). Table 3 shows mean




technique and we also tested the sensitivity of our estimates using the household weights and clustering the standard
errors at the household level. In all cases standard errors were similar.
19
   We observe 80.39% of children for five weekdays (and seven days overall).
20
   We also estimated the short-run results using logit, which yielded qualitatively similar results. These tables are
available from authors.

                                                                                                                       17
meal participation for SNAP children by sample. As shown, lunch and breakfast participation is

lower in the event study sample than in the non-event study sample (85.7% compared to 91.6%

for lunch, and 68.9% versus 82.5% for breakfast). In general, however, school and non-school

meal participation is comparable across the three samples. Roughly, 46 to 48% of children

participate in school lunch compared to 40 to 43% that acquire non-school lunches. School

breakfast participation rates are much lower – around 22%.

       As shown in table 4, we first show results from our baseline model estimating the effect

of SNAP pay on school lunch and breakfast participation. We show both unadjusted and adjusted

models with individual and household level controls for completeness, but adjusted models are

our preferred specification and so we focus our discussion of the results on those. To begin, we

find large decreases in both school lunch (17 percentage points) and breakfast (20 percentage

points) participation for children aged 11 to 18 after SNAP pay (columns 2 and 4 in panel B). In

contrast, lunch participation does not change for children aged 5 to 10. That said, results suggest

school breakfast might decline by roughly 8 percentage points for this group (column 4 in panel

A), but this coefficient is only significant at the 10% level.

       Columns 6-8 show results for non-school meals. Here we find positive, albeit

insignificant coefficients for teenagers and that non-school breakfast participation decreases

substantially (13 percentage points) for 5-10 year olds immediately after SNAP pay.

       Gaining a full understanding of this short-run effect, however, requires uncovering any

trends in participation in the period before families receive the SNAP benefit. As shown in Table

5, an extended specification reveals that school lunch and breakfast participation starts

decreasing the day before or two days before SNAP pay and is magnified after payment.

Specifically, 11-18 year olds are 18 percentage points less likely to acquire a school lunch the



                                                                                                   18
day before SNAP pay and 23 percentage points less likely to do so after SNAP receipt (column

2, panel B). School breakfast drops 19 percentage points two days before SNAP and continues to

decline relative to the last days of the SNAP benefit cycle. In the days after SNAP receipt, 11-18

year olds are 36 percentage points less likely to acquire a school breakfast than in the days before

SNAP benefit payment (column 4, panel B).

        Is there an opposite trend in non-school meal participation? Non-school meal acquisitions

increase for 11-18 year olds and the increase begins the day before SNAP pay. Results are

positive for both non-school lunch (insignificant) and breakfast (significant). Column 8 shows

non-school breakfast acquisitions rise substantially the day before SNAP pay (26 percentage

points) and continue to rise after SNAP pay (24 percentage points). Taken together, these suggest

that 11-18 year olds substitute school meals for non-school options, and especially non-school

breakfast when they can. We find no such effects for 5-10 year olds, but we do see a large

decrease in non-school breakfast participation after SNAP pay of 28 percentage points (column

8, panel A).

        Overall, findings from these extended specifications provide some evidence of

“anticipation effects” whereby children substitute away from school lunch (breakfast) in the day

(two days) just before a scheduled SNAP payment. Although a fully satisfying theoretical and

empirical investigation of this effect is outside the scope of this paper, it is possible that this

reflects household willingness (or ability) to draw down cash or reserves of food at home

(allowing students to bring lunch or purchase it from outside vendors) in anticipation of an

inflow of new benefits the next day (or day after). To be clear, it may also reflect student

decisions, rather than household decisions, per se, which is consistent with our finding of this

effect within the teenagers but not the younger children. (That is, teenagers may “splurge” using



                                                                                                      19
their own resources at the very end of the SNAP month.)

School and non-school meal participation over the SNAP month

        Results discussed so far focus on the short-term impact of the SNAP payment on school

and non-school meal participation. While they provide evidence that 11-18 year olds substitute

away from school meals at the start of the SNAP benefit cycle, they provide limited insight into

school meal utilization throughout the entire month. If school meals help ameliorate declines in

food consumption at the end of the SNAP month as our event study results suggest, at which

point in the SNAP benefit cycle do families rely more on school meals? Figure 1 shows results

from the full month specification with fixed effects by age for school lunch and non-school lunch

participation and figure 2 shows similar results for breakfast. 21 As shown, among 11-18 year

olds, school lunch participation drops in the first two weeks of the SNAP month reaching the

lowest point on days 11 to 15 (23 percentage point decline), and increasing afterwards. Non-

school lunches increase correspondingly in the first two weeks of the SNAP month for this age

group, peaking on days 11 to 15 with a 22 percentage point increase. Results for 5-10 year olds

are generally not significant. Figure 2 shows similar results for breakfast. School breakfast

acquisitions drop in the first two weeks of the SNAP benefit cycle for 11-18 year olds reaching

the lowest point in the second week with a decline of 21 percentage points and increasing

afterwards. Non-school breakfast acquisitions increase up to days 11 to 15 (19 percentage points)

and then decline. Among 5-10 year olds, we see increases in school breakfast in the first 10 days

of the SNAP month and declines afterwards (although coefficients are largely insignificant).

That said, by days 20 to 25 of the SNAP month there is a large and statistically significant drop

in school breakfast and a corresponding increase in non-school breakfast. Thus, school breakfast

may play a different role in younger children’s food acquisitions (and perhaps consumption).

These results also highlight differences in how older and younger kids use school meals. Note

that children and adolescents in non-SNAP households do not show this pattern of participation

in school and non-school meals throughout the calendar month (see figures A3 and A4 in

appendix).

Robustness tests

           We investigate the sensitivity of our results to alternative ways of controlling for the

timing of payments. In particular, we might be concerned that other payments may be made at

the same time – or complementary times – to SNAP payments. Unfortunately, while FoodAPS

includes information on other sources of income, it does not provide details on the timing of

these payments. We investigate potential bias in two ways. First, since payments are more likely

to be made on the first of the month, we re-estimate our models adding an indicator for the first

of the month. Results are substantively similar. 22 Second, since some sources of income, may be

received on another day of the month – such as the 15th of the month – we re-estimate with,

calendar week controls (in five-day intervals). As shown in tables 6 and 7, results are

qualitatively unchanged in short-run models, although some breakfast coefficients are smaller

and lose statistical significance. Of particular interest, the anticipation effect remains. Full month

specifications results are also qualitatively similar. 23

           We explore the robustness of results in a number of other ways. First, we re-estimated

our baseline specifications adding an indicator variable for whether the SNAP payment was

received on a weekend, following the Castellari et al (2016) finding that weekend payments

affect households’ consumption and purchasing behavior differently. As shown in Tables A5 and


22

                                                                                                      21
A6, our findings remain largely unchanged. (Full month results are also largely uncharged by the

addition of this variable.) 24

           Second, we stratified models by school level instead of age following the logic that,

differences in children’s ability to procure non-school meals may vary by grade level (K-

elementary school vs middle and high school) rather than by age. For example, students in

middle and high school might have open campuses that may be less common for children in

elementary school and kindergarten. Tables 8 and 9 show results for the baseline and the

extended specifications. Overall, results are robust to this alternative. As before, baseline results

in table 8 show a drop in school lunch participation only for children in middle and high school

of 19 percentage points. School breakfast acquisitions decline for K-elementary students and

middle and high school students after SNAP pay by 15 percentage points and 19 percentage

points, respectively (column 4) providing additional evidence that children use school lunch and

breakfast quite differently. The extended specification in table 9 also confirms results reported

above. Declines in school lunch acquisitions begin the day before SNAP pay for children in

middle and high school with a 21 percentage point drop (column 2). This decline continues after

SNAP pay and it is roughly 25 percentage points. School breakfast also decreases for children in

K-elementary school immediately after SNAP pay (panel A, column 4). This decline begins two

days before SNAP payments for children in middle school and high school and magnitudes are

similar as those reported in models stratified by age.

           Full month models stratified by grade show declines in school lunch and breakfast for

children in middle and high school earlier in the SNAP month and increases in non-school meal

acquisitions toward the end of the month. 25 Results for children in K-elementary school are

 6. Discussion

         In this paper, we examine the relationship between the timing of SNAP benefit payments

and school lunch and breakfast participation. We use two empirical strategies that allow us to

estimate effects in the short-run (over a five-day window) as well as over the full SNAP month.

Results using the two strategies yield similar conclusions. Teenagers 11 to 18 years old

substantially decrease their school meal participation immediately after SNAP payments and for

the first two weeks of the benefit cycle. In contrast, they seem to increase their non-school meal

acquisitions during this time. Specifically, we find decreases between 17 percentage points and

36 percentage points for school meals and increases between 13 percentage points and 26

percentage points for non-school meals. These are not small changes. For example, recent

evidence on universal free lunch in New York City found increases in lunch participation

ranging from 5 to 11 percentage points for poor and non-poor students, respectively (Schwartz

and Rothbart, 2016). Interestingly, we do not see similar decreases in school lunch participation

post SNAP pay for 5-10 year olds. This is an important finding because middle and high school

students are less likely to participate in school meals (Mirtcheva and Powell, 2009) and they are

also less protected from food insecurity relative to younger children (Moffitt and Ribar 2018).

Adolescents may have more attractive competing options or the stigma associated with

subsidized lunches is higher for them, preferring to bring lunch from home or purchase from

other vendors instead. FoodAPS, unfortunately, does not provide information about the school



26
   We tested the robustness of our results to alternative age breakdowns. We re-estimated all models stratifying the
sample between 5-12 year olds and 13-18 year olds. We still see declines in school lunch and breakfast for
adolescents that are of similar magnitude as those reported in the paper but are only statistically significant in the
extended specification for school breakfast. Note that in the short-run models our sample for teenagers is cut by
almost half, thus we are likely underpowered to detect any statistically significant differences for this group. Full
month models are consistent with reported results. Tables available from authors.

                                                                                                                     23
food environment facing children, whether they have access to an open campus, or whether

schools serve “a la carte” menu items. Thus, we are limited in our ability to explore how these

characteristics of the meal options available to children affect their choices. As for where

teenagers acquire non-school meals, our examination of the FAFH data suggest 11-18 year olds

do use outside options such as restaurants and other fast food places, groceries and convenience

stores, as well as family and friends when they can, which aligns with qualitative evidence

(Bailey-Davis et al, 2013). Interestingly, we observe that most non-subsidized meals away from

home happen at school. Future research could use the FAFH items dataset to try to uncover

differences in the items acquired between meals at school coded as subsidized options and those

that are not on days before and after SNAP benefit receipt to determine the role that competing

options play in children’s meal choices. It is important to note that any analyses that explore non-

school options are limited by the inability to use FoodAPS to fully distinguish meals (and the

items of those meals) that were brought to school but prepared in the home, which could be

another important source of substitution for children. Indeed, of non-school meals reported in

FoodAPS roughly 73% appear in the M&SF only, suggesting a large share of non-school options

are meals prepared at home to eat at school. These competing options may vary substantially in

quality or nutritional value. This analysis may provide helpful insights into the design and

benefits of school meal programs relative to multiple competing options (Kline and Walters

2016).

         Overall, findings in this paper suggest that school lunch may ameliorate declines in food

consumption at the end of the SNAP month. As such, it provides additional insights into the

different coping strategies of SNAP households to maintain food consumption throughout the

SNAP month. Specifically, our findings suggest that SNAP households do not fully smooth



                                                                                                  24
consumption. Older children increase reliance on school meals toward the end of the SNAP

cycle but choose non-subsidized options earlier in the SNAP month. That said, whether this

behavior results in decreases in healthy eating or declines in nutritional intake remains a question

for future work, as suggested by Cotti et al. (2018) which shows lower academic performance at

the end of the SNAP cycle.

         Finally, while we are unable to directly explore the interaction between SNAP, school

meals, and other income sources (i.e.cash benefit programs or wages) since FoodAPS does not

include their receipt dates, these interactions may be important and warrant future work drawing

on alternative data sources.

       The findings in this paper may prove useful for school food managers and future work

might fruitfully explore the determinants of participation in school meals and the potential

implications for policy and practice. Menu planning is the responsibility of local school food

authorities and knowing when children are more (less) likely to rely upon school meals might

usefully inform decisions regarding offerings. There is, to our knowledge, no research examining

changes in school lunch provision in response to changes in family resources over the month,

though Figlio and Winicky (2005) suggest that school authorities may respond to other

incentives such as accountability pressures by altering the caloric content of school meals.

       As for policy implications unrelated to the school food environment, we need to further

understand possible consequences of the substitution between school and non-school meals for

children’s health and diet. The quality of school meals has improved with the adoption of the

Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act in 2010 and our own estimates using FoodAPS suggest that

participation in school meals is positively correlated with the Healthy Eating Index (HEI).

Specifically, we estimate that acquiring school lunch on a day increases the HEI by 5 to 7 points



                                                                                                 25
for 11-18 year olds and 5-10 year olds, respectively. Thus, it would be important to understand

whether the decrease in non-school meals we find in this paper negatively impacts the quality of

teenagers’ diet.

        There are some limitations worth noting. The relationship between SNAP and school

lunch may depend on where people live. While the cost of living varies across the different states

and areas of the country, SNAP benefits remain the same, which may negatively affect a

household’s resources. The relationship between school meal participation and SNAP may, thus,

vary across states and cities. Further, there may also be differences based on access to food

outlets. Families with less access to SNAP eligible stores may make one trip at the start of the

month and use more school lunch toward the end of the month compared to families that make

frequent trips. Exploring these differences is a task for future work. Second, FoodAPS collects

no information about school outcomes, and as a result, we are unable to dig deeper on the

alternative meal options facing children. Specifically, we are unable to distinguish children who

do not acquire lunch at school because they use outside options versus those who were absent

from school on that day.

        Finally, more work should be done regarding the role of summer meals and their ability

to ameliorate food insecurity at the end of the SNAP month. The Summer Food Service Program

(“Summer Meals Program”) provides free meals to children aged 18 and under living in low

income areas. According to the FNS, however, only 3.8 million children participate in the

Summer Meals Program. Using FoodAPS, we find suggestive evidence that the availability of

school meals during the school year might protect young children’s lunch consumption

compared to the summer months. 27 Understanding whether the Summer Meal Program can play


27
  Using a difference-in-difference approach, we investigate whether the probability of having lunch (any lunch)
after SNAP pay differs between school year and the summer months. To do so, we estimate the baseline model with

                                                                                                             26
a similar role when school is not in session and under what circumstances can have important

policy implications.




an interaction between “Post SNAP pay” and “school year”, and a “school year” dummy. Results show that after
SNAP pay 5-10 year olds are 13 percentage points more likely to have a lunch during the school year relative to the
summer months; however, this coefficient is not statistically significant. For teenagers our difference-in-difference
estimate suggest a decline in lunch (-0.05 percentage points) but this coefficient is also not statistically significant.
There are only 202 observations interviewed during the summer in this sample, and only 73 observations aged 5-10
years old and 129 aged 11-18 years old, severely limiting our ability to extract meaningful conclusions from these
models.

Data Appendix

Data used for this paper comes from the Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS)
restricted files, which we accessed through the NORC data enclave. We use five of FoodAPS data
sources as detailed below:

Individual level data (FI)
This is individual level dataset provides demographic and other information about FoodAPS
participants. The data contain one observation per survey respondent. We use this data source to
identify children in the FoodAPS sample. We identify children using their age (AGEGROUP).
Additionally, we use this dataset to obtain basic demographic information: gender, race, whether
the child attends public school, and school level. The school level variable (SCHLEVEL) allows us
to restrict our sample to children attending K-12 school. These data include one observation per
child, so in creating our final dataset we transform them into a child-day panel.

Household level data (FH)
We matched the child sample to the household level data using the unique household identifier
(HHNUM). FH data provide information on the characteristics of the household, including their
SNAP status. This dataset allows us to identify children in current SNAP households
(SNAPNOWHH) and those that are poor but not on SNAP (using the TAGETGROUP variable).
We also use this dataset to construct additional control variables: such as whether the household
lives in a rural area (RURAL), in public housing (HOUSINGPUB), and whether the household has
a car (AUTO). This dataset also includes the variable SNAPDAYS, which counts the days since
SNAP payment relative to the survey date. There are two versions of this variable, in this paper we
use the ERS cleaned version, which assumes a 30-day benefit cycle. After matching children from
FI to their household we create the child-day panel.

Food away from home event data (FAFH-event)
This is an event (meal) level dataset. That is, these data include a meal identifier as well as the
ability to match that meal to an individual in FI. We matched the child-day data using a unique
identifier that is the combination of the individual id (PNUM/WHOGOTPNUM) and the household
id (HHNUM) and day. We use the event level dataset to select meals that happened at school or
not, as well as to identify whether those meals were free or not.

 Food away from home item data (FAFH-item)
This is an item-level dataset that provides information about the specific items in each event (meal)
in FAFH-event. We use these data to identify meals that are classified as school meals (MENUID
and MENUGRP). The FAFH-item data also provide and indicator of whether items in the meal are
not part of reimbursable meals (NONSCHMEALITEM). We matched these variables to FAFH-
Event data using the common event identifier (EVENTID).

Meals and Snack Forms (M&S)
This is an individual level dataset that provides information whether an individual acquired a
breakfast, lunch, snack, or dinner on a given day. This data source provides no additional
information. We match these data to the child-day dataset we constructed by unique child id as
described before and day.
