Are Sticky Prices Costly? Evidence From The Stock Market

                                                 ABSTRACT

We propose a simple framework to assess the costs of nominal price adjustment using stock market
returns. We document that, after monetary policy announcements, the conditional volatility rises more
for firms with stickier prices than for firms with more flexible prices. This differential reaction is economically
large as well as strikingly robust to a broad array of checks. These results suggest that menu costs---broadly
defined to include physical costs of price adjustment, informational frictions, etc.---are an important
factor for nominal price rigidity. We also show that our empirical results qualitatively and, under
plausible calibrations, quantitatively consistent with New Keynesian macroeconomic models where
firms have heterogeneous price stickiness. Since our approach is valid for a wide variety of theoretical
models and frictions preventing firms from price adjustment, we provide ``model-free'' evidence that
sticky prices are indeed costly.

In principle, fixed costs of changing prices can be observed and measured. In practice, such
costs take disparate forms in different firms, and we have no data on their magnitude. So
the theory can be tested at best indirectly, at worst not at all. Alan Blinder (1991)


Are sticky prices costly?        This simple question stirs an unusually heated debate in
macroeconomics.        While there seems to be a growing consensus that prices at the
micro-level are fixed in the short run,1 it is still unclear why firms have rigid prices.
A central tenet of New Keynesian macroeconomics is that firms face fixed “menu” costs
of nominal price adjustment which can rationalize why firms may forgo an increase in
profits by keeping existing prices unchanged after real or nominal shocks. However, the
observed price rigidity does not necessarily entail that nominal shocks have real effects
or that the inability of firms to adjust prices burdens firms. For example, Head et al.
(2012) present a theoretical model where sticky prices arise endogenously even if firms
are free to change prices at any time without any cost. This alternative theory has vastly
different implications for business cycles and policy. How can one distinguish between
opposing motives for price stickiness? The key insight of this paper is that in New
Keynesian models, sticky prices are costly to firms, whereas in other models they are
not. While the sources and types of “menu” costs are likely to vary tremendously across
firms thus making the construction of an integral measure of the cost of sticky prices
extremely challenging, looking at market valuations of firms can provide a natural metric
to determine whether price stickiness is indeed costly. In this paper, we exploit stock
market information to quantify these costs and—to the extent that firms equalize costs
and benefits of nominal price adjustment—“menu” costs. The evidence unambiguously
supports the New Keynesian interpretation of price stickiness.
       Specifically, we merge confidential micro-level data underlying the producer price
index (PPI) from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) with stock price data for individual
firms from NYSE Trade and Quote (taq). As a first pass, we sort firms into portfolios based
on the frequency of price adjustment and then compare returns across portfolios to provide
  1
      Bils and Klenow (2004), Nakamura and Steinsson (2008).

a metric of the costs over a broad spectrum of shocks and amplification/propagation
mechanisms. We find that the premium for holding the portfolio populated by firms with
the stickiest prices relative to the portfolio populated by firms with the most flexible
prices is up to 4% per year even after controlling for standard risk factors. This premium
is equivalent to at least 0.3% - 0.8% loss in revenue.
    While this summary statistic provides a simple metric, it does not explain how
nominal rigidities affect firms at the micro level. To identify a causal effect of price
rigidity on stock returns, we use rich cross-sectional heterogeneity of firm characteristics
and high frequency stock market data. Our source of variation are monetary shocks
identified as the difference between futures on the fed funds rates—the main policy
instrument of the Fed—in a narrow time window around press releases of the Federal
Open Market Committee (FOMC). We calculate the response of returns for firms with
different frequencies of price adjustment over the same window.
    To guide our empirical analyses, we show in a basic New Keynesian model that firms
with stickier prices should experience a greater increase in the volatility of returns than
firms with more flexible prices after a nominal shock. Intuitively, firms with larger costs of
price adjustment tolerate larger departures from the optimal reset price. Thus, the range
in which the discounted present value of cash flows can fluctuate is wider. The menu cost
in this theoretical exercise is generic and, hence, our framework covers a broad range of
models with inflexible prices.
    Consistent with this logic, we find that returns for firms with stickier prices exhibit
greater volatility after monetary shocks than returns of firms with more flexible prices,
with the magnitudes being broadly in line with the estimates from a calibrated New
Keynesian model with heterogeneous firms: a hypothetical monetary policy surprise of 25
basis points (bps) leads to an increase in squared returns of 8% for the firms with stickiest
prices. This sensitivity is reduced by a factor of three for firms with the most flexible
prices in our sample. Our results are robust to a large battery of specification checks,
subsample analyses, placebo tests, and alternative estimation methods.
    Our work contributes to a large literature aimed at quantifying the costs of price
adjustment. Zbaracki et al. (2004) and others measure menu costs directly by keeping


                                              3
records of costs associated with every stage of price adjustments at the firm level (data
collection, information processing, meetings, physical costs). This approach sheds light
on the process of adjusting prices, but it is difficult to generalize these findings given the
heterogeneity of adjustment costs across firms and industries. Our approach is readily
applicable to any firm with publicly traded equity, independent of industry, country or
location. A second strand (e.g., Blinder (1991)) elicits information about costs and
mechanisms of price adjustment from survey responses of managers. This approach
is remarkably useful in documenting reasons for rigid prices but, given the qualitative
nature of survey answers, it cannot provide a magnitude of the costs associated with
price adjustment. In contrast, our approach provides a quantitative estimate of these
costs. A third group of papers (e.g. Klenow and Willis (2007), Nakamura and Steinsson
(2008)) integrates menu costs into fully fledged dynamic stochastic general equilibrium
(DSGE) models. Menu costs are estimated or calibrated at values that match moments
of aggregate (e.g. persistence of inflation) or micro-level (e.g. frequency of price changes)
data. This approach is obviously most informative if the underlying model is correctly
specified. Given the striking variety of macroeconomic models in the literature and limited
ability to discriminate between models with available data, one may be concerned that
the detailed structure of a given DSGE model can produce estimates that are sensitive to
auxiliary assumptions necessary to make the model tractable or computable. In contrast,
our approach does not have to specify a macroeconomic model and thus we can make our
estimates robust to alternative assumptions about the structure of the economy.
    Our paper is also related to the literature investigating the effect of monetary policy
shocks on asset prices. In a seminal study, Cook and Hahn (1989) use an event study
framework to examine the effects of changes in the federal funds rate on bond rates using a
daily event window. They show that changes in the federal funds target rate are associated
with changes in interest rates in the same direction with larger effects at the short end of
the yield curve. Bernanke and Kuttner (2005)—also using a daily event window—focus
on unexpected changes in the federal funds target rate. They find that an unexpected
interest rate cut of 25 basis points leads to an increase in the CRSP value weighted market
index of about 1 percentage point. Guerkaynak et al. (2005) focus on intraday event


                                              4
windows and find effects of similar magnitudes for the S&P500. In addition, besides the
impact on the level of returns, monetary policy surprises also lead to greater stock market
volatility. For example, consistent with theoretical models predicting increased trading
and volatility after important news announcements (e.g. Harris and Raviv (1993) and
Varian (1989)), Bomfim (2003) finds that the conditional volatility of the S&P500 spikes
after unexpected FOMC policy movements. Given that monetary policy announcements
also appear to move many macroeconomic variables (see e.g. Faust et al. (2004b)), these
shocks are, thus, a powerful source of variation in the data.
      There are several limitations to our approach. First, we require information on
returns with frequent trades to ensure that returns can be precisely calculated in narrow
event windows. This constraint excludes illiquid stocks with infrequent trading. We focus
on the constituents of the S&P500 which are all major US companies with high stock
market capitalization.2 Second, our methodology relies on unanticipated, presumably
exogenous shocks that influence the stock market valuation of firms. A simple metric of
this influence could be whether a given shock moves the aggregate stock market. While
this may appear an innocuous constraint, most macroeconomic announcements other
than the Fed’s (e.g. the surprise component of announcements of GDP or unemployment
figures by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and BLS) fail to consistently move the
stock market in the U.S. Third, our approach is built on “event” analysis and therefore
excludes shocks that hit the economy continuously. Finally, we rely on the efficiency of
financial markets.
      The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The next section describes how our
measures of price stickiness at the firm level are constructed. Section III presents evidence
on differential returns across portfolios sorted on price stickiness. Section IV lays out both
a static and a dynamic version of a New Keynesian model with sticky prices and provides
guidance for our empirical specification and a likely range of parameter estimates for this
empirical specification in a calibrated version of the dynamic model. This section also
discusses our high frequency identification strategy employing nominal shocks from fed
  2
   Given high volume of trades for these firms, news are quickly incorporated into stock prices. For
example, Zebedee et al. (2008) among others show that the effect of monetary policy surprises is
impounded into prices of the S&P500 within minutes.

funds futures and the construction of our variables and controls. Section V presents the
estimates of the sensitivity of squared returns to nominal shocks as a function of price
stickiness. Section VI concludes.



                     II    Measuring Price Stickiness
A key ingredient of our analysis is a measure of price stickiness at the firm level. We
use the confidential microdata underlying the PPI of the BLS to calculate the frequency
of price adjustment for each firm. The PPI measures changes in selling prices from the
perspective of producers, as compared to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) which looks
at price changes from the consumers’ perspective. The PPI tracks prices of all goods
producing industries such as mining, manufacturing, gas and electricity, as well as the
service sector. The PPI covers about three quarters of the service sector output.
    The BLS applies a three stage procedure to determine the individual goods included in
the PPI. In the first step, the BLS compiles a list of all firms filing with the Unemployment
Insurance system.     This information is then supplemented with additional publicly
available data which is of particular importance for the service sector to refine the universe
of establishments.
    In the second step, individual establishments within the same industry are combined
into clusters. This step ensures that prices are collected at the price forming unit as several
establishments owned by the same company might constitute a profit maximizing center.
Price forming units are selected for the sample based on the total value of shipments or
the number of employees.
    After an establishment is chosen and agrees to participate, a probability sampling
technique called disaggregation is applied. In this final step, the individual goods and
services to be included in the PPI are selected. BLS field economists combine individual
items and services of a price forming unit into categories, and assign sampling probabilities
proportional to the value of shipments. These categories are then further broken down
based on price determining characteristics until unique items are identified. If identical
goods are sold at different prices due to e.g. size and units of shipments, freight type,


                                              6
type of buyer or color then these characteristics are also selected based on probabilistic
sampling.
       The BLS collects prices from about 25,000 establishments for approximately 100,000
individual items on a monthly basis. The BLS defines PPI prices as “net revenue accruing
to a specified producing establishment from a specified kind of buyer for a specified
product shipped under specified transaction terms on a specified day of the month”.3
Taxes and fees collected on behalf of federal, state or local governments are not included.
Discounts, promotions or other forms of rebates and allowances are reflected in PPI prices
insofar as they reduce the revenues received by the producer. The same item is priced
month after month. The BLS undertakes great efforts to adjust for quality changes and
product substitutions so that only true price changes are measured.
       Prices are collected via a survey which is emailed or faxed to participating
establishments. The survey asks whether the price has changed compared to the previous
month and if yes, the new price is asked.4 Individual establishments remain in the sample
for an average of seven years until a new sample is selected in the industry. This resampling
occurs to account for changes in the industry structure and changing product market
conditions within the industry.5
       We calculate the frequency of price adjustment as the mean fraction of months with
price changes during the sample period of an item.6 For example, if an observed price path
is $4 for two months and then $5 for another three months, there is one price change during
five months and hence the frequency is 1/5. Because data may have missing values, we
construct different measures of the frequency of price adjustment, S. In the first approach,
labeled A, we treat missing values as interrupting price spells. For example, if a price was
   3
      See Chapter 14, BLS Handbook of Methods, available under http://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/.
   4
      This two stage procedure might lead to a downward bias in the frequency of price adjustment.
Using the anthrax scare of 2001 as a natural experiment, Nakamura and Steinsson (2008) show, however,
that the behavior of prices is insensitive to the collection method: during October and November 2001
all government mail was redirected and the BLS was forced to collect price information via phone calls.
Controlling for inflation and seasonality in prices, they do not find a significant difference in the frequency
of price adjustment across the two collection methods.
    5
      Goldberg and Hellerstein (2011) show that forced product substitutions and sales are negligible in
the microdata underlying the PPI.
    6
      We do not consider the first observation as a price change and do not account for left censoring of
price spells. Bhattarai and Schoenle (2012) verify that explicitly accounting for censoring does not change
the resulting distribution of probabilities of price adjustments.



                                                      7
$4 for two months, then misses for a month, and is again observed at $5 for another three
months, we treat the data as reporting two price spells with durations of two and three
months where none of the spells has a price change and hence the frequency is zero. In
the second approach, labeled B, missing values do not interrupt price histories. In the
previous example, approach B concatenates spells of $4 and $5 prices and yields one price
change in five months so that the frequency is 1/5. Approach C takes the union of A and
B, that is, there is a price change if either A or B identify a price change.7
      We aggregate frequencies of price adjustments at the establishment level and further
aggregate the resulting frequencies at the company level.               The first aggregation is
performed via internal establishment identifiers of the BLS. To perform the firm level
aggregation, we manually check whether establishments with the same or similar names
are part of the same company. In addition, we search for names of subsidiaries and
name changes e.g.       due to mergers, acquisitions or restructurings occurring during
our sample period for all firms in our financial dataset.            We calculate both equally
weighted frequencies, U and frequencies weighted by values of shipments associated with
items/establishments, W .
      Table 1 reports mean probabilities, standard deviations and the number of firm-event
observations for our measures of the frequency of price adjustment, both for the total
sample and for each industry separately. As results are similar across different measures,
we focus on the statistics for measure SAU , which is the frequency of price adjustment
calculated with the procedure A and equal weights across items/establishments (U ) within
a firm. The overall mean frequency of price adjustment is 14.66%/month implying an
average duration, −1/ln(1 − SAU ), of 6.03 months. There is a substantial amount of
heterogeneity in the frequency across sectors, ranging from as low as 8.07%/month for the
service sector (implying a duration of almost one year) to 25.35%/month for agriculture
(implying a duration of 3.42 months). Finally, the high standard deviations highlight
dramatic heterogeneity in measured price stickiness across firms even within industries.
  7
     When calculating the frequency of price adjustment, we exclude price changes due to sales. We
identify sales using the filter employed by Nakamura and Steinsson (2008). Including sales does not
affect our results in any material way because, as documented in Nakamura and Steinsson (2008), sales
are rare in producer prices.



                                                 8
                               III       Portfolio Returns
As a first pass at the data, we take the standard approach in finance and sort firms
into portfolios based on our firm-specific measure of price stickiness. Sorting stocks into
portfolios has the advantage of diversifying idiosyncratic noise and focusing on the risk
premium associated with price rigidities.8 Once stocks are sorted into portfolios, we
compare returns across portfolios. A spread in returns can provide a simple summary
statistic of how price stickiness is related to stock returns. To construct these portfolios, we
follow Weber (2013) and sort all stocks in our sample with non-missing frequency of price
adjustment SAU into five portfolios based on SAU. Each January from 1963 till 2011 we
rebalance portfolios and weight returns equally within each portfolio. Panel A of Table 2
reports the mean of our sorting instrument, the frequency of price adjustment as well as the
implied duration in months. By construction, the frequency is monotonically increasing
from as low as 1%/month for the most sticky price portfolio to 36%/month for the portfolio
containing the most flexible price firms resulting in a difference in duration of more than 5
years. We see in Panel B that this sorting generates a spread in annualized sample mean
returns between sticky and flexible price portfolios of 2.5-3.7% per year depending on the
sample period. This premium is statistically significant and economically large. Mean
returns are monotonically decreasing with increasing price flexibility. To disentangle a
potential premium for price stickiness from compensation for other risk factors, we control
for exposure to the Fama-French factors in Panel C. Annualized Fama-French alphas are
also decreasing with increasing portfolio number resulting in an annualized spread in
risk adjusted returns of around 1.5-2.5% depending on the sample period but the results
continue to stay economically and statistically significant.9
   8
     As the measure of price stickiness is also not strongly correlated with firm characteristics known
to be associated with differences in returns, such as market capitalization or the book to market ratio,
sorting into portfolios, therefore might also diversify away exposure to risk factors and a potential spread
in returns across portfolios can be interpreted as premium for holding sticky price firms. Table 6 in the
online appendix contains descriptive statistics and correlations of firm characteristics and risk factors.
   9
     Li and Palomino (2009) find no differences in returns for portfolios sorted by price stickiness at the
industry level. In contrast, we construct measures of price stickiness at the firm level. Table 1 documents
that variation of price stickiness within industries is four times larger than variation of price stickiness
across industries (see large standard deviations of measured price stickiness within industries). Focusing
on mean returns at the industry level therefore leaves a lot of heterogeneity unused and biases against
finding differences in returns.



                                                     9
     Since a marginal firm should be indifferent between paying increased costs of raising
capital and paying costs incurred due to price rigidities, one may get a sense of how costly
sticky prices are. To make these spreads comparable to previously reported measures of
“menu” costs, we multiply the spread by the share of capital costs in total revenue so
that the cost is in percent of revenue. In the data (e.g., NBER Productivity Database)
the median capital share in revenue is 0.28. While firms in the S&P500 are likely to be
more capital intensive, we choose a conservative value of 0.2, which is also in line with
the share of gross operating surplus in gross output reported by the BEA. Using our
estimates, the cost of moving from very flexible prices (top quintile; price spell duration
of about 2-3 months) to very rigid prices (bottom quintile; price spell duration of about
5 years) amounts to at least 0.3% to 0.8% of revenue, which is in the ballpark of the
estimate (1.2% of revenue) reported by Zbaracki et al. (2004).
     A limitation of this analysis is that returns may differ across portfolios for reasons
other than price stickiness. For example, portfolios may have different cyclical properties,
capture differences in market power, or heterogeneous responses to different shocks
independent of price stickiness. While controlling for Fama-French factors is likely to
alleviate some of these concerns, we can make the analysis more convincing by exploiting
the rich cross-sectional variation in returns, measured price rigidities and other firm
characteristics at high frequencies so that one can rule out alternative explanations.
We will argue that using monetary policy shocks identified at high frequencies offers
an ideal setting to analyze the relationship between stock returns and price stickiness.
These shocks make identification particularly clear cut and provide a simple but powerful
framework to highlight the mechanism behind the relationship between returns and price
stickiness.



                                IV      Framework
In this section, we outline the basic intuition for how returns and price stickiness are
related in the context of a New Keynesian macroeconomic model. We will focus on one
shock—monetary policy surprises—which has a number of desirable properties. While


                                            10
restricting the universe of shocks to only monetary policy shocks limits our analysis in
terms of providing an integral measure of costs of sticky prices, it is likely to greatly
improve identification and generate a better understanding of how sticky prices and stock
returns are linked. This section also guides us in choosing regression specifications for the
empirical part of the paper and describes how variables are constructed.


A.       Static model

We start with a simple, static model to highlight intuition for our subsequent theoretical
and empirical analyses. Suppose that a second-order approximation to a firm’s profit
function is valid so that the payoff of firm i can be expressed as πi ≡ π(Pi , P ∗ ) = πmax −
ψ(Pi −P ∗ )2 where P ∗ is the optimal price given economic conditions, Pi is the current price
of firm i, πmax is the maximum profit a firm can achieve and ψ captures the curvature of
the profit function.10 The blue, solid line in Figure 1 shows the resulting approximation.
       Furthermore assume that a firm has to pay a menu cost φ if it wants to reset its price.
This cost should be interpreted broadly as not only the cost of re-printing a menu with
new prices but also includes costs associated with collecting and processing information,
bargaining with suppliers and customers, etc. A firm resets its price from Pi to P ∗ only if
the gains from doing so exceed the menu cost, that is, ψ(Pi −P ∗ )2 > φ. If the menu cost is
low (φ = φL ), then the range of prices consistent with inaction (non-adjustment of prices)
is (P L , P L ). If the menu cost is high (φ = φH ), then the range of price deviations from
P ∗ is wider (P H , P H ). As a result, the frequency of price adjustment is ceteris paribus
lower for firms with larger menu costs. Denote the frequency of price adjustment with
λ ≡ λ(φ) with ∂λ/∂φ < 0. We can interpret 1 − λ as degree of price stickiness.
       Without loss of generality, we can assume that prices of low-menu-cost and high-
menu-cost firms are spread in (P L , P L ) and (P H , P H ) intervals, respectively, because
firms are hit with idiosyncratic shocks (e.g. different timing of price adjustments as in
Calvo (1983), firm-specific productivity shocks) or aggregate shocks. Suppose there is a
nominal shock which moves P ∗ to the right (denote this new optimal price with Pnew
                                                                                ∗
                                                                                    )
  10
    This expansion does not have a first-order term in (Pi − P ∗ ) because firm optimization implies that
the first derivative is zero in the neighborhood of P ∗ .



                                                   11
so that the payoff function is now described by the red, dashed line. This shift can push
                                                                             ∗
some firms outside their inaction bands and they will reset their prices to Pnew and thus
                                        ∗      ∗               ∗
weakly increase their payoffs, (i.e. π(Pnew , Pnew ) − π(Pi , Pnew ) > φ). If the shock is not
too large, many firms will continue to stay inside their inaction bands.
     Obviously, this non-adjustment does not mean that firms have the same payoffs after
the shock. Firms with negative (Pi −P ∗ ) will clearly lose (i.e. π(Pi , Pnew
                                                                          ∗
                                                                              )−π(Pi , P ∗ ) < 0)
                                                                        ∗
as their prices become even more suboptimal. Firms with positive (Pi − Pnew ) will clearly
                   ∗
gain (i.e. π(Pi , Pnew )−π(Pi , P ∗ ) > 0) as their suboptimal prices become closer to optimal.
Firms with positive (Pi −P ∗ ) and negative (Pi −Pnew
                                                  ∗
                                                      ) may lose or gain. In short, a nominal
shock to P ∗ redistributes payoffs.
     Note that there are losers and winners for both low-menu-cost and high-menu-cost
firms. In other words, if we observe an increased payoff, we cannot infer that this increased
                                                                           ∗
payoff identifies a low-menu-cost firm. If we had information about (Pi − Pnew ) and/or
(Pi − P ∗ ), that is, relative prices of firms, then we could infer the size of menu costs
directly from price resets. It is unlikely that this information is available in a plausible
empirical setting as P ∗ is hardly observable.
     Fortunately, there is an unambiguous prediction with respect to the variance of
changes in payoffs in response to shocks. Specifically, firms with high menu costs have
larger variability in payoffs than firms with low menu costs. Indeed, high-menu-cost firms
can tolerate a loss of up to φH in profits while low-menu-cost firms take at most a loss of
φL . This observation motivates the following empirical specification:


               (∆πi )2 = b1 × v 2 + b2 × v 2 × λ(φi ) + b3 × λ(φi ) + error.                 (1)


where ∆πi is a change in payoffs (return) for firm i and v is a shock to the optimal price
P ∗ . In this specification, we expect b1 > 0 because a shock v results in increased volatility
of payoffs. We also expect b2 < 0 because the volatility increases less for firms with more
flexible prices. Furthermore, the volatility of profits should be lower for low-menu-cost
firms unconditionally so that b3 < 0. In the polar case of no menu costs, there is no
volatility in payoffs after a nominal shock as firms always make πmax . Therefore, we also



                                               12
expect that b1 + b2 ≈ 0.


B.    Dynamic General Equilibrium Model

While the static model provides intuitive insights about the relationship between payoffs
and price stickiness, it is obviously not well suited for quantitative analyses for several
reasons.   First, empirically we can measure only returns that capture both current
dividends/profits and changes in the valuation of firms. Since returns are necessarily
forward looking, we have to consider a dynamic model. Second, general equilibrium
effects may attenuate or amplify effects of heterogeneity in price stickiness on returns.
Indeed, strategic interaction between firms is often emphasized as the key channel of
gradual price adjustment in response to aggregate shocks. For example, in the presence
of strategic interaction and some firms with sticky prices, even flexible price firms may be
reluctant to change their prices by large amounts and thus may appear to have inflexible
prices (see e.g. Haltiwanger and Waldman (1991) and Carvalho (2006)). Finally, the
sensitivity of returns to macroeconomic shocks is likely to depend on the cross-sectional
distribution of relative prices which varies over time and may be difficult to characterize
analytically.
     To address these concerns, we use a model developed in Carvalho (2006) where firms
are heterogeneous in the degree of price stickiness. In the interest of space, we only verbally
discuss the model and focus on key equations. In this model, a representative household
lives forever. The instantaneous utility of the household depends on consumption and
labor supply. The intertemporal elasticity of substitution for consumption is σ. Labor
supply is firm-specific. For each firm, the elasticity of labor supply is η. Household’s
discount factor is β. Households have a love for variety and have a CES Dixit-Stiglitz
aggregator with the elasticity of substitution θ.
     Firms set prices as in Calvo (1983). There are k sectors in the economy with
each sector populated by a continuum of firms. Each sector is characterized by λk , the
probability of any firm in industry k to adjust its price in a given period. The share of
firms in industry k in the total number of firms in the economy is given by the density
function f (k). Firms are monopolistic competitors and the elasticity of substitution θ

                                              13
is the same for all firms both within and across industries. While this assumption is
clearly unrealistic, it greatly simplifies the algebra and keeps the model tractable. The
production function for output Y is linear in labor N which is the only input. The
optimization problem of firm j in industry k is then to pick a reset price Xjkt :

    We calibrate the model at quarterly frequency using standard parameter values in
the literature (Table 3). Ashenfelter et al. (2010) survey the literature on the elasticity of
labor supply faced by firms. They document that the short-run elasticity is in the 0.1-1.5
range while the long-run elasticity is between 2 and 4. We take the middle of the range
of these elasticities and set η = 2. The elasticity of demand θ is often calibrated at 10 in
macroeconomic studies. However, since firms in our model compete not only with firms in
the same sector but also with firms in other sectors we calibrate θ = 7 which captures the
notion that elasticity of substitution across sectors is likely to be low. Other preference
parameters are standard: σ = 2 and β = 0.99. Parameters of the policy reaction function
are taken from Taylor (1993) and Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2012). We follow Carvalho
(2006) and calibrate the density function f (k) = 1/5 and use the empirical distribution of
frequencies of price adjustment reported in Nakamura and Steinsson (2008) to calibrate
{λk }5k=1 . Specifically, we sort industries by the degree of price stickiness and construct
five synthetic sectors which correspond to the quintiles of price stickiness observed in
the data. Each sector covers a fifth of consumer spending. The Calvo rates of price
adjustment range from 0.094 to 0.975 per quarter with the median sector having a Calvo
rate of 0.277 (which implies that this sector updates prices approximately once a year).
    We solve the model using a third-order approximation as implemented in DYNARE
and simulate the model for 100 firms per sector for 2000 periods, but discard the first
1000 periods as burn-in. For each firm and each time period, we calculate the value of the

                                                15
firm V (Pjkt ) and the value of the firm net of dividend Ṽ (Pjkt ) ≡ V (Pjkt ) − (Pjkt Yjkt+s −
Wjkt+s Njkt+s ) as well as the implied return Rjkt = V (Pjkt )/Ṽ (Pjkt−1 )−1. As we discussed
in the case of the static model, realized returns can increase or decrease in response to a
nominal shock. Hence, we consider the specification suggested in the previous section:

                  2
                 Rjkt = b0 + b1 × vt2 + b2 × vt2 × λj + b3 × λj + error                    (16)


     We report resulting estimates of b1 , b2 and b3 in Table 3 for the baseline calibration
as well as for alternative parameterizations. We find that b̂1 is large and positive while b̂2
is negative with the magnitude such that b̂1 + b̂2 ≈ 0. The estimates of b̂3 are negative,
as predicted, but generally close to zero.
     Obviously, these estimates depend of structural parameters of the model. One may
use empirical moments to infer these structural parameters. The answer in this exercise is
likely to depend on the details of the model, which can limit the robustness. However, this
simulation highlights the relationship between price stickiness and returns and provides
a sense of magnitudes one may expect in a reasonably calibrated New Keynesian model
with heterogeneous firms.


C.     Identification

Identification of unanticipated, presumably exogenous shocks to monetary policy is
central for our analysis.       In standard macroeconomic contexts (e.g.             structural
vector autoregressions), one may achieve identification by appealing to minimum delay
restrictions where monetary policy is assumed to be unable to influence the economy
(e.g. real GDP or unemployment rate) within a month or a quarter. However, asset
prices are likely to respond to changes in monetary policy within days if not hours or
minutes. Balduzzi et al. (2001) show for bonds and Andersen et al. (2003) for exchange
rates that announcement surprises are almost immediately incorporated into asset prices.
Furthermore, Rigobon and Sack (2003) show that monetary policy is systematically
influenced by movements in financial markets within a month. In short, stock prices and
monetary policy can both change following major macroeconomic news and can respond


                                              16
to changes in each other even in relatively short time windows.
    To address this identification challenge, we employ an event study approach in the
tradition of Cook and Hahn (1989) and more recently Kuttner (2001), Bernanke and
Kuttner (2005) and Guerkaynak et al. (2005). Specifically, we examine the behavior of
returns and changes in the Fed’s policy instrument in narrow time windows (30 minutes,
60 minutes, daily) around FOMC press releases. In these narrow time windows, the only
relevant shock (if any) is likely due to changes in monetary policy.
    However, not every change in policy rates affects stock prices at the time of the
change. In informationally efficient markets, anticipated changes in monetary policy
are already incorporated into prices and only the surprise components of monetary
policy changes should matter for stock returns. To isolate the unanticipated part of
the announced changes of the target rate, we use federal funds futures which provide
a high-frequency market-based measure of the anticipated path of the fed funds rate.
This measure has a number of advantages: i) it allows for a flexible characterization
of the policy reaction function; ii) it can accommodate changes in the policy reaction
function of decision makers at the FOMC; and iii) it aggregates a vast amount of data
processed by the market. Krueger and Kuttner (1996) show that federal funds futures
are an efficient predictor of future federal funds rates. Macroeconomic variables such as
the change in unemployment rate or industrial production growth have no incremental
forecasting power for the federal funds rate once the federal funds futures is included in
forecasting regressions. In similar spirit, Guerkaynak et al. (2007) provide evidence that
the federal funds futures dominate other market based instruments in forecasting the
federal funds rate. In short, fed funds futures provides a powerful and simple summary
of market expectations for the path of future fed funds rates. Using this insight, we can
calculate the surprise component of the announced change in the federal funds rate as:

                                   D      0           0
                           vt =       (f ft+∆t + − f ft−∆t− )                        (17)
                                  D−t

                                                             0
where t is the time when the FOMC issues an announcement, f ft+∆t+ is the fed funds

                                 0
futures rate shortly after t, f ft−∆t− is the fed funds futures rate just before t, and D




                                             17
is the number of days in the month.11 The D/(D − t) term adjusts for the fact that
the federal funds futures settle on the average effective overnight federal funds rate. We
follow Guerkaynak et al. (2005) and use the unscaled change in the next month futures
contract if the event day occurs within the last seven days of the month. This ensures
that small targeting errors in the federal funds rate by the trading desk at the New York
Fed, revision in expectations of future targeting errors, changes in bid-ask spreads or
other noise, which have only a small effect on the current month average, is not amplified
through multiplication by a large scaling factor.
       Using this shock series, we apply the following empirical specification to assess
whether price stickiness leads to differential responses of stock returns:


                  Rit2 = b0 + b1 × vt2 + b2 × vt2 × λi + b3 × λi

                            +F irmsControls + F irmsControls × vt2 + error                          (18)


where Rit2 is the squared return of stock i in the interval [t − ∆t− ,t + ∆t+ ] around event t,
vt2 is the squared monetary policy shock and λi is the frequency of price adjustment of firm
i. Below, we provide details on how high frequency shocks and returns are constructed
and we briefly discuss properties of the constructed variables.


D.      Shocks

Federal funds futures started trading on the Chicago Board of Trade in October 1988.
These contracts have a face value of $5,000,000. Prices are quoted as 100 minus the daily
average fed funds rate as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Federal
funds futures face limited counterparty risk due to daily marking to market and collateral
requirements by the exchange. We acquired tick-by-tick data of the federal funds futures
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Globex electronic trading platform

     We implicitly assume in these calculations that the average effective rate within the month is equal
to the federal funds target rate and that only one rate change occurs within the month. Due to changes
in the policy target on unscheduled meetings we have six observations with more than one change in a
given month. As these policy moves were not anticipated, they most likely have no major impact on
our results. We nevertheless analyze intermeeting policy decisions separately in our empirical analyses.
While constructing vt , we have also implicitly assumed that the risk premium does not change in the
[t − ∆t− , t + ∆t+ ] window, which is consistent with results in Piazzesi and Swanson (2008).


                                                   18
(as opposed to the open outcry market) directly from the CME. Using Globex data has
the advantage that trading in these contracts starts on the previous trading day at 6.30
pm ET (compared to 8.20am ET in the open outcry market). We are therefore able
to calculate the monetary policy surprises for all event days including the intermeeting
policy decisions occurring outside of open outcry trading hours. To provide some insights
into the quality of the data and the adequacy of our high frequency identification strategy
we plot the futures based expected federal funds rate for three event dates in Figure 2.12
These plots show two general patterns in the data: high trading activity around FOMC
press releases and immediate market reaction following the press release.
       The FOMC has eight scheduled meetings per year and starting with the first meeting
in 1995, most press releases are issued around 2.15 pm ET. Table 7 in the online appendix
reports event dates, times stamps of the press releases, actual target rates changes as well
as expected and unexpected changes. We obtained these statistics for the period up to
2004 from Guerkaynak et al. (2005). The time stamps of the press releases in the later part
of the sample were provided by the FOMC Freedom of Information Service Act Service
Center. The release times are based on the timing of the first FOMC statement related
story appearing in the press. We consider “tight” and “wide” time windows around the
announcement. The tight (wide) window is 30 (60) minutes and starts ∆t− = 10 (15)
minutes before the press releases are issued.
       Panel A of Table 4 reports descriptive statistics for surprises in monetary policy
for all 137 event dates between 1994 and 2009 as well as separately for turning points in
monetary policy and intermeeting policy decisions. Turning points are target rate changes
in the direction opposite to previous changes. Jensen et al. (1996) argue that the Fed is
operating under the same fundamental monetary policy regime until the first change in
the target rate in the opposite direction. This is in line with the observed level of policy
inertia and interest rate smoothing (cf Piazzesi (2005) as well as Figure 3). Monetary
policy reversals therefore contain valuable information on the future policy stance.
       The average monetary policy shock is approximately zero. The most negative shock
is with more than -45 bps about three times larger in absolute value than the most positive
 12
      Similar plots for the earlier part of our sample can be found in Guerkaynak et al. (2005).



                                                     19
shock. Policy surprises on intermeeting event dates and turning points are more volatile
than surprises on scheduled meetings. Andersen et al. (2003) point out that financial
market react differently on scheduled versus non-scheduled announcement dates. Lastly,
the monetary policy shocks are almost perfectly correlated across the two event windows.
Figure 4 visually confirms this finding in a scatterplot of monetary policy shocks in the
tight event window on the x-axis and the wide event window on the y-axis. Almost all 137
observations line up perfectly along the 45◦ line. August 17, 2007 and December 16, 2008
are the only two exceptions. The first observation is an intermeeting event day on which
the FOMC unexpectedly cut the discount rate by 50 bps at 8.15am ET just before the
opening of the open-outcry futures market in Chicago. The financial press reports heavy
losses for the August futures contract on that day and a very volatile market environment.
The second observation, December 16, 2008, is the day on which the FOMC cut the federal
funds rate to a target range between zero and 0.25 percent.


E.     Event Returns

We sample returns for all constituents of the S&P500 for all event dates. We use the CRSP
database to obtain the constituent list of the S&P500 for the respective event date and
link the CRSP identifier to the ticker of the NYSE taq database via historical CUSIPs (an
alphanumeric code identifying North American securities). NYSE taq contains all trades
and quotes for all securities traded on NYSE, Amex and the Nasdaq National Market
System. We use the last observation before the start of the event window and the first
observations after the end of the event window to calculate event returns. We manually
checked all event returns which are larger than 5% in absolute value for potential data
entry errors in the tick-by-tick data. For the five event dates for which the press releases
were issued before start of the trading session (all intermeeting releases in the easing
cycle starting in 2007, see Table 7 in the online appendix) we calculate event returns
using closing prices of the previous trading day and opening prices of the event day.13
  13
    Intermeeting policy decisions are special in several respects as we discuss later. Markets might
therefore need additional time to fully incorporate the information contained in the FOMC press release
into prices. In a robustness check, we therefore calculate event returns using the first trade after 10am
on the event date. Result do not change materially.



                                                   20
    Our sample period ranges from February 2, 1994, the first FOMC press release in
1994, to December 16, 2009, the last announcement in 2009 for a total of 137 FOMC
meetings. We exclude the rate cut of September 17, 2001—the first trading day after the
terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Our sample starts in 1994 as our tick-by-tick stock
price data is not available before 1993 and the FOMC changed the way it communicated
its policy decisions. Prior to 1994, the market became aware of changes in the federal
funds target rate through the size and the type of open market operations of the New
York Fed’s trading desk. Moreover, most of the changes in the federal funds target rate
took place on non-meeting days. With the first meeting in 1994, the FOMC started to
communicate its decision by issuing press releases after every meeting and policy decision.
Therefore, the start of our sample eliminates almost all timing ambiguity (besides the nine
intermeeting policy decisions). The increased transparency and predictability makes the
use of our intraday identification scheme more appealing as our identification assumptions
are more likely to hold.
    Panel B of Table 4 reports descriptive statistics for the percentage returns of the
S&P500 for all 137 event dates between 1994 and 2009, turnings points and intermeeting
policy decisions. We use the event returns of the 500 firms comprising the S&P500 to
calculate index returns using the market capitalization of the previous trading day as
weights. The average return is close to zero with an event standard deviation of about
one percent. The large absolute values of the tight (30 minute) and wide (60 minute)
event returns are remarkable. Looking at the columns for intermeeting press releases
and turning points, we see that the most extreme observations occur on non-regular
release dates. Figure 5, a scatterplot of S&P500 event returns versus monetary policy
shocks, highlights this point. Specifically, this figure shows a clear negative relation
between monetary policy shocks and stock returns on regular FOMC meetings and on
policy reversal dates in line with Bernanke and Kuttner (2005) and Guerkaynak et al.
(2005). The scatterplot, however, also documents, that anything goes on intermeeting
announcement days: negative (positive) monetary policy shocks induce positive and
negative stock market reactions with about equal probabilities. Faust et al. (2004a) argue
that intermeeting policy decisions are likely to reflect new information about the state


                                            21
of the economy and hence the stock market reacts to this new information rather than
changes in monetary policy. This logic calls for excluding intermeeting announcements as
our predictions are only for exogenous monetary policy shocks.


F.    Firm Controls

Firms are heterogeneous in many dimensions. Ehrmann and Fratzscher (2004) among
others show for S&P500 constituents that firms with low cash flows, small firms, firms with
low credit ratings, high price earnings multiples and Tobin’s q show a higher sensitivity to
monetary policy shocks in line with bank lending, balance sheet and interest rate channels
of monetary policy. To rule out that this heterogeneity drives our results, we control for
an extended set of variables at the firm and industry level. For example, we construct
measures of firm size, volatility and cyclical properties of demand, market power, cost
structure, financial dependence, access to financial markets, etc. We use data from a
variety of sources such as the Standard and Poor’s Compustat database, publications of
the U.S. Census Bureau, and previous studies. The online appendix contains detailed
information on how these variables are measured.



                           V      Empirical Results

A.    Aggregate Market Volatility

We first document the effects of monetary policy shocks on the return of the aggregate
market to ensure that these shocks are a meaningful source of variation. Table 5 reports
results from regressing returns of the S&P500 on monetary policy surprises as well as
squared index returns on squared policy shocks, for our tight event window (30 min) in
regressions (1) to (6) and our wide event window in columns (7) to (12). Column (1)
shows that a higher than expected federal funds target rate leads to a drop in stocks
prices. This effect—contrary to findings in the previous literature—is not statistically
significant. Restricting our sample period to 1994-2004 (or 1994-2007), we can replicate
the results of Bernanke and Kuttner (2005), Guerkaynak et al. (2005), and others: a 25


                                            22
bps unexpected cut in interest rates leads to an increase of the S&P500 by more than
1.3%. In column (3), we find a highly statistically significant impact of squared policy
shocks on squared index returns. Conditioning on different types of meetings, we see that
the overall effect is mainly driven by turning points in monetary policy. The remaining
columns show that widening the event window mainly adds noise, increasing standard
errors and lowering R2 s, but does not qualitatively alter the results. Thus, monetary
policy surprises are valid shocks for our analysis.


B.       Baseline

Table 6 presents results for the baseline specification (18) where we regress squared event
returns at the firm level on the squared policy surprise, the frequencies of price adjustments
and their interactions. To account for correlation of error terms across time and firms,
we report Driscoll and Kraay (1998) standard errors in parentheses. We use the SAU
measure of the frequency of price adjustment, but results are very similar if we use different
measures.14
       Column (1) shows that squared surprises have a large positive impact on squared
stocks returns. The point estimate is economically large and statistically significant at the
1% level: a hypothetical policy surprise of 25 bps leads to an increase in squared returns
of roughly 8% (0.252 × 128.50 = 8.03). The estimated coefficient on the interaction
of the frequency of price adjustment and the squared shock indicates that this effect is
lower for firms with more flexible prices. For the firms with the most flexible prices in
our sample (which have a probability of price adjustment of roughly 0.5 per month),
the impact of squared monetary policy shocks is reduced by a factor of three, that is,
(β1 − 0.5 × β3 )/β1 ≈ 1/3. Importantly, the estimated sensitivity of conditional volatility
to monetary policy shocks across firms with different frequencies of price adjustment is
broadly in line with the estimates we obtained for simulated data from a calibrated New
Keynesian model in Section IV.B. Thus, our empirical results can be rationalized in a
reasonably parameterized macroeconomic model.
       The differential response of conditional volatility for sticky and flexible price firms is
 14
      Detailed results are contained in the online appendix of this paper.


                                                     23
a very robust result. Controlling for outliers (column (2)),15 adding firm fixed effects
(columns (3) and (4)), firm and event (time) fixed effects (columns (5) and (6)), or
looking at a 60 minutes event window (columns (7) and (8)) does not materially change
point estimates and statistical significance for the interaction term between squared policy
surprises and the frequency of price adjustment. Increasing the observation period to a
daily event window (columns (9) and (10)) adds a considerable amount of noise, making
point estimates statistically insignificant but they remain economically large.
       While in the baseline measurement of stock returns we use only two ticks, we find very
similar results (Table 7 columns (1) and (2)) when we weight returns by trade volume in
time windows before and after of our events. The results also do not change qualitatively
when we use absolute returns and policy shocks (columns (3) and (4) of Table 7) instead
of squared returns and squared shocks.
       One may be concerned that the heterogeneity in volatility across firms is largely
driven by market movements or exposure to movements of other risk factors rather than
forces specific to the price stickiness of particular firms. To address this concern, we
consider squared market adjusted returns (i.e. (Rit − RtSP )2 ), squared CAPM adjusted
returns (i.e. (Rit −βi RtSP )2 ), and squared Fama-French adjusted returns ((Rit −βF F RtF F )2 )
where βi and βF F are time series factor loadings of the excess returns of firm i on the
market excess returns and the three Fama-French factors. All three adjustments (Table
7: columns (5) and (6), columns (7) and (8), and columns (9) and (10)) take out a lot
of common variation, reducing both explanatory power and point estimates somewhat
but leaving statistical significance and relative magnitudes unchanged or even increasing
it slightly. Thus, conditional volatility responds differentially across firms even after we
adjust for movements of the aggregate market and other risk factors which itself could be
influenced by nominal rigidities as no firm in our sample has perfectly flexible prices.
       The sensitivity of the conditional volatility to monetary policy shocks may vary across
types of events. For example, Guerkaynak et al. (2005) and others show that monetary
policy announcements about changes in the path/direction of future policy are more
powerful in moving markets. Table 8 contains results for different event types. We restrict
  15
   We use a standard approach of identifying outliers by jackknife as described in Belsley, Kuh, and
Welsch (1980) and Bollen and Jackman (1990).

                                                24
our sample in columns (3) and (4) to observations before 2007 to control for the impact
of the Great Recession and the zero lower bound. The effect of price flexibility increases
both statistically and economically in the restricted sample. In the next two columns, we
follow Bernanke and Kuttner (2005) and restrict the sample only to episodes when the
FOMC changed the policy interest rate. While this reduces our sample size by more than
50%, it has no impact on estimated coefficients. Some of the monetary policy shocks are
relatively small. To ensure that the large effects of price rigidity are not driven by these
observations, we restrict our sample to events with shocks larger than 0.05 in absolute
value in columns (7) and (8). Both for the full and the no outliers samples, statistical
and economic significance remains stable or even slightly increases. The next column
conditions on reversals in monetary policy (i.e. turning points in policy). The coefficient
on the interaction term between the probability of price adjustment and squared policy
shocks increases by a factor of three. The effect of policy shocks is somewhat reduced for
intermeeting releases as shown in the last column.


C.    Additional controls and subsamples

In Table 9 we add a wide range of controls to disentangle the effect of price stickiness from
confounding firm and industry effects. In the first two columns we repeat the baseline
regression for the full and no outliers sample. In the first set of controls, we focus on
measures of market power and profitability. For example, in column (3) we include the
squared shock interacted with the price cost margin (pcm) as an additional regressor.
While firms with larger pcm appear to have volatility more sensitive to monetary policy
shocks, the sensitivity of the volatility across firms with different frequencies of price
adjustment is barely affected by including pcm. Likewise, controlling directly for market
power with industry concentration (the share of sales by the four largest firms, 4F −
conc ratio, column (4)) does not change our main result. We also find that our results
for b2 in equation (18) do not alter when we control for the book to market ratio (column
(5)) or firm size (column (6)).
     The differential sensitivity of volatility across sticky and flexible price firms may
arise from differences in the volatility of demand for sticky and flexible price firms. To

                                             25
eliminate this potentially confounding effect, we explicitly control for the volatility of
sales (standard deviation of sales growth rates, std sale, column (7)) and for durability
of output (columns (8) and (9)) using the classifications of Gomes et al. (2009) and Bils
et al. (2012), respectively. The latter control is important as demand for durable goods is
particularly volatile over the business cycle and consumers can easily shift the timing of
their purchases thus making price sensitivity especially high. Even with these additional
regressors, we find that the estimated differential sensitivity of volatility across sticky and
flexible price firms is largely unchanged.
    Some heterogeneity of stickiness in product prices may reflect differences in the
stickiness of input prices. For example, labor costs are often found to be relatively
inflexible due to rigid wages. In column (10), we control for input price stickiness proxied
by the share of labor expenses in sales and we indeed find that firms with a larger
share of labor cost have greater sensitivity to monetary policy shocks. This additional
control however does not affect our estimates of how stickiness of product prices influences
conditional volatility of returns. In columns (11) to (19), we additionally control for fixed
costs to sales (F C2Y ) as a higher ratio might decrease the flexibility to react to monetary
policy shocks, receivables minus payables to sales ratio (RecP ay2Y ) to control for the
impact of short term financing, investment to sales ratio (I2Y ) to control for investment
opportunities, depreciation to assets ratio (D2A) as a measure of capital intensity, the
rate of synchronization in price adjustments within firm (sync), the number of products
at the firm level (#prod) as well as the S&P long term issuer rating (Rat) and the Kaplan
- Zingales index (KZ) to investigate the impact of financial constraints. Overall, none
of the controls—neither individually nor jointly—attenuates the effect of price stickiness
which is highly statistically and economically significant.
    In Table 10 we run our baseline regression at the industry level to control for possible
unobserved industry heterogeneity. In this exercise, we have typically much fewer firms
and thus estimates have higher sampling uncertainty. Despite large reductions in sample
sizes, for almost all industries we find a statistically significant negative coefficient on the
interaction term between the frequency of price adjustment and squared monetary policy
surprises. For the finance industry, this coefficient is not statistically significant. For the


                                              26
service sector, the estimate for the full sample is positive and significant but this result
is driven by a handful of outliers. Once these outliers are removed, the point estimate
becomes much smaller and statistically insignificantly different from zero.


D.       Relative Volatility and Placebo Test

If inflexible price firms have unconditionally higher volatility than flexible price firms
and this drives the previously documented effects, then we should find no effects of
price stickiness once we scale the event volatilities by their unconditional volatilities.
To implement this test, we pick a pseudo event window in the middle of two adjacent
                                                                                    2
event dates t and t − 1 (date τ = t − 1/2) and calculate a pseudo event volatility Riτ in
a 30 minute window bracketing 2.15pm at date τ . We then scale the event volatilities of
the following event date with these volatilities, Rit2 /Riτ
                                                         2
                                                            , and run our baseline regression
with Rit2 /Riτ
            2
               as the dependent variable.
     Column (1) in Table 11 shows that this story cannot explain our result that
flexible price firms have lower conditional volatilities than sticky price firms. Monetary
policy surprises increase event volatility compared to non-event dates. This conditional
increase is completely offset for the most flexible firms with both coefficients being highly
statistically significant. Controlling for outliers in column (2), firm fixed effects, event
fixed effects or both in columns (3) to (8) does not change this conclusion.
     An alternative test to address the concern that potentially unobserved heterogeneity
drives our results is to directly run our baseline regression on the pseudo event volatilities.
We perform this test in Table 12: all coefficients are economically small, none of them
is statistically significant and once we exclude outliers, the coefficient on the interaction
term between the monetary policy surprise and the frequency of price adjustment changes
signs.


E.       Profits

The large differential effects of price stickiness on the volatility of returns suggest that
firms with inflexible prices should experience an increased volatility of profits relative


                                              27
to firms with flexible prices. This response in fundamentals may be difficult to detect
as information on firm profits is only available at quarterly frequency. To match this
much lower frequency, we sum shocks vt in a given quarter and treat this sum as the
unanticipated shock. Denote this shock with ṽt . We also construct the following measure
of change in profitability between the previous four quarters and quarters running from
t + H to t + H + 3:

                               1
                                   Pt+H+3               Pt−1
                               4    s=t+H   OIis − 14    s=t−4   OIis
                      ∆πit =                                            × 100              (19)
                                             T Ait−1

where OI is quarterly operating income before depreciation, T A is total assets, and H can
be interpreted as the horizon of the response. We use four quarters before and after the
shock to address seasonality of profits. Using this measure of profitability, we estimate
the following modification of our baseline specification:


               (∆πit )2 = b0 + b1 × ∆ṽt2 + b2 × ṽt2 × λi + b3 × λi + error               (20)


    We find (Table 13) that flexible price firms have a statistically lower volatility in
operating income than sticky price firms (b2 < 0). This effect is increasing up to H = 6
quarters ahead and then this difference becomes statistically insignificant and gradually
converges to zero. Firms with more inflexible prices (smaller SAU) tend to have larger
volatility of profits. Interestingly, the estimate of b1 is statistically positive only at H = 0
and turns statistically negative after H = 5.



                         VI         Concluding remarks
Are sticky prices costly? We propose a simple framework to address this question using
the conditional volatility of stock market returns after monetary policy announcements.
We document that the conditional volatility rises more for firms with stickier prices
than for firms with more flexible prices. This differential reaction is economically and
statistically large as well as strikingly robust to a broad spectrum of checks. This result
suggests that menu costs—broadly defined to include physical costs of price adjustment,


                                                 28
informational frictions, etc.—are an important factor for nominal price rigidity. Our
empirical evidence lends support to the New Keynesian interpretation of the observed
nominal price rigidity at the microlevel: sticky prices are costly. Our empirical results
are qualitatively and, under plausible calibrations, quantitatively consistent with New
Keynesian macroeconomic models where firms have heterogeneous price stickiness. Our
“model-free” evidence unambiguously suggests that sticky prices are indeed costly for
firms, which is consistent with the tenets of New Keynesian macroeconomics.

          This figure plots the profit at the firm level as a function of price. Low and high
          menu costs (φL and φH ) translate into small and large bands of inaction within
          which it is optimal for a firm not to adjust prices following nominal shocks. The
          blue, solid line indicates the initial profit function and P ∗ is the initial optimal
          price. For example an expansionary monetary policy shock shifts the profit function
          to the right, indicated by the dashed, red line. Depending on the initial position,
          this shift can either lead to an increase or a decrease in profits as exemplified by
          the arrows.

              Table 1: Frequency of Price Adjustment by Industry
 This table reports average frequencies of price adjustments at the industry and aggregate
 levels with standard deviations in parentheses for different measures of the frequency of price
 adjustment. SA treats missing values as interrupting price spells, for SB, missing values do
 not interrupt price spells if the price is the same before and after periods of missing values
 and SC forms the union of the two. Columns (1) to (3) use equally weighted frequencies
 of price adjustments whereas columns (4) to (6) weight frequencies with associated values
 of shipments. Frequencies of price adjustments are calculated at the firm level using the
 microdata underlying the Producer Price Index constructed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

              Table 4: Descriptive Statistics For High-Frequency Data
 This table reports descriptive statistics for monetary policy shocks (bps) in Panel A and for the
 returns of the S&P500 in Panel B, separately for all 137 event days between 1994 and 2009,
 turning points in monetary policy and intermeeting policy decisions. The policy shock is calculated
 as the scaled change in the current month federal funds futures in a 30 minutes (tight) window
 bracketing the FOMC press releases and a 60 minutes (wide) event window around the release times,
 respectively, according to equation 17. The return of the S&P500 is calculated as weighted average
 of the constituents’ returns in the respective event windows, where the market capitalizations of the
 previous trading days are used to calculate the weights.

     This table reports the results of regressing returns and squared returns in percent of the S&P500 in an event window bracketing the FOMC press releases
     on the federal funds futures based measure of monetary policy shocks calculated according to equation 17, vt , and the squared shocks, vt2 , for different
     event types. See specification 18. Columns (1) to (6) look at a 30 minutes window bracketing the FOMC press releases whereas regressions (7) to (12)
     consider a 60 minutes event window around the release times. The return of the S&P500 is calculated as a weighted average of the constituents’ return
     in the respective event window, where the market capitilization of the previous trading day is used to calculate the weights. The full sample ranges
     from February 1994 through December 2009, excluding the release of September 17th 2001, for a total of 137 observations. Robust standard errors are
     reported in parentheses.

       the microdata underlying the producer price index. Columns (1) and (2) focus on volume weighted returns where the pre- and
       post-event prices are the volume weighted prices of all trades within 10 minutes before start and after end of the event window,
       (3) and (4) look at absolute returns and monetary policy surprises, (5) and (6) use S&P500 adjusted returns (Rit − RtSP )2 , (7)

       The return of the S&P500 is calculated as a weighted average of the constituents’ returns in the event window, where the market
       capitalization of the previous trading day is used to calculate the weights and the returns of the size and book to market factors are
       calculated following the methodology of Fama and French (1993). The full sample ranges from February 1994 through December

                  monetary policy surprises calculated according to equation 17, vt2 and the interaction term with the probability
                  of price adjustment, SAU. See specification 18. SAU treats missing values as interrupting price spells. Equally
                  weighted probabilities of price adjustments are calculated at the firm level using the microdata underlying the
                  producer price index. The full sample ranges from February 1994 through December 2009, excluding the
                  release of September 17th 2001, for a total of 137 observations. Driscoll-Kraay standard errors are reported
                  in parentheses.
