                                          ABSTRACT


     Land and capital serve not only as factors of production but as assets

which households use as stores of value. Standard trade models typically

amount of national savings available for capital investment.

     Foreign investment affects the national economy through both asset

markets and factor markets. When the share of labor in the land—using sector

is large relative to the labor share in the capital—using sector, factor—

market effects are likely to dominate. In this case a drop in the price of

the agricultural good or a rise in the land—labor ratio attracts foreign

investment, while a drop in the world interest rate raises the welfare of a

capital—importing country. If the share of labor in the land—using sector is

smaller, however, asset—market effects dominate. These results are then

likely to be reversed. Even when trade in claims on land equalizes the

domestic and world interest rates, a tax on land raises steady—state welfare.

        The issue of foreign investment in land has been the subject of some

 political concern.' Nevertheless, there is not much economic analysis of the

 causes and consequences of international trade in claims on land. This paper

 analyzes the determinants of foreign ownership of land, and its implications

 for national welfare.

       These issues are explored in a dynamic model in which labor, land and

 capital are used to produce output. In addition, land and capital serve as

 stores of value. Each period the economy is identical to the specific factors

 model described, for example, by Ronald Jones (1971): A manufactured good is

 produced with capital and labor and an agricultural good with land and labor.

       The specific—factors model has become popular in analyzing movements of

capital. Richard Brecher and Ronald Findlay (1983) and T.N. Srinivasan (1983)

provide examples. Unlike the two—factor Heckscher—Ohlin model, the specific—

factors model does not imply that trade in commodities, unless it leads to

complete specialization, removes any incentive for foreign investment. The

formulation determines interior production and investment patterns

simultaneously.

       A limitation of the static specific-factors model as a vehicle to analyze

foreign ownership of land, and foreign investment more generally, is its

treatment of nationally—owned assets as exogenous in supply.    In particular,

the   national supply of capital does not derive from national savings
behavior. The role of land as a store of value that competes with capital is
consequently ignored.
      In the model developed in this paper individual savings determines the
national   capital supply. Savings behavior is the outcome of a simple life-

cycle optimization like that in Paul Samuelson's (1958) overlapping

generations (0L1) model.
                                       2




      Incorporating land and capital together in a dynamic model introduces a

 role for land not only as a factor of production, as in the static specific—

factors model, but as an asset. An important aspect of foreign investment in

land is its effect on the value of this asset and the quantity available to

national investors. These magnitudes in turn have implications for the amount

of capital supplied nationally.

     The analysis addresses three issues. The first is the effect of an

exogenous increase in the amount of land owned by foreigners on the domestic

economy. The effects on the price of land, on factor prices and on welfare

are considered. There is, in fact, no presumption that the price of land

rises in response to more foreign investment. The effect depends upon the

relative labor shares in the two sectors. Increased foreign ownership does

cause the real wage to rise and the interest rate and rent on land to fall,

but the effect on welfare in steady state is ambiguous, depending upon the

initial interest rate, relative labor shares, and the initial amount of

foreign investment.2

     A second concern of this paper is the behavior of the economy under free

trade in claims on land. The paper considers the effects of changes in the

terms of trade, the world interest rate, nd the relative amounts of domestic

factors in fixed supply on foreign investment and welfare.3 One result is

that an increase in the relative price of the agricultural good may raise or

lower the amount of land that foreigners own, but regardless of its effect on

land ownership or trade patterns, an increase in the price of this good always

lowers steady—state welfare. The effects of changes in the world interest

rate and in relative factor supplies on welfare and land ownership are

ambiguous, depending upon factor shares in the two sectors and the initial

foreign investment position. In particular, a country with a low population
                                           3




 density does not necessarily end up with more of its land foreign-owned, and a

 drop in the world interest rate may reduce foreigners' land holdings.4

        The third issue that the paper addresses is the effect of a land tax on

 foreign ownership and on national welfare. This analysis extends to an open

 economy work by Martin Feldstein (1977), Guillermo Calvo, Lawrence Kotlikoff

 and   Carlos Rodriguez (1979) and Christophe Chamley and Brian Wright (1983) who
 show, in a closed economy, that taxing land raises steady—state welfare. The
 reason is that such a tax diverts savings into capital accumulation. The
 interest   rate consequently   fails. Since land serves both as   a   factor of
production   and as a non-depreciating asset, the rate of return in the economy

necessarily exceeds the growth rate. A permanent reduction in the interest

rate consequently raises steady—state welfare, since the economy is brought

closer to the Golden Rule steady state. With free trade in claims on land,

factor prices are unchanged as a consequence of a land tax. Nevertheless, a

tax on land raises steady—state welfare as long as the value of land remains

positive.5

       The outline of the paper is as follows: Section I presents the basic

assumptions of the analysis. The effect of an exogenous increase in foreign—

owned land is examined in Section II. Section III analyzes the economy under

free trade in claims on land, while the issue of the land tax is addressed in

Section IV. Section V provides some concluding remarks.




I. The Model



       In each period t the economy is identical to the three—factor, two-

commodity model of Jones (1971). The manufactured good employs capital and
                                                           4



labor in its production. Its output, given factor inputs K of capital and L

of labor is F(K,L). The agricultural good is produced by land and labor.

Amounts T of land and L of labor produce an output G(T,L). The functions F

and G are continuous, twice—differentiable and linear homogeneous.

      At each period t the economy is endowed with supplies of each factor in

amounts Kt, Lt and Tt. The stock of land is fixed at 1 and the labor force at

L each period. Labor is mobile between sectors, and earns the same wage w in

either activity. Competition in factor markets determines the wage rate, the

interest rate rt, the land rent                       and an allocation of LMt units of labor to

the manufacturing sector. In the absence of a corner solution, equilibrium is

thus described by the equations




(1)        w = FL(Kt,LMt)


           w = ptGL(L          —
(2)                                 LMt)



(3)        rt =   FK(Kt,LMt)


(4)
              =            —               —          —
                  ptG(l_           LMt)        wt(L       LMt)




which determine Wt, rt,                   and LMt as functions of the factor supplies and the

relative price of the agricultural good in period t,                        The manufactured

good serves as numeraire.

      New investment in capital takes the form of currently produced units of

the manufactured good that are not consumed. National savings is determined
                                                  5




 by a simple life—cycle optimization. Individuals live two periods. In the

 first perod of life they provide a unit of labor services to earn a wage w.

 An amount cY is spent on current consumption with the remainder invested in

 land and capital. In the second period the individual consumes the value of

 his assets and the income that they have earned. This amount is denoted C0.

 Lifetime utility as a function of cY, c0, and the relative prices of the

 agricultural good each period, p'" and p°. is given by V'(c,pY) + V°(c°,p°j.

       The price of land is denoted               Denoting the individual 's investment in
 capital as kt and in land as 1t budget constraints imply that

amounts requires that

which implies, with (6), that



(8)        c÷1 =    (1 +       r+i)(w -     c)

       In the working period the individual 's problem is to choose c to

maximize utility, given wt,rt+l, Pt and                  The utility—maximizing level is

        Equilibrium in the markets for land and capital implies that




             Kt+i =               +

(10)         1    =
                      Llt+i       + T

where K+i and T41 denote net foreign investment in capital and land,

respectively, Negative values of these variables imply net ownership of these

assets abroad by nationals.

        The supply of nationally—owned capital K and the price of land                   evolve

according to the two dynamic equations



                  =           -                              —
(11)                  L[Wt            c'(wt,rt+i,pt,pt+i)]

                  -   ________


where                      the share of land owned by nationals.

        Since q does not appear in equations (1) through (4), Wt, rt,                   and LMt

can be expressed as functions of Kt and Pt alone. As Jones (1971), for

example, has demonstrated WK > 0, rK <                       < 0, LMK > 0, w > 0, r < 0,

      > 0, LMp < 0, where XK            = x/oKt   and   x = ôx/ôp   for x   w, r, it,

       In the subsequent analysis foreign investment in capital, K, is assumed

to equal zero. Trade in claims on land constitutes the only form of

international in"stment.

 II. Foreign Investment in Land



        This section treats the amount of land owned by foreigners as exogenous,

and considers the effect of changes in this amount on the capital stock, the

price of land and national welfare, both on steady-state configurations and in

the transition from the initial situation to the new steady state.

        The economy is in steady state when the relative price of the

agricultural comodity is constant over time, at a level denoted , and the

capital stock and price of land are constant values, K and ,     respectively,
that satisfy



(13)        K =     x(K,)    -
                                 Xq

                    w(K,)


            F       r(K,)

                                         8




(K,) is the total savings of workers in steady state.6

       An increase in foreign ownership of domestic land is indicated by an

increase in 1—X. The effects, in steady state, on K and        are given by




              dK

            d(1-X)

                                                        > 0, the condition    > 0 is
       As shown in the appendix, as long as 1 +   crK
necessary and sufficient for the existence of a unique, stable, non—

oscillating convergence path to steady state. This condition states that in

the neighborhood of steady state an increase in the capital stock by a

particular amount raises investment in capital by a lesser amount. If this

stability condition is imposed Proposition 1 follows from equation (15):

        Proposition 1: An increase in the amount of domestic land owned by

foreigners raises the steady—state capital stock, thereby raising the real

wage and lowering the interest rate and rent on land in steady state.

        When more land is owned by foreigners, less is available to national

investors as a store of value. More savings is diverted into capital
                                       9




formation. The capital stock rises with the consequent implications for

factor rewards.

     Imposing the stability condition on equation (16) implies that an

increase in the amount of land owned by foreigners raises or lowers the price

of land depending upon whether VK is positive or negative.

     The term VK indicates the effect of an increase in the steady-state

capital stock on the price of land. Its sign is ambiguous since an increase

in the capital stock has two conflicting effects. One is to raise the real

wage, which reduces the profit earned by land, t. This acts to lower the land

price. The other is to 'lower the interest rate which, given t, raises the

price of land. The first, negative effect dominates if labor's share in

agriculture is larger than its share in manufacturing, and conversely.7 From

this relationship follows:

     Proposition 2: An increase in foreign ownership of domestic land raises

or lowers the price of land depending upon whether the manufacturing sector

has a larger or smaller labor share than the agricultural sector.

     Thus there is no presumption that a permanent increase in the amount of

land owned by foreigners raises the price of land.   If agriculture is labor-

intensive relative to manufacturing, the price falls.

     Consider now the effect of a permanent increase in foreign ownership of

land on the level of welfare that is attained in steady state.

Differentiating utility, U, evaluated at steady state, with respect to (1—X),

gives, using the first—order condition for utility maximization,




19       dU     --   v°c (-pG"F)q
                            +

                                       -
                                              K +

                                       10




The term outside the square brackets is positive. In the steady state of an

economy in which land serves both as a productive factor and as a store of

value, the interest rate is positive. Therefore expression (19) is

nonnegative as long as

                        17
                K   +   X—
(20)       K>            r




Expression (.19) consequently implies the following sufficient condition for

welfare to rise when foreign land ownership rises:

       Proposition 3: A permanent increase in the amount of land owned by

foreigners necessarily raises steady-state welfare if the share of capital in

national wealth exceeds the fraction of the labor force engaged by the

manufacturing sector.

       An increase in foreign investment raises the wage and lowers the interest

rate. The positive effect of the first on welfare is greater when the

capital—labor ratio in manufacturing is high. The negative effect of the

second is greater the greater steady—state wealth per worker.

       Expression (19) indicates another sufficient condition for increased

foreign investment in land to raise welfare:

       Proposition 4: A permanent increase in the amount of land owned by

foreigners necessarily raises steady—state welfare if the labor share in

agriculture is larger than the labor share in manufacturing and net foreign

land holdings are initially nonnegative.

       Propositions 2 and 4 together imply a third sufficient condition for

increased foreign ownership of land to raise steady—state welfare: that
                                         11




 initial foreign land holdings are nonnegative and that the price of land not

 rise when foreign investment in land rises.

     Increased foreign ownership of land can reduce steady—state welfare if

agriculture is highly land—intensive relative to the capital intensity of

manufacturing. Two extreme cases in which an increase in foreign investment

lowers welfare are those in which agriculture employs no labor, and in which

manufacturing employs no capital. The second case lowers the steady—state

interest rate without raising the wage.

     The discussion so far has compared the effect of different levels of

foreign investment in land across steady states. The dynamics of a transition

from one steady state to another can be analyzed by manipulation of equations

(A3) and (A4) in the appendix. Once the change in foreign investment has

occurred, the capital stock and price of land, and consequently factor prices,

begin to move monotonically toward their new steady—state values.

     If the change is anticipated, the land price begins to move toward its

new steady—state value prior to the actual increase in foreign ownership. If

the steady—state price of land falls, then the capital stock begins to rise

before the increased foreign investment occurs. As the price begins to fall

in anticipation, more national savings is diverted toward capital

investment. If the steady—state land price rises, however, there is a period

of capital decumulatjon before the increase in foreign-ownership. Once the

investment takes place, this process is reversed as the capital stock moves to

exceed its initial steady-state level.

    The older generation at the time that the increase in foreign investment

is first anticipated experiences a capital gain or loss on its land holdings

depending upon whether the ultimate effect of the foreign investment is to

raise or lower the steady—state land price. An implication of Proposition 4
                                        12




is consequently that an increase in the amount of land that is foreign—owned

is never Pareto-worsening. Either steady—state welfare rises or the older

generation at the time that the increase is initially anticipated experiences

a capital gain, with no other change in income. An increase in foreign

investment can bring about a Pareto—improvement, however, if the price of land

rises and condition (20) is nevertheless satisfied. This can occur when the

interest rate is large or when the amount of land owned nationally is already

smal 1.




III. Free Trade in Land



       The previous section considered the effect of an increase in the amount

of 'and owned by foreigners, treating this amount as exogenous. This section

extends the model to endogenize foreign investment in land when claims on

domestic land are freely traded internationally.

       Foreign investors are assumed to have available to them investments

elsewhere in the world that earn a constant real rate of return r*. The

country considered here is small in the sense that it does ot affect this

rate. Free trade in claims on land will insure that the rate of return on

domestic land equals r*, or that




(21)
            t+1 +   q1   = 1   +   r*


If nationals continue to invest in domestic land, then condition (7) must

continue to apply as well. Together, equations (7) and (21) imply
                                                       13




 (22)           =    r*


from which follows:

        Proposition 5: Free trade in land will yield a domestic interest rate

equal to the world interest rate unless all land is foreign—owned. The

domestic interest rate will then exceed the world rate.

        Even though, by assumption, foreigners do not invest directly in capital,

investment in land has the same effect on the capital stock as if they did.

In the rest of this section it is assumed that some domestic land remains

nationally-owned, so that the domestic and world interest rates are in fact
        8
equal

        The five equations (1) through (4) and (22) determine perfect foresight

equilibrium values of Wt, rt,                      LMt and Kt as functions of the domestic

supplies of labor and land, the relative price of the agricultural good, and

the world interest rate.             If these amounts are constant, then factor returns,

the allocation of labor and the supply of domestic capital will be constant as

well. Denoting these magnitudes as ,                   , , LM   and K, the land price is then

also a constant, given by


                It
(23)




From the savings relationship (11), with K = K, the share of land that is

nationally—owned is:


                    K -
(24)

       The remainder of this section considers the effects of permanent changes

in the relative commodity price, ,       the    world interest rate, r*, and domestic

supplies of fixed factors on foreign investment in land and on national

welfare.1°



A. An Increase in the Relative Price of the Agricultural Good



       1. Steady-State Foreign Investment

       As long as land ownership remains diversified a change in the relative

price of the agricultural commodity has no effect on the steady—state rate of

interest or wage. These are tied to r* by equations (1) through (4) and

(22). Foreign investment is affected through the effect of            (1) on the value

of land, which rises when         rises, (ii) on the equilibrium capital stock,

which falls when        rises, and (iii) on worker's consumption, which can either

rise or fall. The first acts to attract foreign investment by diverting more

national savings toward investment in land rather than capital. The second

has the opposite effect.

       The total effect on the amount of foreign-owned land of a rise in the

price of the agricultural commodity is, from equation (24), given by



                        c3'L-   G' [_X7t           r*K]

 the effect of a permanent change in p on a worker's consumption,11 and

the   elasticity of substitution between land and labor in the agricultural

sector.

      If tastes are homothetic and identical across periods then c = 0.       More

generally there is no presumption as to its sign. The sign of the remaining

term of expression (25) depends upon the sign of the term in square brackets,

from which follows:

      Proposition 6: A permanent increase in the price of the agricultural

good is more likely to raise foreign investment in land when (1) the labor

share in agriculture is smaller than its share in manufacturing, (ii) the

elasticity of substitution between land and labor in agriculture is large, and

(iii) the initial amount of foreign—owned land is small.

      If either a = 0 or .        0, and c < 0, foreign ownership of land
necessarily falls when          rises. A high elasticity of substitution in

agriculture and a high labor share in agriculture relative to manufacturing

imply that the capital stock that equates the domestic to the world interest

rate does not fall very far when         rises.'2 Consequently the main effect of a

rise in    is to raise the value of a given amount of land, diverting national

savings away from capital. To obtain the required investment in capital more

foreign investment in land must be attracted. If little land is held by
                                        16




nationals initially, however, an increase in the price of land, given X,

affects investment in capital very little.

       Since the price of land rises when    rises, the value of foreign

investment in land may rise even when the amount of land that is foreign—owned

falls. The effect of a permanent increase in       on the value of foreign—owned

land is given by

       There is still no presumption that an increase in
foreign investment. It is more likely to do so when the labor share in

manufacturing is larger than in agriculture and when the elasticity of

substitution between land and labor in agriculture is large.




       2. Steady-State Welfare

       Since the steady-state wage and interest rate in terms of the

manufactured good are unaffected by a change in , an increase in the relative

price of the agricultural good unambiguously lowers welfare in steady state.

It does so by reducinq the purchasi power of the wage and of interest

income. This result emerges regardle'- of the trade pattern or the pattern of

land ownership.



       3. Transitional Effects

       If the increase in    is unanticipated, the retirees at the time the

change occurs will experience an unanticipated capital gain on their land but

earn a lower than expected return on capital.      The net effect is ambiguous.
                                             17




        If the increase in      is anticipated, the price of land will begin to rise

before the commodity price increase. During this period more national savings

will be diverted toward land unless X falls. To maintain the domestic

interest rate at the world level thus requires more foreign investment between

the announcement of the change and the change itself. When the rise in

actually occurs, foreign investment will fall, possibly to below its initial

steady-state   level.
       When the increase in      is anticipated the retired generation at the time

their   land rises above its previous steady—state level, but the rate of return

on their capital is unaffected. The welfare of generations between the

announcement and the change itself is unaffected, but when              does actually

rise current and all subsequent generations experience a reduction in welfare.



B. An Increase in the Labor Force



       As long as nationals continue to own land, a permanent change in the size

of the labor force has no effect on the wage and the interest rate. The

profit on land, and consequently the value of land, are also unaffected. What

does change is the amount of national savings, which rises in proportion to

the labor force, and the capital stock required to employ the larger labor

force at the world interest rate and implied wage. The first acts to reduce

foreign investment and the second to attract it.

       Differentiating 1— with respect to L gives



(27)
            d(1-X) =   K   +   XM -      K
              dL                 L

                                                18




which implies

       Proposition 7: A permanent increase in the total labor force will lead

to a rise or fall in the amount of land that is foreign-owned depending upon

whether the proportion of the labor force engaged in manufacturing is larger

or smaller than the proportion of national wealth that consists of capital.

       Since factor prices are unaffected by a change in the size of the labor

force, welfare is also unaffected. Since there is no change in the price of

land, the amount and the value of foreign investment in land change in the

same proportion.



C. An Increase in the World Interest Rate



       The world interest rate affects all domestic factor prices, the price of

land and the equilibrium domestic capital stock. A rise in r* causes the wage

and the capital stock to fall and the return on land to rise.    The effect on

the price of land is given by:



                      w(L_LM)              it
            .sL   =             (IK -           —)
(29)        dr*                 wLM     w(L_LM)
                       (r*)2


which is positive or negative as the labor share in agriculture is larger or

smaller than in manufacturing.



       1. Foreign—Owned Land

       Both the amount and the value of foreign investment in land may rise or

fall as a consequence of an increase in the world interest rate. Unless the

 interest elasticity of savings is highly positive, national savings falls when

 r* rises. This acts to raise foreign investment. The decline in the
                                        19




 equilibrium capital stock acts to reduce foreign investment, however.

 Finally, the wealth effect associated with the change in   acts to attract

 foreign investment if the land price rises but to repel it if it falls. No

simple condition summarizes the net impact of these three effects on foreign

land ownership, but foreign investment does not necessarily fall as a

consequence of a higher world interest rate. The opposite result will emerge,

for example, if agriculture is very labor—intensive relative to manufacturing.



       7 W1fr
       To determine the effect of an increase in the interest rate on welfare in

steady—state is more straightforward. Differentiating the utility function

with respect to r* given



(29)           =             - (1+r)K


This expression is opposite in sign to the expression that indicates the

effect of an exogenous increase in foreign investment on welfare: A rise in

the world interest rate with free trade in land affects steady—state welfare

in the same way as a fall in foreign investment when foreign—owned land is

exogenous. Welfare is more likely to rise when the interest rate is initially

low and manufacturing labor—intensive relative to agriculture. There is thus

no presumption that a net recipient of foreign investment experiences a

reduction in its steady—state welfare when the world interest rate rises.'3

IV. The Consequence of a Tax on Land with International Capital Mobility



     In contrast to what is implied by a static model of tax incidence, that a

tax on land is neutral in its effects on resource allocation, in a closed

economy, overlapping-generations context such a tax increases the steady-state

supply of capital, thereby reducing the interest rate and raising the real

wage. As long as the initial interest rate exceeds the population growth

rate, which it will when land serves both as an asset and as a factor of

production, steady-state welfare rises.14 A land tax raises the capital stock

by reducing the price of land. More savings is then available for capital

investment.15

     With capital mobility, in the form of either foreign borrowing or direct

foreign investment in land, a tax on land has no effect on factor prices and

the domestic stock of capital. These are governed by the world interest

rate. Nevertheless, the tax does have real effects. It lowers the value of

foreign investment and, as in the closed economy case, it raises steady-state

            16
wel fare.




A. The Land Tax and Foreign Investment



     Consider a lump—sum tax in amount w   that   is collected on all domestic

land each period. If nationals continue to invest in land, free trade in

claims on land continues to equate the domestic interest rate to the world

rate. Equation (22), along with equations (1) through (4), imply a particular

value for the capital stock. Since the tax affects none of these four

relationships, it has no effect on the stock of domestic capital, factor
                                                   21




rewards, or the allocation of labor, with rEt              defined now as the pre-tax return

on land.

        The tax does affect the price of land, however. To incorporate its

effect equation (7) must be changed to


                   +   ltt+1 -
(30)


If the tax revenue is distributed to the working generation, an individual

worker's wage income is augmented by r/L. The relevant savings relation

becomes



                              + -r/L -                                -
(31)        K1 =       L[Wt              c)'(wt+.v/L,rt+i,pt,pt÷i)]


If,    instead, the government gives the tax revenue to the retired generation,

the relevant equation is



                                                                          -
(31')        Kt+i =    L[wt
                              -
                                  cY(wt+
                                           L(1+rt+l)rt+1PtPt+1fl
                                                                              X1q

In steady state these become:




(32)         K =   L[ +     t/L   -   c    +   /L,r*,p,p)]

and




(32')        K          -
                            c'(                            -




respectively.17        Differentiating equation (32) with respect to -r             gives:
                                          22

             d_1_cW+XIr
                    -
             dt



which is positive as long as future consumption is non—inferior. Taxing land
raises the amount of domestic land owned nationally, if the tax revenue is

distributed to the working generation. It does so for two reasons. First, by

increasing working period income, the tax revenue raises savings. Second, by

lowering the price of land it increases the amount of savings available for

investment. Since the capital stock cannot rise, the amount of land owned by

nationals rises.

         The equivalent derivative for equation (32') is



              d    _c)'/(l+r*) +
                    W
                                   X/r*
(333)




If       is close to one, this expression is positive: as before, the land tax

raises the amount of land owned by nationals. If           is very small, however,

the expression is negative. The reason is that, in this case, the net effect

of the tax is to raise retirement income. Savings in the form of land

acquisitions is consequently lower. These results may be summarized as

follows:

         Proposition 8: Taxing land reduces the amount of foreign—owned land in

steady state unless (i) the tax revenue is distributed to the retired

generation and (ii) foreigners already own most land.

         Regardless of how the tax revenue is distributed or the pattern of land

ownership, unless first-period consumption is highly inferior the land tax

reduces the steady—state value of foreign investment in land.         If tax revenue

is distributed to workers then, using expression (32),
                                                 23




             d(1.-       yw -     1+r

               d     =
                                      r*



which is negative as long as c < 1.              If the tax revenue is distributed to

retirees, the expression is



(34'\       d(14)    =    1
                         1+r*
                              —   c' — ____
                                  '
                                      w    r*



which has th same sign as (35S) but is smaller in absolute magnitude.18



B. The Effect of a Land Tax on Welfare



        However the tax revenue is distributed, the land tax does not affect the

steady—state wage rate or rate of return on savings.              If tax revenue is

distributed to workers then each worker receives, in addition to his wage

income, an amount t/L in redistributed tax proceeds. If the revenue is

distributed to retirees then each retiree receives an additional r/L, which is

equivalent to a wage supplement of 1/L(1+r*). In either case the tax provides

a net addition to income, leaving the steady-state return on savings

unaffected. Proposition 9 immediately follows:

        Proposition 9: A tax on land raises steady—state welfare regardless of

how the revenue is distributed between generations.

        Steady—state welfare rises as t         rises.   The potential welfare gain is

not, of course, unlimited. If land can remain unowned then when 'v >                  no land

is owned and no tax is collected;               consequently imposes an upper bound on

 ,19
                                      24




    While Feldstein (1977) and Chamley and Wright (1983) demonstrate that a

land tax raises steady—state welfare in a closed economy, they also show that

such a tax does not constitute a Pareto improvement. This is likely to be the

case when land is traded, as well. If the tax is announced in advance of its

imposition, or if the tax revenue is distributed to workers at the time the

tax is announced, retirees owning land experience a capital loss for which

they receive no compensation. Their welfare drops because of the tax. If,

however, the tax is imposed immediately upon its announcement and retirees are

given the tax revenue, the potential for a Pareto—improving land tax, from a

national perspective, emerges.

    The tax creates an immediate capital loss for retirees in total amount

        where    is the initial amount of land owned nationally. If

   > r*, of course, this magnitude exceeds tax revenue, t.   Even if retired

land owners are given the tax revenue, it does not compensate them for their

capital loss. They are net losers. If      < r*, however, tax receipts exceed

the capital loss to nationals, and retirees are net beneficiaries of a land

tax. Since steady-state welfare rises as a consequence of the tax, and the

new steady state is achieved in one period, the tax yields, from a national

perspective, a Pareto improvement. The capital loss on the part of foreign

land—owners is, of course, the source of the gain to the initial retirees.

     In summary, while a land tax raises steady state welfare, it typically

harms the retired generation at the time it is announced. For a national

Pareto improvement to emerge requires that (i) the tax is not anticipated,

(ii) tax revenue is distributed to retirees, and (iii) the share of

nationally—owned domestic land is less than the world interest rate.

V. Conclusion



     Capital and land serve both as factors of production and as stores of

value. The primary distinction between capital and land is that the supply of

the first is determined by household saving and foreign investment. Nature

determines the supply of land. Models of international trade and investment

have typically incorporated land and capital only in their roles as factors of

production, not as competing assets in household portfolios. Once a role for

land as an asset is recognized, standard results on the implications of

international investment can change significantly. This paper has examined

the effects of international investment when land is both a factor of

production and an asset in fixed supply. International investment raises the

wage, but lowers the return on land and capital. The first effect is more

pronounced when the share of labor in agriculture, the land—using sector, is

large relative to the labor share in manufacturing, which uses capital. When

this effect dominates foreign investment is more likely to raise welfare, and

increases in the labor force and the price of the land—using commodity are

more likely to reduce the amount of foreign investment. At the same time

foreign investment in land is more likely to reduce the steady—state price of

land when agriculture has a larger labor share than manufacturing. Taxing

land raises steady—state welfare and is likely to reduce foreign investment.

and with p1 and p2 defined so that p1 < p2. The scalars A1 and A2 are

determined by boundary conditions.

       At any period t the capital stock Kt, and hence x, are predetermined.

The price of land           and hence t' are determined by assetmarket equilibrium

each period. At period t = 0 A1 must therefore satisfy the condition

A1 =xo -A.

       A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a unique stable

non—oscillating convergence path to steady state is that 0 < p1 < 1 < p2.

       If p1 < 0 the system oscillates. The condition           > 0 is necessary and

sufficient to preclude oscillation. This condition in turn is guaranteed by

the two conditions




(A5)      1c
which states that the marginal propensity to save is nonnegative, and



(A6)      1+crK>O

which requires that an increase in the interest rate not have a highly

negative effect on savings.

       If p1 > 0 and p2 < 1 then for          value of A2 equations (A3) and (A4)

converge to steady state while if p1 > 1 no path converges unless A2 = 0.           A
unique convergence path therefore requires that 0 < p1 < 1 < p2 and A2              0.


        If (A5) and (A6) are satisfied a necessary and sufficient condition for a

unique stable non—oscillating convergence path is that t > 0 where t is

defined in equation (17).

     To    verify that A > 0         is necessary and sufficient define the function



                            -                  +
            A(p)                (r11 + r22)p       r11(1+r)


Since   A(p) =0 defines p1 and p2, for p e (p1,p2), A(p)           < 0. If p1 < 1 < p2

then A(1) < 0. Since

                                 A
             A(1) =
                      -(1    + Lc'rK)

Along with (A6), A > 0 implies and is implied by A(1) < 0.

1. The amount of land in the United States that is owned by foreigners

apparently grew substantially during the 1970s. Concern over increased

ownership of U.S. land by foreigners has led to closer monitoring of land-

ownership patterns by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Legislation

restricting the sale of agricultural land to foreigners has been considered in

California. The state of Oklahoma has tried to enforce a clause in its state

constitution prohibiting non—resident foreigners from owning land in that

state. A number of countries currently restrict foreign ownership of land,

particularly land used in agriculture. See articles in Business Week (1979a,

1979b, 1982) for a discussion.



2. Foreign investment has been analyzed in two—factor, one—asset OLG models

by John Kareken and Neil Wallace (1977) and by Willem Buiter (1981). Kareken

and Wallace ignore capital, so that changes in the price of land and the

amount that is owned by foreigners have no effect on factor supplies.

Buiter's model, in contrast, has no land. Again, there is no asset

substitution effect of foreign investment on asset supplies. The effect of

foreign   investment on steady—state welfare that these authors find is

consequently quite different.


3.   Elsewhere I have explored the implications of changes in the terms of

trade and in factor supplies in a dynamic specific—factors framework with

portfolio autarky: i.e., in the absence of trade in claims on land or capital

flows (Eaton, 1984).
4.   In a series of articles Jagdish Bhagwati and Ernesto Tironi (1980) and

Bhagwati and Richard Brecher (1980, 1981) investigate the implications of

foreign-owned factors of production for trade and welfare.            Their analysis is

static, and treats the amount of foreign investment as exogenous. The results

are consequently quite different.



5. John Dutton (1982, 1984) derives optimal tax policies toward foreign and

domestic capital income in a two-factor OLG model.



6. Conditions for the existence of a K and              that satisfy (13) and (14) are

derived elsewhere (Eaton, 1984). A condition for the stability of the steady

state is provided in the Appendix.

8.   If the amount of land bought by foreigners were less than the amount that

equated interest rates, then the domestic capital stock would be lower, since

more national savings would be channeled into purchases of domestic land.            The

domestic interest rate would consequently be higher. Equation (7) would then

imply a net rate of return on domestic land above r*. An incentive for more
foreign investment would emerge. By the same argument, if foreigners bought

more than the appropriate amount, the rate of return on land would be less

than r*. Foreign investment would fall.



9. Note that factor prices and the domestic capital stock, and consequently

the price of land, assume their new steady—state values immediately upon any

anticipated change in exogenous variables. From equation (24) the amount of

land owned by foreigners therefore achieves its new steady—state value after

10.    The analysis considers the effect of changes in exogenous variables on

both the amount of land owned by foreigners and the value of their

investment. When the price of land itself changes these two magnitudes can

respond in different directions. Free trade in land, when it does not lead to

a total divestiture of land holdings by nationals, leads to domestic factor

prices that are the same as those that would emerge if capital, rather than

land, were internationally mobile. The value of land owned by foreigners then

equals the amount of foreign borrowing that would occur if capital were

mobile.

13. If the increase in the world interest rate is not anticipated, the

retired generation at the time the change occurs benefits if the steady—state

land price rises, but the effect on their welfare is ambiguous otherwise. If

the increase is anticipated the retired generation when the change occurs

necessarily benefits while the retired generation in the period in which the

change   is first anticipated gains or loses depending upon whether land prices
rise or fall.

14. These qualitative effects emerge independently of how the proceeds           of the

tax   are distributed. Feldstein (1977) incorrectly asserted that the
traditional   results reemerge if      the tax revenue is given to the retired
generation.     Calvo, et al. (1979) correct this error.



15. The effect is similar to the so—called Tohin effect" of inflation on the

capital stock: higher anticipated inflation channels savings out of cash

balances into capital investment (James Tobin, 1965). Chamley and Wright

(1983) emphasize the quantitatively trivial potential for inflation to affect

the capital stock in contrast with the potential effect of a land tax.
16. The effect of the tax on the steady—state value of foreign investment and

welfare is the same regardless of whether capital mobility takes the form of

borrowing or direct foreign investment in land, barring a corner solution in

which all domestic land is foreign—owned.



17. These expressions apply only if X < 1, so that there is net foreign

investment in domestic land. If A > 1 the last term in these equations should

become -     — (X_1)q* where q* is the price of foreign land. This change

does not affect the qualitative conclusions stated here, as the interested

reader can readily verify.



18. The reason is that when tax revenue is distributed to retirees its effect

on savings is muted; the delay reduces the present value of the payment.



19.   If land—owners must sell their land then a negative price of land must be

admitted. The upper bound on -   in   this case is determined by the wealth of

land—owners at the period in which the tax is initially imposed.
