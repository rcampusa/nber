                                             ABSTRACT



        This paper makes three contributions. First, I report information on the size of the Japanese
financial crisis. Drawing principally on work by Fukao (2003) and Doi and Hoshi (2003) I estimate
that the current taxpayer liability for losses incurred but yet to be recognized is likely to be at least
24% of GDP. Second, I explain why it has been so difficult to end the crisis. Third, I sketch the
likely ingredients of what will be required to successfully resolve the crisis. The overarching
principle is that Japan’s banks, insurance companies, and government financial agencies all suffer
different problems and require different solutions. But all three sectors are connected, and a failure
to tackle concurrently the problems of all three promises to doom any reform plan.

 In principle, a slow winding down of the loan problems would
give the banks more time to take advantage of the tax credits. But,
as I explain below, stretching out the resolution of the problem is
likely to lead to more losses. See Goldman Sachs (2002).
