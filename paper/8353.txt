       The decade of the 1990s was remarkable in many ways. This decade produced the longest
running U.S. economic expansion. A byproduct of this continued economic growth was a sharp
tightening of the U.S. labor market. The growing scarcity of available workers raised the concern
that accelerating wage demands would develop which might lead to renewed inflation. Figure 1
shows the growth rate of nominal compensation per hour (CPH) and its relationship to the prime
age male unemployment rate during the 1990s.1 Two ‚Äúwage puzzles‚Äù exist during the 1990s. The
first relates to the period from 1992 to 1995 when compensation growth declined at the same
time that the unemployment rate was rapidly falling. One explanation is that ‚Äúworker insecurity‚Äù
early in the expansion accounted for the tepid pay demands during this period.2 From 1995 to
1998, compensation growth accelerated as the unemployment rate broke through the four percent
barrier. However, the second wage puzzle emerges in 1999 when compensation growth fell back
below the five percent level despite the continued tightening in the labor market during the year.
What explains these two wage puzzles?
       In this paper, we explore whether changes in the structure of pay can help explain the
behavior of CPH during the 1990s. Labor markets have changed considerably over the last
twenty years. Workers today receive a higher portion of their total compensation in
nontraditional forms such as profit-sharing and stock options.3 CPH captures profit-sharing and
stock options. However, stock options are reflected in total compensation on the date they are
exercised, not on the date they are granted. As we discuss below, there can be several years
between the grant and exercise dates for stock options. This raises the possibility that the
growing use of stock options may be affecting the timing of when tight labor markets are
reflected in CPH growth.
       We bring the existing data to bear on the question of how the use of stock options is
affecting the growth in CPH. Given data limitations, we will focus primarily on the second pay



       1
         CPH is the most comprehensive of all U.S. pay measures. It captures wage and salary income,
tips and overtime, paid leave and severance pay, payments in kind, benefits, bonus and profit-sharing
payments, and realizations of stock options.

puzzle. While we can provide an educated assessment of the likely impact of stock options on the
dynamics of CPH, there is a clear need for more data. We find evidence that stock options may
have had an appreciable impact on CPH in the late 1990s. When we recalculate compensation to
reflect current stock option grants instead of current realizations, we find that there was likely no
downturn in the growth in CPH in 1999.
        The paper is organized as follows. The next section lays out the essential institutional
details regarding employee stock options necessary for our empirical work. Empirical models of
the stock option grant and realization decisions are presented and discussed in the third section.
In the fourth section, we use these estimates to assess the impact of employee stock options on
compensation per hour. The final section discusses some general implications of stock options
for the labor market.


Accounting for Stock Options
        Employee stock options (ESOs) are the right to purchase a given number of shares of
company stock at the ‚Äústrike‚Äù price between the vesting date and the expiration date of the
options.4 The vesting period for an option is the interval of time between when a company grants
the option to the employee and when the employee can first exercise the option. If the current
market price for a vested option exceeds the strike price, then the option is ‚Äúin-the-money.‚Äù If in-
the-money options are exercised (that is, the employee decides to purchase the underlying shares),
then the gain to the employee is the difference between the current market price and the strike
price times the number of shares exercised.5 If the current market price for a vested option is
below the strike price, then the option is ‚Äúout-of-the-money.‚Äù While out-of-the-money options
would have no current value if exercised, they still have positive ‚Äúoption value,‚Äù which reflects




        4
            See Murphy (1999) for a discussion of the structure of ESO plans.
        5
          A common practice is for a cashless transaction to occur using the services of a third-party. The
third-party makes a short-term loan to the employee to cover the cost of purchasing the exercised options
at the strike price. The shares are then immediately sold back out into the market and the loan is paid off,
with a fee going to the third-party.

the possibility that the future market price of the stock may rise above the strike price prior to
their expiration date.
       ESOs can be structured as either ‚Äúincentive stock options‚Äù (ISO) or ‚Äúnonqualified stock
options‚Äù (NQSO). ISOs must satisfy certain restrictions defined by the Internal Revenue Service
which do not apply to NQSOs.6 The primary advantages of ISOs to employees is that the income
derived from the exercise of the options is taxed as a capital gain rather than as ordinary income,
and the tax is levied when the underlying shares are sold rather than when the shares are
exercised. Offsetting this tax gain to employees from ISOs is the loss of a tax deduction to the
firm. In contrast to ISOs, the income gain from NQSOs is treated for tax purposes as ordinary
income to the employee as of the exercise date, and the company can deduct this cost as a labor
expense. Employers are required to file quarterly reports (ES202) that list all taxable sources of
income paid to their employees including realized NQSOs. The ES202 reports are used as an
input into total compensation. However, these reports do not break out the gain from NQSOs from
other sources of compensation. NQSOs became the dominant type of ESO following the reduction
in marginal income tax rates in 1986.
       In January 1993, the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) started requiring public
firms to disclose in their proxy statements both the level of stock option grants and the option
exercise activity to their top five executives. The SEC also required that companies report their
executive compensation for the two previous years in the annual filing with the agency. Starting in
1991, then, it is possible to collect detailed information on public company stock option programs
for top management. Firms could value these option grants using any pricing methodology. The
dominant method used in practice is the Black-Scholes pricing formula.
       ESOs differ in many important ways from traded stock options (TSOs). The most
important difference is that they are nontradeable. An employee can exercise a vested in-the-
money option, but can not sell the option to an investor. An implication is that both the
employee‚Äôs valuation of the option and the timing of the exercise decision will be affected by the
employee‚Äôs risk tolerance. An employee with a significant amount of wealth tied up in company

stock options has a strong interest in diversifying the risk from movements in the value of the
company stock. With TSOs, the employee could simply sell some of the options in the market to
another investor, an action which transfers but does not diminish the underlying value of the
options. With ESOs, the employee would have to exercise the options in order to diversify their
risk.7 This creates an incentive for early exercise of vested ESOs, which reduces their overall
value by forgoing their remaining option value. Huddart and Lang (1996) show that workers tend
to exercise ESOs soon after their vesting dates, and that this early exercise sacrifices roughly half
of the value implied by the Black-Scholes pricing methodology (which is designed to price a
TSO).
        Two other distinctions arise when comparing ESOs and TSOs. As mentioned earlier,
ESOs are subject to vesting requirements and tend to have a significant time period until
expiration. A variety of vesting schedules are used in practice, with the majority of plans
incorporating vesting over two to five years.8 In addition, an employee must exercise any vested
in-the-money ESOs prior to leaving a firm. Any non-vested or out-of-the-money ESOs must be
forfeited upon termination of the employment relationship. This creates an additional reason for
early exercise of ESOs.9




        7
          For ISOs there is a minimum holding period on the underlying stock which compounds the
diversification problem. No similar restriction applies to NQSOs.
        8
          A Hewitt Associates study of 74 plans in 1998 found that 35% of the plans used Cliff vesting
(where all shares vest at the same specified time) with one and three years being the most frequent
vesting times, 45% of the plans used uniform vesting (where share vest at a uniform rate over the vesting
period) with three and four years being the most frequent vesting times and the remaining 20% either
used mixed vesting or provided no information (TCM Data 1998). The most common expiration date is
ten years after the grant date.
        9
         This feature of ESOs makes them a useful tool for reducing employee turnover. Mehran and
Yermack (1999) document that the probability of a voluntary departure by a CEO is inversely related to
the length of the stock option vesting schedule. They also document that the higher the ratio of deferred
compensation to current pay, the less likely a CEO is to leave voluntarily.

Measuring the Importance of Employee Stock Options
        Standard and Poor‚Äôs (S&P) ExecuComp is our primary data source. ExecuComp includes
annual data from proxy statements for the five highest paid executives in three cohorts of firms:
the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P Small Cap 600.10 S&P makes some adjustments to the
firms in the data base each year. Our pooled sample which covers the period from 1992-1999
comprises a total of around 2,000 companies. We make extensive use three specific items from
the ExecuComp data: the total number of new grants to all employees, the number of grants and
their value going to the top five executives and the value of exercised options by the top five
executives. We calculate the total value of all new grants in a year by scaling up the value of the
grants to the top five executives by the ratio of the total number of options granted to the number
of options granted to the top five executives.11
        The ExecuComp data is useful for examining general trends in the use of employee stock
options during the 1990s. For example, over the decade stock options became the dominant
component of an executive‚Äôs compensation package. We illustrate this remarkable change using
two measures of the relative importance of executive stock options. The first is the ratio of the
grant value of new options in a year divided by the executive‚Äôs base salary and cash bonus. The
second is the ratio of the income gain from stock option realizations in a year divided by the
executive‚Äôs base salary and cash bonus. Figure 2 shows the averages for these two ratios from
1992 to 1999. Early in the 1990s, both ratios indicate that stock options were typically smaller
than an executive‚Äôs base salary and cash bonus. By 1996, both ratios equaled or exceeded one.
Two years later, continued rapid growth in the expansion of executive stock option programs had
pushed both ratios above two, with new grants averaging around 250% of an executives base




        10
        The median real market value is $8.3 billion for the S&P 500 firms, $1.7 billion for the S&P
MidCap firms and $0.4 billion for the S&P Small Cap firms.
        11
          Starting in 1994, ExecuComp recalculates the grant value of a company‚Äôs new options using a
consistent set of assumptions on the interest rate, implied stock return volatility, and expected duration of
the option. Company Handbooks on ESO plans typically do not make any distinction between executive
and non-executive stock option plans. Therefore, we to assume that the Black-Scholes value of an option
granted to an executive and to a non-executive is the same.

                                                     -5-
salary and bonus. In 1999, the grants ratio leveled off while there was a sharp reduction in the
realization ratio.12
        An important related question is whether the use of stock options is also filtering its way
down through the ranks of company pay structures. The ExecuComp data allow us to track the
distribution of the percent of total new stock option grants that are awarded to the top five
management. While this is a very restrictive view of the diffusion of stock options down through
the corporate ranks, it has the advantage of providing some sense of recent trends. Figure 3
shows the equally weighted 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of these top five percentages from 1992
to 1999. Despite the dramatic rise in the use of stock options for executives, there has actually
been a slight decline in the fraction of new stock option grants directed toward upper
management. This indicates that there has also been a commensurate increase over the 1990s in
the use of stock options for employees below the top management level.
        Given the rapid rise in the use of stock options, it is interesting to speculate on the impact
that stock options are having on aggregate compensation growth in the private sector. As noted
earlier, aggregate compensation reflects NQSOs when they are realized rather than when they are
granted. Unfortunately, there is no currently collected data that permit the direct measurement of
the total size of stock option grants or realizations in the labor market. The alternative is to
estimate total stock option grants and NQSO realizations by year. The growth rate of CPH net of
the income from stock option realizations can then be constructed and contrasted with its actual
growth rate. In addition, the cash value of new stock option grants can be added into this net of
realizations CPH measure to arrive at a more accurate measure of current labor market pay
conditions. We now turn our attention to implementing this approach.
        The private non-farm sector consists of publically traded and private firms. Over the past
five years, public firm have accounted for between forty-seven and fifty percent of employment
in the private non-farm business sector. The ExecuComp data consists entirely of publically


        12
           There is no general agreement as to what has caused the popularity of stock options in the
1990's. Murphy (1999) presents a behavioral discussion. Hall and Liebman (1998) examine the role of
taxes where under IRC Section 162(m) compensation above one million dollars in not deductible unless
it is performance-based. Of the 1,672 firms on ExecuComp in 1998, 1,566 reported paying less than a one
million dollar salary for their CEOs.

                                                  -6-
traded firms, and in 1998 covered roughly 46% of the total employment in public firms.13
Detailed characteristics of publically traded firms are available from the COMPUSTAT data, and
equity returns for these firms are available from the CRSP data. For private firms, we have no
similar data on their characteristics, nor do we have any details of stock option plans in which to
draw any inferences. However, a recent Bureau of Labor Statistics study found that the incidence
of stock options in privately held firms in 1999 was significantly below that for publically held
firms.14 Based on this evidence we will focus our analysis exclusively on public firms.
        The basic question, then, is how best to use the ExecuComp data to estimate total stock
option grants and realizations for publically held firms. The simplest approach would be to
assume for each year that all employees in these firms that are outside of the ExecuComp sample
are awarded new stock option grants and realize vested stock options at the average rate observed
in that year for employees covered in the ExecuComp data. This approach, however, ignores
potentially important variations across firms in their use of stock options that relates to the
characteristics of the firm. Taking this variation into account may provide a more accurate
estimate of the overall impact of stock options on total compensation.


Determinants of Stock Option Grants
        We start with the problem of estimating stock option grants, since the volume of prior
stock option grants is likely to be an important predictor of current realizations. For firms in the
ExecuComp sample, we can calculate the Black-Scholes value of the total ESO grants made in
the year.15 While we are interested in understanding the determinants of the firm‚Äôs decision on
the total amount of new grants to make in a year, it is useful to look toward the executive
compensation literature for guidance on an appropriate empirical specification.



        13
          This is based on the comparison of COMPUSTAT employment for ExecuComp firms in 1998
to total employment of COMPUSTAT firms in the same year.
        14
             See BLS, October 11, 2000.
        15
          ExecuComp reports the Black-Scholes value of new grants to each of the top five executives,
and the ratio of their grants to the total new grants made in the year. From this information, we can back
out the total Black-Scholes grant value.

       The literature on executive compensation starts with the premise that optimal
compensation policies should address agency problems between the firm‚Äôs managers and its
equity and debt holders. The two methods for ameliorating these agency problems are monitoring
and incentives.16 A general prediction is that stock options will be more extensively used when
agency costs are high and monitoring is difficult. In addition, the accounting treatment of stock
options discussed earlier suggests that firms may also use stock options for tax or liquidity
reasons.
       We include several variables to control for expected agency costs. Monitoring may
become difficult when a firm has significant growth opportunities. Information asymmetries may
arise from these opportunities which make evaluating the managers‚Äô investment choices more
difficult [e.g., Mehran (1992), Smith & Watts (1992) and Bizjak et al (1993)]. Stronger
incentives, then, are needed to compensate for the monitoring difficulties. These additional
incentives can be provided by increasing the share of stock options in total compensation. We
measure a firm‚Äôs growth opportunities using its market-to-book value (MVBV). The prediction is
that stock option grants will be positively related to a firm‚Äôs MVBV.
       Monitoring managers is also difficult in an environment where there is a significant
amount of noise regarding the firm‚Äôs performance [Lambert & Larcker (1987)]. In such an
environment, a higher pay-performance sensitivity is warranted. Yermack (1995) proxies this
using the ratio of the relative variability of accounting returns as compared to stock returns. We
focus just on the variability of the stock returns over the prior year. The prediction is that higher
stock return variability will lead to increased use of stock options. However, higher stock return
variability also increases the manager‚Äôs risk exposure, which should lead to a higher risk
premium to compensate the manager for this added risk.17 This risk premium increases the
relative price to the firm of using stock options versus cash compensation, which may induce the

       17
          While volatility always raises the option value of TSOs, Lambert, Larcker, and Verrecchia
(1991) and Kulatilaka and Marcus (1994) show that increased volatility can lower the value of ESOs,
especially for more risk averse employees.

firm to substitute away from stock options in its pay structure. The overall effect, then, of stock
return variability on the use of stock options is ambiguous.
        Capital structure may also exert an important influence on a firm‚Äôs compensation system.
Stock options, by increasing managers‚Äô pay-performance sensitivity, may encourage managers to
pursue riskier investment strategies that tend to favor equity holders over debt holders. If this
shift in investment strategies is anticipated by bond holders, then increased reliance on stock
options will give rise to a debt premium which differentially impacts highly leveraged firms
[John & John (1993)]. To reduce this agency cost of debt, highly leveraged firms may choose to
scale back their use of stock options. This should lead to an inverse relationship between a firm‚Äôs
leverage and its reliance on stock options.18
        To help control for any firm life-cycle effects on the use of stock options, we control for a
firm‚Äôs age which we measure as the number of years the firm‚Äôs stock has been traded. If young
firms tend to be more cash flow constrained, then we would expect them to rely more heavily on
stock options. When a firm issues new stock options it typically incurs no current expense, rather
the expense is shifted into the future when the stock options are realized. Workers, however,
value these new stock options and are willing to accept lower current cash compensation as a
consequence. This should lead to a negative relationship between firm age and the granting of
stock options. We also directly proxy for cash flow constraints using an indicator variable for
whether the firm has a net operating loss in the current year.
        Our remaining firm-specific variables include measures of recent performance and firm
size. We measure firm performance using the firm‚Äôs return on assets (ROA). We use the size of
the firm‚Äôs assets and employment to control for possible scale effects. Finally, we include two-
digit industry effects and year effects to control for any remaining differences across industries
and time in the pattern of stock option grants.
        Our estimation results for stock option grants are presented in Table 1. Summary statistics
are provided in Appendix B. For most of our control variables of interest, we divide the range of


        18
           More specifically, the prediction pertains to the relative portion of an executive‚Äôs compensation
that is stock based. Our dependent variable is the total amount of stock options granted, rather than the
ratio of total stock option grants to total compensation.

                                                    -9-
the variable into quartiles and create indicator variables for the upper three quartiles. The
coefficient on an indicator variable should be interpreted as the difference is the use of stock
option grants between a firm with a value of the indicated variable in the specified quartile and a
similar firm with a value of the indicated variable in the bottom quartile (holding all values for
other variables at their sample means)
       The use of stock options varies with firm performance and firm size. Firms with high
ROA tend to grant fewer new stock options. For example, grants for firms performing at or
above the median in ROA tend to be around 35-40% below the poorest performing firms. Stock
option grants tend to increase with the firm size as measured by employment and total assets. The
employment relationship only applies to the top size quartile, while the asset relationship holds
throughout the size range, is quite large in magnitude but is imprecisely estimated. Core and
Guay‚Äôs (1999) found that executive stock and option incentives are positively related to firm size
as measured by equity value.
       We find empirical support for the agency cost of debt constraint on employee stock
options. Controlling for other factors, highly leveraged firms tend to pay out fewer new stock
option grants. Firms in the highest quartile of leverage have new grants that are on average 26%
below the level of firms in the lowest quartile of leverage. This is in contrast to Yermack‚Äôs
(1995) empirical findings.
       Monitoring problems arising from potential market opportunities and noisy environments
also play an important role in determining the flow of new stock option grants. Firms with higher
MVBV tend to have much more aggressive stock option programs, as evidenced by consistently
higher flows of new stock option grants. This effect is especially pronounced for firms in the top
MVBV quartile who are predicted to have on average a 300 percent larger flow of stock option
grants than for firms in the bottom MVBV quartile. Higher stock return volatility reduces the
magnitude of a firm‚Äôs stock option grants. These findings are consistent with the existing
empirical literature [see Core and Guay (1999), (2000)].
       We also find support for the prediction that firms facing cash flow constraints substitute
stock options for cash compensation. The data suggest that firms experiencing a net operating
loss in a given year have stock option grants that are 24 percent higher than similar firms with


                                                 -10-
operating profits.19 In addition, younger firms tend to rely more heavily on the use of stock
options in their compensation structure. A ten year increase in firm age is associated with an 8
percent decline in stock option grants.


Determinants of Stock Option Realizations
        The ExecuComp data report the stock option realizations for each of the top five
executives. What is not reported is the total stock option realizations generated by the other
employees. To estimate total realizations, we assume that the time pattern of stock option
realizations by the top five executives can be used to proxy for the time pattern of realizations for
the remaining employees.20 Specifically, we calculate the total realizations in the year for a firm
by scaling up the realizations by the top five executives using the ratio of total grants to top five
grants from two years earlier.21
        The empirical specification for a firm‚Äôs total stock option realizations is motivated in part
by the characteristics of ESO plans. In any given year, an employee has the right to realize any
vested stock options. As previously noted, there is a strong tendency for employees to exercise
options close to their vesting dates. While vesting schedules vary across firms, the typical vesting
rules imply that it would be important to control for stock option grants from two to five year
prior to the current year. Given the short time span covered by the ExecuComp data, we
compromise and include only stock option grants from two years prior to the current year.



        19
          As a robustness check we also used the firm‚Äôs ‚Äúbefore financing‚Äù marginal tax rate [see Graham
(1996) (2001)]. We find that both net operating loss and marginal tax rates generate the predicted sign
and are statistically significant. However, marginal tax rates were missing for roughly 15% of our
COMPUSTAT sample, so we proceed using just the net operating loss.
        20
           The time pattern of exercise for executives may differ from other employees for two reasons.
First, executives have private information about their firm‚Äôs prospects which can alter the timing of their
exercise decision. Second, footnotes in companies‚Äô proxy statements typically reveal that top executives
may exercise their options sooner than the normal vesting schedules would permit if certain financial
conditions are met. Huddart and Lang (1996) find that the exercise decisions by top management as
compared to other employees is less sensitive to recent stock returns and return volatility.
        21
          Ideally, we would like to use a weighted average of these ratios based on the typical vesting
pattern for ESOs. This is precluded by the short time period covered by the ExecuComp sample.

                                                    -11-
       Vested stock options will be exercised only if they are in-the-money. Since the option
strike price is typically set equal to the market price on the grant date, the cumulative stock return
during the vesting period will determine whether an option is in-the-money on the date it vests. If
a firm makes grants to employees over several years and uses a staggered vesting schedule, then
the appropriate stock return to examine would be a weighted average of different cumulative
stock returns over the various vesting periods. Since we lack the detailed data necessary to
calculate this particular stock return, we will use the firm‚Äôs cumulative stock return over the prior
two years as our proxy.
       A prominent feature of stock option realizations data is that in a given year many firms
experience no realizations, even if these firms have continuously made grants over the past
several years. In our sample of around 5,189 firm/year observations for which we have complete
data on all of our control variables, 32% involve no realizations by the firm in that year. To
account for the high frequency of zero realizations in the data, we use a generalized Tobit
specification. Details on the generalized Tobit model are provided in Appendix A.
       The generalized Tobit results are presented in Table 2. For ease of interpretation, we
convert the generalized Tobit coefficients into three marginal effects: the implied impact of a
variable on (1) the probability that a firm experiences a positive realization in the year, on (2) the
percent change in the expected log realizations conditional on a positive realization, and on (3)
the percent change in the unconditional expected log realizations.
       The level of prior grants and the two year cumulative stock return both have positive and
significant effects on current realizations. Higher prior grants of stock options raise both the
probability that a firm has positive realizations in the current year [column (1) of Table 2] and the
expected magnitude of these realizations conditional on the realizations being positive [column
(2) of Table 2]. Holding constant the level of prior grants, current realizations are sharply
increasing in the firm‚Äôs two-year cumulative stock return. Like prior grants, higher stock returns
increase both the incidence and magnitude of current realizations. These findings are consistent
with the results of prior case studies [Huddart & Lang (1996)].
       While larger firms are more likely to experience positive stock option realizations in a
year, firm size as measured by employment has no significant impact on the conditional


                                                 -12-
magnitude of the realizations. Similarly, holding constant our other control variables, the degree
of firm leverage has no significant impact on realizations. Stock option realizations show a
strong positive relationship with a firm‚Äôs MVBV. This reflects both a positive effect of MVBV
on the incidence and magnitude of realizations. Finally, higher stock risk raises the likelihood of
a firm experiencing positive realizations, but does not have any further impact on the magnitude.


The Impact of Stock Options on CPH
        We are now at a point where we can assess the overall impact of stock options on
aggregate CPH. We use our earlier estimates to predict stock option grants and realizations for
all COMPUSTAT firms. We use actual firm data on grants and realizations where reported in the
ExecuComp sample. For COMPUSTAT firms that are not in the ExecuComp sample where we
have a complete set of control variables (where we use predicted instead of actual lag stock
option grants), we predict their stock option realizations using the estimated model presented in
Table 2. For the remaining firms in COMPUSTAT where we have missing data problems for one
or more of our control variables, we impute their stock option realizations.22 We aggregate these
actual and estimated stock option grants and realizations across all publically traded firms, and
then multiply by the assumed fraction of ESOs that comprise NQSOs.23 This provides our
estimate of the total income generated from NQSOs in that year.
        Table 3 shows total compensation for the private non-farm business sector, our estimates
of total NQSO grants and realizations, and the growth rates of all three for the years 1995


        22
          For firms with one or two missing values for our control variables, we impute these missing
values by regressing the variables in question on all other control variables using the estimation sample
which has no missing values. We then predict their grants and realizations using these estimated values
for the missing right-hand-side variables and actual data for the remaining control variables. For firms
with chronic missing data problems, we leave their grant and realization values missing. We then scale
up by 1-digit industry our estimates to cover all public firms by taking our in-sample average grant and
realizations per employee and multiplying this by the ratio of total public firm employment in that
industry to our in-sample public firm employment in that industry.
        23
         We assume that 82% of ESOs represent NQSOs, and that this fraction is constant over our
sample period [see Hewitt Associates (1998)]. When reporting the value of new NQSO grants, we scale
down first by the 82% and then by an additional 50% to reflect the likely overestimate of the value by the
Black-Scholes methodology [see Huddard and Lang (1996)].

                                                   -13-
through 1999. The findings are presented both on an aggregate and on a per worker basis. The
data indicate that in the mid-nineties stock option grants and realizations amounted to less than
one percent of total compensation. However, the growth rates of both have significantly
exceeded the growth rate of compensation. For example, in 1998 stock option grants and
realizations grew by 56 percent and 53 percent respectively, whereas total compensation grew by
8 percent. Over the five years from 1995 to 1999, stock options realizations per worker more
than doubled from $395 to $1,068.24
        The rapid rate of increase in the magnitude of employee stock options raises the
possibility that they may have had a significant impact on the growth of CPH in recent years. The
growth in CPH can be expressed as a weighted average of the growth in stock option realizations
per hour and the growth in other compensation per hour. The weight on the growth in stock
option realizations per hour is the share of stock option realizations in that year to total
compensation. Despite the small weight given to stock option realizations per hour, their fast
growth rate as evidenced in Table 3 may imply a significant contribution to compensation
growth.
        Our estimates of the impact of stock options on the growth in CPH are given in Table 4.
For reference, we give the annual growth in CPH (column 2). We start by recomputing the
growth rate in each year removing from total compensation an estimate of overall NQSO
realizations in public companies. We do this using two different approaches. First, we do a
simple extrapolation from the ExecuComp sample which requires no estimation (column 3). For
each year, we calculate the average stock option realizations per employee based on all firms in
the ExecuComp sample. We then gross this up to cover all public firms by assuming that all
workers in public firms that are not in the ExecuComp sample realized this average value of
stock options. Our second (and preferred) approach is to use our estimates from Table 2 to
predict stock option realizations for COMPUSTAT firms that are not in the ExecuComp sample
(column 4). In both cases, we subtract the implied income from NQSO realizations from total




        24
         Our estimates of the value of stock options per employee are likely to be conservative given our
assumption of no stock option use by privately held firms.

                                                  -14-
compensation in that year, and we divide by total hours to recompute CPH net of the effect of
stock option realizations.25
        The actual growth in nominal CPH accelerated from around 2 percent in 1995 to 5
percent in 1998. This is consistent with the tightening of the labor market during this time period.
Notice, however, that if we removed the contribution of stock option realizations from public
companies using our second approach, growth in CPH in 1998 would have been 4.3 percent.
Stock option realizations appear to have contributed around 0.7 percentage points to the growth
in CPH in 1998. This illustrates the sizeable impact that a fast growing segment of compensation
can have on overall CPH growth rates, even when that segment still accounts for a small fraction
of overall compensation.
        Having removed the influence of current stock option realizations from CPH, we now
recalculate the growth in CPH including the estimated cash value of new grants of ESOs (column
5). This last adjustment yields a CPH measure which should more accurately reflect current labor
market conditions. We add the cash value of new ESO grants to total compensation less stock
option realizations in that year, and we divide by total hours to recompute CPH.
        Does the peculiar way in which stock options enter CPH offer an explanation for the
second pay puzzle? To answer this, we examine the implied growth rate of CPH in 1998 and
1999 where we have removed stock option realizations and included new stock option grants.
Despite continued tightening of labor markets in 1999, actual CPH deaccelerated from its 1998
growth rate [from 5.08 percent in 1998 to 4.64 percent in 1999]. However, when we look at our
adjusted CPH measure, we find that it continued to accelerate through 1999 [from 4.95 percent
in 1998 to 5.05 percent in 1999].26 The dropoff in the pace of actual CPH in 1999, therefore, can



        25
          To assess the reliability of our estimates we also report monte carlo standard errors. These were
computed by simulating draws of new coefficient estimates from the stock option grant and realizations
estimations, recalculating the all of the results, and repeating this process 1,000 times. The reported
standard errors are the standard deviations of the sample distribution of results for each statistic reported
in the table.
        26
          The adjusted CPH growth rate is sensitive to the assumptions we made along the way. For
example, if we assume that the cash value of new grants is 60 percent (40 percent) of the Black-Scholes
value, then the adjusted CPH growth rate in 1999 is 5.13 percent (4.97 percent).

                                                    -15-
potentially be explained by the rapid increase in new stock option grants in this year relative to
current realizations from prior year grants.
       An implication of this finding is that stock options may be changing the traditional
relationship between unemployment rates and pay measures. If firms increasingly use stock
options as a substitute for wage and salary increases in order to attract and retain workers in a
tight labor market, then the impact of tight labor markets will either be muted in the data [for
those pay measures such as the Employment Cost Index that do not reflect stock options], or it
will show up with a several year lag [for pay measures like CPH that reflect realizations ] due to
the vesting requirements for stock options.
       The most comparable effort in the literature at assessing the impact of stock options on
aggregate pay measures is Lebow et al (1999). They construct a sample of employee stock option
plans for 125 S&P 500 firms. Their sample covers the years 1994 to 1998. Using the details of
the option grants, they calculate modified Black-Scholes values for the new grants in each year.
They find that over their sample period, the average stock option grant value per employee grew
at a 31 percent annual rate. This accords well with our data which indicate an average annual
growth rate over this period of 33 percent. Assuming that all workers at public companies
experienced the same rate of growth in stock option grants, they calculate that treating stock
option grants as compensation on the grant date would have added roughly a quarter percentage
point to growth in the Employment Cost Index.


Additional Implications
       Our analysis indicates that while employee stock options still represent a small fraction of
total compensation in the U.S., they have grown rapidly over the past few years. The result, as
shown in Table 4, is that the recent growth of CPH has been significantly impacted by the
behavior of stock option grants and realizations. These findings have several implications which
we now discuss.
       If the trend in the use of stock options continues, a consequence is that CPH growth is
likely to be more variable in the future than it has been in the past. As we saw from the earlier
analysis, current stock option realizations depend to a great extent on the firm‚Äôs recent stock

                                                -16-
performance. Swings in the equity markets will generate swings in stock option realizations that
are likely to exceed the underlying movements in base wage and salary income. This increased
volatility implies that discerning trend changes in CPH growth will be more difficult.
Understanding the impact of stock options on CPH is critical to making the correct inference on
the underlying pay trends. This underscores the need for more accurate and timely data on stock
options.
        An increased reliance on stock options may also increase overall pay flexibility in the
U.S. labor market. A variety of arguments have been put forward as to why employers are
reluctant to impose nominal wage cuts on workers during adverse times [see Lebow et al (1995),
Groshen and Schweitzer (1996), Card and Hyslop (1997) and McLaughlin (1999)]. A corollary is
that some inflation is good for labor market efficiency in that it allows for real wage reductions
even in the absence of nominal wage reductions. Stock options by design build in downward pay
flexibility. As noted earlier, the typical NQSO is issued with the strike price equal to the market
price. If the firm does not produce equity gains during the vesting period, then the options will
remain out-of-the-money and will not be exercised by the workers.27 This added pay flexibility
may help to relax any constraints imposed by nominal wage rigidities that may exist in the base
wage and salary components of pay. As a consequence, the labor market may be able to operate
efficiently at a lower steady-state rate of inflation.
        Finally, stock options may strengthen the link between pay and performance. Hall and
Liebman (1998) argue that the increasing importance of stock options in executive pay has been
the primary determinant of the increased sensitivity of executive compensation to firm
performance. As stock options filter down through the salary ranks, an increasing segment of a
firm‚Äôs salary liability will become linked to firm performance. This restructuring of the wage
contract between a firm and its workers may be contributing to the upturn in labor productivity
[see Black & Lynch (2000)].




        27
          Firms, however, may reprice their employee stock options and/or issue new stock option grants
in order to restore incentives. See Carter and Lynch (2000) for FASB reporting of repricing of ESOs.

Conclusions
       In this paper, we try to resolve one of the aggregate pay puzzles in the 1990s by exploring
the impact that stock options are having on the growth of CPH. The actual growth in nominal
CPH accelerated from around 2 percent in 1995 to 5 percent in 1998. As labor markets continued
to tighten in 1999, the growth of CPH paradoxically slowed. When we recalculate CPH growth
to reflect the value of current stock option grants and not current realizations, we find that our
adjusted CPH measure accelerated in each year from 1995 to 1999. The timing of when stock
options are picked up in CPH, then, does help to explain the pay puzzle of the late 1990s.

Appendix A: Estimating the level of stock option realizations

       We use a generalized Tobit framework for estimating a firm‚Äôs stock option realizations. Let
*
I denote a latent index for the propensity for a firm‚Äôs workers to realize their vested options in a
given year. Let R* denote desired realizations, and R actual realizations. We assume that I* and ln
R* have a continuous distribution, while ln R has a censored distribution.

                                   I it = Z itŒ≥ + Œµ1it ,
                                    *




                                  ln Rit = X it Œ≤ + Œµ 2 it ,
                                        *




                                  Ô£´ Œµ1 Ô£∂                    Ô£Æ1 œÉ 12 Ô£π
                                  Ô£¨Œµ Ô£∑   : N ( 0, ‚àë ) , ‚àë = Ô£Ø‚ãÖ œÉ 2 Ô£∫ ,
                                  Ô£≠ 2Ô£∏                      Ô£∞     2 Ô£ª

                                                    *      *
                                             ln Rit if I it > 0
                                  ln Rit =
                                               0 otherwise

          The probability of a firm having positive stock option realizations in a year is given by
F (Zit ?). Given the assumed normality of the two error terms, the observed stock option realizations
have the following conditional mean.

                                                                           œÜ ( ZitŒ≥ )
                          E(ln Rit | ln Rit* > 0) = X it Œ≤ + œÉ 12                         ,
                                                                           Œ¶ ( Z itŒ≥ )

where f and F are the standard normal density function and cumulative density functions,
respectively. The expected unconditional stock option realizations are given by the probability of
observing positive realizations in a year multiplied by the expected conditional magnitude of the
realizations.
                                                                                œÜ ( Z it Œ≥ )
                        E (ln Rit | Z it , X it ) = Œ¶ ( Z it )[ X it Œ≤ + œÉ 12                ]
                                                                                Œ¶ ( Z itŒ≥ )

         We estimate this model in two steps. First, we estimate the ? parameters using a Probit
model. Using these estimates, we calculate the variable f /F for each observation with a positive
realization. We then estimate the √ü parameters by regressing the log positive realizations on our X
variables and f /F .
