                                             ABSTRACT

We use nine waves of the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) to investigate the large labor market
height premium observed in the BHPS, where each inch of height is associated with a 1.5 percent increase
in wages, for both men and women. We find that half of the premium can be explained by the association
between height and educational attainment among BHPS participants. Of the remaining premium,
half can be explained by taller individuals selecting into higher status occupations and industries. These
effects are consistent with our earlier findings that taller individuals on average have greater cognitive
function, which manifests in greater educational attainment, and better labor market opportunities.

1. Introduction

Recent research on the association between height, earnings and occupational choice

shows that that each extra inch of height is associated with a one-to-two percent increase

in average hourly earnings for men and women (Case and Paxson 2008). This labor

market height premium can be explained largely by the association between height and

cognitive function: healthier, better nourished children are significantly more likely to

reach both their height potential and their cognitive potential. In two British birth cohort

studies, the 1958 National Child Development Study (NCDS) and the 1970 British

Cohort Study (BCS), there is a positive and significant association between height and

cognitive function during childhood. Moreover, the height premium observed for these

cohorts in adulthood largely disappears when test scores from childhood – a proxy for

cognitive ability in adulthood – are added as controls.

       In this paper, we examine the height-earnings nexus using nine waves of panel

data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS). Labor market outcomes for the

NCDS cohort are currently available only at ages 33 and 42, and the BCS at age 30,

while the BHPS annually reports on labor market outcomes of adults of all working ages.

In Wave 14 of the BHPS, information was collected on adults’ heights. We use this

information, together with labor market data collected annually from 1996 to 2005, to

analyze the association between height, education, occupation and earnings in the BHPS.

We find that each inch of height is associated with a 1.5 to a 1.8 percent increase in

wages for both men and women. Non-parametric regressions (not shown here) indicate

that this is true for the range of heights observed in the BHPS.




                                              3
        Our results differ from those presented by Heineck (2008), who also uses BHPS

data to analyze the height premium. He concludes that his results “mainly do not

reinforce the existence of simple linear height-wage premiums for tall workers” (page

293). The differences in conclusions reached by the two papers arise in part because of

differences in the BHPS samples chosen for analysis. We use all data available in nine

waves, Wave 7 (1997) to Wave 15 (2005), while Heineck uses data from Wave 14 only.

        More importantly for the results, the papers also take different modeling

approaches. Heineck mentions that “tall workers might self-select into occupations which

reward being tall,” and for this reason he analyzes height premiums by occupation (page

292). We believe this is problematic. If taller workers select into better-paying

occupations, one would want to document that in the data, as it may highlight a channel

through which the height premium operates. Even a large labor market height premium

could be masked in analyses carried out solely within occupation. In addition, Heineck’s

choice to divide workers by sex into nine occupational categories, using just one wave of

the BHPS, leads to very small cell sizes. We follow a different strategy, quantifying the

extent to which height is associated with greater educational attainment and selection into

higher skill occupations. We then examine the extent to which education, occupation and

industry choice can explain the height premium we find throughout the height

distribution.



2. Data and methods

Summary statistics for our sample are presented in Table 1. We analyze an unbalanced

panel of individuals interviewed between 1997 and 2005. In any given wave, we use data




                                             4
on individuals who were ages 21 to 60 during that wave. Some individuals (those in

middle age) will be present in every wave. Younger members of the BHPS may only be

present in the last waves (after they reach age 21), while older members age out of our

sample. Individuals must be present at Wave 14, when height data were collected.1

         The samples of individuals are not large, with fewer than 4000 observations each

for men and women. For this reason we divide occupations into three groups, which we

refer to as “high skill” (managers and senior officials, professional occupations);

“medium skill” (associate professionals and technical, administrative and secretarial,

skilled trade, sales and customer service occupations); and “low skill” (personal services,

process, plant and machine operators, and elementary occupations). We assign each

individual the modal occupation skill level we observe for him or her between 1997 and

2005. We use multinomial logits to examine the relationship between height and

occupation, and indicators for these three occupation-skill classes, when analyzing the

relationship between earnings, height and occupation. In some specifications of the wage

equations, we include 17 indicators of the individual’s current industry as controls.

         The complexity of the British education system does not allow a simple

translation from educational milestones to years of completed education. For that reason,

we use a categorical variable when quantifying the relationship between schooling and

height (with “no schooling” equal to zero, a “Certificate of Secondary Education” (CSE)

equal to one, and so on through “higher degree,” which takes a value of six). We use

ordered probits to examine the relationship between height and educational attainment,

 In our panel data regressions, we allow unobservables to be correlated for the same individual seen
multiple times. Regression results are unweighted, but results are qualitatively and quantitatively similar
when regressions are weighted using Wave 14 sampling weights.

and indicators for each education level, when analyzing the relationship between

earnings, height and education.



3. Results

We present results on the association between height and educational attainment in the

first column of Table 2.2 For both men and women, an inch of height is associated with a

positive and significant increase in the ordered probit index. For men, each inch of height

has the same effect on the ordered probit index as a roll-back of the age clock of five

years, so that movement from the 25th to the 75th percentile in the height distribution (an

increase of 4 inches) has an association with educational attainment comparable to

moving to a younger (and more highly-educated) generation.

        The second set of columns in Table 2 present the change in the log odds of being

in a high- or medium-skill occupation relative to being in a low-skill occupation, given a

one inch increase in height. Being taller is associated with a greater probability of being

observed in a higher skilled job, for both men and women. The change in the probability

for men is especially noteworthy: every inch of height increases the probability of being

observed in a high skill occupation, relative to a low skill occupation, by 16 percentage

points.3 Results in Table 2 suggest that height is significantly associated with greater

educational attainment, and selection into higher skill occupations – both of which confer

higher earnings capacity.

        Table 3 presents estimates of the height premium found in the BHPS, and

examines whether education, occupation and industry choice provide an explanation for

relationship between height, education, and occupation once for each person followed by the BHPS.

  That is 0.118 × (31.58/23.31).


                                                   6
the greater hourly earnings of taller people. The first column presents the coefficients on

height from log hourly earnings regressions in which the sample is restricted to people

ages 21 to 50 from Wave 14. Restricting the sample in this way, we come very close to

replicating the findings reported in Heineck (2008). Younger workers are taller, on

average,4 but older workers have greater labor market experience and higher earnings on

average. In order to avoid confounding height effects with age effects, the second column

runs regressions for the same sample, but includes controls for age, age squared and race.

Controlling for age (and, so comparing workers of the same vintage), the height

premiums are substantially larger, particularly for men. Increasing the sample size in

column 3, by adding workers ages 51 to 60, has no measurable effect on the height

premium, although the standard errors are reduced due to the increase in sample size.

         Opening the sample to observations from waves 7 through 15 in column 4 has

little effect on results. However, the inclusion of indicators for educational attainment

reduces the labor market height premium by half for men, and by two-thirds for women.5

The addition of indicators for occupation and industry, which are themselves highly

correlated with earnings, reduce the height premiums in half again. These results are

consistent with the greater average educational attainment of taller workers and sorting

by height into higher-paying occupations.



4. Conclusions

The evidence here confirms that each inch of height increases wages by approximately

1.5 percent, and shows that much of this premium can be explained by taller workers

4
  In the BHPS, each year of age is associated with a 0.04 inch reduction in reported height.
5
  In all regressions in Table 3 that include education indicators, they are jointly highly significant. This is
true also for industry and occupation indicators.

obtaining more education and sorting into higher-status occupations. These findings

suggest that the association between height and earnings may be driven by the influence

of early life health and nutrition on adult height, educational attainment and occupational

choice.
