               RECENT TRENDS IN U.S. TRADE AND INVESTMENT


                                Abstract



     This paper reviews some of the main recent developments in U.S.
trade and overseas investment against the background of long—term trends.
     The United States, and particularly the agricultural sector, has
become more linked with the rest of the world. The commodity distribution
of trade has moved toward being in large part an exchange of U.S. manu-
factured goods for other countriest manufactures even though the share
of developed countries in U.S. trade has declined. The fall in the U.S.
share of world trade which began around 1950 has slowed down or even
stopped, as has the fall in the terms of trade of the United States and
other developed countries.
     The U.S. share of new direct investment outflows has fallen while
that of Japan and Germany have increased, but the United States has
become one of the major recipients of direct investment from other coun-
tries. U.S. firms have increasingly accepted less than 100 per cent or
even majority ownership, but majority ownership is still the usual form,
by a large margin, in industries in which technology is important.
U.S.—owned affiliates in foreign countries, particularly those in the
smaller Asian countries, have shifted their activities towards exporting.
In most areas U.S. affiliates increased their exports more in recent
years than did other firms in their host countries, thus increasing
their share of exports from these countries.

                        Trade and the U.S. Economy

 U.S. Trade and Outjp

      For much of its history the United States has been a relatively

 isolated economy, in the sense that its trade with the rest of the world

 has been small relative to total output.   During most of the 19th Century

 and up until World War I merchandise exports were around 6 to 7 per cent

of GNP. The Great Depression of the 1930's disrupted and reduced inter-

national trade, and after World War II U.S. involvement was at an even

lower level——only about 4 per cent in the 1950's and l960's (Lipsev,

1971, p. 554). Starting in 1970, the trade links began to become stronger,

until by the early 1980's the ratio had doubled, with merchandise exports

at about 8 per cent of CNP (Table 1).

     The comparison of merchandise exports with GNP understates the U.S.

links with the rest of the world since much of CNP consists of the produc-

tion of services, omitted from merchandise exports, and that part of GNP

has been growing steadily. Exports of goods and services are now 12—13

per cent of GNP, as compared with 6 per cent in the l960's, and merchan-

dise exports are close to 20 per cent of goods production alone, as

compared to 8 per cent of total GNP. The trade links with the rest of

the world are much stronger for U.S. goods production than for service

production: exports of services are about 10 per cent of service industry

output if factor incomes (mainly profits on direct investment abroad) are

included in services, and only 3—1/2 per cent if factor incomes are

excluded.    Furthermore, the export ratio for services has been growing
much less   rapidly than that for goods. Thus the rise in the share of

services    in   GNP has tended to hold back the increase in exporting.

     All of these statements about exporting apply equally or even more

strongly to imports, since U.S. imports were rising more rapidly than

exports. Thus the rise in exports does not represent a gain in the

competitiveness of the United States in the world economy but rather an

increasing degree of integration: closer ties with the rest of the world.

     The rise in U.S. trade/output ratios reflects two developments. One

is a very long—run trend in the world economy, discussed below. The other

is the change in the relation of U.S. growth to world economic growth.

At least from the 1870's through the 1930's or even the early 1950's the

ratios of exports and imports to commodity output declined in the United

States (Lipsey, 1971, p. 554). One reason was that the United States was

growing rapidly relative to its trading partners; both its markets and

sources of supply were growing comparatively slowly. Since the 1950's

the reverse has been true. The United States has been growing more

slowly than its major trading partners; it is therefore selling to more

rapidly growing markets and buying from more rapidly growing producers.

     The rise in the importance of trade in the national economy is not

particularly a U.S. phenomenon. It is evident in the data for the major

European countries, Canada, and Japan as well. In every case the ratios

of both exports and imports to goods production rose during the 1970's,

as did the ratios of trade to GM' (Table 2). However, the move towards

a greater importance of trade was larger in the United States than in

any of the other countries, on both the export side and the import side.

              The increase in the proportion of output traded has been a charac-
    teristic of     the years sinde World War II, but it is     also part of a much
    larger     and longer trend for the world as a whole. Simon Kuznets calcu-

 lated that over the century from 1800 to the beginning of World War               I
    the   world ratio of trade (exports plus imports) to output rose from

 approximately 3 per cent to about one third (Kuznets, 1964 and 1967).

 This      enormous growth of trade was presumably due to the great decline
 in the cost of transportation and communication and the improvement In
 its      quality. World War I, the depression of the 1930's, and World War

II all tended to reduce this ratio somewhat, but the upward trend has

resumed since the l950's and continued with few interruptions.

          The sector of the U.S. economy perhaps shifting most strongly to:ard

dependence         on the rest of the world in recent    years has been agriculture.

Agriculture had always been more export—oriented than the rest of the

U.S. economy, exports being 10—15 per cent            of agricultural   gross product

even before the Civil War, when the ratio for all products was only 6 or

7    per cent. The ratio rose to over 20 per          cent at the end of the 19th

Century        and during the 1920's. In the Great Depression of the 1930's,
agricultural dependence on trade declined, but since World War II, more
and more of U.S. agricultural production has gone into exports (Lipsey,

1971, p. 556). In the 1960's agricultural exports were more               than a
quarter        of gross farm   output   and, by a better measure of trade dependence,

agricultural        exports were about 15 per cent of farm rnarketings (Table 3)1


          1
      The comparison with marketings is a better measure since both
exports and marketings are measures of sales, not net of intermediate
inputs,        while gross farm output nets out a large amount of such inputs.

By the 1980's the ratio of exports to gross farm        income was over 60 per
cent   and the share of farm sales made abroad was over 30 per cent.
The Commodity Composition of U.S. Merchandise Trade

       Large changes have been taking place in the commodity composition

of U.S. merchandise trade. As the economy of the United States developed,

its export trade steadily shifted toward finished manufactures, from

less than ten per cent in the early 19th Century to 60 per cent in the

1960's (Lipsey, 1971, p. 568), and that proportion has remained relatively

constant since then. On the import side, on the other hand, manufactures

started out as the main item——more than half the total in the first half

of the 1800's——and then declined in importance as U.S. manufacturing

capacity grew. By the 1920's, and still in the first decade after World

War II, finished manufactures were less than 20 per cent of U.S. imports.

Then, beginning in the 1950's, there was a shift in the composition of

imports    back toward finished manufactures, their share rising to over half
at the beginning of the 1970's (Table 4).        After that time, of course, the

enormous rise in oil prices shifted the composition of imports toward crude

materials, but most of that growth was at the expense of food imports; the

share of finished manufactures remains close to half. Thus with respect

to the share of finished manufactures in imports, the United States has

returned to its    pattern of   the early 19th   Century, although the export
distribution is very different. Instead      of exchanging foods and raw

materials for finished manufactures, the United States is now        to a large
extent exchanging finished manufactures for other finished manufactures.
       Within the rising trade in manufactures, the most rapidly growing

segments   have been machinery, transport equipment, and instruments.

These rose from 35 to about 45 per cent of total exports and from 57 to
about 67 per cent of manufactured exports between 1960 and 1980 (U.S.
Bureau   of the Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States, various

issues). Within this fast—growing group the leading commodities were

electronic computers, parts and accessories, telecommunications equipment,

air conditioning equipment, and instruments, which more than doubled their

shares of total and manufacturing exports over these 20 years.

     The comparative advantage of the United States has been thought of

for many years as being concentrated in machinery and transport equipment,

particularly capital goods. These and automotive vehicles and parts

accounted for over a third of U.S. exports in the early 1960's and over 40 per

cent in the 1970's (Table 5). What has changed markedly is the position of

these same two groups of commodities on the import side, growing from

less than 10 per cent to almost a quarter of imports. The automobile

case is best known, involving both the greatly increased share of Japanese

cars in the U.S. market and the operation of the Canada—U.S. Auto

Agreement, which promotes both exports and imports of automotive products.

The rise in imports of capital goods is equally impressive, particularly

in view of the fact that it has taken place in the presumed area of U.S.

comparative advantage. There are, however, several important differences

between the capital goods and automotive groups. For one thing, in the

latter group the value of U.S. exports has been below that of imports

since the late 1960's, while in capital goods there is still a large

surplus, running at over $50 billion per year in the early 1980's.

Secondly, there has been a marked slackening in the rate of growth of

capital goods imports relative to that of exports of capital goods,

although the import growth rate may still be a bit higher. Rapidly as

imports have grown, however, the export surplus on capital goods was far

larger relative to CNP in the late 1970's and early 1980's than in the

1960's (Table 6). There were wide swings in the surplus with large

increases in 1974 and 1975, followed by a gradual decline, and then

another large increase in 1980. The increases seemed to have roughly

coincided with both the two major oil price increases and U.S. recessions.

Most of the sharp changes in the surplus were in U.S. exports rather than

imports.

     The items contributing to the growth of both surpluses and deficits

in the machinery trade account can be identified more precisely. Items

on which the trade deficit increased more rapidly than the CNP, and for

which we may therefore infer erosion of American comparative advantage

included telecommunications equipment, even though, as mentioned earlier,

it was one of the fastest—growing items of U.S. exports (Table A—6). Items

producing increasing trade surpluses, relative to GM?, included office

machines, because of the contribution of electronic computers and acces—

ones, aircraft and parts, n.e.c., and professional, scientific, and

controlling instruments. All were products for which not only exports but

also imports were rising very rapidly. In all three products imports were

growing more rapidly than exports for the first period calculated, 1965 to

1970, but in only one product, office machines, did the higher rate of

growth persist over 15 years. Even in this case, the rate of growth of

imports declined over the period, until in the last 5 years it was barely

larger than that of exports. Thus it would be inadvisable to project into

the future a more rapid rate of growth on one side of the trade account

relative    to the other, particularly if the more rapid growth is associated

with low initial values.


The Geographical Distribution of U.S. Merchandise Trade

       There has been a major shift of merchandise exports away from

developed market economies since 1965, particularly in foods and

related products and in chemicals (Table 7). For total trade, the

increases in exports were mainly to the OPEC countries and the centrally

planned economies, but there was also an increase in the share of other

developing countries. In food products, the major shift was from

developed market economies especially to centrally planned economies,

but there was also a substantial shift to OPEC countries. In chemicals,

most   of the fall in the share of developed market economies went to
developing countries other than OPEC, mainly in Latin America and Asia.
The decline in the developed countries' share of U.S. exports was smaller
in machinery and transport equipment than in the other two groups we
discuss   (partly as a consequence of the Canada—U.S. Auto Agreement) and

the main gain was in exports to OPEC countries. While the gains in

shares of the OPEC countries were not very large in terms of percentages

of total exports, because their original shares were so low, it should

be mentioned that they      were large relative to the original levels. There
were   increases in OPEC shares of exports ranging from about 50      per cent
to more than double.
       On the whole, it appears that U.S. merchandise exnorts shifted to a
substantial   degree away from    other Industrial   countries and towards developing
countries   and   the   centrally planned economies. The shift to OPEC, among the

developing countries, presumably was in large measure a consequence of
the increase in OPEC countries' income from the rise in oil prices. The

United States was able to offset about a third of the rise in its oil

import bill between 1965 and 1975 directly by this increase in exports

to OPEC countries. The 1979—80 jump in oil prices reduced the offset

to only about 20 per cent, but that is because the expansion of U.S.

exports to the oil exporting countries takes some time to develop.

     As Branson (1981) has pointed out, the reallocation of U.S. resources

stemming from the oil price increases and the income gains of oil pro-

ducers is not confined to this direct route. Much of the income of the

oil producers is channeled into international financial markets and

borrowed by the rapidly growing developing countries. Part of their

borrowings are then used to finance purchases of capital goods from the

United States, so that some of the gain we describe in U.S. exports to

non—oil developing countries may be an indirect consequence of the oil

boom and an indirect way of financing U.S. oil imports.

     Another way of describing the direct shift in U.S. exports is to

say that in 1965 U.S. exports went 2/3 to developed countries and 1/3 to

developing countries, overall and in food products, chemicals, and

machinery and transport equipment. By 1980, all the developed country

shares were 60 per cent or less, and for food products and chemicals,

about half or less. Still, it is worth pointing out that developed

countries   accounted for half or more of increases in exports overall
and in the two groups other than foods. The developed countries, despite
the major geographical shifts in trade, remain the main markets for U.S.
exports.
                                   — 17 —



      On the import side the geographical shifts have been
                                                             larger. The
 most notable in the aggregate are the rise in the OPEC countries' share

 of U.S. imports and the corresponding decline in the proportion coming from

 developed countries, both much greater than the reorientation on the

 export side. While part of this shift was a rise in the OPEC share within

 the fuels category, a large part in addition reflected the great increase

 in the importance of the fuels category resulting from the OPEC price

 increases.

      Within the broad categories shown here, the major change, outside of

 that in fuels, and perhaps the most important for the future, was in U.S.

imports of machinery and transport equipment. There was a decline in the

developed countries' share, which had been almost 100 per cent, and a

rise in that of the non—OPEC developing countries——mainly Asian. In 1965

they accounted for less than 2 per cent of U.S. imports of machinery and

equipment and by 1980 their share had risen to 12 per cent.

     The shift in aggregate imports can be summarized by saying that in

1965 two—thirds of U.S. imports came from developed countries, a quarter

from non—OPEC developing countries, and less than a tenth from OPEC. By

1980, the developed country share had fallen to one—half, about equal to

that of all developing countries. The latter share was almost evenly

split between OPEC and non—OPEC countries. The non—OPEC developing

country share changed little, although its commodity composition was

altered.



                 The U.S. Role in World Merchandise Trade

     The United States has accounted for a declining share of world

merchandise trade for some years, but that is a comparatively recent
                                — 18 —




phenomenon.     The share of the United States approximately doubled during

the 19th Century and again during the first half of the 20th Century.

Until the 1880's most of the U.S. gains were at the expense of the largely

agricultural exporters of Eastern and Southern Europe. For the next

70 years or so they were largely at the expense of the countries of

industrial Europe, which bore the heaviest burden of two   devastating
World Wars. The difference between the two periods reflects the change

in the character of the United States from a largely agricultural

exporter in the 19th Century to a heavily Industrialized country   in   the

20th Century.

     Since the 1950's the U.S. share in world trade has fallen steadily.

To some extent this has reflected the recovery from World War II of the

economies of Western Europe and Japan. However, the 1950's were a turning

point in a broader sense, being the end of a period of 150 years In which

U.S. population and income were growing relative to the rest of the world.

Since then, the U.S. shares of world population and income have fallen.

Thus the norm against which to measure changes in the U.S. share of trade

should probably be something other than a constant share. For example,

the U.S. share of world population fell by 16 per cent between 1950 and

1980 and the U.S. share of world industrial production and industrial

production in manufacturing fell by 22 per cent between 1960 and 1980

(UN Statistical Yearbook and Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, various Issues).

Most of the declines in the U.S. share of output came before 1975. Whatever

the reasons for these declines in population and production growth rates,

they presumably reflect causes outside the trade area.
                                   - 19   -




      The U.S. share in world merchandise exports declined almost continu-

ously from 1950 through the end of the 1970's (Table 8). Between 1960

 and 1979 that share fell by a third, considerably more than the decline In

 the U.S. share of world income or population, and the loss in U.S. shares

seemed to accelerate during the 1970's instead of slowing down. Among the

malor areas of U.S. comparative advantage, there was an increase of the U.S.

share in exports of foods, beverages, and tobacco in the l970's but large

declines in shares in chemicals and machinery and transport equipment.

The pattern of changes in U.S. shares of developed market economy exports

was similar, with one exception: in the early 1970's the U.S. share of

world exports fell much more rapidly than its share of developed—country

exports. The reason for the difference Is in the developed market

economy share of world exports. Despite the rapid growth of some develop-

ing countries, the share of developed market economies in world exports

steadily increased through the early 1970's. Then, in 1973 and 1974 the

enormous rise in the price of oil, largely a developing country export,

sharply increased the share of these countries in world exports, reducing
the shares of the United States and other developed countries. After
1974 the developed country share crept up again until the second large oil

price Increase in 1979 again reversed the trend, at least temporarily.

     1979 and 1980 showed some reversal of the long decline in U.S. shares

of developed country merchandise exports. That reversal was observable

in each of the three groups shwri here as well as in the total. To judge

by the U.S. share in exports of developed market economies, the U.S.

share in world exports may have stopped declining in 1977 and may even

have risen a bit since then, despite the rise in oil prices in 1979—80.

However, it is not yet clear how much of the U.S.        increase   is the result

of cyclical factors.

The   Terms of   Trade

        The developed countries in general, and the United States as a part

of that group, have in the last decade suffered sharp declines in their

terms of trade. This is particularly true for the terms of trade for

their exports of manufactures to developing countries relative to their

imports from those countries. Our best estimate of this decline, which

includes some correction for improvements in the quality of capital goods,

is something like 50 per cent between the 1960's and the late 1970's

(Table 9). Much of this decline stems from the rise in the price of oil,

of course, but even if oil is omitted from primary products one finds a

large    fall——perhaps about 25 per cent. Thus there was an important rise
in the relative prices of primary products compared with manufactured
goods.
      A longer view of the terms of trade        shows little net change over the

whole    span of years   from the 1870's or 1890's   to the early 1950's before
the   recent fall. However, the real lesson of the long perspective is

that there is no clear trend. Instead, there are large fluctuations that

eventually reverse themselves. Thus we would not expect a continuation

of the deteriorating terms of trade for developed countries of the last

two decades. In fact, the last few years have been more favorable, in

this sense, to the developed countries.

                             U.S. Direct Investment Abroad

Sources and Direction of Investment

        The chief vehicle for the transmission of new products and new

technologies in the 19th century and earlier were migration and trade.

The fact that Great Britain attempted to restrict the emigration of

skilled textile workers showed that the notion of technological leads

and their value in giving a country advantages in trading with others

is a very old one. The establishment of many American industries in the

19th    century   was   associated with the immigration of particular natlonali—
ties.      For example, Germans founded most American breweries, and the names

of the companies today still show their origin.

        With the growth of large enterprises, and especially large manufac--

turing enterprises, at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th

century, a new form of technology transfer came into existence. That was

direct investment: the ownership of a factory or a sales or service

establishment in one country by a company from another country. There

had been international banking partnerships earlier, and companies forrnd

in one country for the exploitation of mines or other resources abroad,

but direct investment in foreign manufacturing came to be the character-

istically American form of foreign investment. Two of the earliest American

investors, carrying American inventions abroad, were the Singer Sewing

Machine    Company and the International Harvester Company.
       American direct investment expanded rapidly     after World War II and

particularly      in the 1960's but the flow showed somewhat in the 1970's,

not in nominal terms, but in real terms, using any reasonable deflator.2


       2
        These general descriptions of recent developments in direct invest-
ment are drawn mainly from OECD (1981) and Christelow (1982).
                                   — 24 —



        Almost all direct investment——close to 95 per cent——comes from the

developed industrial countries. The two major sources, the U.S. and the

U.K., accounted for about 70 per cent of the stock of all direct invest—

ment in 1967 but less than 60 per cent in 1976, with Germany, Japan, and

to a smaller extent, Switzerland, replacing them (Table 10). Changes in

the sources of direct investment flows have been more startling: the

United States down from 61 per cent in 1961—67 to 29 per cent in 1974—79,

and Germany and Japan up from 14 per cent to 40 per cent.3 On the other

hand, the United States became a major destination of direct investment

from other countries during the same period. Of direct investment flows

to developed countries, the United States received only 3 per cent in

1961—67 and 27 per cent in 1974—78. At the same time, some traditionally

heavy recipients of direct investment had their shares reduced sharply.

Canada and Australia, for example, received 32 per cent of the flow to

developed countries in 1961—67 and only 13 per cent in the later period.

     To some extent the shift in direct investment flows probably reflected

changes in currency values. The overvaluation of the dollar in the 1960's

added to the incentives for the export of funds while the possible under-
valuation of the dollar in the 1970's was an attraction for investment.

last   period ($.52 per dollar of market value of net worth)4 may also

have had some influence on the direction of these flows.

       Aside from these very large shifts in resource flows among developed

countries there was also a modest gain in the share of developing coun-

tries, from 30 per cent in 1965—69 to 33 per cent in 1975—79. However,

the newly industrializing countries, or NIC's (Brazil, Greece, Israel,

Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, Spain, and Taiwan), increased their share

of direct investment) inf lows from 10 to 15½ per cent, partly at the

expense of OPEC and other developing countries.

       Bearing in mind the minor role of developing countries in U.S.

direct investment in general it is of interest to mention one other

trend. U.S. parent companies have always been reluctant to share owner-

ship in affiliates, despite the pressure in this direction from host

country governments. Of the multinationals' affiliates surveyed in the

Harvard program that were established before 1951, 58 per cent of the

U.S.—owned affiliates, 39 per cent of European affiliates, and 27 per

cent of affiliates of firms in other countries were wholly—owned.5 All

these proportions had decreased by the          late   1960's, to 46, 19, and 6 per

cent, but the preference of U.S. firms for 100 per cent ownership remains

clear.

       While there has been some shift by U.S. parents towards sharing of

ownership      most of    U.S.—owned production abroad is in majority-owned

affiliates:       about    3/4 in developed countries and 85 per cent in develop-

ing countries (Table 11). The ratio for the latter group, however,

 reflects   mainly the high proportion of production by majority—owned

 firms in the petroleum industry in developing countries and the great

 importance    of petroleum——well over half of total affiliate sales——in
 these countries. Within manufacturing the relation is reversed; 80 per
 cent of affiliate sales in developed countries and only 70 per cent
 in   developing countries are by majority—owned affiliates.

 Thus the efforts by developing countries to gain substantial shares in

 the equity of foreign—owned affiliates seem to have had some success.

        One would expect that the more technologically oriented an industry

 was or the more that it relied on proprietary information, the smaller

 the willingness of the parent company to share information and the greater

 the insistence on control or total ownership. It is thus not surprising

 that in the more technologically—oriented industries the shares of sales

 by majority—owned affiliates are higher than average. The two industries

 relying heavily on advertising, foods and soaps and cleansers, also tend

 to be dominated by majority—owned affiliates.

        We have to modify our earlier statement, then, about the success in

 forcing host—country partnership: it tends not to     succeed very   well in

 technologically—oriented   industries.    A corollary is that if it does

 succeed, it   may only be at the cost of reducing investment.


 U.S.—Owned Affiliates and Host—Country Exports

      The effects of direct investment on trade, particularly those of direct

investment in manufacturing, are usually analyzed in terms that suggest

that it is a substitute for exports from the home country. That may be

because capital movements in general, whether direct or portfolio, are

thought of as substitutes for trade, along the lines of the Mundell (1957)
                                      — 29




analysis.     Or it may   be   because, as in the sore recent analyses specifi-

cally of direct investment, such investment is thought of as involving a

decision by the parent company as to whether to serve an essentially fixed

host—country    market by   exporting from the home country or by host—country

production.6 However, the empirical examinations of        the relation of home—
country exports to direct investment have almost all searched in vain for

any evidence of such substitution.

    Another side of the concern with trade effects of direct investment has

been the fear among host countries that foreign—controlled subsidiaries are

prevented by their parent companies from competing with them outside the

host—country market, and that foreign ownership therefore impedes the devel-

opment of export industries. That issue has been discussed and studied

extensively in Canada in particular8 although the advantage of such a

policy to a parent maximizing its worldwide income is not obvious. On the

other hand, countries welcoming direct investment from abroad often look on

it as an aid to establishing or increasing exports because the foreign

owners bring previously unavailable technology, established marketing faci—

lities, or entree to the parents' home markets. In the United States, at

present, one of the chief concerns of trade policymakers is that host

countries are squeezing U.S. exports out of third—country markets by

forcing U.S.—owned affiliates to export as the price for host—country per-

mission to invest or to take over existing firms. Again, Canada is a par—

 ticular   focus of this concern although export requirements are increasingly

 applied in developing countries.


Production for Export and for Local Sale

    U.S.—owned manufacturing affiliates have always had as their main

markets the host countries within which they operate. In 1966, over 80 per

cent of sales were within the host countries, and the proportion of local

sales was over 90 per cent for affiliates in developing countries.

Although U.S. foreign production is heavily concentrated in developed

countries (about 85 per cent of sales in both 1966 and 1977) the number of

manufacturing affiliates in developing countries was almost 30 per cent of

the total in 1966. Thus, the proportion of affiliates engaged almost

entirely in host—country sales irust have been very large.

    Although host—country sales remained the predominant business of manu-

facturing affiliates in 1977, there had clearly been a major shift in their

activity. The share of exports in total sales rose from 16 per cent in

1957 to 19 per cent in 1966 and to 31 per cent in 1977, and this shift took

place in both developed and developing countries (Table]2).      Among the deve-
loping countries the overall rise in the export ratio was very large: from 8

to 18 per cent (Table 12).   There was a very large increase in the export

ratio for the group of countries called "Other Asia and Pacific, except

India, Indonesia and the Philippines," principally
                                                      I-long Kong, Singapore,

Malaysia, Taiwan, and South Korea, as well as a rise in the importance of

that group among the developing countries.     Affiliates in these countries
had been comparatively export_oriented

sales)    and by 1977, almost three quarters of their sales were for export.

       For U.S. affiliates in developed countries, exports to the United

States were only about 30 per cent of total exports in both 1966 and 1977,

and even in the later year remained less than 10 per cent of their sales.

Only for   affiliates in Canada was the U.S.   market of major importance (a

quarter   of sales) and this high ratio was partly attributable to the trade
in automobiles and parts resulting from the U.S.—Canadian auto agreement.
U.S.   affiliates in developing countries did   shift their exports to the

United   States to some degree (38   to 50 per cent of exports) but the U.S.

market still accounted for less than 10 per cent of sales in 1977. Even
that was a large rise from 1957. The chief exceptions once again were the
small Asian countries, for whom exports to the U.S. reached well over half

of exports in 1977 and probably about 50 per cent of their total sales,

four or five times the 1957 share.

    In general, then, exporting to the United States has been a relatively

minor activity of U.S. manufacturing affiliates in foreign countries for the

last twenty years. The major exceptions to this generalization are the

affiliates in the small Asian countries, for which the United States is a

major market, accounting for roughly half of their sales, and those in

Canada. The chief trends in affiliate activity over the twenty years have

been the rise in export orientation of affiliates in most parts of the

world, but particularly in the small Southeast Asian countries, the shift

away from exporting to the United States by European affiliates, and the

shift towards the United States as a market by those in Canada and in Asian

developing countries.

   To some extent, the differences between affiliates in developed

countries and those in developing areas may have reflected the industry

composition of activities in the two types of host countries. Affiliates in
                                   — 33 —




 developed countries were more heavily involved with sales of machinery

and transportation equipment and those in developing countries with sales

of food products and chemicals (Table 13). However, there was considerable

convergence in the industry composition of the two groups of countries:

in particular from the large fall in importance of food products and rise

in machinery sales among affiliates in the developing countries.

     In data for the major investing industries we find several common

characteristics and developments. Affiliates in all industries worldwide

became more export—orient ed, and the same was true for affiliates in the

great majority of regions, including those in Europe for all the industries.

However, even in the most export—oriented' industries, the affiliates in

the aggregate sold mainly in their own countries——the great bulk of U.S.—

owned foreign production was still for local sale in 1977. The exceptions

were machinery in Southeast Asia and in some of the smaller European

countries, as well as motor vehicles in Canada.

     Exports to the United States were a small part of total sales in almost

all industries and regions: the exceptions were affiliates in Canada In two

industries and machinery producing affiliates in the developing countries

of Asia. In other words exporting to the United States was not a major

reason for the establishment or development of U.S. production abroad in

most cases.


The Role of U.S. Affiliates in Exports

     The rapid growth in exports of manufactured goods by foreign affiliates

of U.S. companies reflects, to some extent, the growth of the economies in

which they are located and the worldwide rise in trade relative to output.

To try to learn what role the U.S. affiliates played in the trade of their

host   countries we compare their exports and export growth with those of

their countries.

       U.S. manufacturing affiliates accounted for about 10 per cent of

exports of manufactures by "market economies," which we shall henceforth

refer to as world exports, in 1977 (Table 14). The move towards greater

export orientation, referred to earlier, is reflected here in the fact that

exports by U.S. affiliates grew faster than host—country exports in every

one of the regions in Table 14 or, in other words, that the share of aff ii—

iates in exports increased in each one. A somewhat surprising aspect of

the table is that U.S. affiliates were considerably more important in the

exports of developed countries, even aside from Canada, where they

accounted for a majority of exports, than in the developing countries.

U.S. affiliates had the largest share of exports in Singapore ——   over a
fifth —— and possibly in a couple of other Southeast Asian countries,

although in those cases we may have failed to adjust the SITC export data

sufficiently. The U.S. shares were also large —— 15 per cent

or so, in the U.K., Belgium, the Netherlands, Brazil, and Mexico, and even

larger in Ireland.

    In no area, aside from Canada, were U.S. affiliates responsible for a

ld-ge part of the growth in exports, the shares in growth being 10 per cent

or less. In individual countries, however, the ratio reached the range of

15—20 per cent and even higher in Indonesia and the Philippines. In many,

but not all cases, the major export success stories were also associated

with relatively high shares of U.S. firms in both exports and export

growth. This was the case, for example, for Belgium—Luxembourg, the

Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Brazil, and Mexico. Several of

these, it may be recalled, were also the countries in which U.S. affiliates

were particularly export—oriented.

     The exporting of machinery, the most important industry group for U.S.

direct investment abroad, has traditionally been the preserve of producers

in developed countries. Between 1966 and 1977, however, there was an enor-

mous increase in exports by developing countries——to perhaps about thirty

times the earlier level (Table 15). The exports of U.S. affiliates reflected

these trends, those from developed countries rising to a little under six

times the earlier level while those from developing countries reached almost

60 times the 1966 level. Another way of describing the change is that the

share of exports by U.S. firms (other than from the U.S.) supplied from

developing countries rose from less than 2 per cent to about 17 per cent.

     Another contrast between the developed and developing countries in

machinery exports was that while U.S. affiliates' exports from developing

countries increased about twice as fast as exports in general, those in

developed countries rose a little less quickly than exports of the industry

as a whole (Table 15). However, in the European countries, affiliate

exports rose faster than those of the average firm; what brought down the

share of affiliates for developed countries in the aggregate was mainly the

large growth of Japanese machinery exports, in which U.S. firms played a

very small role. U.S. affiliates accounted for a little over 10 per cent

of the increase in developed country exports but for almost a third of the

rise in developing countries, and around half or more for such countries as

Mexico, Malaysia, and Singapore.

                                   Summary

      The main recent developments we find in U.S. trade and investment are

 the following:

1. There has been a steady increase in the strength of the links, via

     trade, between the U.S. economy and that of the rest of the world,

    much more in goods than in services. U.S. agriculture, in particular,

    has increased its dependence on world markets.

2. The pattern of U.S. trade has shifted toward the exchange of U.S.

    finished manufactures for foreign finished manufactures. While imports

    of machinery and transport equipment have grown more rapidly than

    exports, the United States has retained its comparative advantage in

    non—automotive capital goods. That is, the export surplus on these

    products has continued to increase relative to total U.S. output.

3. The geographical composition of U.S. exports has shifted away from

    developed market economies toward OPEC, the centrally planned economies,

    and, to a smaller extent, other developing countries. However, the

    developed countries remain the main markets for U.S. exports.

    The shift toward OPEC countries was stronger on the import side, as

    a result of both the rise in importance of fuels and the rise of the

    OPEC countries within that category. Another shift, perhaps more

    important for the future, was the rise of developing Asian countries

    as suppliers of machinery and equipment.

4. The U.S. share of world trade has continued to fall, even more than

    the U.S. shares of population and aggregate production, but recent

   years have shown a slowing, or even a reversal, of this trend. There
                                    — 40   —




     has been a persistent tendency for the share of developed countries in

     world exports to rise, the increase interrupted for a time but not

     stopped by the oil price rises.

5. The terms of trade have shifted against manufactured exports of

     developed countries in the last two decades. Even primary products

     other than petroleum have risen in relative price. However, the

     cycle seems to have turned again in the last few years in favor of

     manufactured goods prices. If that continues it will Tepresent one

     more example of the lack of any long—term trend in the rela don

     between manufactured and primary product prices.

6. There has been a large shift in the sources of new direct investment

     flows, excluding reinvested earnings, from the United States to

     Germany and Japan. At the same time the United States has become an

     important recipient of direct investment from abroad while traditional

     absorbers of direct investment, such as Canada and Australia, have

     declined in importance. The rising share of the United States probably

     reflects the low price of the dollar during much of the 1970's and the

     low stock market valuation of U.S. equities.

         U.S. firms, under pressure from host countries, have accepted

     more sharing of ownership. However, most of U.S. manufacturing activity

     still takes place in majority—owned affiliates, especially in industries

     with a large technology element in their activities.

7.   Foreign manufacturing affiliates of U.S. firms are still basically

     concerned mainly with selling in their host countries. However, they

     have shifted substantially in the direction of exporting. The United

     States   has never been an important market for most U.S.—owned affiliates
                                     — 41   —




   abroad, with the exception of those in Canada and in the small Asian

   countries, and the latter have not only become more export—oriented

   but have also shifted towards the United States as a market.

8. The shift   toward an export orientation of U.S.   affiliates was reflected
   in   a rise in their shares of host—country exports in most areas of the
   world.   In the   machinery industries the export increases were more
   rapid in the developing countries and their share of all exports by

   foreign affiliates of U.S. firms rose steeply. In these countries,

   and in Europe as well, exports of machinery by U.S.—owned affiliates

   increased more rapidly than those of other companies.
