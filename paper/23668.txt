Subsidizing Health Insurance for Low-Income Adults: Evidence from Massachusetts
Amy Finkelstein, Nathaniel Hendren, and Mark Shepard
NBER Working Paper No. 23668
August 2017
JEL No. H51,I13

                                         ABSTRACT

How much are low-income individuals willing to pay for health insurance, and what are the
implications for insurance markets? Using administrative data from Massachusetts’ subsidized
insurance exchange, we exploit discontinuities in the subsidy schedule to estimate willingness to
pay and costs of insurance among low-income adults. As subsidies decline, insurance take-up
falls rapidly, dropping about 25%for each $40 increase in monthly enrollee premiums. Marginal
enrollees tend to be lower-cost, consistent with adverse selection into insurance. But across the
entire distribution we can observe – approximately the bottom 70% of the willingness to pay
distribution – enrollee willingness to pay is always less than half of own expected costs. As a
result, we estimate that take-up will be highly incomplete even with generous subsidies: if
enrollee premiums were 25% of insurers’ average costs, at most half of potential enrollees would
buy insurance; even premiums subsidized to 10% of average costs would still leave at least 20%
uninsured. We suggest an important role for uncompensated care for the uninsured in explaining
these findings and explore normative implications.

1        Introduction
Governments spend an enormous amount of money on health insurance for low-income individuals. For
instance, the U.S. Medicaid program (at $550 billion in 2015) dwarfs the size of the next largest means-
tested programs – food stamps and the EITC ($70 billion each).1 Perhaps because of these high and
rising costs, public programs increasingly offer partial subsidies for health insurance, requiring enrollees
to pay premiums to help cover costs. Partial subsidies are a key feature of market-based programs such
as Medicare Part D and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) exchanges, and even traditional low-income
programs like Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) increasingly require
premiums for some enrollees (Smith et al. (2015), Brooks et al. (2017)). Partial subsidies are also a
textbook policy response to adverse selection if a full coverage mandate may not be efficient (Einav
and Finkelstein, 2011).
        In this paper, we estimate low-income individuals’ willingness to pay (WTP) for health insurance,
assess how it compares to the cost they impose on the insurer, and discuss the positive and normative
implications for subsidized health insurance programs. We do so in the context of Massachusetts’
pioneer health insurance exchange for low-income individuals, known as “Commonwealth Care” or
“CommCare.” Established in the state’s 2006 health care reform, CommCare offered heavily-subsidized
private plans to non-elderly adults below 300% of poverty who did not have access to insurance through
an employer or another public program. Public subsidies were substantial: on average for our study
population, enrollee premiums are only about $70 per month – or less than one-fifth of insurer-paid
medical claims ($359 per month) or insurer prices ($422 per month). There was also a health insurance
mandate backed by financial penalties.
        We use a regression discontinuity design, together with administrative data on enrollment and
medical claims, to estimate demand and cost for CommCare plans. Our main analysis focuses on
fiscal year 2011, when the insurance options had a convenient vertical structure. We also present some
complementary results for the full 2009-2013 period over which we have data.
        The analysis leverages discrete changes in subsidies at several income thresholds. Subsidies were
designed to make enrollee premiums for the cheapest insurer’s plan “affordable”; in practice, the
subsidy amount changes discretely at 150%, 200% and 250% of the federal poverty line (FPL). These
discontinuities in program rules provide identifying variation in enrollee premiums. The cheapest plan’s
(post-subsidy) monthly enrollee premium increases by about $40 at each of the discontinuities, and
more generous plans experience a $40 to $50 increase in (post-subsidy) monthly enrollee premiums.
        We first document two main descriptive patterns. First, enrollee demand is highly sensitive to
premiums. With each discrete increase in enrollee premiums, enrollment in CommCare falls by about
25%, or a 20-24 percentage point fall in the take-up rate. Second, we find that despite the presence
of a coverage mandate, the market is characterized by adverse selection: as enrollee premiums rise,
lower-cost enrollees disproportionately drop out, raising the average cost of the remaining insured
population. We estimate that average medical claims rise by $10-$50 per month (or 3-14%) with each
premium increase.

                                                         1
      We use a simple model to analyze the implications of these descriptive patterns. The nature of
the individual choice problem lends itself naturally to a vertical model of demand in which individuals
choose among a “high-coverage” (H) option, a “low-coverage” (L) option, and a third option of unin-
surance (“U ”); the vast majority of enrollees choose the high-coverage option, H. We use the model –
which is a slight extension of Einav, Finkelstein, and Cullen (2010) – along with the premium variation
to map out curves for willingness to pay, average costs of insurance, and costs of marginal enrollees.
      The model allows us to translate the descriptive patterns into two main results about willingness
to pay and costs for these plans. First, even large insurance subsidies are insufficient to generate near-
complete take-up of insurance by low-income adults. For example, at the median of the willingness to
pay distribution, willingness to pay for H is about $100 per month – less than one quarter of average
costs of $420 per month if all those with above-median willingness to pay enrolled in H. Even with a
subsidy that makes enrollee premiums for the H plan equal to 25% of insurers’ average costs, at most
half the population would purchase insurance if offered H. Subsidies making enrollee premiums 10%
of insurers’ average costs still leave at least 20% uninsured.
      These findings suggest that even modest enrollee premiums can be a major deterrent to universal
coverage among low-income people. This deterrent is likely to be even larger in the ACA exchanges,
in which income-specific premiums are significantly higher than in CommCare – 2-10% of income for
the benchmark plan in the ACA versus 0-5% of income in CommCare.2 Our results may thus help
explain coverage outcomes in the ACA exchanges, where early evidence suggests highly incomplete
take-up (Tebaldi (2016); Avalere Health (2016)). They can also generate predictions of coverage under
alternate reform proposals.
      Second, although adverse selection exists, it is not the primary driver of low take-up. The cost of
marginal consumers who enroll when premiums decline is less than the average costs of those already
enrolled, implying that plans are adversely selected (Einav, Finkelstein, and Cullen, 2010). But across
the in-sample distribution – which spans the 6th to the 70th percentile of the willingness to pay
distribution – the willingness to pay of marginal enrollees still lies far below their own expected costs
imposed on insurers for either the H or L plans. For example, for the median willingness to pay
individual, the gap between the costs of the marginal enrollee and average costs of enrollees explains
only one-third of the $300 gap between willingness to pay and average costs. This suggests individuals
would not enroll even if prices were subsidized to reflect the expected cost of marginal enrollees.
Enrollment is low not simply because of adverse selection, but because people are not willing to pay
their own cost imposed on the insurer.
      In the final section of the paper, we briefly explore potential explanations for our findings and
analyze their normative implications. Back-of-the-envelope calculations using estimates from the prior
literature suggest that moral hazard effects of health insurance cannot explain much of the gap be-
tween willingness to pay and costs. However, an estimate of the uncompensated care available to the
uninsured suggests that this can account for nearly all of our estimated gap between willingness to
pay and costs of insurance.
  2
    These are based on authors’ calculations using ACA and CommCare policy parameters. The ACA premiums are for
the second-cheapest silver plan; the CommCare premiums are for the cheapest plan.



                                                      2
    If we interpret our willingness to pay estimates normatively as individuals’ value of insurance,
they suggest that most low-income enrollees would prefer being uninsured to having to pay the cost
they impose on the insurer. This suggests that subsidies in this market cannot be justified simply
as a response to adverse selection. Our results suggest two potential such justifications for subsidies:
as an offset to the externalities resulting from uncompensated care (i.e., the Samaritan’s dilemma
(Buchanan, 1975; Coate, 1995)), or as a means of redistribution to low-income households.

Related Literature While a substantial literature estimates demand and costs for health insurance
(see e.g., Einav, Finkelstein, and Levin (2010) for an overview), there is relatively little work providing
such estimates for low-income adults on whom much public policy attention is focused. This is partly
because, until recently, most of the low-income uninsured either were not offered health insurance
or faced prices that were difficult to measure.3 The introduction of the ACA in 2014 has given
researchers an opportunity to study how low-income insurance take-up responds to subsidies (Frean,
Gruber, and Sommers, 2017; Sacks, 2017). However, the ACA’s subsidy schedule does not feature the
sharp discontinuities present in Massachusetts, which we exploit for our research design.
    Our estimates of a low-income population’s willingness to pay for formal insurance compared
to insurance costs are consistent with Finkelstein, Hendren, and Luttmer (2015), who use ex-post
outcome distributions to infer low-income adults’ WTP for Medicaid in the context of the Oregon
Health Insurance Experiment. Both sets of results suggest that low-income enrollees value formal
health insurance products at substantially below their average cost. Such findings contrast with those
for higher-income populations. In particular, Hackmann, Kolstad, and Kowalski (2015) study the
unsubsidized Massachusetts health insurance exchange for individuals above 300% of poverty. They
also find evidence of adverse selection but (unlike our estimates for a low-income population) estimate
that willingness to pay exceeds own costs over the entire population of potential consumers. One
natural explanation for these ostensibly divergent findings is that low-income individuals likely have
much greater access to uncompensated care. Indeed, a growing empirical literature documents the
large role of uncompensated care for the (predominantly low-income) uninsured and the impact of
insurance in decreasing unpaid bills (see e.g. Garthwaite, Gross, and Notowidigdo (2015); Finkelstein
et al. (2012); Mahoney (2015); Dobkin et al. (2016); Hu et al. (2016)).4
    Finally, our results have implications for the broader literature on adverse selection in health insur-
ance markets. The empirical literature has extensively documented the presence of adverse selection in
health insurance markets but concluded that the welfare cost of the resultant mis-pricing of contracts
is relatively small. This literature however has “looked under the lamppost” – primarily focusing on
    3
      In a creative effort to surmount this substantial obstacle, Krueger and Kuziemko (2013) conducted a survey exper-
iment designed to elicit willingness to pay for hypothetical plan offerings among a large sample of of the uninsured. In
a recent exception-that-proves-the-rule, Dague (2014) examines how duration enrolled in Medicaid responds to increases
in monthly premiums. In addition, another body of work has studied low-income individuals’ price sensitivity in their
choice of health plans, both in Massachusetts (Chan and Gruber, 2010) and in the ACA exchanges (Tebaldi, 2016),
though without formally estimating willingness to pay.
    4
      Differences in the availability of uncompensated care may also reconcile our findings with results from a calibrated
life cycle model suggesting that the low-income elderly’s willingness to pay for Medicaid is above their costs (De Nardi
et al., 2016); unlike low-income adults, low-income elderly do not have access to substantial uncompensated nursing home
care (the primary healthcare covered by Medicaid), either in the De Nardi et al. (2016) model or in practice.



                                                            3
selection across contracts that vary in limited ways, rather than selection that causes a market to un-
ravel, leaving open the possibility of larger welfare costs on this margin Einav, Finkelstein, and Levin
(2010). Our work, however, finds evidence of significant adverse selection on the extensive margin of
purchasing insurance versus remaining uninsured – a finding consistent with past work on the Mas-
sachusetts reform (Chandra, Gruber, and McKnight, 2011; Hackmann, Kolstad, and Kowalski, 2015;
Jaffe and Shepard, 2017). But it also finds that adverse selection is not the primary driver of limited
demand for formal insurance among low-income adults.

    The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the setting and data. Section 3
presents the basic descriptive empirical evidence, documenting the level and responsiveness to price
of both insurance demand and average insurer costs. Section 4 uses a simple model of insurance
demand to translate the empirical results from Section 3 into estimates of willingness to pay and
costs for insurance. Section 5 briefly considers potential explanations for low willingness to pay and
our findings’ normative implications for insurance subsidies for low-income adults. The final section
concludes.


2     Setting and Data
2.1    Setting: Massachusetts Subsidized Health Insurance Exchange
CommCare

We study Commonwealth Care (“CommCare”), a subsidized insurance exchange created under Mas-
sachusetts’ 2006 “Romneycare” health insurance reform that laid the foundation for many of the health
insurance exchanges created in other states under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). CommCare oper-
ated from 2006-2013 before shifting form in 2014 to comply with the ACA. We focus on the market in
fiscal year 2011 (July 2010 to June 2011) but also present descriptive results for fiscal years 2009-2013,
the full period over which we have data. The market rules described below apply to 2011; the rules
for other years are similar except in some details.
    CommCare covered low-income adults with family income below 300% of the federal poverty level
(FPL) and without access to insurance from another source, including an employer or another public
program (i.e., Medicare or Medicaid). This population is similar to those eligible for subsidies on the
ACA exchanges. Given Medicaid eligibility rules in Massachusetts,5 the CommCare-eligible population
consisted of adults aged 19-64 without access to employer coverage and who were either (1) childless
and below 300% of FPL, (2) non-pregnant parents between 133% and 300% of FPL, or (3) pregnant
women between 200% and 300% of FPL.
    CommCare specified a required set of benefits (i.e., covered services and cost sharing rules) and
then solicited competing private insurers to provide these benefits. Each insurer offered a single plan
that had the required set of benefits but could differ in its network of hospitals and doctors. Between
   5
     During our study period, Medicaid covered all relevant children (up to 300% FPL) and disabled adults, as well as
parents up to 133% FPL and pregnant women up to 200% FPL. Medicaid also covered long-term unemployed individuals
earning up to 100% FPL and HIV-positive individuals up to 200% FPL – both relatively small groups.

4 and 5 insurers participated in the market each year. Benefit design and participating insurers were
very similar to the Massachusetts Medicaid program. In particular, CommCare enrollees faced very
modest co-pays.6
    Eligible individuals could enroll during the annual open enrollment period at the start of the fiscal
year, or at any time if they experienced a qualifying event (e.g., job loss or income change). To enroll,
individuals filled out an application with information on age, income over the last 12 months, family
size, and access to other health insurance. The state used this form to determine whether an applicant
was eligible for Medicaid, CommCare, or neither. The form was also used to calculate income as a share
of FPL for determining an enrollee’s premiums. However, as discussed below, the translation from
income and other information on the form into FPL units was not readily transparent to applicants
on the form.
    If approved for CommCare, individuals were notified (by mail and/or email) and provided infor-
mation on the premiums for CommCare plans. They then had to complete a second form (or contact
CommCare by phone) to choose a plan and pay the first month’s premium. Individuals who did not
make a plan choice and the associated payment did not receive coverage. Coverage commenced at the
start of the month following receipt of payment. Once enrolled, individuals stayed enrolled as long
as they remained eligible and continued paying premiums. Income and eligibility status changes were
supposed to be self-reported and were also verified through an annual “redetermination” process that
included comparisons to tax data and lists of people enrolled in employer insurance.

Subsidy Structure

Insurers in CommCare set a base plan price that applied to all individuals, regardless of income (or
age, region, or other factors). The actual payment the insurer received from CommCare equaled their
base price times a risk score intended to capture predictable differences in health status.
    Enrollees paid premiums equal to their insurer’s base price minus an income-varying subsidy paid
by the state.7 Subsidies were set so that enrollee premiums for the lowest-price plan equaled a target
“affordable amount.” This target amount was set separately for several bins of income, with discrete
changes at 150%, 200%, and 250% of FPL. Figure 1, Panel A shows the result: enrollee premiums for
the cheapest plan vary discretely at these thresholds. For the years 2009-2012 (shown in black), the
cheapest plan is free for individuals below 150% of FPL and increases to $39 per month above 150%
FPL, $77 per month above 200% FPL, and $116 per month above 250% of FPL. In 2013 (shown in
gray), these amounts increase slightly to $0 / $40 / $78 / $118. Consistent with the goal of affordability,
these premiums were a small share of income. For instance, for a single individual in 2011 (whose FPL
equaled $908 per month), these premiums ranged from 0-5% of income (specifically, 2.9% of income
just above 150% FPL, 4.2% just above 200% FPL, and 5.1% just above 250% FPL).
   6
     Enrollees below 100% of FPL received benefits equivalent to Medicaid. Enrollees between 100-200% FPL received
a plan that we estimate (based on claims data) has a 97% actuarial value, while those between 200-300% FPL received
a 95% actuarial value plan. The slight change in generosity at 200% FPL is a potential threat to the RD analysis of
demand and costs at 200% FPL; we show below that our main results are not sensitive to excluding this discontinuity.
   7
     We will use “price” to refer to the pre-subsidy price set by insurers and “premium” to refer to the post-subsidy amount
owed by enrollees.

NOTE: Panel A plots enrollee premiums for the cheapest plan by income as a percent of FPL, noting the thresholds
(150%, 200%, and 250% of FPL) where the amount increases discretely. The black lines show the values that applied
in 2009-2012; the gray lines show the (slightly higher) values for 2013. Panel B shows insurer prices (dotted lines) and
enrollee premiums (solid lines) for the five plans in 2011. In this year, four insurers set prices within $3 of a $426/month
price cap, while CeltiCare set a lower price ($405) and therefore had lower enrollee premiums.




2011 Plan Options

We analyze the market in 2009-2013 but focus especially on fiscal year 2011 when the market had a
useful vertical structure with plans falling into two groups. In 2011 CommCare imposed a binding
cap on insurer prices of $426 per month. Four insurers – BMC HealthNet, Fallon, Neighborhood
Health Plan, and Network Health – all set prices within $3 of this cap. The exception was CeltiCare,
which set a price of $405 per month. Figure 1, Panel B shows these insurer prices and the resulting
post-subsidy enrollee premiums by income. The prices and premiums of the four high-price plans are
nearly indistinguishable, while CeltiCare’s premium is noticeably lower.
        Along with its lower price, CeltiCare also had had a more limited network than other plans. We
estimate that CeltiCare covered 42% of Massachusetts hospitals (weighted by bed size), compared to
79% or higher for the other three plans offered statewide.8 Both because of this limited network and
because of its lack of long-term reputation with consumers (it had entered the state insurance market
only in 2010), CeltiCare was perceived by enrollees as less desirable, aside from its lower price.9
        As a result, in much of our analysis that follows we pool the 2011 plans into two groups: CeltiCare
    8
     One plan (Fallon Community Health Plan) was only active in central Massachusetts, so its network is difficult to
compare to the other insurers.
   9
     Consistent with this perception, when all plans were available for free – which was the case for enrollees below 100%
of FPL – 96% of enrollees chose a plan other than CeltiCare.

NOTE: The figure shows how 2011 enrollee premiums and the mandate penalty vary across incomes (as a percent of the
federal poverty level, FPL). PL denotes the enrollee premium for the L plan (CeltiCare), while PH is the share-weighted
average of the enrollee premiums in the four H (non-CeltiCare) plans. “Mandate Penalty” (dashed gray line) is the
statutory mandate penalty at each income level. The black dots show the expected mandate penalty for a person near
the income discontinuities, which is the average of the two mandate penalties on either side of the discontinuity.


as a low coverage (“L”) option and the other four plans with extremely similar prices pooled together
as a high coverage (“H”) option. We interpret H as a composite contract that gives enrollees a choice
among the four component insurers, with its utility equal to the max over these four insurers. When
we specify and estimate a model of insurance demand in Section 4, we will further assume that H is
perceived as higher quality than L. We also show in an extension in Section 4.4 below that we can
generate fairly tight bounds on willingness to pay in a more general model that does not assume this
vertical structure.
    Figure 2 zooms in on enrollee premiums for the H plan and the L plan in 2011 by income. We
define the enrollee premium for H as the share-weighted average of the component plans; Appendix
Table 5 reports these separately for each component plan. As previously discussed, enrollee premiums
for the cheapest plan L (pL ) – subsidized to equal a target affordable amount – jump at 150%, 200%,
and 250% of FPL. The premium of the H plan (pH ) also jumps at these thresholds. Notably, pH
jumps by more than pL at each of these thresholds. This occurs because CommCare chose to apply
non-constant subsidies across plans with the goal of narrowing premium differences across plans for
lower-income groups. Importantly for our demand estimation, this subsidy structure creates variation
in both premium levels and differences between H and L. Specifically, the difference pH − pL grows
from $11 below 150% FPL, to $19 from 150-200% FPL, to $29 from 200-250% FPL, and to $31 above
250% FPL.
    The final relevant option for people eligible for CommCare was to remain uninsured and pay the
mandate penalty. The dotted gray line in Figure 2 shows the statutory mandate penalty at each

                                                            7
income, which the state set to be half of the lowest CommCare premium (pL ). In practice, however,
the actual penalty an individual would owe likely diverges from the gray line for two reasons. First,
the mandate is assessed based on total annual income (reported in end-of-year tax filings), whereas
the measure used to determine enrollee premiums is self-reported on the program application and
measures income over the last 12 months (e.g., the prior July to June for someone enrolling during
open enrollment). Thus, the actual expected mandate penalty is unlikely to change discontinuously
at the income thresholds, since someone just above a threshold is equally likely to have total annual
income (relevant for the mandate) above or below the threshold. Figure 2 shows in black dots the
expected mandate penalty for individuals near each threshold, which we assume is simply the average
of the statutory penalty above and below the threshold. A second reason the actual mandate penalty
may differ is that individuals may be able to avoid paying even if they are uninsured. For instance,
the law does not impose a penalty if an individual is uninsured for three or fewer consecutive months
during the year or if an individual qualified for a religious or hardship exemption.10
       It is unclear how to use the mandate penalty when calculating revealed willingness to pay. For the
reasons discussed above, an individual’s actual mandate penalty is difficult to determine. Moreover,
individuals may discount the mandate penalty because it is incurred in the following year’s taxes, or
even be unaware of it. In our baseline demand estimates, we will use the sticker premiums for insurance,
effectively ignoring the saved penalty when an individual buys insurance. This will make our estimates
a conservative upper bound on individuals’ willingness to pay for insurance. In robustness analysis in
Section 4.4 below, we also report the lower willingness to pay estimates that we find when we normalize
premiums by the expected mandate penalty values (shown in black dots).

2.2      Data
Administrative Data: Enrollee Plan Choices, Claims, and Demographics

Our primary data are enrollee-level and claim-level administrative data from the CommCare program
for fiscal years 2009-2013. We observe enrollee demographics and monthly plan enrollment linked to
data on their claims and risk scores. All data is at the individual level because CommCare only offers
individual (not family) coverage.11
       We observe each enrollee’s chosen plan at a monthly level. We define total enrollment as the
annualized number of enrollee months in CommCare or a specific plan. In practice, most enrollees
are in the same plan for the whole year. We also observe enrollees’ choice sets, including the prices,
subsidies, and enrollee premiums of each option (summarized in Figures 1 and 2). Enrollee-linked
insurance claims data allow us to measure each person’s monthly costs (both insurer-paid and out-of-
pocket).
       The most important demographic we observe is the individual’s family income as a percent of
FPL (rounded to the 0.1% level), which is the running variable for our RD analysis. This variable is
  10
     The three-month exception is empirically important: based on a state report, almost 40% of the 183,000 uninsured
people above 150% FPL in 2011 were uninsured for three or fewer months (Connector and of Revenue, 2011).
  11
     These de-identified data were obtained via a data use agreement with the exchange regulator, the Massachusetts
Health Connector. Our study protocol was approved by the IRBs of the Connector and our affiliated institutions (Harvard,
MIT, and NBER).

calculated by the regulator from information on family income and composition that enrollees report
in their initial CommCare application, and is used to determine premiums and subsidies. This variable
is updated based on any subsequent known changes – which in principle, enrollees are required to self-
report when they occur – and based on information from annual audits. We also observe information
from CommCare’s records on enrollee age, gender, zip code of residence, and risk score, a measure of
predicted spending calculated by CommCare.
   Throughout our analysis, we limit attention to individuals above 135% of FPL because of the
significant eligibility change at 133% FPL – above this threshold, parents cease to be eligible for
Medicaid and become eligible for CommCare. Table 1 reports some summary statistics from the
administrative data for CommCare enrollees in fiscal year 2011 between 135 and 300 percent FPL.
Ninety percent of CommCare enrollees are in the H plan, despite higher enrollee premiums (see
Figure 2). About 20 percent of enrollees are between 135 and 150 percent of the federal poverty line.
CommCare’s subsidies are quite large. Average enrollee premiums ($70 per month) cover less than
20% of insurer-paid medical costs ($359/month) or prices ($422).

Survey Data: Eligible Population for CommCare

We supplement the administrative data on CommCare enrollment with estimates of the size of the
CommCare-eligible population from the 2010 and 2011 American Community Survey (ACS), an annual
1% random sample of U.S. households. We use this data to estimate the number of people eligible for


                                                       9
CommCare in each 1% FPL bin between 135% of FPL and 300% FPL. To be coded as eligible, an
individual must live in Massachusetts and be: a U.S. citizen, age 19-64, not enrolled in another form of
health insurance (specifically, employer insurance, Medicare or Tricare), and not eligible for Medicaid
(based on income and demographics).12 Because the ACS is a 1% sample (and because of clustering
in reported income at round numbers), our raw estimates of the size of the eligible population by 1%
FPL bin are relatively noisy. We therefore smooth the estimates using a regression of raw counts by
1% FPL bin on a polynomial in income. Appendix A reports additional details on sample construction
and shows the raw counts of eligibles by FPL, as well as the smoothing regression fit.
       Rather than use the ACS estimates directly to estimate the size of the eligible population, we use
it to estimate two statistics: the shape of the eligible income distribution and the average take-up
rate for our study population. We do this because comparing the raw implied counts of the eligible
population in the ACS to the number enrolled in CommCare from our administrative data would
imply that only 37% of eligible individuals enroll in CommCare. This number seems low compared
to the take-up estimate in the ACS data itself, where we find that 63% of eligible individuals report
having insurance. We suspect the ACS take-up estimate is closer to the truth since it closely matches
estimates from a MA health insurance survey in the fall of 2010 (Long, Stockley, and Dahlen, 2012)
and estimates from tax filing data.13 We conservatively use the higher take-up estimate internal to the
ACS and show in sensitivity analysis that if we instead use the ACS estimates of the eligible population
directly, this produces a substantially lower take-up rate and in turn yields even lower estimates of the
share insured under a given subsidy scheme.
       Specifically, we take our estimates of the number of eligible individuals in the ACS by FPL bin
(see Panel A of Appendix Figure 15) and scale the whole distribution down by a constant multiple
(of 0.59) so that dividing the administrative count of enrollees by our adjusted eligible population size
yields an average take-up rate of 63% (the rate calculated in the ACS).
       Measuring the eligible population is difficult, and our approximation is, of course, imperfect. For-
tunately, as we discuss in more detail below, the exact size of this population is not critical to estimate
changes in enrollment and costs at the income discontinuities. Using this information (from admin-
istrative data alone), we can generate our key result: that willingness to pay is far below costs for
marginal enrollees who drop coverage at each discontinuity. However, the ACS estimates are important
for understanding what share of the eligible population these marginal enrollees comprise and where
in the population distribution they lie. This is also necessary for translating our results into estimates
of take-up shares under various subsidy policies. As discussed, in this sense, our baseline approach is
a conservative one.
  12
     The ACS does not distinguish Medicaid from CommCare coverage (both are coded as “Medicaid/other public insur-
ance”), so we cannot directly exclude Medicaid enrollees.
  13
     Specifically, Long et al. (2012) find a 90% insurance coverage rate for non-elderly adults below 300% of FPL, nearly
identical to the 89% rate we estimate using the ACS. Further, using statistics from state tax filings (used to determine
who owes the mandate penalty), we estimate that about 107,000 tax filers earning more than 150% of the FPL were
uninsured at a typical point in time during 2011 (Connector and of Revenue, 2011). This number is calculated from
state-reported statistics on the number of full-year and part-year uninsured (separately for ≤ 3 months and > 3 months)
and a midpoint assumption about the part-year groups’ duration of uninsurance. From the ACS data, we estimate that
there were 108,342 uninsured tax filers earning >150% of FPL (treating each “health insurance unit” as a single tax-filer).
These two estimates are remarkably close, suggesting that the ACS’s uninsured estimates are accurate.

NOTE: Figure shows our (smoothed) estimate of the CommCare-eligible population in 2011 (based on ACS data), and
raw enrollment counts in CommCare in 2011 by bins of 5% of the FPL.


    Figure 3 shows our (smoothed) estimate of the size of the eligible population by FPL bin. For
comparison we also show the raw counts of the number enrolled in any CommCare plan by FPL bin;
we use the difference between the eligible population estimate and the number of CommCare enrollees
as the number of people choosing uninsurance. Note that the decline in the estimated number of
eligible people by income does not reflect the shape of the overall income distribution in that range,
but rather the shape of the eligible population income distribution. Eligibility requires, among other
things, that the individual not have access to employer-sponsored insurance, which tends to increase
with income (Janicki, 2013).


3     Descriptive Analysis
3.1    Regression Discontinuity Design
We use the discrete change in enrollee premiums at 150%, 200% and 250% of FPL to estimate how
demand and costs change with enrollee premiums. We estimate a simple linear RD in which we allow
both the slope and the intercept to vary on each side of each threshold. Specifically, we run the
following regression across income bins (b) collapsed at the 1% of FPL level:

                                          Yb = αs(b) + βs(b) Incb + b                                     (1)

where Yb is an outcome measure in that income bin b, Incb is income (as a % of FPL) at the midpoint
of the bin, and s(b) is the income segment on which bin b lies (either 135-150%, 150-200%, 200-250%,
or 250-300% FPL). Notice that the unit of observation is the income bin, while the slope and intercept

                                                      11
coefficients vary flexibly at the segment level. Our outcomes are either measures of plan enrollment
shares, or enrollee costs or characteristics. We run all regressions using bin-level data and report
robust standard errors.
    The key assumption is that the eligible population size is smooth through the income thresholds at
which subsidies change (150%, 200%, and 250% FPL). This would be violated if people strategically
adjust (or misreport)14 their income to get just below the thresholds and qualify for a larger subsidy.15
While in principle such manipulation would be possible, in our setting individuals were largely shrouded
during the application process from a clear illustration of how their reported incomes translated into
the %FPL formula for determining subsidies. As we illustrate below in Section 4.4, we find minimal
evidence of such manipulation. Moreover, because of the relatively linear patterns we find away from
the discontinuity, alternative methods (such as constructing a donut-hole around the discontinuity)
would lead to very similar estimates.

3.2    Evidence from Pooled Years (2009-2013)
Insurance Demand

Figure 1 showed that premiums increase discontinuously at 150, 200, and 250% of FPL. Figure 4,
Panel A shows that enrollment drops significantly at each of these income thresholds. Specifically,
the figure plots average monthly enrollment in the CommCare market over the 2009-2013 period by
income bin. It also superimposes estimates from the linear RD model in equation (1), using average
monthly enrollment as the dependent variable. At each of the three discontinuities, enrollment falls
by 30% to 40%. All three changes are statistically distinguishable from zero (p < 0.01).

Cost of Insurance and Adverse Selection

Figure 4, Panel B plots average insurer costs by income bin, again superimposing estimates from the
linear RD model in equation (1). Average insurer costs are defined as the average claims paid by the
insurer for the set of people who are enrolled in that month.
    The figure shows that average costs of the insured rise as the enrollee premium increases. For
example, we estimate a discontinuous increase in costs of $47.3 (s.e. $7.7) per enrollee per month at
150% FPL and of $32.4 (s.e. $8.7) at 200% of FPL. We find a smaller but noisier increase of $6.2
(s.e. $11.9) at 250% FPL; this imprecision may reflect the smaller size of the eligible and enrolled
populations at 250% of FPL (see Figure 3).
    These patterns indicate the presence of adverse selection: increases in average costs indicate that
the marginal enrollees (who exit in response to the premium increase) are less costly than the average
enrollee who remains. In Appendix Figure 19 we also show that, consistent with adverse selection,
the average age and risk score (i.e. predicted medical spending) of enrollees increase at these income
  14
     Enrollees were required to show proof of income (e.g., via recent pay stubs) when applying but in theory could adjust
hours or misreport self-employment income to get below subsidy thresholds.
  15
     In addition, there are minor changes in eligibility just above 200% FPL – pregnant women and HIV-positive people
lose Medicaid eligibility and become eligible for CommCare – that also technically violate the smoothness assumption.
This will bias our RD estimate of demand responsiveness to price slightly towards zero, since the eligible population grows
just above 200% FPL. In sensitivity analysis, we show that our main results are robust to excluding this discontinuity.

NOTE: The figure shows discontinuities in enrollment and average insurer costs at the income thresholds (150%, 200%,
and 250% of FPL) at which enrollee premiums increase (see Figure 1). Panel A shows average enrollment in CommCare
(total member-months, divided by number of months) by income over the 2009-2013 period our data spans. Panel B
shows average insurer medical costs per month across all CommCare plans over the same period. In each figure, the dots
represent raw values for a 5% of FPL bin, and the lines are predicted lines from our linear RD specification in equation

thresholds. In other words, in response to higher premiums, younger and lower-risk enrollees are more
likely to leave the market.
        A priori, it was unclear whether this market would suffer from adverse selection. On the one
hand, insurers were not allowed to vary prices based on individuals’ health characteristics (such as
age, gender, or pre-existing conditions); this would tend to generate adverse selection. On the other
hand, in an effort to combat adverse selection, Massachusetts imposed a mandate on individuals to buy
coverage, backed up by financial penalties. Our results suggest the coverage mandate and associated
penalty were not sufficient to prevent adverse selection.

3.3       Evidence from 2011
In most of the rest of the paper, we study data from fiscal year 2011, which has the convenient vertical
differentiation of plans discussed above. Here we present reduced form evidence on demand and costs
for 2011 alone, focusing on overall enrollment and enrollment in the H plan.

Insurance Demand

Figure 5 shows statistically significant (at the 1% level) declines in overall CommCare and H plan
enrollment at each enrollee premium threshold (see Figure 2). The drops in enrollment do not occur
only when premiums rise from zero to a positive amount (150% FPL threshold): enrollment falls by

20-30% at all three thresholds.
        Figure 6 transforms these raw enrollment counts into market shares, using our estimate of the
eligible population (see Figure 3) as the denominator. Panel A shows that the share enrolled in
any CommCare plan falls by a statistically significant 24-27% at each discontinuity at which enrollee
premiums rise by $38-39 per month. The size of these percent drops are identified directly from the fall
in enrollment in the administrative data. But, we can also use our estimate of the size of the eligible
population from the ACS to make make inferences about the levels of take-up rates as a function of the
enrollee premium. Take-up rates fall from 94% when insurance is free (below 150% FPL) to 70%where
the cheapest premium increases to $39 per month (above 150% FPL). Take-up rates continue to fall
with premiums, declining to below 50% as the cheapest premium rises to $116 per month (above 250%
FPL).

Cost of Insurance

Figure 7 shows that average monthly insurer costs rise as enrollee premiums increase at each income
threshold. Panel A indicates that at 150% of FPL, average costs for CommCare enrollees increase by
$47 (about 14%); this is statistically distinguishable from zero at the 1% level. We also see increases
in average costs at the 200% and 250% thresholds, but the increases are somewhat smaller ($31 and
$15, or 9% and 4%) and less precisely estimated. These magnitudes are similar to the more precise
estimates for the pooled 2009-2013 years shown above.
        Panel B shows analogous estimates for the 2011 enrollees in the H plan. Again we see increases in

average costs at all three discontinuities; however, these are less precisely estimated.


4      Willingness to Pay and Cost Curves
We use a model of insurance demand and cost to map the 2011 descriptive results into estimates of
willingness to pay and cost curves that we use for counterfactual analysis. The model follows Einav,
Finkelstein, and Cullen (2010), but incorporates three plan options: the H plan, the L plan, and
uninsured (U ), as opposed to a binary model considered in Einav et al. (2010a). Motivated by our
institutional setting, we assume a vertical model of insurance demand. The vertical structure is helpful
for tractability. We show in the sensitivity analysis of Section 4.4 that we can derive fairly tight bounds
on willingness to pay that are similar to our point estimates below but do not rely on the vertical
model assumptions.

4.1      Setup and Assumptions
Consider an insurance market where contracts j are defined by a generosity metric α. We assume
there are two formal insurance contracts j = H and L, with αH > αL . In addition, there is an
outside option of being uninsured, U , which is weakly less generous than L (αU ≤ αL ). Let w (α; i)
be the (dollar) willingness to pay (WTP) of consumer i for an α-generosity contract. Let pij be the
enrollee premium of contract j, and normalize piU = 0 so that premiums are defined relative to U .

normalize hU = 0 and assume the formal insurance contracts H and L involve the same hassle cost
hH = hL ≡ h. This hassle cost, h, will be positive if enrolling in formal insurance involves a greater
hassle relative to remaining uninsured (e.g., due to the hassle of applying for insurance and making
an active plan choice) and negative if staying uninsured involves greater hassle.
       With these assumptions, we write the utility of consumer i for plan j as:

                                    uij   = w (αj ; i) − h − pij         for j ∈ {L, H}
                                   uiU    = w (αU ; i) .

We denote the willingness to pay Wj for plan j relative to U as:

                             Wj (i) = (w (αj ; i) − w (αU ; i)) − h,          for j ∈ {L, H}

which is the maximum price at which the consumer would choose plan j over U . We denote the
willingness to pay ∆WHL (i) for plan H relative to plan L as:

                               ∆WHL (i) ≡ WH (i) − WL (i) = w (αH ; i) − w (αL ; i) .                                 (2)

       We impose a vertical demand model (see Tirole, 1988) using the following two assumptions about
preferences:

Assumption 1. Vertical preferences for generosity: Everyone prefers more generous contracts:


                                                             16
w (α; i) is increasing in α.


Assumption 2. Single dimension of heterogeneity in value for generosity (increasing dif-
ferences): w (α; i) = w (α; s), where 1 − s ∈ [0, 1] indexes increasing value for generosity, with
dw (α; s) /d (1 − s) > 0 and d2 w (α; s) /dαd (1 − s) > 0.

       Note that we use 1 − s as the index of WTP for generosity – i.e., s = 0 is the highest WTP type
and s = 1 is the lowest. This ensures that s is the x-axis value on a standard demand curve (where
highest-WTP types are on the left) and simplifies notation for our graphical analysis below.
       Assumption 1 implies that WH (i) > WL (i) for all i. It thus rules out cases in which people
disagree about the quality of plans H and L (i.e. different people would prefer H or L at the same
price). As noted in Section 2 the data are consistent with this vertical assumption: when the price of
H and L are the same – specifically CommCare enrollees below 100% of FPL for which all plans are
free – 96% of enrollees choose H.
       Assumption 2 imposes increasing differences in WTP for generosity. This means that both the
value for H relative to L and value for L relative to U are increasing in a single index of preferences,
1 − s.16 This rules out cases in which the people who value L relative to U by more than average also
care less than average about H relative to L, and vice versa.

Demand Curves

We define the demand for product j ∈ {U, L, H}, Dj (pL , pH ), as the fraction of the population
purchasing j at prices {pL , pH }. Assuming that prices are such that there is positive demand for
all contracts, Assumptions 1 and 2 imply that those with the lowest s choose H, those with the
highest s choose to remain uninsured, U , and those with interim values of s choose L. Moreover, with
positive demand for all plans, the model has the tractable feature that demand depends only on price
differences between adjacently ranked options. Specifically, DH depends only on pH − pL , DU depends
only on pL 17 and DL depends on both pH − pL and pL .
       Figure 8 illustrates how the willingness to pay curves translate into the fraction enrolling in each
plan. The figure plots WL and WH against a horizontal axis of s so that these curves are downward
sloping. The vertical preference assumption (1) implies that WH > WL at all points. The increasing
differences assumption (2) implies that the the gap WH − WL widens as WL increases (as one moves
left).
       We denote the point s∗HL to be the point of indifference between L and H, which occurs where the
vertical distance between WH − WL equals pH − pL . All types to the left of this enroll in H, and the
demand for H equals s∗HL . Likewise, the point s∗LU at which pL intersects the WL (s) curve determines
the person who is indifferent between L and U .. All types to the right of s∗LU remain uninsured, and
  16
     Note that Assumption 2 ensures that a single crossing property holds and generalizes the standard assumption in
a vertical model of demand (Tirole, 1988). The standard vertical model assumes that v(αj ; s) = β(1 − s) · αj so that
choice-specific utility equals β(1 − s) · αj − pj , where β (1 − s) is the value of generosity for type s (with β 0 (1 − s) > 0).
This model satisfies our Assumption 2.
  17
     In general, demand for U would depend on pL − pU , but pU is normalized to zero.


                                                               17
those just to the left enroll in the L plan. Mathematically, these points s∗HL and s∗LU are defined by
the equations:

                             ∆WHL (s∗HL ) ≡ WH (s∗HL ) − WL (s∗HL ) = pH − pL
                                                                    WL (s∗LU ) = pL                                   (3)

Given these definitions, a necessary and sufficient condition for demand for all contracts to be positive
is for:
                             Positive Demand Condition:                    0 < s∗HL < s∗LU < 1.

Without loss of generality (since it is an arbitrary index), we assume a uniform distribution over s
types. Because ∆WHL (s) and WL (s) are monotonically decreasing functions (by Assumption 2), the
equations in (3) implicitly define s∗LU = WL−1 (pL ) and s∗HL = ∆WHL
                                                                  −1
                                                                     (pH − pL ). Define the demand
for product j ∈ {U, L, H} as the fraction of the population purchasing j at prices {pL , pH }. Assuming
the positive demand condition holds,18 these are given by:

                                                                  −1
                        DH (pH − pL ) = s∗HL                  = ∆WHL (pH − pL )
                                                                       −1
                     DL (pL , pH − pL ) = s∗LU − s∗HL = WL−1 (pL ) − ∆WHL (pH − pL )                                  (4)
                               DU (pL ) = 1 −      s∗LU       =1−            WL−1 (pL )
where the demand for H only depends on the price difference pH − pL , and the demand for L depends
on both pL and pH − pL . We will often analyze “demand for formal insurance” (i.e. pooled demand
for H or L) which is calculated from the above equations as 1 − DU , which depends only on pL , not
pH .

Insurer Costs

We denote by Cj (s) the expected costs to the insurer of enrolling type s in plan j.19 As is standard in
the literature, we define insurer costs as medical claims paid and abstract from administrative costs.
We also adopt the standard assumption that Cj (s) is independent of the premium charged for the
insurance plan. We define average costs ACj (s) as the average costs of all individuals with type s̃ ≤ s:
                                                              Z     s
                                                          1
                                             ACj (s) =                  Cj (s̃) ds̃.                                  (5)
                                                          s     0

where recall that we have assumed s ∼ U [0, 1]. If premiums are such that all types s̃ ≤ s choose the j
plan, then the cost imposed on the insurer would be given by ACj (s).
  18
      Practically speaking, in our empirical setting, we observe positive demand for all products, so will assume the
positive demand condition holds (though it would be conceptually simple to generalize these curves to the more general
case).
  19
     In a setting with a binary contract choice (as in Einav et al. (2010a)), the variation in Cj (s) with respect to s is
referred to as the marginal cost curve for contract j; with three contracts as we have here, there can be two different
margins of selection into a contract and so the “marginal cost curve” language is less useful.

NOTE: Figure shows the theoretical implications of our vertical model for the willingness to pay (Wj ) curves for the H
and L plans. The model assumptions imply that both WH and WL are downward sloping (i.e., decreasing with s) and
that the gap between WH − WL is also narrowing as s increases. Under the positive demand condition for prices (which
this graph assumes), the lowest-s types (furthest left on the x-axis) buy H, middle-s types (between s∗HL and s∗LU ) buy
L, and the highest-s types choose U .


4.2     Constructing Willingness to Pay and Cost Curves
4.2.1    Willingness to Pay (Wj )

We combine the modeling assumptions above with the empirical patterns documented in Figure 6
to construct the empirical analogues of the WH (.) and WL (.) curves in Figure 8. Figures 9-10 walk
through this exercise.
    Panels A and B of Figure 9 plot the willingness to pay curves for the L contract (WL (.)) and for
the H contract relative to L (∆WHL (.)), respectively. Each line segment represents points derived
from our three income RDs at 150% FPL (in blue), 200% FPL (red), and 250% FPL (green). Equation
(4) shows that WL−1 (pL ) equals 1 − DU (pL ), the share of people who purchase formal insurance at
enrollee premium pL . Therefore, we obtain the WL curve by plotting observations of (1 − DU , pL )
derived from market shares and premiums around each income discontinuity from our RD estimates
                                                            −1
(see Figures 2 and 6). Similarly, Equation (4) shows that ∆WHL (pH − pL ) equals DH (pH − pL ), the
share of people who purchase the H plan at premium difference pH − pL . We therefore obtain the
∆WHL curve by plotting observations of (DH , pH − pL ) from the same RD estimates.
    In principle, we could identify part of a willingness to pay curve using only one premium disconti-
nuity. In practice, we combine the data from all three discontinuities because it lets us observe demand
over a wider range of premiums. As a result, at two of the enrollee premiums, we observe (and plot)
two different market shares. This is because each pricing discontinuity identifies a demand curve for
individuals at a given income level, and these demand curves need not be the same. For example, the

NOTE: Figures show our construction of the willingness to pay curves (WL and ∆WHL ) based on the demand points in
our RD estimates in Figure 6 and the premium variation at each discontinuity from Figure 2. Panel A shows the WL
points, each of which represents an observation of (1 − DU , pL ) drawn from either side of our income discontinuities at
150%, 200%, and 250% FPL. Panel B shows the ∆WHL points, each of which is an observation of (DH , pH − pL ) from
either side of the discontinuities. Panel C and Panel D show how we adjust the WL and ∆WHL curves horizontally to
line up with the 150% FPL line segment.




                                                                         20
premiums that apply between 150-200% FPL identify one point on the demand curve for 150% FPL
(“from the right”) and one point on the demand curve for 200% FPL (“from the left”).
       In practice, we observe that demand in fact varies little with income. In other words, market shares
are relatively flat within an income range that has constant premiums, as was evident in Figure 6.20
As a result, the demand line segments for the three income groups (shown in different colors in Figure
9) nearly intersect.
       To adjust for remaining differences in demand across incomes, we extend our theoretical framework
above to allow willingness to pay for insurance to vary with income, y. We define our index s conditional
on a fixed income level, y, and we denote w (α; s, y) to be the willingness to pay of a type s for a single
income group, y. To allow us to combine demand information across income groups, we assume that
income functions as a horizontal shifter of the value curves:

                                             w (α; s, y) = w (α; s + λy ) .

This assumption implies, for example, that WL150% (s) = WL200% (s + λ200% − λ150% ).
       Panels C and D of Figure 9 illustrate the implications of this assumption graphically. Specifically,
we horizontally shift the Panel A and B value curves estimated at the discontinuities at 200% FPL
and 250% FPL so that willingness to pay (i.e. demand) lines up with the curve estimated at 150%
FPL. We chose to line up the curves at 150% of FPL since that is the threshold with the greatest share
of the eligible population (see Figure 3); results would be qualitatively similar if we instead created a
demand curve at the 200% or 250% FPL threshold. In practice, since demand is relatively flat with
respect to income, the shift is not very large: the 200% FPL curve is shifted leftward by 6% points
in s space, and the 250% FPL curve is shifted leftward by an additional 2% points. The resultant
willingness to pay curves consist of three piece-wise linear segments.
       Finally, in Figure 10 we use our estimates of WL (.)and ∆WHL (.) from Panels C and D of Figure 9
to construct WH (s) as WL (s) + ∆WHL (s) using equation (2). The resulting WL and WH curves allow
us to infer willingness to pay for L and H for people earning 150% of FPL. Willingness to pay for H
is non-trivially higher than for L. The additional value (∆WHL ) ranges from $11 to $31/month, or
11-30% of the median type’s WTP for L. The median type has total WTP for H (WH ) of $103/month.
Using our in-sample variation, we can infer WL over the range s ∈ [0.36, 0.94] – i.e., all but the highest
36% and lowest 6% of the WTP distribution. Similarly, our variation lets us infer WH over the range
s ∈ [0.31, 0.80] – i.e., all but the highest 31% and lowest 20% of the distribution.

4.2.2      Cost Curves for H: ACH and CH

Constructing ACH            In Figure 11 we construct the average cost curve for the H plan, ACH . In
Panel A we plot estimated average costs for enrollees in the H plan on each side of the premium
discontinuities (from Panel B of Figure 7) against the shares in the H plan at each discontinuity (from
Panel B of Figure 6). For instance, just below the 150% FPL discontinuity, 80% are in the H plan, and
  20
    This does not necessarily imply that income effects of insurance demand are small; recall that the eligible population
consists of people who, among other things, do not have access to employer-provided health insurance. The nature of
the eligible population may therefore be changing with income as well.

NOTE: Figure shows our final estimated WTP curves. The blue curve is the adjusted WL curve shown in Panel C of
Figure 9, with the large dots representing observed points. The WH curve (in green) is constructed by vertically summing
the WL and ∆WHL curve (as shown in Panel D of Figure 9) at each x-axis value (of 1 − s). The red vertical bars in the
figure represent the observed points of the adjusted ∆WHL curve. We extrapolate the WL curve slightly out of sample
(from 1 − s = 0.36 down to 1 − s = 0.31) to be able to add on the final point of the ∆WHL curve.


the average cost is $361. Just above the discontinuity, 64% of people are in the H plan and average
cost is $393. Therefore, the average cost curve for 150% FPL flows through the points (64%, $393)
and (80%, $361).
       In Panel B, we once again adjust the average cost curves to obtain a single curve applicable to
individuals at 150% of FPL. To do so, we assume that the slopes of the average cost curves are stable
with income so that one can vertically shift the average cost curves for the 200% FPL and 250% FPL
thresholds to align with the 150% FPL average cost curve.21 To be consistent with how we adjusted
the Wj curves, we also shift the shares along the horizontal axis to align with the 150% FPL curve.

Constructing CH              In addition to the average cost curves, we construct the cost to the insurer of
of marginal enrollees, CH . To do so, note that the total costs to the insurer under the H contract at
prices p = {pL , pH } equals:
                                                  Z      s∗HL (p)
                                     T CH (p) ≡                     CH (s) ds = s∗HL (p) · AC(s∗HL )
                                                     0

where AC(s) was defined in equation (5). This formula integrates over all the individuals who choose
the H contract at these prices. Under the vertical model structure, this corresponds to types for which
s ≤ s∗HL (pH − pL ).
  21
    Specifically, this assumes that the slopes of the average cost curves with respect to type, s, are stable with income
even though the levels of costs are declining in income (see Figure 7 Panel B).

NOTE: Panel A shows the raw average cost points for the H plan, drawn from the RD estimates around each of our three
income discontinuities (see Figure 7 Panel B; for convenience, Appendix Table 6 summarizes those estimates). Panel B
shows how we generate our adjusted ACH for 150% FPL by translating the 200% and 250% FPL line segments to line
up with the 150% FPL segment.


          Now, consider the variation induced by the discontinuities, where both pL and pH may vary. To
capture this, we introduce some additional notation. Let θ parameterize the price changes at the
                                                               dpL                                             dpH
discontinuity so that pL changes by                             dθ    and pH changes by                         dθ .    The policy induces a change in
                          d(pH −pL )       dpH       dpL
pH − pL of                    dθ       =    dθ   −    dθ .   Despite the fact that both pH and pL vary at the discontinuities,
one can still use variation induced by the policy to estimate CH (s). To see this note that:

Because the pricing change does not affect the costs of infra-marginal types, we can infer the costs of
the marginal group by measuring the change in total costs and demand for H. This logic is identical to
the two-plan case considered in past work (Einav, Finkelstein, and Cullen, 2010). The key requirement
for equation (6) to be valid is that pH and pL do not change by the same amount at the discontinuities


                                                                                23
(so that d(pH − pL ) 6= 0.)22
    Panel B of Figures 6 and 7 showed how shares (DH ) and average costs (or ACH ) changed at the
pricing discontinuities. We map these – using the ACH curve adjusted to 150% of FPL from Panel
B of Figure 11 – into CH in (6) using the identity that total costs equal average costs times demand:
T CH = ACH · DH . The resulting CH (s) curve is shown in Figure 12, along with the previously
estimated curves WH, , ACH and WL . We place the CH values along the horizontal axis points that
correspond to the midpoint of the relevant average cost segment. The downward slope of each average
cost curve in turn implies that the cost curve CH (s) lies below the average cost curve, ACH (s).

4.2.3    Cost Curve for L: CL

Because we do not have variation in pL and pH that is orthogonal to pH − pL , we cannot use the same
method to estimate ACL and CL . Absent such independent variation in prices, it is difficult to separate
the costs of those who enter/exit the L plan into the H plan, and those who enter/exit the L plan
into uninsurance, U . Appendix Figure 20 shows the regression discontinuity results for enrollment in
the L plan, the L plan’s market share, and average monthly insurer costs among L enrollees. We see
statistically significant decreases in enrollment and increases in costs at the 150% threshold. There is
little evidence of changes at other thresholds.
    However, we can draw some inferences about CL by exploiting the fact that the market share of
L is relatively small.This implies that the average L enrollee is similar to the marginal enrollee. For
instance, just above 150% FPL, Appendix Figure 20 shows that just 6% of the population enrolls in
the L plan, and we estimate (see Figure 9, Panel A) that the marginal individual who enrollees at
that premium is at s = 0.70 in the WTP distribution. Thus, the 6% who buy at that premium span
s ∈ [0.64, 0.70], and the average cost of the L plan just above 150% FPL provides an approximation
to CL (s) for individuals in this narrow range of WTP.
    We use this strategy to estimate the CL (s) for individuals at 150% of FPL. A similar strategy
could be used at other income thresholds but we focus on 150% for simplicity. In practice, this means
that we use our estimates (see Appendix Table 6) of the average CL of $169 per month for those
enrolled just below 150% FPL (where the relevant s range is s ∈ [0.80, 0.94]) and $242 per month just
above 150% FPL (where the relevant s range is s ∈ [0.64, 0.70]).23
    We include these two CL (s) points (locating them at the midpoint of each s range) in Figure 12.
The implied CL curve is quite similar to the CH curve over the regions of the s distribution where both
are observed. This suggests that obtaining the more generous H contract instead of the L contract
does not significantly increase costs. Therefore the much lower observed average cost in the L plan
(see Table 1) is driven largely by favorable selection rather than by the causal impact of the plan on
costs for the same type, s (i.e. moral hazard).
   22
      Note that although the impact on demand is driven both by changes in pH and pL , we only need to observe the net
impact on demand and costs. Under the vertical model, there is only one type of marginal consumer for the H plan –
i.e., those with s = s∗HL .
   23
      Note that the empirical distribution of average claims for those in L shown in Appendix Figure 20, Panel C is not the
analog of the “average cost” concept defined in equation (5) since the figure shows average claims for all those enrolled
in L; some individuals with higher WTP will in fact enroll in H.

4.3      Results and Implications for Take-up
Figure 12 displays our key findings for individuals at 150% of FPL; Appendix Table 7 summarizes the
numbers in the Figure at key points in the willingness to pay (s) distribution. Throughout the entire
range of s spanning our data,24 the WH (s) curve is substantially below both ACH (s) and CH (s). The
gap between CH and ACH is sizable, indicating significant adverse selection, especially for lower-WTP
types. For instance, if the highest-WTP half of the market (s ≤ 0.5) enrolls in the H plan, the marginal
enrollee (i.e., s = 0.5) costs CH (0.5) = $333 per month, about 20% less than the average enrollees’
cost of ACH (0.5) = $417.
       The fact that throughout the range of our data we find CH (s) > WH (s) is particularly striking,
since WH (s) and CH (s) represent enrollee WTP and insurer costs for the same people.25 Throughout
the observed distribution, WH (s) is less than half of CH (s). At the median of the WTP distribution,
WH (0.5) is only $103 per month, less than one-third of CH (0.5) = $333. Even at the highest in-
sample point of the WTP distribution (the 69th percentile, or s = 0.31), WH (0.31) of $162 per
month is still substantially below average costs of insuring the top 31 percent of the WTP distribution
(ACH (0.31) = $448), as well as costs for the 69th percentile WTP individuals (CH (0.31) = $399).
Even if one could eliminate adverse selection and set premiums for marginal enrollees equal to their
expected costs imposed on the insurer (i.e., pH (s) = CH (s)), at least 70 percent of individuals would
  24
     Our price variation spans roughly the 70th to the 6th percentile of the WTP distribution (essentially all but the top
30 percent of the WTP distribution).
  25
     Our willingness to pay and cost curves were adjusted to reflect those of the 150% FPL income group. If we had instead
adjusted WH and ACH to line up with the estimates at 200% FPL or 250% FPL, we would still find CH substantially
above WH .


                                                                 25
not buy H.
    WTP for L is also far below its costs, CL . Indeed, the gap between WL and CL is larger than
between WH and CH over the entire range of CL we can observe. Specifically, to the right of s = 0.64,
CL ranges from $177 to $241 per month whereas WL is less than about $50 per month. Indeed, the
observed CL points lie above our maximum in-sample WL estimate of $129 per month. Assuming
adverse selection leads to a CL curve that rises with WL , CL will also be above WL for the 70% of the
population for which we can measure demand for H or L.

Take-up under Counterfactual Subsidies These results imply low take-up of even heavily sub-
sidized insurance for low-income adults. For example, at 150% of poverty, individuals in MA face a
$39 enrollee premium for the L plan, which is a 90% subsidy relative to the insurer price (see Figure 1,
Panel B). Our estimates of WL and WH indicate that, with a 90% price subsidy, only 69% of the mar-
ket would enroll if offered L, and only 76% would enroll if offered H (with the corresponding enrollee
monthly premium of $42.40). These estimates have implications for understanding enrollment in the
ACA subsidized exchanges, where enrollee premiums are significantly higher than in Massachusetts at
a given income level. For instance, for an individual at 175% FPL in 2011, the ACA would make the
second-cheapest silver plan cost 5.2% of income (or $83 per month),26 even though the ACA silver
plan has an actuarial value below the plans we study in Massachusetts.27 Our estimates suggest that
at an enrollee premium of $83, only about half of the market would buy L and only about 60% would
buy H.
    The results also suggest that without subsidies that lower enrollee premiums substantially below
average insurer cost of enrollees, relatively few low-income people would take up insurance. To illus-
trate this, Table 2 summarizes predicted take-up under potential subsidies for plan H. With enrollee
premiums that are 75% below average costs (i.e., a subsidy in excess of $300 per month) only 50% of
the population would enroll. Premiums would need to be 90% below average costs in order to induce
80% enrollment. Interestingly, the per-enrollee subsidy cost increases by only $2 as subsidies move
from 90% to 100% of average cost, reflecting the fact that average enrollee costs are declining steeply
as healthier individuals are brought into the market.



4.4    Sensitivity
Our key findings of low take-up and willingness to pay well below insurer costs are robust to a number
of alternative implementation choices. Table 3 summarizes some of these results. Each row represents
a single deviation from the baseline specification, as indicated. In all the alternative specifications we
consider below, our main results continue to hold: WH is substantially below ACH and CH , which
implies limited take-up even with substantial subsidies. Indeed, the sensitivity analysis highlights the
  26
     This calculation applies the ACA’s subsidy rules (see https://www.irs.gov/irb/2014-50 IRB/ar11.html) – which
specify the premium of the second-cheapest silver plan as a percent of income – to the FPL for a single individual in
2011.
  27
     We estimate that CommCare plans have an actuarial value of about 97% for enrollees between 100-200% of poverty.
In the ACA, the baseline silver plan has an actuarial value of 87% for enrollees between 150-200% FPL.

NOTE: Table summarizes the implications of our estimates for enrollment and costs for H under alternative subsidies
(shown in the rows). We consider subsidies that lead to enrollee premiums for H of $246, $105, $36, and $0 per month
(column 1); these correspond to subsidies of 50%, 75%, 90%, and 100% of equilibrium average costs (column 2). The
third column shows the corresponding dollar amount of the subsidy. The fourth column shows the share of the eligible
population purchasing insurance (i.e. the offered H plan). The next two columns show WTP and costs of the marginal
enrollee – the marginal WTP by definition equals the enrollee premium. The final column shows average costs of the
insured population. Note that while our analysis of 75% and 90% subsidies uses “in-sample” demand and cost curves,
analysis of 100% and 50% subsidies requires extrapolating demand and costs outside of our in-sample range, which
spans all but the top 31% and bottom 6% of the willingness to pay distribution. Appendix B shows the simple linear
extrapolation we use to approximate willingness to pay and costs out of sample for these two estimates.


conservative nature of our baseline assumptions; under plausible alternative specifications, the share
who enroll in H at a given subsidy level is always (weakly) lower, sometimes substantially so.



RD Specification Our baseline specification allowed a (linear) slope and intercept to vary on each
side of the 150%, 200%, and 250% thresholds (see equation 1). In practice, this meant a bandwidth
of 50% of FPL everywhere but to the left of the 150% FPL threshold. The first two rows of Table 3
show results using a narrower (25% of FPL) bandwidth, and results with the baseline bandwidth but
a quadratic (rather than linear) functional form for the running variable. The third row shows results
from our baseline specification excluding one of our three thresholds: the 200% of FPL threshold.28 As
we discussed in Section 2, this threshold is potentially problematic because of two other small changes
at 200% FPL that could affect enrollment or costs independently of the change in enrollee premium:
eligibility expands slightly at 200% FPL (to cover pregnant women and HIV-positive individuals for
whom Medicaid eligibility ceases) and copays increase slightly at 200% FPL, resulting in a decline in
plan actuarial value from 97% to 95%.

Examining manipulation of the running variable A key threat to the validity of our empirical
design is if individuals manipulate the running variable (the CommCare-specific income measure as a
share of FPL) in order to qualify for higher subsidies. A standard way to look for such manipulation
is to examine how the density of the population varies around the RD thresholds. Appendix Figure 15
shows the density of the eligible population in the ACS data for 2011, as well as for a similar ACS sample
  28
     We fill in the (now missing) space between the 150% and 250% FPL line segments by extrapolating the 150% FPL
segment linearly.

of CommCare-eligible individuals pooled over 2009-2013. The figure shows no evidence of bunching
in the ACS income distribution at the thresholds. However, the data are somewhat noisy for 2011
alone, and more importantly, the income measure reported in the ACS may not be the same as what
is reported to CommCare for purposes of determining subsidy eligibility. It is the CommCare-specific
income measure for which we are concerned about potential manipulation. Since our administrative
data only include those who actually enroll in CommCare, we cannot look for bunching per se in the
CommCare income measure as we cannot separately identify income manipulation from the take-up
response to higher premiums.
    Turning to the administrative data on plan enrollment, we can look for other patterns consistent
with strategic manipulation, including whether there is an upward spike in the number of enrollees
just below the subsidy threshold or a decline just above the threshold (see Kleven (2016)). Panel A
of Figure 4 shows some slight evidence of lower enrollment (relative to the linear slope in income that
we fit) to the right of the thresholds in the 2009-2013 pooled data. Appendix Figure 21 examines this
further by showing enrollment by FPL separately for each year. The slightly lower-than-projected
enrollment to the right of the subsidy threshold in the pooled 2009-2013 data appears to be entirely
driven by the 2012 and (especially) 2013 data. There is no evidence of manipulation in the earlier
years. The lack of manipulation in 2011 – our base year – suggests that any attempt to adjust for it
using standard techniques (e.g. donut RDs as in Diamond and Persson (2016)) would not substantively
affect our baseline estimates. We expect any manipulation that does occur may reflect learning how to
“game” the system by existing enrollees; consistent with this, we find no evidence of such manipulation
among new enrollees even in 2012 and 2013 (not shown).

                                                         28
Alternative Estimates of Take-up As we discussed in Section 2, the administrative data alone
are sufficient to estimate willingness to pay, average cost, and own costs for the enrolled population
and thus produce our key result that willingness to pay is substantially below average cost and own
costs. However, an estimate of the eligible population size is essential for pinning down where in the
distribution of willingness to pay for insurance our observed demand changes occur.
    Our baseline estimates scaled the shape of the eligible population income distribution in the ACS
to match the ACS estimate that on average, 63% of the eligible population enrolls in CommCare. As
discussed, the ACS’s coverage estimates match other survey estimates, as well as estimates based on
tax filing data. However, if we instead divide the administrative counts of enrollment in CommCare
by the raw ACS estimates of the size of the eligible population, we estimate only a 37% take-up rate.
As shown in Table 3, this implies an even lower fraction of the population that will be insured at a
given subsidy. For example, with this alternative take-up rate, we estimate that with a 75% subsidy
of average costs, only 29% of eligible individuals would enroll in H, compared to 49% in our baseline
analysis. Right below 150% FPL, using the the raw ACS estimates for the denominator suggests 56%
take-up, compared to our baseline estimate of 94%. The lower take-up estimates based on the ACS
denominator may reflect the fact that income in the ACS is a noisy measure of the administratively
recorded income in the CommCare data.

Accounting for the Mandate Penalty Our baseline analysis assumes that individuals do not
take account of the expected mandate penalty for remaining uninsured when deciding whether or not
to buy insurance. While we argue in Section 2 that this is a reasonable assumption in our institutional
environment, the last row of Table 3 shows that accounting for the mandate penalty – which lowers the
effective premiums – implies even lower willingness to pay than our baseline estimates.29 For example,
our estimates now imply that with a 75% subsidy of average costs, only about 32% would enroll in H.

Inertia in Plan Demand and Robustness to New Enrollees Our estimates thus far have
abstracted from inertia or switching costs, which have shown to be relevant for health insurance plan
choices (Handel, 2013; Ericson, 2014; Polyakova, 2016). If individuals do not make “active choices”
each year once they are enrolled in CommCare this raises potential concerns with our estimates.
    One concern is that enrollees’ income might change, leading them to move across the RD income
threshold, but they might be unaware of the change or not re-optimize their choices.30 This would
suggest that our estimates understate the impact of higher premiums on insurance demand.
    A second concern is that enrollees may not respond to changes in relative premiums for L compared
to H, affecting our estimates of WL relative to WH . This seems potentially relevant, since the L plan
(CeltiCare) was new to the market in 2010, so enrollees who joined the exchange prior to 2010 did
not have it as an option. However, our main findings are driven by a shift in demand from any formal
  29
     Specifically, we normalize premiums by subtracting the expected mandate penalty values (shown by the black dots
in Figure 2) from the “sticker premiums” shown in that same figure; note that effective premiums are everywhere lower,
but the premium change at the FPL thresholds remains the same. Appendix Table 6 reports the normalized premiums
by FPL.
  30
      Institutionally, lack of awareness seems less likely to be relevant, since the administrative income variable (used for
calculating subsidies) changes only if an individual is audited (a salient event) or self-reports a change.


                                                             29
insurance (H or L) to uninsurance at the RD income thresholds. Thus, switching between H and L is
less likely to be empirically important for our main results. Further, because L was unavailable prior
to 2010, lack of awareness of L would likely push upward our estimates of demand for H relative to L.
         A third, and related, concern is that in years prior to 2011, the premiums for the different plans
that make up the H composite plan varied.31 This motivated our focus on 2011 when the premiums
were quite similar, so these plans can be pooled into a single “H” option (defined as the preferred
choice among the four component plans) with price pH . However, if individuals made their choices in
other years, this could be problematic.
         To investigate the potential importance of such concerns for our estimates, we re-estimated demand
on the sub-sample of new enrollees. We define new enrollees as those who enroll for the first time in
2011 (since the market opened in 2006); by definition, therefore, they must make an active choice in
2011. The results for new enrollees in 2011 are shown in Appendix Figures 22 and 23 for enrollment
in any plan and enrollment in the H plan respectively. In each case, Panel A shows results for all
enrollees (for comparison) while Panel B shows results for new enrollees. New enrollees comprise about
one-sixth of all enrollee-months. The percent reductions in enrollment at the income discontinuities
are similar for new enrollees and all enrollees; for example, enrollment in any plan declines by 22 to
28 percent for new enrollees, compare to 25 to 27 percent for all enrollees. This suggests that inertia
is unlikely to be biasing downward our estimates of how much demand falls as premiums rise.

Relaxing Assumptions of Vertical Model Our analysis thus far has assumed a vertical model
of demand with two CommCare options, H and L. In Appendix D, we show that we can eliminate
the vertical assumptions and still obtain bounds on WTP for CommCare (“W Ins ”) – defined as an
individual’s WTP for her most preferred plan. Assuming only that consumers are optimizing when
making their plan choices, we can use the enrollee premium for the cheapest plan (pmin ) as a lower
bound on W Ins at a given point in its distribution, and the premium of the most expensive plan (pmax )
as an upper bound. Our RD subsidy discontinuities then serve as exogenous variation in pmin and
pmax that let us map out these lower and upper bounds on W Ins across a range of the population
distribution. We find that the resultant lower and upper bounds of W Ins are, in fact, quite similar to
the WL and WH estimates from the baseline vertical model. The lower bound on W Ins is identical to
WL by construction – both are generated by plotting the share purchasing any insurance against the
premium of the cheapest plan (L). The upper bound on W Ins is also only slightly above WH .


5         Discussion and Normative Implications
Our results suggest that willingness to pay for insurance among a low-income population is extremely
low relative to the costs they impose on the insurer. Why might this be the case? And what are the
normative implications for health insurance subsidies? We briefly discuss both issues here.
    31
    For instance, in 2010 for individuals in the 150-200% FPL group, enrollee premiums for the four H plans varied from
$39 to $64 per month.




                                                          30
5.1     Why Is WTP so Low?
We estimate that willingness to pay is less than one-third of average costs. This cannot be fully
explained by adverse selection driving a wedge between average costs and costs for marginal enrollees.
We estimate that willingness to pay is also always less than half of marginal enrollees’ own expected
costs. This stylized fact runs counter to a standard assumption in textbook models of insurance
demand – that willingness to pay for insurance equals expected costs plus a value of risk protection.
      In principle, moral hazard offers a potential explanation. If the provision of health insurance leads
individuals to consume care they wouldn’t have consumed when uninsured (“moral hazard”), their
willingness to pay for this additional care will be less than the cost they would have had to pay for
it when uninsured. In practice, however, moral hazard is unlikely to be large enough to explain the
results. Insurance would have to increase costs by a factor of at least 200% to explain the estimated
gap between willingness to pay (Wj ) and own costs (Cj ). This seems well outside the plausible range of
estimates. For example, the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment finds that Medicaid for low-income
adults – the closest analog to CommCare – increases health care spending by about 25% relative to
being uninsured (Finkelstein et al., 2012).
      By contrast, uncompensated care for the low-income uninsured is large enough to rationalize their
low willingness to pay for CommCare. Uncompensated care for the uninsured reduces willingness to
pay relative to the gross cost of this insurance, since some share of those costs pays for care that,
if uninsured, would have been paid for by third parties. Estimates suggest that the uninsured pay
only about 20% to 35% of their cost of care (Coughlin et al. 2014; Hadley et al. 2008; Finkelstein,
Hendren, and Luttmer, 2015), which is remarkably similar to our estimated ratio of WTP to own costs
for the H plan. Not surprisingly therefore, a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the
magnitude of uncompensated care for the low-income uninsured could close most of the gap between
willingness to pay (WH ) and own expected cost (CH ).
      To illustrate the potential role of uncompensated care, we let CU (s) denote expected uncom-
pensated care costs that type-s individuals receive if uninsured. Uncompensated care is notoriously
difficult to measure. We form a rough approximation of it as:
                                                                       
                                                               CH (s)
                                        CU (s) = (1 − x)                    .                          (7)
                                                               1+φ

where x denotes the share of the uninsured’s total health care costs that they pay out of pocket (thus
1 − x reflects the fraction provided as uncompensated care) and φ denotes the percentage increase
in costs that result from insurance coverage (i.e. moral hazard). Hence, total costs of the uninsured
      CH (s)
are    1+φ .   We assume φ is 0.25 and x is 0.2 based on results from the Oregon Heath Insurance
Experiment (Finkelstein et al. 2012; Finkelstein, Hendren, and Luttmer, 2015). These values imply
that CU (s) = 0.64CH (s). Thus the “net” cost of insurance, CH (s) − CU (s), is only about one-third
of gross costs CH (s). Figure 13 suggests that this magnitude of uncompensated care can account for
nearly all of the gap between willingness to pay and own costs. For example, at the median of the
willingness to pay distribution, we estimate net cost of $120, which is quite close to the willingness
to pay estimate of about $100. At higher points in the willingness to pay distribution (e.g. 30th

percentile), willingness to pay is about $10 higher than our approximation of net costs.32 Hence, a
plausible parameterization of uncompensated care shows its sizable role in the economics of health
insurance demand: individuals may be willing to pay their net cost from additional coverage but not
the gross cost they impose on the insurer that ignores savings for providers of uncompensated care.
       A large role for uncompensated care also can potentially explain differential take-up findings for
low- vs. high-income populations. The low willingness to pay we find for the low-income population
in Massachusetts contrasts with the findings for higher-income individuals in Massachusetts: Hack-
mann, Kolstad, and Kowalski (2015) estimate that individuals above 300% of the federal poverty line
in Massachusetts are willing to pay the (gross) cost they impose on the insurer. One parsimonious
way to rationalize these findings is that only low-income individuals are able to obtain substantial
uncompensated care, and this uncompensated care when uninsured reduces the willingness to pay for
formal insurance. Consistent with this interpretation, our results are similar to Finkelstein, Hendren,
and Luttmer (2015) who, based on ex-post valuation of Medicaid, find its value to enrollees to be sub-
stantially below (gross) insurer costs. Both of these estimates apply to a low-income adult population;
the estimates here are for adults at 150% of FPL while Finkelstein, Hendren, and Luttmer (2015)
study adults below 100% of FPL.
       Figure 13 suggests that subsidies that offset the costs of uncompensated care will be necessary to
generate substantial insurance coverage. They may not, however, be sufficient. For example, Figure
  32
    For our illustrative purposes, we have focused on the H contract. As shown in Figure 12, the CL (s) appears similar
to CH (s) over the range we can observe both, suggesting that the net cost estimate in equation (7) would be similar if
we calculated it based on CL (s) instead of CH (s). Likewise, if we repeated Figure 13 for the L policy, it would similarly
suggest willingness to pay for L is similar to or above own expected net cost of L.


                                                               32
13 suggests that willingness to pay is above own net costs for about 40% of the market. However, if
subsidies simply covered CU , prices could still be driven higher than WTP because of adverse selection.
The adverse selection we observe is not sufficient to explain low take-up given that WTP is less than
own costs, but if WTP were closer to CH , adverse selection would be more consequential.
   More broadly, the analysis in Figure 13 does not preclude other factors that may reduce estimated
willingness to pay below the individual’s true value of insurance. For example, Hendren (2017) has
recently emphasized that observed demand may understate the ex-ante value of insurance measured
before the individual has learned something about her health type; in practice, however, as we show
in Appendix C, our estimates suggest that even though an ex-ante willingness to pay measure may be
significantly higher than our baseline willingness to pay estimates, the ex-ante willingness to pay mea-
sure would still be below own (gross) cost. Liquidity constraints are another potential factor creating
a wedge between willingness to pay and value that does not appear quantitatively important. The
majority of the enrollees choose to pay for the H instead of the L plan, suggesting that although they
might be liquidity constrained, they are not up against the corner of their budget constraint. Finally,
behavioral biases – such as lack of information about eligibility, inattention, inertia, or misperceptions
(Spinnewijn (2017); Baicker et al. (2012)) – could also reduce willingness to pay below value. Our
previous finding of similar (or if anything lower) demand responsiveness by new enrollees suggests that
inertia or inattention are not primary drivers of low willingness to pay, but naturally we cannot rule
out behavioral biases more broadly. What we can conclude is that the size of uncompensated care for
low-income populations can rationalize their low willingness to pay even in the absence of behavioral
or other frictions.

5.2   Normative Implications
To consider the normative implications of our findings, we need to make the additional assumption
that willingness to pay is in fact the welfare-relevant metric for judging the welfare of health insurance
subsidy recipients. This is a standard assumption in economics and has been widely used to estimate
the surplus from private (often employer-provided) insurance Einav, Finkelstein, and Levin (2010).
However, it does require assuming away behavioral or other frictions that may drive a wedge between
estimated demand and the value individuals truly derive from the insurance.
   For our normative analysis we follow Hendren (2016) and compute the marginal value of public
funds (M V P F ) for an incremental government subsidy for health insurance. This is given by the ratio
of marginal benefit to marginal cost. The marginal benefit of an additional subsidy dollar is defined by
the marginal willingness to pay for it; the marginal cost to the government of the additional subsidy
incorporates any fiscal externalities resulting from behavioral responses to the subsidy. Thus when
fraction s∗ of the market is enrolled, we can derive:

                                                    s∗                            1
                       M V P F (s∗ ) =          CH (s∗ )−WH (s∗ )
                                                                    =        CH (s∗ )−WH (s∗ )
                                                                                                 .    (8)
                                         s∗ +      −WH  0 (s∗ )         1+     −s∗ WH 0 (s∗ )


Appendix E provides a formal derivation. Intuitively, the marginal benefit of the subsidy is s∗ : lowering
the premium by $1 is valued at $1 for all inframarginal enrollees, and the marginal enrollees who choose


                                                         33
to purchase insurance because of the additional subsidy are indifferent between being insured and
                                                                     ∗       ∗
uninsured. The marginal cost of the subsidy is s∗ + CH (s )−WH (s )
                                                       −W 0 (s∗ )
                                                                    , where the first term is the increased
                                                                         H
cost for the s∗ inframarginal enrollees and the second term follows from the fact that the subsidy
                                ds∗
expands the market by          −dpH   =     1
                                            0 (s∗ )

                                                      and the marginal enrollee imposes a cost of CH (s∗ ) − WH (s∗ ).
Hence, the cost of additional insurance subsidies is less (greater) than the mechanical cost, s∗ , to
the extent to which the marginal enrollee’s premium pH = WH (s∗ ) is higher (lower) than her cost
CH (s∗ ).33 The MVPF will be above 1 if individuals are willing to pay the cost to the government of
additional subsidies. This could result from market failures (e.g. adverse selection) that leaves people
uninsured despite having a willingness to pay above own expected costs.
    For illustrative purposes, we use the above formula and our estimates in Figure 12 to study the
normative implications of subsidizing the H plan in a simplified world without the presence of an L
plan. We compute the MVPF at two coverage levels: when 30% and 90% of the market is insured.
This corresponds roughly to the in-sample range we observe. We estimate M V P F (0.30) = 0.28 and
M V P F (0.90) = 0.56. An MVPF below 1 indicates that individuals would prefer a $1 lump-sum
transfer to $1 of insurance subsidies. For example, M V P F = 0.28 indicates that recipients are willing
to pay about 30 cents for every $1 increase in government spending on subsidies.
    This calculation, however, implicitly assumes that uncompensated care is either non-existent
(CU (s∗ ) = 0) or that it has no social value. The impact of accounting for uncompensated care on the
MVPF depends on the incidence of uncompensated care. For example, suppose the government bears
the incidence of uncompensated care payments – as would be the case if public funds were used to
reimburse hospitals for uncompensated care. Then the cost to the government of providing insurance
subsidies – which was CH (s∗ )−WH (s∗ ) in the denominator of equation (8) – would be replaced by the
net cost, CH (s∗ ) − CU (s∗ ) − WH (s∗ ). If however, the incidence of uncompensated care were on the
low-income beneficiaries themselves – as would be the case if reductions in uncompensated care costs
on the newly insured allow providers to provide better care to those who are not enrolled – this would
affect the numerator rather than the denominator of equation (8). Specifically, the marginal benefit of
the insurance subsidies increases from the mechanical s∗ impact on the inframarginal enrollees in (8)
           CU (s∗ )
to s∗ +   −WH0 (s∗ ) ;   the marginal benefit of the subsidy increases by CU (s∗ ) for each marginal enrollee,
with a $1 subsidy inducing −W10 (s∗ ) to enroll. Finally, if the incidence of uncompensated care is borne
by third parties, such as hospital owners or those enrolled in employer-provided insurance, one might
wish to account for the different social marginal utility of income of these third parties compared to
the low-income beneficiaries whose insurance is subsidized. Let η denote the social marginal utility of
income to those bearing the incidence of uncompensated care so that society is indifferent between $1
to the low-income individuals receiving insurance subsidies and $η in payments to those paying the
                                                                                            CU (s )                   ∗
uncompensated care costs. In this case the marginal benefit of the subsidy would be s∗ + η −W 0 (s∗ ) .
                                                                                                                  H
    Figure 14 illustrates the impact of these different assumptions about uncompensated care on our
estimates of the MVPF of additional subsidies, starting from having either 30% or 90% of the market
insured. We parameterize CU (s) using the methods described in Section 5.1. The first panel shows the

     This cost definition abstracts from any potential labor market activity response to the means-tested health insurance
subsidies. If individuals reduce earnings in response to higher subsidies, this would introduce an added cost that would
need to be incorporated into the denominator.

NOTE: Figure shows estimates of the marginal value of public funds (MVPF) for insurance subsides, based on equation (8)
and different assumptions about the initial level of insurance coverage and the presence and incidence of uncompensated
care for the uninsured. See text for details.


MVPF ignoring uncompensated care (i.e η = 0). Panels (2)-(4) show the MVPF when, respectively, the
incidence of uncompensated care payments is on the government, the low-income uninsured (η = 1),
and more affluent third parties for whom η = 0.5.34 Figure 14 shows that whether the MVPF from
additional subsidies is above 1 depends on the incidence of uncompensated care, as well as the baseline
share of the market insured.
       Of course, the appropriate benchmark for the MVPF may not be 1. Insurance subsidies for low-
income adults may serve redistributive aims, and redistribution inevitably involves some resource cost
(Okun, 1975). In Figure 14 we therefore consider two other benchmarks. In the first we ask: given
a specific social welfare function, individual utility function, and the consumption level of the eligible
population relative to the general population, how high would the MVPF have to be to make additional
subsidies desirable (Saez and Stantcheva, 2016)? We consider a utilitarian social welfare function over
individual CRRA utility functions, and assume median consumption of our study population is 60%
that of median consumption in the general population in Massachusetts.35 With a coefficient of
relative risk aversion of 3 (i.e. marginal utility of u0 (c) = 1/c3 ), this would suggest society should
  34
     An η = 0.5 can be motivated by assuming the incidence of uncompensated care falls on more affluent individuals
whose social marginal utility is 50% that of the direct subsidy recipients. Alternatively, it can be motivated by Hendren
(2014)’s estimate that, because of the distortionary cost of taxation, $1 at the top of the income distribution can be
turned into only $0.50 for those at the bottom.
  35
     This is derived from authors’ calculations from the Consumer Expenditure Survey. We compare median consumption
in the recipient population to the general population under the assumption that the subsidy is financed through a uniform
lump sum tax on the population, and we ignore fiscal externalities from income effects that result from such a tax.


                                                               35
prefer policies with an MVPF of at least 0.20, a threshold crossed by all of our MVPF estimates.
Naturally, more concave social welfare functions would further increase social value, while more (less)
concave individual utility functions would increase (decrease) social value.
    A second benchmark, which avoids having to take a stand on the curvature of the social welfare
function or the individual utility function, asks whether these subsides are more or less costly than
other redistributive programs (Hendren, 2014). A natural comparison is to the Earned Income Tax
Credit (EITC) – the primary form of tax subsidies to low-income individuals in the U.S. Hendren
(2016) draws on existing empirical estimates of the impact of the EITC on labor supply to estimate a
MVPF of 0.9 for the EITC. Figure 14 indicates that whether additional health insurance subsidies for
low-income individuals deliver positive welfare benefits relative to increasing the EITC (i.e., whether
the MVPF is above 0.9) once again depends on the share of the market already insured and the
incidence of uncompensated care.


6    Conclusion
This paper estimates willingness to pay and costs for health insurance among low-income adults using
data from Massachusetts’ pioneer subsidized insurance exchange. For at least 70% of the low-income
eligible population, we find that willingness to pay for insurance is far below insurers’ average costs.
Adverse selection exists, despite the presence of the coverage mandate, but is not the driving force
behind low take up. We estimate that willingness to pay is less than half of enrollees’ own expected
costs; thus, even if insurers could set prices conditional on an individual’s willingness to pay, at least
70% of the market would be uninsured.
    From a positive economics perspective, our results point to substantial challenges in getting to
universal coverage via partially subsidized insurance programs like the ACA’s exchanges. For example,
we estimate that even subsidizing premiums down to 10% of insurer costs would generate only 80%
coverage. This reality may underlie the incomplete take-up of insurance under the ACA, despite a
coverage mandate and generous subsidies. We provide suggestive evidence of an important role for
uncompensated care in explaining why willingness to pay is substantially below (gross) insurance costs.
This in turn suggests a potential economic rationale for subsidies as a response to the “Samaritan’s
dilemma” to offset the implicit tax that uncompensated care imposes on formal insurance (Coate,
1995).
    If we are willing to interpret our estimates of willingness to pay as revealing individuals’ value for
insurance, our results also have normative implications for such subsidies. In particular, they suggest
that if individuals had to pay the full cost imposed on the insurer, mandating these low-income
individuals to buy health insurance would not make them better off. We find robust evidence that
low-income individuals value health insurance below the cost they impose on the insurance company.
A priori, this need not have been the case if adverse selection were the primary source of lack of
insurance. Our results therefore suggest that adverse selection, while it exists in this market, is not
by itself provide a sufficient rationale for health insurance subsidies. Further, we show that normative
analysis of the insurance subsidies depends critically on the economic incidence of the provision of


                                                   36
uncompensated care. Better understanding this incidence is an important, albeit challenging, area for
future work.

Appendix A. Estimating the CommCare Eligible Population in the
ACS
We estimate the size of the eligible CommCare population in Fiscal Year 2011 using data from the
2010-2011 American Community Survey (ACS). This appendix describes how we estimate the size of
the population eligible for CommCare using the American Community Survey (ACS). Our estimation
has two main steps: first, we apply CommCare’s eligibility criteria to the ACS data to limit to the
sample of individuals likely eligible for CommCare. Second, we estimate the eligible population by
income bin, using a regression to smooth the raw counts in each bin. Below, we describe each step in
detail.

Applying CommCare Eligibility to ACS Data
We begin with ACS data from 2010-2011, using both years because our CommCare year of interest,
fiscal year 2011, spans July 2010-June 2011.36 To take an average of the population across years, we
multiply sample weights by 1/2.
       We begin by defining family income as a share of the poverty line, analogous to the measure used by
CommCare. Specifically, we sum total personal income across all members of an individual’s “health
insurance unit” (HIU), a variable defined by the University of Minnesota’s SHADAC to approximate
family unit definitions used by public insurance programs. We divide this total income by the FPL
defined by the year and the HIU size.
       We then define people as CommCare eligible if they are U.S. Citizens in the relevant age range (19-
64) and income range (less than 300% FPL) who are not enrolled in another form of health insurance
(specifically, employer insurance, Medicare, or Tricare) and are not eligible for Medicaid (based on
income and demographics). We discuss each of these restrictions in turn. The top panel of table 4
shows the ACS sample size, the (unweighted) number of individuals dropped at each of stages, and
the estimated population size (scaled up using 1/2 of the ACS person weights).
       Restricting to the relevant age range (row 1) and income range (row 2) is straightforward. In row
3 we restrict to U.S. citizens. Nearly all non-citizens are ineligible for CommCare, with the exception
of long-term green card holders (longer than 5 years). Because we cannot separately measure this
latter group in the ACS, we exclude all non-citizens. In row 4, we exclude any individual who reports
  36
       We obtained ACS data from the IPUMS-USA website (Ruggles et al., 2015).



                                                         41
having employer-sponsored insurance (ESI), Medicare, Tricare, privately purchased insurance, or VA
insurance.
       The last two rows of the table show how we exclude individuals eligible for Medicaid (MassHealth)
instead of CommCare. We cannot directly measure Medicaid eligibility in the ACS.37 Instead, we
approximate it by excluding the two largest groups we know are eligible: parents with income below
133% of FPL, and the disabled (proxied by under 65 and SSI receipt). Parents with dependents under
18 are eligible for Medicaid below 133% FPL and eligible for CommCare above this cut-off. We focus
on income groups above the cutoff so that results are not affected by this large compositional change
in eligibility, and use the 135% FPL cutoff to avoid ambiguity right at the 133% FPL cutoff and
to maintain equal-size 5% FPL bins for later analysis. This approach misses a few groups who are
Medicaid eligible but whom we cannot easily measure in the ACS - specifically, pregnant women below
200% FPL and HIV-positive people below 200% FPL. Based on the number of women below 200%
FPL with a child under one year old, we estimate that pregnant women may constitute 0.4% of our
eligible sample. The HIV-positive group is likely to be even smaller.38
       The final sample in the ACS includes 2,856 observations. Scaling this up to a population size using
the ACS’s person weights, we estimate a CommCare-eligible population size of 168,041 for FY 2011.

Estimating Smoothed Eligible Population
We next use this restricted sample to estimate the CommCare-eligible population by income bin.
       Figure 15 shows the raw estimates, with each point representing the estimated eligible population
size for a 5% of FPL bin. These estimates are quite noisy, both because the ACS is a 1% sample
and because of clustering in reported income at round numbers (which is emphasized in the very high
outlier points). To prevent this noise from introducing error into our estimates of market shares from
the administrative data, we construct a smoothed estimate of the eligible population by income bin.
Specifically, we regress the raw population counts by 1% of FPL bin on a quadratic polynomial in
income as a percentage of FPL. The predicted values from this regression (multiplied by 5 to match
the 5% FPL bins we use in our analysis) are shown in the red curve in Figure 15.
       We use the value of this curve at the midpoint of each 5% FPL income bin for our smoothed
estimate of the CommCare-eligible population size.


Appendix B: Extrapolating out of sample
Appendix Figure 16 shows the simple extrapolation we used to approximate willingness to pay and
cost out of sample; we use this out-of-sample extrapolation only for the 100% and 50% subsidy coun-
terfactuals in Table 2.
       We extrapolate by extending the left-most segments of WH and ACH linearly to the left (and

    We cannot even directly measure Medicaid enrollment; the ACS does not distinguish between Medicaid and Comm-
Care (both are coded as “Medicaid/other public insurance”).

    Details of Medicaid eligibility rules are based on MMPI (2012).

The dots are raw estimates of the annual eligible population size (weighting by the ACS “person weight” to generate a
population estimate) by 5% of FPL bin. Because these data are relatively noisy – especially at high outlier points that
reflect round income numbers like $20,000 – we use a quadratic regression to generate a smoothed estimate of the eligible
population size. The resulting estimates are shown in the curve. Panel B shows the raw estimates of the annual eligible
population size from the pooled 2009-2013 ACS data.

out to its value above the right-most value of WL that we observe (s = 94%) using a linear extrapolation
of the right-most segment of the ∆WHL and ACH curves.40
    This extrapolation leads to estimates of willingness to pay that are still everywhere far below
average and own costs. Because demand lies everywhere below average costs (falling short by more
than $225; WH never exceeds 52% of average costs), our extrapolation suggests the market would
fully unravel in the absence of large government subsidies. Because individuals’ WTP lies everywhere
below their own expected cost they impose on the insurer (by at least $140; WH never exceeds 53%
of CH ), this suggests that even if insurers were able to price discriminate on WTP type (i.e., based
on s), the market would unravel. In this sense, adverse selection cannot explain the low take up of
H by low-income individuals. Even if the quantile of WTP, s, were known to insurers and they were
allowed to price on this information, they would still not be able to profitably sell insurance.
    Naturally, a concern with this linear extrapolation is that it assumes away the possibility that there
is a subset of the population with much higher demand than other types, so that demand increases
non-linearly. While we cannot of course rule this out, the most natural source for willingness to pay
increasing non-linearly would be if the variance of costs (i.e. risk) were higher for higher willingness
to pay individuals, and this does not appear to be the case. To test for this, Appendix Figure 17
explores how the standard deviation of costs changes around our pricing discontinuities. While the

     It would also be possible to extrapolate cH linearly and recalculate ACH accordingly. In practice, this produces even
higher estimates of both cost curves, meaning that our conclusion that WTP is entirely below costs is unchanged.
  40
     Interestingly, WH is quite close to zero at this point (about $4). This does not occur by construction but is consistent
with the idea that these people have virtually no willingness to pay for health insurance, whether H or L. The model
implies that WL is zero or negative for the rest of the s distribution, and based on the estimates, the same is also true of
WH ; in the context of the model, this can be explained by transaction costs in enrolling (even at a zero “sticker” price),
which reduces the net willingness to pay for a formal contract below the uninsured option. Of course, it is also possible
that these 6% who do not enroll at zero price are uninformed about their eligibility (e.g. Bhargava and Manoli (2015)).

results are fairly noisy, there is no evidence that the standard deviation of costs is increasing at the
price discontinuities where willingness to pay of those enrolled is also increasing. While this does not
guarantee that the linear extrapolation is appropriate, it does suggest that it is not entirely inconsistent
with the underlying cost variation in the data.


Appendix C. Willingness to Pay Behind the Veil of Ignorance
One potential concern with comparing willingness to pay to costs is that demand is measured after
some information about health risk may potentially have been revealed to the individual. For example,
suppose demand is measured after one learns whether or not she has a chronic condition. In this case,
observed demand will understate the ex-ante value of insurance that would be measured before the
individual has learned their risk. Hendren (2017) provides a method for calculating willingness to
pay for insurance from behind the veil of ignorance. Instead of using the observed market demand
curve, W (s), one uses an “ex-ante” demand curve, W (s) + EA (s), where EA (s) captures the value
of expanding the size of the insurance market from the perspective of behind the veil of ignorance.
    For a linear demand curve, the formula in Hendren (2017) for the ex-ante component of willingness
to pay is given by EA (s) = (1 − s) (C (s) − W (s) − sW 0 (s)) γ 1−s       0

cient of absolute risk aversion and the factor of 12 translates our monthly demand estimates into yearly
units. We apply this formula in our context using a conservatively high coefficient of absolute risk
aversion of 5x10−4 (which corresponds to a coefficient of relative risk aversion of 5 if individuals have

$10,000 of annual consumption). Our estimates suggest that even using an ex-ante demand measure
and a high value of γ, willingness to pay would still be below own cost. For example, at s = 0.50 we es-
timate that the marginal welfare impact from behind the veil of ignorance of expanding the size of the
                                                                                               0.5

higher (i.e., $163 instead of $100) than the marginal welfare impact implied by observed demand.
Although non-trivial, this is small relative to the approximately $300 difference between marginal cost
and observed demand at s = 0.5. The intuition for this is that the “risk” of learning that one is a high
risk type and must purchase insurance is not exceedingly large when premiums are already heavily
subsidized.


Appendix D. WTP Estimates without a Vertical Model
Our vertical model involves non-trivial assumptions about the nature of the market and preferences
of consumers. These assumptions – while reasonable for CommCare in 2011 – will not be reasonable
in all settings, including for CommCare in other years. In this section, we develop a model with fewer
assumptions that gives us bounds on the WTP for access to a given set of insurance plans.

    Setup and WTP for Insurance The setup is very general. Consider an insurance market with
plan options j = 1, ..., J and an outside option of uninsurance, j = U . Let Wij be the willingness to
pay of consumer i for plan j, where we normalize WTP relative to WiU = 0. Let pij be the premium
of each plan (which can vary across consumers), where we also normalize piU = 0. Consumers choose


                                                            46
among available options to maximize their utility, which equals:

                                             uij = Wij − pij .

Note that by our normalizations, uiU = 0.
   We would like to estimate the willingness to pay for (any) CommCare insurance (WiIns ), defined
as the willingness to pay for each consumer’s most preferred plan:

                                            WiIns = max {Wij }
                                                    j6=U


A challenge in measuring the WTP for insurance is that while we want the maximum value of Wij
across j options, in CommCare consumers choose plans to maximize Wij − pij . However, we can
use choices in CommCare to get bounds on WiIns . To do so, note that if someone chooses U in the
CommCare setting, it implies that Wij ≤ pij for all j 6= U . This in turn implies that

                               Choose U :       WiIns ≤ max {pij } ≡ pmax
                                                                      i                                (9)
                                                           j6=U


Thus, pmax
       i   is an upper bound on the value of access to CommCare for people who choose not to buy
into it. Similarly, if an individual chooses to take up CommCare, we know that Wij ≥ pij for at least
one plan. Therefore, we can bound their WiIns from below by the cheapest plan’s price:

                             Choose j 6= U :      WiIns ≥ min {pij } ≡ pmin
                                                                        i                             (10)
                                                             j6=U


   We can now map these bounds into bounds on a W Ins curve. Let s be an index that orders people
according to decreasing WiIns . Without loss of generality, let the distribution of s be uniform on [0, 1].
Let W Ins (s) denote the WTP for insurance for someone with index s (i.e., the (1 − s)th quantile of
WTP). Suppose that at a given vector of premiums we observe that 1 − s∗ share of people choose U ,
while s∗ choose formal insurance. For the marginal type s∗ , both conditions (10) and (9) hold, so we
can say that:
                                        pmin ≤ W Ins (s∗ ) ≤ pmax

   We use this result, along with our variation in premiums, to estimate bounds on the W Ins (s) curve.
Specifically, we use the same income discontinuities in premiums discussed above. At each side of the
discontinuity, we measure pmin and pmax and estimate 1 − DU . We then plot 1 − DU (as x-values)
against the bounds pmin , pmax (as y-values) using the points on either side of the discontinuity. As
                   

with our estimates of WL and WH , we implement this exercise at each income level separately and
then shift the curves horizontally to line up with the curve for 150% of FPL.
   Appendix Figure 18 shows the resulting bounds for W Ins , with our baseline estimates of WL
and WH from the vertical model shown for comparison. The estimated bounds are relatively tight
and quite close to the WL and WH curves. Indeed, the lower bound on W Ins is identical to WL by
construction; both are generated by plotting the share purchasing formal insurance versus the premium
of the cheapest plan (L). The upper bound on W Ins is above WH , but only slightly higher – a result

that does not occur by construction but reflects the fact that the premiums of the H plans are quite
similar and that few people choose L. From this exercise, we conclude that our basic estimates of (low)
willingness to pay for CommCare insurance are robust to relaxing the vertical model assumptions.
    Relaxing the vertical model assumptions for estimating costs is more challenging. Intuitively, our
vertical model assumes we can pool the four non-CeltiCare plans into a single composite H option
for which a type-s individual has a single expected cost CH (s). As premiums for H increase slightly,
individuals of a single s type (s∗HL ) leave the plan, and we can estimate cH (s∗HL ) using average costs
before and after the change. However, it is also possible that some individuals may switch among
the plans within H as premiums change. If we weaken the composite plan assumption, this switching
could have an independent effect on ACH and T CH . In practice, however, we expect any bias to our
cost estimates from any switching among H plans to be small. First, there is little reason to expect
significant switching, since the premiums of the H plans are nearly identical to each other on both
sides of the income thresholds (see Appendix Table 5). Second, given the similarity of CH (s) and
CL (s) (see Figure 12), it seems unlikely that cost differences among the (much more similar) H plans
for a given s type would be large.


Appendix E: Deriving the MVPF for additional subsidies
We derive the expression for the marginal value of public funds (MVPF) for additional subsidies for
health insurance shown in equation (8). The MVPF is defined as the ratio of the marginal benefit of


                                                              48
an additional subsidy to the marginal cost. The marginal benefit of the additional subsidy is defined
by the marginal willingness to pay for the additional subsidy. The marginal cost to the government
of the additional subsidy incorporates any fiscal externalities resulting from a behavioral response to
the subsidy; in this case, this comes from an enrollment response to the subsidy.
     To derive the MVPF, we define aggregate welfare of beneficiaries when premiums pH are set such
that a fraction s∗ of the market is enrolled as:
                                                           Z       s∗
                                                    ∗
                                                V (s ) =                (WH (s) − pH )ds
                                                            0

where pH = WH (s∗ ) is the price required for a fraction s∗ to choose to enroll. The term WH (s) − pH
captures the consumer surplus of an individual s enrolled in the H plan; this surplus equals her
willingness to pay WH (s) minus the premium she pays, pH . We define the cost to the government of
enrolling a fraction s∗ as:
                                                           Z       s∗
                                                    ∗
                                                χ (s ) =                (CH (s) − pH )ds
                                                               0

where CH (s) − pH denotes the net-of-premium cost of enrolling an s type.
     We can then use these two expressions to define the marginal value of public funds when s∗ of the
market is enrolled:

                                                                              −d

                                                                             dpH χ(s∗)

and to derive:

                                                                                                                .

                                                                          −d
Consider first the expression for the numerator:                         dpH V   (s∗ ) = s∗ . Lowering the premium by a dollar
is valued by $1 for the s∗ fraction of the market already purchasing insurance. In addition to the
transfer to the existing (inframarginal) enrollees, the market also expands in response to the subsidy
      ds∗         1
by   −dpH   =     0 (s∗ ) ,
                −WH
                              or in other words by the inverse of the slope of the demand curve. But the value
of insurance to the marginal enrollee is by definition equal to the premium (i.e. WH (s∗ )≡ pH ), so
that the marginal benefit of insurance for the marginal enrollee is 0. Thus by the standard envelope
theorem argument, the marginal benefit term consists only of the transfer to existing enrollees.
                                                                              −d     ∗    ∗   CH (s∗ )−WH (s∗ )
     Consider next the expression for the denominator:                       dpH χ(s ) = s +     −WH  0 (s∗ )   . The first term,
                                      dWH (s∗ )
s∗ , follows from the fact that         dpH       = −1, so that           the s∗ inframarginal enrollees cost $1. The second
term follows from differentiating the extremum of the integral, which accounts for the cost of new
                ds∗                                                                                                     ds∗

enrollees impose a cost of CH          (s∗ )   − pH .
     Thus the key term for determining whether the MVPF is above or below one is whether the cost
of the marginal enrollee CH (s∗ ) is lower or higher than their willingness to pay (WH (s∗ ). If the cost

NOTE: The table shows enrollee premiums (by income group range) for each CommCare insurer in the market in fiscal
year 2011. The top four plans – which we pool into an “H” plan in our analysis – all have very similar premiums because
their (pre-subsidy) price bids were nearly identical, having been constrained by a binding price ceiling.


of the marginal enrollee is above (below) the willingness to pay of the marginal enrollee, the marginal
subsidy increase will be welfare decreasing (increasing). It is important to note that, a priori, the
sign is unclear. In particular, if adverse selection were the sole or primary source of low take-up – so
that willingness to pay exceeded own costs for the marginal enrollee – subsidies for insurance financed
through lump sum taxes on enrollees could increase aggregate welfare (Einav and Finkelstein, 2011).

NOTE: This table summarizes the inputs into our estimates of willingness to pay and cost curves. For each income
threshold at which premiums change, table shows the monthly enrollee premium, estimated market share, and average
monthly insurer costs just below and above the threshold, as well as the change across the threshold. The premiums
reported in the first two panels were previously presented in Figure 2. The first panel shows sticker premiums for U
(the expected mandate penalty), the L plan, H plan, and the difference pH − pL ; we use these for our main demand
estimates. The second panel shows “normalized” premiums, where pU has been normalized to $0, which we use for
robustness analysis. The third and fourth panels report changes in market shares and average insurer costs based on RD
estimates of equation (1); these results for any insurance and H plan were previously shown in the main text in Figures
(6) and (7), respectively. The results for the L plan are in Appendix Figure 20.

NOTE: These graphs show RD estimates for the average age (panel A) and risk score (panel B) of CommCare enrollees
in all plans, pooled over the 2009-2013 period of our data. Risk scores are calculated by CommCare to reflect a person’s
expected medical spending based on their age, sex, and medical diagnoses. They are used by CommCare to adjust
payments to insurers for their enrollees. Risk score values are relative to an average enrollee (whose risk score is 1.0) –
e.g., a risk score of 1.05 indicates expected costs 5% above average.
