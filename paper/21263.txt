We explore the first period of sustained decline in child mortality in the U.S. and provide
estimates of the independent and combined effects of clean water and effective sewerage systems
on under-five mortality. Our case is Massachusetts, 1880 to 1920, when authorities developed a
sewerage and water district in the Boston area. We find the two interventions were
complementary and together account for approximately one-third of the decline in log child
mortality during the 41 years. Our findings are relevant to the developing world and suggest that
a piecemeal approach to infrastructure investments is unlikely to significantly improve child
health.

    I.    Introduction

         For much of the nineteenth century child mortality was the prime cause of short lifetimes

at birth in the U.S. and much of Europe. In 1880 Massachusetts, for example, infant deaths were

20.4 percent of all deaths even though births were just 2.5 percent of the total population.

Similarly, in 1900 infant deaths were 22.5 percent of all deaths, whereas births were 2.6 percent

of the population. But change occurred swiftly and for reasons that often eluded contemporary

observers and later researchers. From 1870 to 1930, life expectation conditional on reaching age

20 changed little, but infant mortality plummeted from around 1 in 5 to 1 in 16 white infants for

the U.S. and Massachusetts, and deaths of non-infants under five years decreased by a factor of

seven in Massachusetts (Figure 1).1 Why the rapid change?

         An extensive and important literature has explored the role of public health interventions in

reducing the pathogenic environment of early twentieth century cities in the U.S. and Europe,

and the concomitant decline of urban morbidity and mortality. Some researchers have

emphasized the roles of public water and sewerage systems, whereas others have stressed

  Child mortality means deaths to those less than five years of age and includes infant mortality. The “infant
mortality rate” is the number of infants less than one year of age who died during a year divided by the number of
births in that year. The historical literature on U.S. infant mortality includes Cheney (1984), Condran and Lentzner
(2004), Condran and Murphy (2008) and Preston and Haines (1991). Seminal contributions include Cain and Rotella
(2001), on water and sewerage infrastructure by major city; Condran and Cheney (1982), on mortality changes
within Philadelphia; Condran and Crimmins-Gardner (1978), demonstrating the importance of public works in the
decrease of waterborne diseases; Ferrie and Troesken (2008), on clean water and a general decline of non-
waterborne diseases; and Meeker (1972), a pioneering piece on waterborne disease and river spillovers. See also
Beach, Ferrie, Saavedra and Troesken (2016), on long-run payoffs to water purification; Galiani, Gertler and
Schargrodsky (2005), on privatization of water services in Argentina; and Troesken (2001, 2002) on race-specific
typhoid mortality and water provision. How cities began to clean up their acts in the early twentieth century is told
in part by Cutler and Miller (2006), which emphasizes the growth of financial markets.


                                                                                                        Watersheds -1-
additional public health factors. Analyses have been done both across and within cities. As

impressive as these studies are, few can pinpoint a specific exogenous intervention. But the

weight of the evidence is that cities began to clean up their acts in the early twentieth century.

       Among the best identified of the research is that by Cutler and Miller (2005) on the impact

of water chlorination and filtration on the death rate from waterborne diseases across 13 U.S.

cities. Their estimates suggest that improved water quality accounted for 47 percent of the

decline in log infant mortality from 1900 to 1936.2 In addition to purer water, effective sewerage

systems were installed across many U.S. and European metropolitan areas, but their role in the

mortality decline for children under five in the U.S. has yet to be rigorously assessed.3

       Water and sewerage interventions interrupt different points on the fecal to oral

transmission pathway. Sewerage reduces the fecal-oral transmission of pathogens by removing

excrement from drinking water sources, reducing human contact with feces, and limiting

exposure to the gastrointestinal diseases transmitted by flies.4 Clean water interventions remove

impurities, making water safe for consumption and washing. Whether the improvements are

substitutes or complements depends on their overall efficiency as well as the prevailing burden

of disease. Technical complementarities between sewerage and water also existed. For instance,

piped water was used to flush sewage down home drain pipes.

       Our contribution to the impressive literature on public health and mortality is to provide an

  Cutler and Miller (2005, table 5) compute the decrease in IMR due to clean water and sanitation to be 46 log points
from 1900 to 1936 in their 13 cities. The total decrease was 98 log points (log [189.3/71.3], table 2) or 47 percent.
Their paper reports a 74 percent change, but they have posted a correction.

  Cutler and Miller (2005) analyze two discrete water interventions, not sewerage. Research contributions on
sanitation interventions and mortality include, but are not limited to, Brown and Guinnane (2015) on Bavaria,
Kesztenbaum and Rosenthal (2014) on early twentieth century Paris, Preston and Van de Walle (1978) on nineteenth
century France, and Watson (2006) on U.S. Indian reservations.

  The aptly named “F-diagram” of fecal-oral disease transmission and control (Wagner and Lanoix 1958)
demonstrates how feces can lead to disease transmission through the “5 F’s” fingers, fluids (water supply), flies,
fields/floor and food (occasionally flooding is included). Even with clean water, feces can re-contaminate water.

                                                                                                   Watersheds -2-
empirical examination, possibly the first, of the earliest sustained decline in child mortality in

U.S. history. Because we use data from the state that pioneered the collection of U.S. vital

statistics, our data are annual and include large and small municipalities for a period that predates

national mortality statistics. Most important is that we exploit exogenous variation in both

sewerage and water treatments and have information on mortality and cause of death for those

under five years of age. We thus have exogenous variation in both water and sewerage

treatments and examine their complementarity in the production of health using high frequency

and rich mortality data.

      The estimation strategy exploits a mandate originating from the Massachusetts State Board

of Health that all municipalities surrounding Boston join the Metropolitan Sewerage District. 5

We also rely on the fact that infrastructure rollout was based on technocratic considerations (such

as the distance to various outfalls and terrain).6 Unanticipated delays further staggered the

rollout, thus infrastructure completion dates were not very predictable. Because of the negative

externalities associated with upstream dumping of sewage, all municipalities located within the

watershed area of the Boston Harbor were compelled by law to join (and pay for) the sewerage

district. Although each could elect to receive water from the Metropolitan Water District, the

timing of the intervention was beyond the control of any given municipality.

      Our difference-in-differences estimates show that effective sewerage and safe water

systems are complements in the production of child health and their combination was a major

factor contributing to the initial decline in child mortality in U.S. history. Using our preferred

specification, the combination of sewerage and safe water treatments lowered child (under-five)

  See Whipple (1917).

  We provide evidence in Section II B and Appendix Table B1 that intervention completion dates were determined
largely by technical engineering factors, not political issues or health concerns.

                                                                                               Watersheds -3-
mortality by 26.6 log points (out of a 79.2 log point decline), or 33.6 percent. The treatments

lowered infant mortality by 22.8 log points (out of a 47.7 log point decline), or by 48 percent.

Each intervention in isolation had a small positive health effect, but their combination caused a

powerful health improvement. As the financial and political powerhouse of the Commonwealth,

as well as the recipient of much of the downstream waste, Boston initiated the pure water and

sewerage projects. In consequence, we exclude Boston from our analysis.

      A variety of informal tests bolster our main findings about the complementarity of water

and sewerage. These include: (1) that our treatment and control municipalities show minor

baseline differences in infant or child mortality (also in general health determinants or in

outcome variable trends prior to the interventions); (2) a sharp and persistent shift in the

evolution of infant or child mortality with the introduction of the two technologies that is not as

prominent with the introduction of just one; and (3) the robustness of our results to time-varying

municipality-level controls and various trends.

      We provide further support of a causal interpretation by examining age- and cause-specific

mortality (see also Galiani, Gertler and Schargrodsky 2005). Diseases related to the

gastrointestinal system and those that require fecal to oral transmission are heavily affected by

the introduction of the sewerage and safe water interventions in our analysis. However, deaths

from non-waterborne diseases, such as tuberculosis, or among older children and adults, are not.

The age-specific result is relevant because the less than five-year-old population was most likely

to succumb to gastrointestinal disease given their susceptibility to dehydration. In addition, the

infrastructure improvements had larger impacts on children in municipalities that experienced

more rapid population growth and had a higher fraction of certain foreign-born groups.

    II.    Mortality Decline and the Two Treatments: Historical Background

            A. Infant and Child Mortality


          Infant mortality data for the U.S. and Massachusetts start around 1850, no coincidence

given the origins of U.S. vital statistics collection.7 For both series, as shown in Figure 1, the

infant mortality rate (IMR) begins its long-term descent starting in the late nineteenth and early

twentieth centuries. The decrease in the mortality series of children one to five years old in

Massachusetts shows similar trends. We present the Massachusetts data that we construct from

1870 to 1930 because the U.S. data begin in 1900. We refer in this paper to the death rate of

those less than five years as the child mortality rate (CMR).

          Although the Massachusetts IMR series is highly volatile to around 1880, likely due to

epidemics, the infant death rate clearly underwent a watershed event in the late 1890s. The rate

fell from around 163/1,000 (1 in 6.14) in 1896 to 151/1,000 (1 in 6.62) in 1898, and then to

around 91/1,000 (less than 1 in 10) by 1920.8 To understand the initial period of decline, we

focus our analysis of the Massachusetts data from 1880 to 1920. What enabled more babies and

children in the Commonwealth to escape death?

          Several facts from the Massachusetts data provide clues regarding the cause of the initial

decline in the mortality of those under five years. The first is that there was a decrease in the

“urban penalty.” The initial decrease was greater in the more urbanized areas of the

Commonwealth (Appendix Figure B1).9 Another clue is that whatever enabled the youngest

1900 and 1910 U.S. population censuses on ever born and surviving children. See Shattuck (1850) on the
establishment of the Commonwealth’s vital statistics collection.

members of society to survive apparently had little mortality impact on older individuals. Infants

and young children were primarily dying of diarrheal-related illnesses, whereas adults were

succumbing mainly to pulmonary tuberculosis.10

       We focus on a specific group of municipalities that experienced sharp changes to their

water supply and sewerage systems. These cities and towns underwent a larger decrease in both

CMR and IMR than occurred in the entire Commonwealth during our analysis period, 1880 to

1920. These cities and towns also underwent a larger decrease than in comparable urban areas

with no treatment. For example, CMR declined by 62 log points in our full sample of

municipalities but by 79 log points in the 15 municipalities that received both treatments,

compared with a 53 log point decrease in the sample that received no treatment.11

       Our answer to what caused the initial decline in child mortality in Massachusetts is the

radical change in water and sewage disposal and the protection of watersheds that provided purer

water to the greater Boston area. An extensive public water and sewerage project created a large

watershed area from which potable water could flow to homes and in which water would be

protected from potentially polluting sewage that would be piped and pumped into the Boston

Harbor. The area eligible to receive pure water contained more than one-third of the state’s

population at the time, but included only cities and towns within a ten-mile radius of the

Massachusetts State House in Boston. Even though much of the state was not directly affected by

the water project, the Commonwealth in 1886 began to protect all inland waterways and to

employ water engineers who aided its cities and towns.12


          B. The Creation of the Metropolitan Water and Sewerage Districts


        The Boston Metropolitan District had rapidly increasing population density in the post-

Civil War era.13 The immediate impetus behind the creation of the Metropolitan Sewerage

District (MSD) came from complaints among Boston’s wealthier citizens about the stench of

sewage: “The first of a series of hearings was given by the sewerage commission at the City Hall

... it would appear in various parts of the district including most of the finest streets, the stench is

terrible, often causing much sickness” (Boston Medical and Surgical Journal 1875, p. 79).

        The sewage had two main sources. The direct outfalls from Boston dumped into the

Harbor: “As early as 1870, an aggregation of old sewers discharged by about seventy outlets into

tide water, chiefly along the harbor front.”14 The second was that surrounding municipalities

discharged into the Mystic, Charles, and Neponset Rivers, which eventually emptied into the

Harbor. Thus, Boston was the terminus for the region’s sewage. A joint engineering and medical

commission was appointed in 1875 to devise a remedy.

        The report of the 1875 Sewerage of Boston Commission (Chesbrough et al. 1876)

recommended a drainage system for Boston and its surrounding municipalities. Boston City

authorities acted and, from 1877 to 1884, constructed a comprehensive system of sewage

disposal works that discharged into the deep shipping channels off Moon Island (in Quincy Bay,


12
   Infant mortality also declined in Europe in the early twentieth century. In England and Wales the rate remained in
the 150/1,000 range until around 1900 when it decreased to 130 and then to 100 by 1910. See Woods, Watterson and
Woodward (1988, 1989) who discuss the roles of clean water and proper sanitation but not as the major causes.
13
   In 1898 the Metropolitan Sewerage District, with Boston, had 36 percent of the state’s population and 55 percent
of its total assessed valuation, but just 2.5 percent of its land area. The “District” included 23 towns: Arlington,
Belmont, Brookline, Cambridge, Chelsea, Dedham, Everett, Hyde Park (became part of Boston), Lexington,
Malden, Medford, Melrose, Milton, Newton, Quincy, Somerville, Stoneham, Wakefield, Waltham, Watertown,
Winchester, Winthrop, and Woburn (Metropolitan Sewerage Commission of Boston 1899, p. 3).

                                                                                                   Watersheds -7-
Boston Harbor). Attention then shifted to sources of pollution beyond its immediate control,

namely the municipalities of the Neponset, Charles and Mystic River Valleys that comprised the

Harbor’s immediate watershed area.15 But the obvious problems of public works coordination

across municipalities complicated the control of sewage.

        In 1887, the Boston General Court instructed the State Board of Health to revisit the

regional sewerage system for the MSD. The Board was authorized to pick the included

municipalities and to determine how the sewerage system would be constructed.16 The report

divided the District into separate sewerage systems by geographical features. The 1889 Report

(Massachusetts State Board of Health 1889) suggested an additional outfall at Deer Island (near

Winthrop in Boston Harbor) draining the northern Charles River Valley and the Mystic River

Valley and intercepting sewers connecting the southern portion of the Charles River Valley to

the outfall on Moon Island. The Court approved recommendations by the Board to drain the

Neponset River Valley with a separate outfall off Nut Island (in Quincy Bay) in 1895 (Map 1).

        As mentioned above, completion dates were determined mainly by engineering

considerations. Unanticipated delays further staggered the rollout. The engineers considered the

proximity of the municipalities to the harbor (which was the location of the three major outlets)

as well as elevation. A Cox hazard model (Appendix Table B1) demonstrates that the timing of

water and sewerage interventions was strongly affected by geographic features and not

influenced significantly by pretreatment demographic characteristics of the municipality. The



15
   In addition to the immediate Harbor watershed area of the Charles, Mystic and Neponset River Valleys, the
Commonwealth paid for sewerage infrastructure in the towns of Clinton and Marlborough. Both are included in our
main analytical sample but are dropped, and moved to control municipalities in robustness checks (see Table 5 and
Appendix Table B3).
16
   The General Court of Massachusetts resolved that the engineers appointed to the Sewerage Commission were to
“designate the cities and towns...which shall be tributary to and embraced by the district” and “determine and show,
by suitable plans and maps, such trunk lines and main branches as it shall recommend to be constructed, with outlet”
(Massachusetts State Board of Health 1889, p. 3–4).

                                                                                                  Watersheds -8-
analysis provides further evidence that technocratic considerations, rather than immediate need,

were paramount. The construction teams encountered numerous challenges, including quicksand

and boulders, further delaying the completion of specific lines in an idiosyncratic manner.17

        Coincidental with the construction of a regional sewerage district, Massachusetts took

several steps to ensure a safe water supply. The “Act Relative to the Pollution of Rivers,

Streams and Ponds Used as Sources of Water Supply,” passed in 1878, forbade persons and

corporations from dumping human excrement or effluent into any pond, river or stream used as a

source of water supply (Secretary of the Commonwealth 1878, p. 133). But three of the most

polluted rivers—the Merrimack, Connecticut and Concord Rivers—were exempt from the law.

They were heavily used by industry and manufacturers objected to their protection.

        In 1886, the General Court extended the State Board of Health oversight of all inland

bodies of water and directed the Board to offer advice to municipalities on water and sewerage

and to employ engineers to aid the process. The Board was reorganized that year, and Hiram

Mills, a hydraulic engineer, became chair of the Committee on Water Control and Sewerage. A

resident of Lawrence, Mills established the Lawrence Experiment Station to test the filtration of

tainted water, the first in the nation. Mills persuaded Lawrence to adopt a sand filter since its

water supply was taken from the heavily polluted Merrimack River.18




17
   Timing to sewerage and water are modeled separately since distinct engineering factors affected each. Time to the
interaction is difficult to model since many geographic considerations may have differentially impacted the
infrastructure timing. The Charles River System, begun in May 1890, was completed in spring 1892 despite
“difficulties.” It was the fastest to complete since it was an extension of the extant Boston system. The North
Metropolitan System began the same time as the Charles River System but “was slower in progress and much later
in its completion” since it required a new pumping station and other engineering challenges. The Neponset Valley
System was mainly completed in 1897. The High-level System was still in progress in 1899 (Metropolitan Sewerage
Commission of Boston 1899, p. 15).
18
   See Whipple (1917), chap. 4 on the reorganization of the Board. Regarding the Lawrence filter, it has been
pointed out that: “The plans were not furnished by the Board, but by Mr. Hiram F. Mills [who] gave his services to
the city and received no compensation for them … He was Chief Engineer of the Essex Company [which] had
created Lawrence …” (American Society of Civil Engineers 1901, p. 319).

                                                                                                  Watersheds -9-
       In general, however, the State Board of Health eschewed filtration techniques for water

purification, instead preferring that the water be derived from impounding reservoirs in which

spring floodwaters were stored. The storage process clarified the water and killed off bacteria,

which eventually starved or burst. The distinctive Massachusetts methods for providing pure

water would soon be contrasted to those of other cities that, in the early twentieth century, began

using the new filtration and chlorination techniques.

         Because of the safe water strategy that Massachusetts adopted, population growth posed a

serious threat to the water supply because growth inevitably led to encroachment on watersheds.

The concern led to the passage of an act by the General Court in 1893 that paved the way for the

creation of the Metropolitan Water District (MWD).19

         In 1895, the Board of Health recommended the creation of reservoirs in Sudbury and

Wachusett by taking water from the South Branch of the Nashua River and flooding the town of

West Boylston (Whipple 1917). Large aqueducts would bring fresh water to a renovated

Chestnut Hill Pumping Station where it would be distributed through newly constructed iron

main lines to municipalities in the MWD (Map 2). Construction on the waterworks began soon

after and water started to flow to municipalities in January 1898.

         Evidence that water quality improved after the intervention comes from a report of the

Metropolitan Water Board. Bacteria, fungi and other parasites were reduced from 351 per cubic

centimeter in 1897 before the intervention to 192 per cubic centimeter in 1899.20 Similar

observations came from the Lawrence filter. The average number of bacterial counts per cubic



19
   The Act stated: “The state board of health is hereby authorized and directed to investigate, consider and report
upon the question of a water supply for the city of Boston and its suburbs within a radius of ten miles from the state
house, and for such other cities and municipalities as in its opinion should be included in connection therewith”
(Secretary of the Commonwealth 1893, p. 761). Before the establishment of the MWD, many sources (including
lakes, ponds, private wells and reservoirs) supplied water to the municipalities and their residents.

interventions responsible for the initial decline in child mortality in Massachusetts?



III.    Estimating Equations and Empirical Results


        A. Empirical Strategy


       Our empirical analysis exploits the plausibly exogenous timing and geographic penetration

of safe water and sewerage interventions. We assume that child mortality in municipalities with

differentially timed access to clean water and sewerage would have evolved similarly in the

absence of the interventions. The validity of that assumption is assessed below.

       We use a difference-in-differences framework to estimate the impact of these interventions

on population health. Specifically, we estimate:

 log(𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒)𝑖𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝜃𝑊𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑡 + 𝜇𝑆𝑒𝑤𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑖𝑡 + 𝛾(𝑊𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 ∙ 𝑆𝑒𝑤𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒)𝑖𝑡 + Ω𝑋𝑖𝑡 + 𝛿𝑡 +

   𝜋𝑖 + 𝜋𝑖 ∙ 𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡                                                                     eq. (1)

where i is municipality and t is year. Water and Sewerage are dummy variables indicating if a

municipality had adopted the safe water (Water) and/or sewerage (Sewerage) intervention by

year t. The interaction of safe water and sewerage assesses whether infrastructure investments

are complements or substitutes. The coefficients are difference-in-differences estimates of the

impact of the interventions on the outcome, and the sum is the combined effect of the

interventions, conditional on municipality and time fixed effects, municipality-specific time

trends and a vector (X) of time- and municipality-varying demographic controls including (the

log of) population density, percentage foreign-born, percentage male and the percentage of

females employed in manufacturing. The latter variable might be important if mothers who work


                                                                                    Watersheds -11-
in factories are less likely to breastfeed and if breastfed infants are less likely to be exposed or

succumb to diarrheal illness. In robustness tests, we include county-level time-varying

covariates, such as dairy milk quality and a vector of dichotomous county-year fixed effects.

       The main outcome of interest is the (log) under-five mortality rate, although we also

explore mortality rates at other ages (under-one, under-two and over-five) and cause-specific

mortality rates. The log outcome is preferred since a linear-in-levels specification constrains the

mortality rate to decrease by the same amount each year across municipalities. Standard errors

are clustered at the municipality level throughout the analysis since the water and sewerage

treatments were at the municipality level. There are 60 clusters in our main analysis sample and

we describe their selection below.

       The results from our analysis of eq. (1) will show that the combination of safe water and

sewage removal was an effective intervention for reducing child mortality. Each intervention

separately had much smaller effects. We augment the main estimating equation by including a

series of leads and lags:

                      log(𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒)𝑖𝑡 = + ∑ 𝜃𝑘 𝑊𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑘 + ∑ 𝜇𝑘 𝑆𝑒𝑤𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑖𝑘 + ∑ 𝛾𝑘 (𝑊𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑘 ∙

                          𝑆𝑒𝑤𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑖𝑘 ) + Ω𝑋𝑖𝑡 + 𝛿𝑡 + 𝜋𝑖 + 𝜋𝑖 ∙ 𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡                                eq. (2)

where 𝑘 is event time and spans the entire range of our 41-year analysis period. We group event

time into two-year bins surrounding the year immediately prior to the intervention.21 That is, we

include dummy variables for whether the sewerage, water, or their interaction (meaning both

sewerage and water) will take effect in (or have been in effect for) 0 to 1 years, 2 to 3 years, and

so on. Leads and lags before and after nine years are coded as separate groups. The two-year bins




21
  We use the year prior to the connection as our reference period since municipalities were partially treated in the
year of the connection. We thank an anonymous referee for the suggestion.

                                                                                                   Watersheds -12-
improve the precision of the estimates by increasing the number of observations used to estimate

the lead and lag coefficients.

       The intervention municipalities are represented in both the pre- and post-intervention

period and the analysis period is well balanced in terms of the number of treatment and control

observations for all event years except the two extreme tails.22 The coefficients from eq. (2) give

the dynamic response to the introduction of safe water and sewerage, and their combination.23


         B. Intervention Dates and Sources


       The dates of water and sewerage interventions are crucial to our empirical strategy. The

treatment dates we use are when the main water and sewerage lines were completed for a given

municipality rather than when homes and areas were linked to the system. In the case of water,

the two dates were largely coterminous. But that was not the case for sewerage, which we will

also soon discuss. The strategy we use circumvents various endogeneity concerns, and it is

supported by our event studies demonstrating that the effects of only water or sewerage did not

have significant lagged effects.

       We obtained the intervention dates mainly from annual reports of the State Board of

Health, the Metropolitan Sewerage Commission, the Metropolitan Water District (MWD) and

the Metropolitan Water and Sewerage Board. We code a municipality as treated if a main



22
   There are 30 observations in each two-year binned time to both sewerage and water that take the value of one, 50
in time to sewer, and 38 in time to water. Control municipalities (those that do not receive either intervention) are
placed at -1 event time (i.e., the reference year). There are three observations for which the log of the outcome is
missing in a year (Weston 1904 and 1917 and Nahant 1898). Weston is a control municipality. Because Nahant is an
intervention municipality (and has a small population), we combine Nahant with Swampscott, which is adjacent to it
and received the water intervention on the same date.
23
   In Appendix Figure B7 Panel A we extend the bins from 10 to 12 years before the intervention and from 10 to 16
years after the intervention, the limit of balanced event time. The patterns are similar to those provided in Figure 2
though the estimates, particularly in the earliest years of the analysis period, when smallpox and other vaccine-
preventable disease epidemics afflicted various areas of the Commonwealth, are noisier.

                                                                                                  Watersheds -13-
sewerage or water pipe was linked to the municipality from the Metropolitan System or if a local

innovation was adopted at the request and expense of the Board of Health (see Appendix Table

A1 for the dates).24

       None of our control municipalities is a pure control since attempts were made to improve

water and sanitation across the Commonwealth. If these efforts were successful, our estimates

would be biased towards the null. But we have found limited evidence that water quality was

greatly improved elsewhere except for Lawrence, which is part of the treatment group. Another

instance was Springfield, which used water from the Ludlow Reservoir until 1910 when the

water was deemed low quality and then switched to using the Little River.25 Control towns on

the Connecticut River struggled to find clean water in other waterways and create reservoirs, but

they lacked the coordination provided by the Board of Health in the Boston Metropolitan Area.

       Municipality-level data on births are drawn from annual vital statistics registration reports

of births, marriages, and deaths (Secretary of the Commonwealth 1870-1920).26 Although the

annual reports prior to 1891 included deaths by age category for every municipality, between

1891 and 1897 the data was published at the county level only. But the cost-cutting decision was

later reversed and after 1897 deaths by age were reported for all counties and cities.27

       To establish a consistent measure of child mortality for our sample of municipalities during

our analysis time period, we created a data set of child deaths from FamilySearch.org, which is a


24
   We consider three additional local interventions: the 1893 placement of a filter in Lawrence, the permission to
take water from sources protected by the MWD (for Worcester in 1903 and Malden in 1904) and financing of
sewerage infrastructure in Marlborough and Clinton because their effluent was a contaminant of the municipal
water. In the Appendix, we drop Lawrence, Marlborough and Clinton to assess robustness. We also add them to the
control group in another robustness check. These alternative approaches do not alter our main results.
25
   In robustness checks, we move Springfield to the treatment sample though the decision to switch sources was
endogenous to that municipality.
26
   The Commonwealth tried to exclude stillbirths from the counts of births and deaths but the concept of a stillbirth
was ill defined. As late as 1915, the ambiguity was still unresolved: “Apparently, there is no precise definition of a
stillbirth which the physicians or midwives are required to observe” (Secretary of the Commonwealth 1915, p. 18).
27
   Reporting was for incorporated cities with populations exceeding about 12,000 in 1895.

                                                                                                   Watersheds -14-
typescript of most information contained in the death records.28 The same death certificates and

death registries at the municipality level are the basis of both the Secretary of the

Commonwealth’s Reports and the FamilySearch.org compilation.29 The source includes deaths

of young children for (almost) every year and for every municipality in our main sample.

Stillbirths and early infant deaths were not reliably distinguished.30 In compiling births, the

Secretary of Commonwealth data tried to exclude stillbirths, whereas the FamilySearch.org data

does not. To harmonize the two data sources, we chose to include stillbirths in both the

numerator and denominator, since the definition was fluid during our period. Therefore, we add

stillbirths to the official birth data. To construct the under-five population, we subtract lagged

deaths at infancy and other early ages from lagged births (Data Appendix). In our robustness

tests, we normalize under-five deaths by total population (Appendix Table B4).31

       We also entered cause of death and grouped causes into major disease categories (such as

ailments afflicting the gastrointestinal versus the respiratory system and tuberculosis). These data

allow us to probe whether deaths that a priori would be more responsive to sewerage and water

interventions due to fecal-oral transmission declined more than deaths from communicable

disease transmitted via alternative routes (i.e., respiratory droplets in tuberculosis). Graphs of the

category of death data and deaths by age are in Appendix Figures B2 to B5.

       Given the importance of clean milk for the health of babies and its role in the literature on



28
   Appendix C contains the search algorithm and the correlation between death rates from the vital registration
reports and FamilySearch.org when overlap exists. In the handful of instances when pages from registration pages
were missing from FamilySearch.org we checked Ancestry.org and occasionally could fill in missing values.
29
   Our definition of an infant death is that the death and birth years are the same. FamilySearch.org data list an infant
death with the actual death date but give the birth year as the same as the death year if the infant was less than one
year at death, even if the infant was born in the previous year. Therefore, we use the year at death, not birth.
30
   The concept of a live birth evolved over time. The common practice for our period was to count deaths of pre-
term fetuses as miscarriages and of fetuses more than seven months’ gestation as stillbirths. Many infant deaths that
were categorized as stillbirths would have been live births that died during delivery.
31
   Results are also robust to normalizing under-five deaths by total births.

                                                                                                     Watersheds -15-
IMR, we include data on the fraction of dairies at the municipality level that passed State Board

of Health inspection.32 The policy to inspect dairies and their milk started in 1905 and lasted

until 1914 when the inspection authority devolved to the municipality level. For Suffolk County,

milk was transported by refrigerated trains and tested for bacteria on arrival, in transit and at

stores. We define the milk market at the county level and define milk purity the percentage of

dairies that passed inspection and the percentage of tested milk relatively free from bacteria.

       The impact of lead water pipe materials, shown to be of importance to IMR in Clay et al.

(2014), is incorporated by using a cross section from 1897 of pipe materials by municipality.33

Time-varying demographic features of municipalities, such as the percentage foreign-born, age

and sex distribution, and percentage of females employed in manufacturing, are obtained from

state and federal censuses, linearly interpolated every five years between censuses (Appendix A).

       Our main sample is a panel of 60 Commonwealth municipalities (excluding Boston) from

1880 to 1920. The sample contains all municipalities within the immediate Harbor watershed

area (about 12.5 miles from the Massachusetts State House) as well as municipalities outside the

immediate Boston area that were incorporated cities as of 1895.34 To this list, we add two coastal

municipalities (Ipswich and Weymouth) and five (Attleboro, Clinton, Milford, Natick and

Peabody) with the largest 1880 populations among those that did not meet the other criteria.

       In Map 3 we shade municipalities in the Boston Metropolitan Area by whether they

received water (hatched), sewerage (cross-hatched), both (grey) and neither (white). Control

municipalities are all in the Commonwealth since Massachusetts was unique in its early

   Data are mainly from Annual Report of the State Board of Health (Massachusetts State Board of Health 1905–15).
We also used reports from the Health Department of the City of Boston (1905–15).

   Because time-varying data on lead pipes are not available, we test the robustness of our results to the inclusion of
lead pipe status as of 1897. We find few differences.
34
   All sample municipalities are in Massachusetts because of its early vital statistics records. The Boston
metropolitan area is frequently described as including all municipalities within ten miles of the State House, but the
sewerage district extended to those as far as 12.5 miles.

were exposed to other statewide Board of Health regulations, mentioned previously, that

protected inland water.


         C. Results


                  1. Main results


       We first test whether there were preexisting differences in infant and child mortality, as

well as other demographic variables, between municipalities that would eventually receive a safe

water and sewerage treatment and those that would not. That is, we examine whether eventual

participation in safe water, sewerage or both interventions is correlated with covariates in 1880

and changes in our mortality measures of interest before the interventions were formally

announced.35 Table 1 presents these results.

       The first column of Table 1 gives the mean health and demographic characteristics across

the main sample. Col. (2) presents differences between municipalities that improved water

without the sewerage treatment and those that did neither. Col. (3) repeats the exercise for

sewerage and col. (4) gives the difference between municipalities that received both treatments

versus neither. The last three columns (5 to 7) give differences between the treatment groups.

       The results from rows (1) to (8) demonstrate that there are few highly significant baseline

differences in demographics, the number of neighboring municipalities, and infant and child

mortality across the intervention groups in 1880. Because some of the cities and towns outside



35
  This method is a reasonable way to assess baseline differences between groups, but it may not be fully consistent
with the definitions of treatment and control that we exploit since the regressions utilize both geographic and time
variation in the rollout of the interventions. Nevertheless, large differences between the groups at baseline or in the
years leading up to the interventions would be of concern. Two control municipalities (Westwood and Wellesley)
were incorporated as towns shortly after 1880 and are therefore not in our baseline period.

                                                                                                    Watersheds -17-
the Boston metropolitan area were manufacturing hubs, the percentage of women employed in

manufacturing was generally lower in the municipalities that received infrastructure

interventions (Table 1, row 4) and the percentage foreign was 5.3 percentage points higher in

municipalities that only received sewerage versus those that received both in the first year of the

analysis (27.6 versus 22.3 percent). However, directly adding the percentage of females working

in manufacturing or the percentage foreign-born as a control or dropping the untreated group

from the analysis (thus using only variation in the timing of interventions) does not significantly

change our estimates, suggesting that baseline differences do not bias our results.

      In the last two rows, we assess for differences in infant and child mortality rates between

groups of municipalities that eventually received one or more interventions using data from 1880

and 1889, the year the State Board of Health issued its report on a sewerage system for the

Charles and Mystic River Valleys. Note that in the nine years prior to the interventions, the

change in mortality rates was modest. In addition, whether a municipality eventually received

safe water, sewerage, or both is not significantly correlated with the changing mortality pattern

of young children prior to when the interventions were rolled out.

      Our baseline estimates of the impact of the sewerage and water interventions, from

estimating eq. (1), are presented in Table 2 Panel A for the 60 control and treatment cities and

towns. The regressions are unweighted and contain municipality and year fixed effects, as well

as municipality-specific linear trends and demographic controls, in every specification. By not

weighting we are considering each city or town to be a separate experiment. We prefer this

approach and directly model heterogeneity by population growth, a potential contaminant for the

watershed areas, in Section II B (Table 3, Panel B).




                                                                                      Watersheds -18-
       Cols. (1) and (2) test whether the water or sewerage intervention had a significant impact

on child mortality. These regressions provide estimates of the impact of one of the interventions

neglecting the role of the other. The results suggest that the introduction of water (ignoring the

role of sewerage) reduced child mortality by 12.6 log points and the introduction of sewerage

(ignoring the role of water) reduced it by 12.3 log points. In col. (3) we include both safe water

and sewerage. Each estimate has the expected sign, but only sewerage is significant. Sewerage

and water (in col. 4) taken together are economically and statistically significant. These

regressions do not include the separate main effects and thereby consider the full treatment as the

combination of sewerage and safe water (as in a fixed proportions production function).

       We next test whether the two interventions are complements or substitutes by adding the

interaction of the two in col. (5). By including the main effects with the interaction term, the

coefficient on water identifies the effect of having only water (similarly only sewerage), whereas

the interaction tests if the two are complements or substitutes. The sum of the difference-in-

differences coefficients reflects the full effect of implementing water and sewerage interventions.

       Our evidence points to a strong complementarity between the two interventions and

indicates their combined effect reduced child mortality by 26.6 log points (and that much of the

reduction is driven by the interaction term).36 In Appendix Table B2, we repeat the analysis

focusing exclusively on infant and under-two mortality. The results obtained are similar.37




36
   Our preferred estimation includes linear trends. We also report robustness to dropping such trends in Appendix
Table B3 and map out the dynamic response without trends in Appendix Figure B7 Panel B. Adding the main
effects to the interaction in col. (5) does not change the coefficient on the interaction significantly, but does alter the
main effects (without significantly increasing their standard errors). We interpret this as evidence that the interaction
is the primary driver of the mortality reductions, though we would caution against the interpretation that the main
interventions held no individual benefits, since even the “control” municipalities in our sample were receiving
advice on water use and sewage control from the State Board of Health and there is some evidence that sewage
control alone is important for child survival.
37
   The standard error of the combined effect increases somewhat.

                                                                                                       Watersheds -19-
       Figure 2 uses eq. (2) to map out the dynamic response to the introduction of the

combination of the safe water and sewerage interventions. Panel A plots coefficients from a

single regression. The outcome variable is the log of the child mortality rate. The graph on the

left plots the event study coefficients on water, the middle graph plots sewerage coefficients, and

that on the right plots the full effect of the interventions by adding together the coefficients on

water, sewerage and the interaction. Panel B also plots the total combined effect of the

interventions for three different outcomes: the graph on the left plots the event-study coefficients

for (log) seasonal mortality (spring and summer), the middle plots the same for (log)

gastrointestinal mortality and the graph on the right plots the coefficients for a placebo outcome,

the (log) mortality rate for those five years and older.38

       All six of the event studies demonstrate that in the years preceding the intervention,

conditions were neither systematically getting worse nor were they getting better. Comparing

across the event studies in Panel A demonstrates that water alone did not have an appreciable

effect on child mortality, sewerage had a small effect, and the combination produced a rapid

decline. The set of figures also weakens the notion that a lagged effect of sewerage or water

could be driving the main results. The results in Panel B indicate that the combination of

interventions led to an immediate and persistent decrease in gastrointestinal and spring-summer

mortality. The effects, moreover, increased with time probably due to the spread of sewerage

connections within the treated municipalities. The connection to safe water was more immediate.

       Each of the municipalities was required to own their water pipes before the water




38
  Twenty-one additional event studies are included in the appendix: Figure B6 includes category-specific outcomes
(seasonal and gastrointestinal mortality among under-five children), mortality at other ages and the placebo outcome
of non-child mortality. Figure B7 Panel A includes additional lead and lag periods and Figure B7 Panel B omits
municipality linear trends.

intervention.39 When the new source was available, water could immediately flow into

residences. In fact, after the water was available the Metropolitan Water Board was alarmed by

what they saw as rampant wastage, and their concern prompted the installation of water meters.

Regarding sewerage, however, after the main trunk lines were connected to the outfalls in the

Harbor, branching lines within the municipality and some separate residences had to be

connected. Although there was an immediate jump in the miles of local sewerage connected to

the District (Appendix Figure B8), connections continued to increase as more neighborhoods

were “drained.” The need for connections within municipalities could account for the increased

beneficial effect of the sewerage and combined treatment with time.

       Thus, the time pattern of change we show in Figure 2 accords well with the historical

information about the safe water and sewerage projects and with the time course of disease.

Since diarrhea is an acute disease, interventions that protect children from transmission should

translate into a swift decline in mortality.

       In Table 2 Panel B we report results obtained using variations in our baseline specification.

These alternative specifications vary by column heading. We assess the robustness of our results

to county-year fixed effects (col. 6), the use of a count model (col. 7) and a linear-in-levels

model specification both weighted (col. 8) and unweighted (col. 9). The results presented in

Panel B are generally consistent with those reported in Panel A, and demonstrate the failure of a

piecemeal approach to infrastructure improvements. Weighting by the under-five population

attenuates our results; though as we show in Table 3 this is likely due to smaller municipalities




39
   By law, municipalities had to own their water pipes, or purchase them from private providers if they did not
already own them, to receive water from the MWD.

with higher population growth rates benefitting more from the combination of interventions.40


                 2. Channels


       How were young children affected by potentially contaminated water and why did they

benefit so greatly from both safe water and sewerage interventions? Most babies were not

exclusively breastfed throughout but were, instead, often fed a gruel that contained water as were

toddlers. Detailed information on breastfeeding practices from the extensive Children’s Bureau

Bulletins of the late 1910s and early 1920s shows that around half of all surviving infants were

exclusively breastfed at six months, about a quarter were wholly bottle fed at six months and the

rest were nurtured by a combination of the two methods (U.S. Department of Labor, Children’s

Bureau 1923).41 Women in low-income families who worked outside the home were less likely

to breastfeed, although differences in breastfeeding practices by family income were not large.

Furthermore, some women were not able to breastfeed independent of family income.

       Even for women who did breastfeed, it was a common practice, later condoned and

recommended by the Children’s Bureau, to feed infants water. The advice often came with the

admonition to boil water, but that was not always the case. “When the baby cries between

feedings [at the breast] give him pure, warmed water without anything in it. Then let him alone”

(U.S. Department of Labor, Children’s Bureau 1914, p. 50).42 Even if babies were not


40
   In addition, weighting by population can cause a populous outlier municipality to have undue influence on the
results. See Appendix Figure B9.
41
   See Apple (1997), table 9.1. Because babies who were not exclusively breastfed died at higher rates than those
who were, the fraction of survivors breastfed at six months overstates the fraction breastfed had none died. The
Children’s Bureau surveys were done in the late 1910s but the sources in Apple (1997) and Wolf (2001) reveal
similar breastfeeding percentages for earlier decades. Among the reasons offered by Wolf (p. 10) for low
breastfeeding rates is that American women began to rely on artificial formulas before inexpensive ones were
marketed. Although the reasons offered are not fully satisfactory, the decline of breastfeeding seems sound.
42
   Also, “Feed the baby one part milk and two parts water during the first month … During the second and third
months use one part milk and one part water … After the fourth month give two parts milk and one part water (U.S.
Department of Labor, Children’s Bureau 1914, p. 51).

                                                                                               Watersheds -22-
deliberately given water, they were bathed in water that may have been polluted. Finally, flies

landing on feces could have spread disease to milk or gruel that was fed to young children.

          Evidence presented in Table 3 on deaths by season and disease category bolsters the claim

that the water and sewerage interventions greatly reduced gastrointestinal disease and improved

the survival of children. The table begins with seasonal mortality since the prevalence of

gastrointestinal disease increases in warmer months due to spoilage and flies, and the mortality

rate conditional on infection rises as children more easily succumb to dehydration.43 We find that

the full effect of water and sewerage reduced deaths during the warmer months by 6.7 per 1,000

under-five population as compared to fall-winter mortality by 5.1 per 1,000 under-five

population. In cols. (3) and (4) we find that the full effect was greater for gastrointestinal

mortality (4.4 per 1,000) than for respiratory mortality exclusive of tuberculosis (1.8 per 1,000).

          In cols. (5) and (6) we find no significant effect of the interventions on tuberculosis or on

the non-child mortality rate. Tuberculosis is generally transmitted through airborne droplets and

should be less affected by water and sewerage interventions, though contaminated dairy products

might have played a role in transmission during this period. Given that the overwhelming cause

of death for adults at the time was pulmonary tuberculosis, we view these findings as supportive

of the notion that the channel by which safe water and sewerage interventions improved child

survival was by greatly reducing deaths from diseases affecting the gastrointestinal system.


                     3.   Heterogeneous Effects


          We investigate whether the impact of the infrastructure improvements depended on the

percentage of foreign-born by municipality. We divide municipalities by the median percentage



43
     We revert to a level specification since some of the categories (i.e., tuberculosis among children) have few deaths.

                                                                                                      Watersheds -23-
of various demographic groups in 1880 (the last U.S. census before the interventions). Using the

period prior to interventions obviates concerns about endogenous migration response to the

interventions (though Table 4 fails to demonstrate any significant migration response).

      Our findings, presented in Table 3 Panel B demonstrate that the full effects of water and

sewerage had a significant effect on the mortality of children in certain municipalities. As

alluded to above in the discussion of weighting, we find effects of the interventions are largest

and only statistically significant for municipalities that experienced the most rapid population

growth during the analysis period (cols. 1 and 2). Municipalities with more foreign-born

residents, especially those who lived in crowded and squalid conditions, would have had the

most to gain from sewage removal and clean water interventions. But political economy

considerations could have led the foreign-born enclaves to be excluded from the expansion of

sewerage connections. But when we decompose the foreign population by major ethnic groups,

we find that sewerage and water combined led to a 35.5 log point decline in child mortality for

municipalities with more Irish-born inhabitants. These effects are much larger than are those for

places with more foreign-born of British descent (full effect of 15.8 log points) and larger than

places with fewer Irish, suggesting that a socially and economically marginalized group in the

Boston area gained disproportionately from the public health investments.

      We have presented evidence bolstering the notion that clean water and sewerage

interventions together greatly reduced child mortality. But could the interventions have not

directly improved health but, instead, changed the composition of the population? Higher income

persons and the health conscious could have migrated to less odiferous and clean water places.

      To examine the possibility of a composition effect we modify eq. (1) and replace mortality

rates with the percentage of the population that meets some demographic criteria. The analysis,



                                                                                   Watersheds -24-
given in Table 4 cols. (1) through (6), is estimated on a limited sample due to the availability of

the dependent variable only in the quinquennial state and decennial federal censuses.

Nevertheless, the results point in the direction that compositional changes are not a major

explanation for our findings. An unusual exception is the positive correlation between the

variation in the sewerage intervention and the percentage Irish.

       Another possibility is that changes in child mortality led to a decline in fertility or to

migration. But we find no migration response to the interventions (col. 7). At the annual level,

there does not appear to have been an immediate fertility response to the combination of the

interventions in the general population (Table 4, col. 8), consistent with a fairly stable fertility

rate for the period (Haines 1998b).44 There is, moreover, no statistically significant correlation

between foreign births and the rollout of the interventions (col. 9).


                  4. Robustness


       We assess the robustness of our results in Table 5 and Appendix Table B3 to adding

further time-varying municipality-level controls, using different samples, changing the mode of

statistical inference, and removing or adding various trends. We begin, in Table 5 col. (1), by

adding a proxy for milk supply quality at the county level. Milk quality is measured imprecisely

and does not reach statistical significance. In col. (2) we control for the percentage of females

who were illiterate since maternal education is known to be a strong predictor of child survival.

But inclusion of the variable does not change the relevant point estimates.45

       We also assess whether our results are driven by externalities among municipalities by


44
   Infant survival and fertility are negatively correlated in developing countries today. Haines (1998b) notes that
fertility in Massachusetts “had leveled off by the 1870s whereas the infant mortality rate did not commence its
decline until the 1890s … but the birth rate then remained quite stable from the 1890s until the early 1920s, at which
point fertility recommenced its decline until 1960” (p. 238).
45
   Literacy is a poor predictor since most people had basic literacy in some language.

                                                                                                  Watersheds -25-
including the share of neighboring municipalities with either sewerage or water interventions

(those with both contribute to each separately). We find that controlling for spillover effects has

no meaningful impact on the main results concerning the impact of pure water and sewerage for

a given municipality.46

       We next check the robustness of our results to varying the sample in ways that are

meaningful to how it was selected. In col. (4) we use only municipalities that eventually received

at least one intervention, thus exploiting variation in time to the intervention only. The estimate

of the combined effect is almost identical to that for the full sample, though with a somewhat

larger standard error. In col. (5) we exclude three municipalities: Lawrence (which had a filter),

and Marlborough and Clinton (whose sewerage systems were financed by the state). In col. (6)

we move the three municipalities to the control category. In both cases, the estimates of the

combined effect are relatively unchanged (25.9 and 25.0 log point decline in mortality) and

remain significant. In the last column of Table 5, we consider Springfield as a treatment

municipality because it improved its water supply during our analysis period. Changing the

sample in these ways has little effect on our results.

       In Appendix Table B3, we use standard errors that correct for: (col. 1) spatial correlation,

and (col. 2) a small number of clusters. The combined effect of water and sewerage remains

highly significant. In the last set of robustness checks, we vary the included trends. In col. (3) we

add quadratic trends, in col. (4) intervention-specific linear trends, in (col. 5) we add breaks in

trends by intervention date, in col. (6) we include trends by baseline demographic features of the

municipality as well as distance from the State House, and in (col. 7) we exclude all trends.



46
  In addition, we examined whether the combination of interventions by municipality is picking up the effect of
upstream sewerage interventions. We find the combined effect in this specification (not shown) to be of similar
magnitude (-0.250; s.e. 0.098). We thank an anonymous referee for the suggestion.

                                                                                                Watersheds -26-
These robustness checks provide further support for the notion that municipalities were not

chosen based on patterns of survival of their youngest residents and are not particularly sensitive

to various samples or specifications.



     III. Concluding Remarks


       We find robust evidence that the pure water and sewerage treatments pioneered by far-

sighted public servants and engineers in the Commonwealth saved the lives of many infants and

young children. These interventions must also have improved the health of and enhanced the

quality of life for the citizens of the Greater Boston area even if they did not greatly reduce the

non-child death rate.47

       Using our preferred specification, the combination of sewerage and safe water together

lowered the child mortality rate by 26.6 log points or 33.6 percent of the total change in

treatment municipalities. The combination also lowered the infant mortality rate by 22.8 log

points or 48 percent of the total change in treatment municipalities, which is close to the 47

percent estimate from Cutler and Miller (2005) in their study of filtration and chlorination for a

somewhat later period across 13 U.S. cities.

         Can we say that the benefits from the treatments were worth the cost? The question is a

difficult one since there were many benefits and we focus on just one. If the only benefit was the

reduction in child mortality, what was the cost of an averted death? We answer the question

using data for 1910, about in the middle of the treatment period we consider. We produce



47
  These benefits came at a high future cost. The dumping of generally raw sewage into the Boston Harbor led it to
be known, by the 1970s, as the “dirtiest harbor in America.” A cleanup and the installation of a multi-billion-dollar
sewage treatment facility on Deer Island changed its designation to the cleanest Harbor in America and a “great
American jewel.” http://www.mwra.state.ma.us/01news/2008/bhpenvironentalsuccess/bhpenvsuccess.htm

                                                                                                   Watersheds -27-
hypothetical child deaths as of 1910 in the 15 municipalities (excluding Boston) that received

both water and sewerage treatments.

         In 1910, there were 36,801 children less than five years in these municipalities, and the

deaths of 440 were averted in that year by the treatments. What about the cost? Since the benefit

(averted deaths) is on an annual basis, the cost must be. We consider the cost only for the

sewerage system since it was imposed on the municipalities. The total sewerage assessment for

the 15 municipalities in 1910, which was to cover the interest and sinking fund on the project

plus maintenance, was around $300K.48 Therefore, each death prevented per year came at a cost

of $682, about equal to the annual earnings of a manufacturing worker.

       But there were a great many other benefits from the projects. Illness must have declined for

all and the quality of life was improved. In fact, the “stench” was what first sparked public

activism to rid Boston of the sewage. The water project was also an expense, but it alone had

little impact on child mortality and the creation of the watershed area was completely dependent

on the removal of effluent. All towns had a water supply before the watershed project but in

many cases the water was of questionable purity because of sewage.

       The answer we have offered for the first decline in child mortality differs from that of

many contemporary observers in the early twentieth century, and some who have contributed to

the literature on the historical decline for the U.S. and Europe.49 Yet a spate of research in



48
   Metropolitan Water and Sewerage Board, Tenth Annual Report (1911), p. 52–53. Since there were around 337K
people in these 15 towns in 1910, the annual cost per person was $0.89. Note that the impact on Boston is not
considered.
49
   It is our sense that contemporary U.S. observers writing around 1915 correctly deduced that many babies were
dying because of impure milk, and that their written works influenced a more recent literature. By the early
twentieth century the initial decline in infant mortality we describe, that was largely due to clean water and effective
sewerage systems, had already taken place. Lee (2007), for example, stresses the role of clean milk but not clean
water and sanitation. Condran and Lentzner (2004) conclude that many factors were at work and Cheney (1984) puts
the greatest weight on clean milk and the work of the Child Hygiene Bureau. Woods, Watterson and Woodward
(1988, 1989) in their informative work on Britain mention clean water but emphasize clean milk. On the prominence

                                                                                                    Watersheds -28-
economics has focused on clean water technologies and their influence on public health,

particularly typhoid mortality.

       The lessons from our historical study are clear. Without proper disposal of fecal material,

the benefits of clean water technologies for the health of children are limited. Although the

management of diarrheal illness has improved greatly since the early twentieth century, clean

water and sanitation still pose daunting global challenges. According to UNICEF (2014) more

than 700 million people lack ready access to improved sources of drinking water and some 2.5

billion people do not have an improved sanitation facility. Each day, an estimated 3,000 children

under five years of age die because of diarrheal disease and millions of school days are lost.

Further, chronic exposure to fecal pathogens may lead to inflammatory changes in the gut that

preclude the absorption of essential nutrients and that stunt height, retard cognitive development

and increase susceptibility to other diseases (Korpe and Petri 2012; Yu et al. 2016).50

       Although health challenges in late nineteenth century U.S. cities were similar to those in

modern day developing nation cities, there are important differences. The clean water technology

we investigate was primitive. It consisted of protecting watersheds rather than employing a later

technology of chlorination, which has a more persistent germ killing effect. Still, the impact of

chlorination on health might be muted if systems for sewage disposal are not also in place.51 Our

findings accord with recent results from community-level water and sanitation infrastructure

improvements in India. Together, the interventions were found to reduce diarrheal episodes by

30 to 50 percent (Duflo et al. 2015).


of milk in the contemporary literature see the various U.S. Department of Labor, Children’s Bureau reports from the
1910s and 1920s and Whipple (1917, p. 58), who discusses infant mortality causes in the 1870s.
50
   This constellation of symptoms resulting from fecal pathogen contamination is commonly referred to as
“environmental enteropathy.”
51
   Bhalotra et al. (2016) examined the recent rollout of a program in Mexico to chlorinate municipal water sources
and found the health benefits for young children to the clean water intervention were much stronger in places that
had complementary sanitation infrastructure.

                                                                                                Watersheds -29-
       Finally, one may wonder why the Commonwealth government was so foresighted and why

municipalities agreed to raise taxes to prevent downstream pollution and protect the watersheds.

Although a full account of political economy considerations is beyond the scope of our work,

extensive writing on this important issue reveals the respect that politicians and the people gave

to the water engineers and health officials who, in their writings, showed an understanding of the

roles of unsafe water and sewage in spreading disease, even as miasmatic theories still abounded

in the population. We quote Whipple (1917, p. 134) on these matters: “so great has been the

confidence of the public in the ruling of the [State] Board [of Health] that its letters have come to

have almost the force of law.”

       We have identified that the combination of safe water and sewerage interventions was

responsible for much of the first sustained decrease in child mortality in the U.S. Yet child

mortality continued its long decline. Later in the Progressive Era, the purification of the milk

supply, street cleaning, health stations, vaccinations and nurse home visits reduced mortality.52

Still later in the twentieth century, a host of medical technologies, including antibiotics,

continued to lower infant and child death rates. Closer to the present, the use of neonatal

intensive care units has spared many premature babies. Yet improving the lives of young

children in much of the developing world still involves decreasing morbidity from diarrheal

disease through a combination of safe water and sewerage system interventions just as it did

during the first decline in the U.S.




52
  The funding of public health interventions in the 1920s has been identified as a factor reducing IMR. Moehling
and Thomasson (2012) show that in the 1922 to 1929 period better public health, caused by the Sheppard-Towner
Act matching grants to states, can account for 9 to 21 percent of the decrease in infant mortality.

 Notes: Col. (1), rows (1) through (8) report average values for municipalities in 1880 with standard deviations in brackets. Cols. (2), (3) and (4) report coefficients from a single
regression of the indicated characteristic in the leftmost column on an indicator variable for eventual participation in sewerage, safe water or both interventions. This categorization
of the treatment differs from that in the regression analysis because the regression exploits variation across space and time, whereas this table gives the ex post treatment. The final
two rows report coefficients for a similar regression, of the change in log infant mortality or child mortality between 1880 to 1889, the year of the report on a Metropolitan Sewerage
District put forth by the State Board of Health as legislated in 1887, on only water, only sewerage or both in columns (1) to (4). Standard deviations are in brackets. Robust standard
errors are in parentheses.

Notes: OLS estimates of eq. (1) are shown except for col. (7) which reports coefficients from a negative binomial model. The sample spans 1880 to 1920 and includes 60
municipalities (Swampscott and Nahant are combined). The dependent variable is the log of the child mortality rate (in Panel A), the number of child deaths in col. (7) of Panel B
and the child mortality rate (in cols. 8 and 9 of Panel B). Safe water is an indicator variable equal to one during the year when municipal water or a water filter (in the case of
Lawrence) was introduced. Sewerage is an indicator variable that equals one in the year a municipality was connected to the metropolitan sewerage district or had a sewerage
system financed by the Commonwealth (in the case of Marlborough and Clinton). The interaction is an indicator variable that equals one in the first year both interventions are
provided to a municipality. The combination of the estimated effects of water, sewerage and their interaction is in italics and the p-value associated with the combination is shown
below it. Demographic controls include percentage of the population that is foreign-born, percentage male, percentage females in manufacturing and the log of population density.

Notes: OLS estimates of eq. (1). The sample is unbalanced spanning the years 1880 to 1920 and includes the 60 sample municipalities when feasible. The dependent variables for
Panel A are category- and age-specific mortality rates: col. (1) Spring-Summer = child mortality rate constructed from deaths during the months of April to September; col (2) Fall-
Winter = child mortality constructed from deaths during the months October to March; col. (3) Gastrointestinal = child mortality from diseases that are associated with the
gastrointestinal tract and/or are transmitted by fecal-oral route; col (4) Respiratory = child mortality from diseases that affect the lungs, exclusive of tuberculosis; col. (5)
Tuberculosis = child mortality from tuberculosis in all forms; and col. (6) Non-child mortality rate (over-five mortality). For precise definitions and data sources see the Appendix.
The dependent variable for Panel B is the log of the child mortality rate. The sample is described at the top of the column heading, with >50th percentile Irish, denoting

municipalities in the top 50th percentile of the percent foreign who are Irish-born, in the baseline year of 1880. Other columns are defined similarly. Safe water is an indicator
variable equal to one during the year in which municipal water or a water filter (in the case of Lawrence) was introduced. Sewerage is an indicator variable that equals one in the
year a municipality was connected to the metropolitan sewerage district or had a sewerage system built for it by the Commonwealth (in the case of Marlborough and Clinton). The
interaction is an indicator variable that equals one in the first year both interventions are provided to a municipality. The linear combination of water, sewerage and the interaction
is provided in italics. Demographic controls included in every regression include percentage of the population that is foreign-born, percentage male, percentage females in
manufacturing and log population density. Also included are municipality and year fixed effects and municipality-specific linear trends. Standard errors are clustered at the
municipality level.

Notes: OLS estimates of eq. (1). The sample is unbalanced spanning 1880 to 1920 and includes the 60 sample municipalities. Each column is a separate regression with a different
outcome variable. The outcome variables listed under the column numbers are derived from the MA and U.S. Censuses as described in Appendix A. Safe water is an indicator
variable equal to one during the year in which municipal water or a water filter (in the case of Lawrence) was introduced. Sewerage is an indicator variable that equals one in the
year a municipality was connected to the metropolitan sewerage district or had a sewerage system built for it by the Commonwealth (in the case of Marlborough and Clinton). The
interaction represents an indicator variable that equals one in the first year both interventions are provided to a municipality simultaneously. The linear combination of water,
sewerage and the interaction is in italics. Demographic control variables (percentage foreign-born, percentage male, percentage females in manufacturing, log population density)
exclude the outcome variable when applicable. Standard errors are clustered at the municipality level.

Notes: OLS estimates of eq. (1). Each column is a separate regression. The sample specification varies across columns. Col. (1) adds the percent of dairy milk at the county level
that is high quality (see Appendix A); col. (2) adds the percentage of females illiterate; col. (3) adds controls for the percent of neighbors with sewerage or water or both; col. (4)
limits the sample to only those municipalities that eventually received an intervention; col. (5) drops three municipalities: Lawrence (which had a filter) and Clinton and
Marlborough (which had sewerage systems financed by the Commonwealth); col. (6) treats Clinton, Marlborough and Lawrence as controls; col. (7) adds Springfield as a water
intervention municipality. Safe water is an indicator variable equal to one during the year in which municipal water or a water filter (in the case of Lawrence) was introduced.
Sewerage is an indicator variable that equals one in the year a municipality was connected to the metropolitan sewerage district or had a sewerage system financed by the
Commonwealth (in the case of Marlborough and Clinton). The interaction is an indicator variable that equals one in the first year both interventions were provided to a
municipality. The linear combination of water, sewerage and the interaction is provided in italics. Year and municipality fixed effects are included in every specification as are
demographic variables (percentage of the city population that is foreign-born, percentage male, percentage females in manufacturing and log population density). Municipality-
linear trends included except when replaced with alternative trends or dropped from the analysis as indicated in column heading. Standard errors are clustered at the municipality
level.

Notes: The U.S. IMR series for 1850 to 1910 is probably less accurate than the Massachusetts series, which is at an annual frequency and from actual vital statistics data. See
Haines (1998a) and Carter et al. (2006, p. 1–461). The right axis plots the death rate of those [1, 5) for Massachusetts based on the (yearly) registration reports and age-specific
population counts from the federal decennial censuses. The U.S. aggregate series for the children [1, 5) death rate begins in 1900.

Notes: OLS estimates of eq. (2) and their 95 percent confidence intervals are given. Panel A plots coefficients from one regression with the outcome log of child
mortality, which includes the deaths of infants and young children [1, 5) years of age per 1,000 under-five population. Reading from left to right are the coefficients
on water (𝜃𝑘 ), the coefficients on sewerage (𝜇𝑘 ), and the sum of coefficients: Water(𝜃)+Sewerage(𝜇)+Interaction(𝛾). Plotted in Panel B are the sum of coefficients:
Water(𝜃)+Sewerage(𝜇)+Interaction(𝛾) using three different outcome variables (i.e., three different regressions): the log of the child mortality rate during the spring
and summer, which is deaths during the months of April to September per 1,000 under-five population; the log of the child mortality rate from gastrointestinal disease;
and the log of the non-child mortality, which is deaths of those five and above per 1,000 relevant population. See Data Appendix (variables definition), and text for
further details. Standard errors are clustered at the municipality level.

MAP 2- METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT (circa 1910)




Source: Engineering and Contracting (1914, p. 84).
Notes: This map depicts the Metropolitan Water District circa 1910. The circle gives the 10-mile radius from the State House that defined
the eligible municipalities. Aqueducts (dark black lines) and a series of reservoirs (bodies of water labeled as such) were constructed to
bring water from the south branch of the Nashua River to communities in and around Boston.
