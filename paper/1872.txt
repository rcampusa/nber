           Optimal Tariffs in Consistent Conjectural Variations Equilibrium




                                       ABSTRACT




    This paper analyzes the determination of the optimal tariff under the

assumption of Consistent Conjectural Variations (CCV). A general character-

ization of the CCV equilibrium is given. We show that (i) there are, in

general, a multiplicity of such equilibria, and (ii) under certain restric-

tions, the Cournot equilibrium, which is based on the assumption of no retal-

iation can also be a CCV equilibrium. By contrast, free trade is never a CCV

equilibrium. Finally the CCV equilibrium is solved explicitly in a simple

example.

1. INTRODUCTION

    Until recently, the theory of optimal tariffs has been based on the assump-

tion that neither country will retaliate to the imposition of the tariff by its

trading partner.!" The existence of tariff wars, however, calls into serious

question the realism of this assumption. This shortcoming is recognized in a

recent paper by Thursby and Jensen (1983), which analyzes the question of op-

timal tariffs on the assumption of some constant conjectured form of retalia-

tion by each country.V

    In this paper, we determine the optimal tariff under the assumption of

consistent conjectural variations (CCV). That is, we assume that each coun-

try's conjecture about the retaliation by its trading partner is in fact con-

sistent with that country's reaction curve. This form of equilibrium is

appealing and has been introduced into oligopolistic models by a number of

authors; see, e.g., Laitner (1980), Bresnahan (1981), Perry (1982), Kamien and

Schwartz (1983), Eaton and Grossman (forthcoming). It has also been applied

to the determination of tariff equilibrium by Jensen and Thurshy (1984).

    But despite its appeal and widespread adoption in the literature, the con-

jectural variations equilibrium is often criticized as not being a proper game—

theoretic construct. The essence of this objection is that in a static game

there is no possibility for action and policy reaction and hence there is no

way an agent can conjecture, let alone correctly conjecture, his rival's re-

sponse. One justification for the Consistent Conjectural Variations equilib-

rium in this circumstance is as a shorthand 'reduced form' for a fully dynamic

repeated game. Also, Bresnahan (1981) justifies it in terms of comparative

static responses in a situation where exogenous shocks occur with sufficient

frequency for each decision maker to observe and to learn his rival's true
                                        —2—


response. However, the dynamic process by which these consistent conlectures

are generated is an unsolved problem.-1

    As we shall see in the course of the analysis below, the determination of

the CCV equilibrium involves inherent nonlinearities and all we are able to

establish is consistency to the first order of approximation. We give a gen-

eral characterization of the CCV equilibrium for the optimal tariffs. We show

that:   (1)   there are, in general, a multiplicity of such eciullibria, and

(ii) under certain restrictions, the Cournot equilibrium, which is based on

the assumption of no retaliation, can also he a CCV equilibrium. By contrast,

free trade is never a CCV equilibrium. Finally, we solve for the CCV equilib-

rium explicitly in a simple example.


2 DETERMINATION OF EQUILIBRIUM WITH CONSISTENT CONJECTURES

A. Framework

    We consider the usual two country, two good trade model, where both coun-

tries are competitive and the only distortions are import tariffs.' We index

the countries by A, B, the goods by x, y, and assume without loss of gener-

ality that Country B imports good x in return for good y which it exports to

Country A. The tariffs levied by Countries A, B, are t, t, respectively,

and the two governments are assumed to redistribute the tariff revenues to

their citizens.

    The basic model is described by the following set of equations:


         U1 =   U'(C',C1)        I = A, B                                      (1)


         —
         Ui = p      I
                                i = A, B                                       (2)

where C denotes consumption of good in Country i                           I = A, B, j   = x,   y

         Q denotes production of good j                  in   Country i

         E denotes excess demand of good j                    in   Country i

         p =         price     of x relative to y in Country A

         q =         price     of x relative to y in Country B

    Equations (1) define the utility functions in Countries A, B to be func-

tions of the respective consumptions of the two goods. The functions U are

assumed to be continuous, twice differentiable, and quasi—concave. Equations

(2) define the optimality conditions for consumers in each country. Equations

(3) and (4) apply analogously to production. Equation (3) defines the

production possibility curve, which is assumed to be concave, while (4)

specifies the usual marginal product conditions for optimality. Equations (5)

define excess demand as the difference between consumption and production.

For the import good E > 0, while for the export good E < 0.'

    Equations (6) describe the balance of trade equilibrium for the two coun-

tries, while (7) specifies market clearance in the world markets for the two

goods. With no transport costs and in the absence of frictions, (8) specifies

the relationship between the relative prices of the two goods in the two

economies and the tariffs being levied. Using this relationship, it is clear

from (6), (7) that the goods markets are not both independent; equilibrium in

one implies equilibrium in the other, so that one equation, say (7b), can be

dropped.

B, we can show that the analogous optimality condition is

                           y                    x

The sign restrictions introduced are based on the assumption that an increase

in the relative price of good x in either country reduces the excess demand

for that good, while increasing it for the other good y. As usual, we invoke

the Marshall-Lrner conditimi              C > 1. Also, an increase IL the tariff
                                     p     ci


rate reduces the excess demand for the imported good. Using these definitions

the optimality conditions can be expressed in terms of the following elas-

ticity expressions

are extremely complicated to determine. In this section we consider the case

where all elasticities 8q' 8, c, , are constant. Eliminating cA, B' under

these conditions, the solutions in (16) simplify to the following pair of

Equation   (17a) defines the reaction curve for Country A, correctly taking

account of the reaction function of Country B. Likewise, (17b) does the sane

for Country B. The pair of equations may therefore he termed as being "gen—

eralized" reaction functions. Because of the interactions they embody, both

of these equatioiis are highly nonlinear, raising the possibility of a multi-

plicity of solutions. Note that

satisfy the two equations. This verifies Proposition 2, that with offer

curves having constant elasticities, the Cournot solution is also a CCV solu—

tion. But there are other solutions as well.

       In order to study (l7a), (17b) further, and to obtain an explicit solution,

we shall consider the case where not only all elasticities are constant, but

also both countries are symmetric with

           ap =—f3
                q
                   a, a
                      y
                        =x
Given the symmetry it is clear that the solutions to              ,   T,   obtained at the

intersection of the reaction functions (17a), (17b) must imply t               =   T,   a fact

which can be verified directly. Thus setting T =                 = T in (l7a) say and

simplifying the common CCV tariffs are obtained as the solutions to the equa-

tion

            [(l-a)r   -                 — 2ctt —   (1-)]   = 0                           (18)

Letting r =    l+T,   the solutions to this cubic equation are


            (i) t = t1
                           *
                               =        1
                                        —



                           *   =   I
                                   —
           (ii) t = t2
                                   /a
                          *      —l
          (iii) t =            = —
                          t3       /a

Thus, in general, there are three CCV equilibria, one of which is t =
                                                                                    t,    the

usual Cournot equilibrium.

   These solutions may be ranked over varying values of the elasticity a.

First, in order for the Marshall—Lerner condition to hold a > 1/2. Secondly,

for the range 1/2 < a < 1, both t (Cournot) and t3 imply corresponding values

T, t3 < 0. That is, the price of the imported good in each country is negative,
                                         —10—


which is obviously infeasible. Hence, for 1/2 < a < 1 there is a unique

feasible CCV solution, namely

                        *       1
                =           = —:


     For a > 1, all three solutions are feasible, although t3   represents   a

subsidy. If 1 < a < a*, where ct = 2.618 is the positive solution to the

equation
            2       —       + 1 = 0

the rankings of the optimal tariffs are

            *           *           *
           ti       > t2 > t3


On the other hand, if a > a* > 1, the rankings are altered to



           t>t              >
                                    t.

5.   CONCLUSIONS

     This paper has determined the optimal tariff under the assumption that

each country correctly anticipates the response by its rival. We have given

both a general characterization of this CCV equilibrium and considered a

specific example. In general, there are a multiplicity of CCV equilibrium

tariffs. Under certain restrictions one of these may be the Cournot equilib-

rium, which (in this case correctly) assumes no retaliation. But free trade

is never such an equilibrium outcome.

legitimate equilibrium concept. According to this classification, the Cournot
equilibrium is a zero'th order CCV equilibrium. The usual definition, and the
one we shall consider here, is a first order CCV equilibrium, in which the
players correctly conjecture on the slopes (first derivatives) of the reaction
functions. More generally in a CCV equilibrium of the n'th order, the rivals
correctly conjecture on the first n derivatives of the rival's reaction func-
tion.

          model we employ is a standard trade model such as in Bhagwati and
Srinlvasan (1983) or Takayama (1974).

          similar proposition has been obtained by Jensen and Thursby (1984).

operative equilibrium. This is not so under our CCV assumptions. By con-
trast, in the Eaton and Grossman (1983) duopoly model, with no home consump-
tion, free trade emerges as the CCV equilibrium. Mayer (1981) and Riezman
(1982) show how free trade may result from a cooperative equilibrium.

                                               Proof of Propositions 1 and 2


Proof of Proposition 1

    Assuming a Cournot equilibrium and setting A =                             = 0 in (16a), (16b) of

the text, these equations reduce to


                                      =   rB(r,T)      = 0.


Noting the definitions in (l5a), (15b) of the text, these conditions can be

expressed in terms of elasticities, as


           (t —1)8                +T          = 0
                y            q            y

           (rx —l)c —r
                     x
                       =0
                             p


The equilibrium will be consistent with CCV (with zero conjectured variation)

if and only if

                x                          y
Since 8 =       8       (cj,r ),          we have
       q            q             x

Proof of Proposition 2

    To establish this proposition suppose that free trade were consistent with

CCV. In this case t = T                               = 1      (i.e., t =         t       =    0) are solutions to (16a)—(16d).
Setting T =         t        = 1 in the definitions in (15) we have

                            p           y                     q        x

           rB =

so that (16a), (16b) become
                                qx                      =



                                +                           = 0                                                                   (A.la)
           (a_a)

                                +    pyA =                    0                                                                   (A.lb)

Multiplying these two equations together yields
                        =   1                                                                                                     (A.2)

    Differentiating the expressions in (15) with respect to T,                                                           T, and   eval-
uating   at the free trade equilibrium t =                                            = 1,         yields

Finally,   summing these equations and substituting for (A.la), (A.lb), these

equations reduce to


           (q      ÷   B —   a       + a )(B — a +   1) =   0                                       (A.3)

But this is a contradiction. By the Marshall—Lerner condition a —                          B       — 1 > 0,
                                                                                       p       q

while the condition

               q
                   +Bx —ap +ay =0
contradicts the sign restrictions imposed in (11) of the text. Thus we con-

clude that free trade is never a CCV equilibrium.
