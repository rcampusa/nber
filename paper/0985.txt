                Union Wage Settlements During a Disinflation


                                  ABSTRACT


       This paper examines the role of union wage contracts in the persistence

of inflation, and the implication of these contracts for the problem of dis-

inflation in the United States. A quantitative model of overlapping con-

tracts explicitly oriented toward the major union sector is developed. The

model takes account of expectations of future wage, price, and employment

conditions as in more aggregated models that have been used in macro-

economic research. In addition, the distribution of workers according

to contract length as well as deferred wage increases and escalator clauses

are explicitly used in the model. The main aim of the model is to determine

the constraints which these contracts impose on disinflation paths. The

model indicates that the maximum speed of disinflation is extremely slow

in   the early phases——if a rise in unemployment is to be avoided——but
increases considerably before the new lower rate of inflation is reached.
The disinflation path is considerably slower than that observed after

hyperinflarion periods. However, the existence of a path of inflation

reduction raises questions about whether the institution of union wage con-

tracts is really the direct cause of costly disinflations, or whether

their influence works indirectly by raising credibility problems about

a monetary disinflation.

              Union Wage Settlements During a Disinflation

     The three—year union labor contract has been singled out by many econo-

mists as a major factor underlying the persistence of wage inflation in the

United States, and as a reason for the resistance of inflation to aggregate

demand policy. Set throughout a three—year cycle of decentralized collec-

tive bargaining settlements, these overlapping contracts have also been

cited as the primary institutional difference between U. S. wage deterrnina—

tion and that of other countries, such as Germany and Japan, where nominal

wage inflation has appeared to be less persistent.'      Such differences

have even led to proposals for shortening the terms of U. S. labor union

contracts and centralizing contract settlements in order to reduce the per-

sistence of inflation.

     The basic rationale for assigning a major role in the inflation process

to the institution of three—year union contracts follows closely from ar-

guments developed in the labor economics literature, and in particular, the

early ttpat tern bargaining1' literature of Ross (1948) and Dunlop (1957).

One union sets a pattern wage increase and other unions who follow in the

bargaining cycle imitate with a similar wage increase. For example, in

making a case for centralization reforms, Lester Thurow has recently
        2/
argued :—

             American wages are now set in a context of overlapping
             three—year indexed contracts. In such a system it be-
             comes very difficult to phase down wage gains unless an
             industry is on the brink of extinction. Suppose that this
             year the Machinistst union is negotiating a new three—year
             contract. Last year the Auto Workers negotiated a three—
             year contract for 10% rise per year. In many plants
             machinists work right next to auto workers. No leader
             of the machinists can settle for less than 10% per year
             and still remain in office. And in two years' time the auto
             leaders will be similarly imprisoned by what the machinists
             negotiate today. .. .All contracts should run the same length of
             time, so that the country could negotiate in simultaneous
             national wage negotiations.

       Recently, formal, though highly aggregated, models of overlapping wage

setting have appeared in the macroeconomic literature. These models are

somewhat different from the earlier explanations of wage persistence in

that   explicit theories of endogenous inflationary expectations have been
incorporated into the wage contracting process (see Taylor (1980), for
example).    The results have indicated that the persistence of inflation

generated by overlapping contracts is considerably different and poten-

tially much less resistant to changes in macroeconomic policy than earlier

studies have indicated. To date, however, these aggregate models have not

incorporated any explicit characteristics of long—term union contracts in

the U. S.——the actual lengths of contracts, the number of workers nego-

tiating at different dates throughout the year, the deferred wage increases,

and the escalator clauses. Although the models have been formulated in

enough detail for aggregate econometric work, institutional details (such

as the distribution of workers by contract length) have been treated as

parameters to be estimated. Hence, these models have not been able to

address explicit issues involving wage settlements in the union sector.
                                   —3—


     The purpose of this paper is to examine some of these issues by de—

veloping and simulating a model of overlapping contracts explicitly

oriented toward the major union sector in the United States, but which

takes account of expectations as in the more aggregated models in the macro

literature. Using data on union wage settlements, we calculate the dis-

tribution of workers by contract length and take account of the deferred

wage increases and the escalator clauses which have come to be important

features of many long—term contracts. The main aim in developing such a

model is to determine the constraints which the long—term overlapping

contracts put on attempts to reduce the rate of inflation, or to break the

momentum of inflation. The most effective way to characterize these

constraints is to calculate the maximum speed of disinflation which can

occur without a rise in unemployment and without wage concessions in

existing contracts. The model indicates that the maximum speed may be

extremely slow in the early phases of disinflation——almost imperceptable

in the first few quarters——followed by a period of greater deceleration

of wages until the new lower rate of inflation is reached.'    Such a

disinflation path is considerably different than the instantaneous drop to

low inflation rates observed by Sargent (1980) in his study of the end of

the hyperinflations in the 1920's. However, the existence of a path of

inflation reduction along which the increase in unemployment is minimal,

despite the long—term contracts, raises questions about whether the in-

stitution of overlapping union wage—setting is really the central diff i—

culty in reducing inflation without real costs, and whether centralization

reforms would be of much value.' The model indicates that a gradual

reduction in the growth of aggregate demand is necessary to reduce infla—
                                 —4—


tion without great costs in an economy with long—term contracts. The

difficulty with such a path is that it may raise doubts in the early stages

about whether a lower inflation rate will ever be reached. Potentially,

the information provided by the model may be of some value to policymakers

in planning and communicating a monetary disinflation, as well as to in-

dividual wage negotiators deciding what to do during such a disinflation.

It may even help in improving the accuracy of inflation forecasting.

     The paper is organized as follows: In section 1 we describe the

central features of overlapping wage contracts in the major union sector

of the U. S.   In Section 2 we examine the problem of determining an

appropriate level of disaggregation for modeling purposes and introduce

notation and assumptions used in the model. In section 3 we describe the

behavioral equations of the model, and in section 4 we report the results

of calculations and simulations of a disinflation from 10 percent to 3

percent wage inflation.


L Characteristics of Long—Term Union Wage Contracting in the U. S.

     In May 1981 the United Mine Workers signed a contract with the Bitumi-

nous Coal Operators which is typical of the kind of wage adjustment found

in the major union sector in recent years of relatively high inflation.

Affecting about 160,000 workers, the contract called for wage increases

over a set period of 40 months through September 1984. The wage increases

would average 11% per year, starting with an immediate adjustment of $1.20

and followed by deferred increases of $1.10 and $1.00 in the second and

third years and $.30 in the last quarter. Clearly these deferred increases

reflect high expected inflation rates on the part of both the firms and

workers, but the contract involves no escalation clause. In this later
                                         —5--


respect,   it is similar to about 45% of all major union contracts. The

approximately 10% wage adjustments in the second and third year will occur

according to schedule, unless the contract is reopened and concessions are

made, an event which generally occurs only when the industry or certain

firms   reach   distressed conditions.

     The coal contract is one of the major union contracts (defined as af-

fecting   1000 or more workers) about which this type detailed information on
wage adjustment is avai1able' in the U. S. Approximately 10 million workers
are involved in these major union contracts, or about one—half of all union-
ized workers who currently constitute about 20 percent of the labor force

in the Ti. S. The model developed below will focus on the workers in this

major union sector for which such data are available. Although this sec-

tor accounts for only 10 percent of the U. S. labor force, there are good

reasons to study this group of workers, even were it not for this data

1imitation.-' The vast majority of three—year labor contracts are accounted

for by this group of workers, and it is this group which has received most

of the attention in current discussions about the international differences

in wage setting institutions. Although the evidence is mixed about whether

these unions influence wage setting in the small union or the non—union

sector, or the reverse,1 it is clear that close attention is paid to these

contracts in policy discussions. Furthermore, once an adequate description

of wage determination in these unions is developed, it would be possible

to extend the framework to include the other wage setting sectors, though

we would have to rely on indirect estimation of the form of contracts in

those sectors. In any case, in what follows we will take the major union

sector as the universe of workers in our analysis and base our calculations
                                      —6—



of aggregate wage change and inflation on this sector.
     Table 1 suarizes the pattern of bargaining activity in this major
union   sector during the 1970's.     Not all workers in this group are under
three—year contracts, but a significant fraction are. The three—year cycle
in the longer—term contracts is evident in Table 1, with 1979 and 1980 be-

ing heavy years in terms     of   col1ectie bargaining and 1981 being light,

and with the three—year pattern continuing on a regular basis. Moreover,

there is an obvious seasonal pattern with most bargaining activity taking

place in the second and third quarters. There is some gradual shifting of

these patterns caused either by delays in reaching a settlement or by early

settlements. These shifts will move a group of workers out of its cycle,

at least temporarily. Some of the shifting is also caused by deviations

from the exact 1, 2, and 3 year durations.

        Table 2 summarizes the quarterly pattern of negotiated wage increases

for the workers' in the major union     sector.    Clearly a s-ignificant fraction

of any wage    adjustment   occurs in the later years of long—term contracts,

but there is some front—end loading with the current settlements a bit larger

than the deferred increases. Moreover, any cyclical sensitivity of wage

adjustment appears to occur mainly       in   the short—term contracts or in the

first year of the long—term contracts. The deferred wage increases show

almost no cyclical sensitivity.

        In interpreting these deferred wage increases it is important to take

account of the degree of escalation in these contracts. The data reported

in Tables 1 and 2 relate to both indexed and non—indexed contracts, About

55 percent of the workers in this major union sector have some type of
                                    —7—


escalation clause in   thir contracts, though it is usually less than full
indexation to price changes. There is an obvious tradeoff between the size

of the set deferred increase and the amount of indexing for any given ex-

pected rate of inflation. This is seen in Table 3 where a comparison of

first year and length—of—contract wage adjustments is given for contracts

with escalators and those without. Clearly the increased dispersion between

the deferred increases in indexed and non—indexed contracts in the late

1970's reflects an increase in inflationary expectations (there has been only

a slight increase in indexation over this period). As workers and firms

expect the escalator clause to take up a large part of future wage in-

creases, the deferred increases are correspondingly reduced. This substi-

tution is built into the model described below and should indicate that the

relatively modest deferred increases reported in the late 1970's in Table 2

are at least partially due to the indexation clauses in many of these

contracts.

     It should also be noted that Table 2 does not include fringe benefits.

For a smaller group of workers (settlements involving 5000 or more workers),

similar data are available on total compensation adjustments though these

data are not available by contract length or by annual deferred increases.

Table 4 reports a comparison of wage versus compensation adjustments which

indicates that the discrepancies between the two are of some potential

significance.

     In any given quarterly time period the aggregate wage change for the

group of workers in the major union sector can be divided into the current

settlement component determined in the current quarter, and the prior

settlement component determined by previous deferred wage increases, plus
                                     —8—



an adjustment for indexation, the escalator component. The sum of      these

gives the total effective wage change for this sector and corresponds

closely   to   other measures of aggregate compensation in the United States.


2. Aggregation Issues.

     An important consideration in designing a model of wage contracting

is the appropriate level of aggregation. Some wage disaggregation is neces-

sary because of the differences in the contracts signed at different dates.

At any point in time the aggregate wage is composed of contract wages set

by workers at different times in the past, and hence with different informa-

tion sets and with different remaining durations. Aggregating across such

contracts could miss crucial features of the dynamics of inflation.

     While it is possible to model each of the 5000 settlements in the

major union group separately, as the BLS data file has information on every

settlement, for computational reasons we chose to aggregate these settlements

into 24 groups of workers and to focus on the average wage change for con-

tracts negotiated in each quarter. Contracts are first grouped into three

classes corresponding to their length: 6 months through 18 months, 19 months

through 30 months, and 31 months and over. These correspond to the 1, 2,

and 3 year grouping of contracts shown in Table 1. The 24 groups, or cohorts,

of workers then correspond to the 4 groups of workers signing one—year

contracts every 4 quarters, the 8 groups of workers signing two—year contracts

every 8 quarters, and the 12 groups of workers signing three—year contracts

every 12 quarters.

     The relative importance of each of these 24 groups in the wage setting

process can be obtained directly from the data on the number of workers by

contract length reported in Table 1.
                                     —9—



     As mentioned above, however, the distribution of workers by

contract length drifts gradually over time; that is, the one, two, and

three year cycles do not exactly repeat themselves every one, two, or

three years. Hence, the composition of each of these 24 groups of

workers gradually changes over time. For the purpose of illustrating

the general properties of the model, this drift can be ignored. We

use the most recent contract data reported in Table 1 and assume that

this distribution repeats every one, two or three years depending

on the length of the contracts.2-' This distribution, organized into

the 24 contract cohorts, is shown     in   Table 5, along with the year of

observation upon which the distribution is based. As an aid in

keeping track of the cohort groups we have given a representative

industry bargaining name to each     cohort,   which is also shown in Table

5.

     In   any given quarter, three of these groups will be negotiating

wage changes: one of the one—year contract groups, one of the two—

year, and one of the three—year contract groups. We assume that all

wage changes occur at the   start,   and at yearly intervals after the

start, of each contract. Hence, the one—year contract group must

determine a single wage level for the year. The two—year contract

group must determine two wage levels: one for the first year, and one

for the second year. The three—year contract group must determine

three wage levels: one for each of the three years. The wage change

for the first year of these contracts corresponds to the current set-

tlement and the wage changes for the second and third year correspond

to deferred settlements in Table 2.-u-'
                                      — 10 —




      In   order to summarize these assumptions and describe the behavioral

relationships which underlie the model, some notation will be helpful.

Let

             n.(t) = number of workers signing contracts of length

                     j    Th quarter t.

           x.(t,s)   log of the wage set in contracts of length j
                                                                   th
                     signed in quarter t to prevail in the s

                     quarter following quarter t.

The aggregation assumption is that j equals either 4, 8, or 12, corres-

ponding to the one, two, and three—year contracts. The assumption that

wage changes occur only at yearly intervals is represented algebraically

as


(1)          x(t,s) =    x,(t,0)   for s=1,2,3 and j       4, 8, l2



(2)          xjt,4+s) =    x.(t,4),    s =   1,2,3 and j   8, 12


(3)          x12(t,8+s) =   x12(t,8),    s     l,2,3


Equation (1) states that the wage level is constant during the first

year of the one, two, and three—year contracts (j = 4, 8, and 12), and

equal to the value determined in the first quarter x.(t,0)., Equation

(2) states that the wage level is constant during the second year of the

two and three—year contracts (j = 8 and 12), and equal to the value set

in the first quarter of the second year x,(t,4).           Finally, equation

(3) states that the wage level is unchanged during the third year of
                                       — 11 —




three year contracts (jl2).

      During each quarter six wage levels are determined; three

current levels: x4(t,O), x8(t,O), and x12(t,0); and three deferred

levels: x8(t,4), x12(t,4) and x12(t,8). Note that there is no

presumption that the deferred wage levels are equal to the current

levels   so that deferred increases are possible according to this set-
up.
      The aggregate wage is a weighted average of the contract wages
and is given by the expression.

                          j —1
                      I    I n.(t—s)x.(t—s,s)
                          s=O
             w(t) =
(4)

                                 I
                                     j-l
                                     I n.(t—s)
                                 j s0


Our use of logarithms means that (4) should be interpreted as the log

of a geometrically weighted index of contract wages.


3. Wage Setting Assumptions.

      The wage determination process is analogous to that used in the

theoretical staggered contract model described in Taylor (1980), In

particular we assume that, in the absence of a need for a change in

relative wages, it is natural for workers and firms    to   attempt to keep

their own   wages as close as possible to the prevailing level of wages
during the period of the contract, adjusted for skill and other dif-

ferentials. If wage adjustments are thought to be necessary, because

of a shift in labor market demand or supply conditions, then these

adjustments will be made relative to this prevailing wage. Since we
                                    — 12 —




are interested in how union contracts should be adjusted during a
general disinflation period, where there is no explicit need for rela-

tive wage change, we will focus on a behavioral assumption which

maintains the relative wage structure.

      Consider first the case of non—indexed contracts We assume that

one—year contracts will call for a wage adjustment to equal the average

wage expected to prevail during the contract periodS Similarly, the

first year of 2 and 3—year contracts will have a wage adjustment to

equal the prevailing wage during that same one—year period. Alge-

braically the current settlements are then given by:


                          3,'
(5)          x.(t,O) =         w(t+s)    j      4,   8, 12,
                         s=O


where w(t) is the expectation of             w(t) the average wage defined in

equation (4). For the deferred wage increases in the second year of

two and three—year contracts, we assume


                          7,'
(6)          x.(t,4)      E w(t+s)       j      8,   12
                         s4


and finally, for the deferred increase in the third year of three—year

contracts,


                          11
(7)                        E w(t+s)
             x12(t,8)
                          s= 8




      Most theories of wage adjustment suggest that labor market conditions
                                     — 13 —



 will   influence wages and in particular that wages will be bid up

 relative to the prevailing wage during periods when the unemployment

 rate is low, and conversely when the unemployment rate is high. This,

 for example, is the explicit assumption used in Taylor (1980). It

would be appropriate, therefore, to add a negative function of the

unemployment rate (measured relative to the natural or normal level of

unemployment) tc'   the   right—hand side of equations (5) through (7).

The fact that no additional terms are added, so that equations (5)

through (7) hold at all times, is simply a way to ensure that full em—

ployment is maintained. As stated in the introduction, this is a con-

venient way to characterize how wage contracts constrain the movements

of aggregate wages. Of course, it would be possible to modify the

model by adding unemployment effects to the right—hand side of equations

(5) through (7) in order to examine how much unemployment might rise

if disinflation occurs too quickly.

        The behavioral equations reflect a relative wage concern on the part

of workers. It is possible to interpret these equations in terms of the

wage imitation literature: each union imitates the behavior of other

unions by establishing wages which meet the going wage. Note, however,

that (skill adjusted) wage levels, not rates of change, are what are

imitated. Moreover, in terms of pattern bargaining terminology, the

pattern must run in both directions. Because the aggregate wage w(t)

is comprised of past wage decisions (see equation (4)), each of equa-

tions (5) through (7) indicate that current wage decisions are "patterned"

on previous wage decisions. But since the future contract decisions

are also embedded in the future average wages, current wage decisions
                                 — 14 —



are also patterned on future wage decisions. The traditional pattern

bargaining literature focused entirely on the former type of pattern-

ing. The behavioral equations used here are forward—looking, although

the staggering of contracts naturally leads to backward—looking. These

features have been emphasized in the recent theoretical overlapping

contract literature.--'

       When contracts are indexed, the contracted adjustment in wages will

reflect the expected increase or decrease in wage rates which will

arise because of changes in the price level. Consider the following

example. In a steady inflation of 10 percent, the above contracting

arrangements would imply that a three—year contract without indexing

would have a 10 percent increase in the first year, followed by a 10

percent increase in each of the second two years (10, 10, 10).

Suppose, instead, that contracts are indexed at .3 in the second and

third year, so that a 10 percent increase in the price level automat-

ically adds 3 percent to the wage in the second and third year. Then

in a steady 10 percent inflation where prices and wages are increasing

at the same rate, the set wage increase would again be 10 percent in

the first year, but only 7 percent in the second and third years (10,

7, 7). The remaining increase in wages of 3 percent in the second and

third years would come from indexing; that is, (10, 7, 7) + (0, 3, 3) =

(10,   10, 10).

       These effects are incorporated into the model by adjusting down

the set wage in equations (6) and (7) by the amount of increase which

is ed from indexing. The exact size of the indexing is assumed

to be constant fraction of the increase in the aggregate price level
                                   — 15 —




 during the previous four quarters. This constant is the same for
              12/
 all workers.— We assume, as in the example, that indexing reviews

 occur annually at the start of the second and third year of two

 and three—year contracts. One—year contracts are not indexed. In

 the calculations reported in this paper, the real wage is assumed to

be constant so that the indexing is assumed to be a fixed fraction

of the increase in the aggregate wage.


4. Solving the Model.

      We will use the rational expectations assumption for generating

the forecasts of future expected wages. To do this we must close

the model. The easiest way to do this is to assume a simple quantity.

type relation for the demand for money. In particular, we assume

that deviations of real GNP from trend are proportional to deviations

of real money balances from trend. Our assumption of full employment

used in these solutions corresponds to holding real GNP at a trend

(full—employment) level, or equivalently to holding real money balances

at a trend (full—employment) level. If real wages are constant,

then we simply require that real balances measured in wage units do

not deviate from a level consistent with full employment, Let m(t)

be the log of money, which is assumed to be exogenous. The model is

closed by requiring that


(8)        m(t) —   w(t)   =   k


where k is the full—employment level of real balances.

      We will only simulate the model for paths for which (8) is satis-

fied. The qualitative behavior of the economy when (8) is not satisfied
                                     — 16 —




is   fairly clear, however. If m(t) —         w(t)   >   k   then unemployment

will fall below normal levels, because higher real balances will

reduce interest rates and stimulate demand. Similarly, if

m(t) -   w(t)   <   k,   then unemployment will rise above normal. In

the first situation, the low unemployment will tend to bid up new

wage settlements relative to the prevailing level, because a positive

term would appear on the right—hand side of (5) through (7). In the

second situation, wage settlements will be bid down,

     The model, consisting entirely of equations (1) through (8), is

a linear (in the logarithms) rational expectations model. At each date,

6 wage levels are determined and these depend on wage decisions made

as far as 11 quarters in the past and an wage decisions to be made

as far as 11 quarters in the future. The model has flaccelerationistu

properties in that any steady state money growth path, and corres-

ponding wage inflation path satisfies the equations of the model,

and is therefore consistent with full employment. In this paper,

however, we are interested in disinflation——moving from a high rate

of inflation to a low rate of inflation——without deviating from full em-

ployment. To calculate such disinflation paths, the model was solved

using the EP algorithm discussed by Fair and Taylor (1982). In all

cases we found that there was only one full—employment disinflation

path for a given parameter configuration of the mode1)-" The proper-

ties of this path are described in the next section.


4. Patterns of Wage Settlements during a Disinflation.

     Consider a situation where the rate of wage inflation has been

steady for a long period of time at 10 percent per year and where there
                                 —17—


is no indexing of contracts. Then, according to the equations of

the model, the current wage adjustment and deferred wage adjustments

in the long—term contracts would all be equal to 10 percent per year.

For example, every three years the Coal Niners would sign a contract

calling for 10 percent wage increase in each of the three years of

their long—term contract, much as in the actual 1981 agreement dis—

cussed above. After the signing of such agreements there would be a

considerable overhang of deferred pay increases in future years. It

is this overhang which makes it necessary for wage adjustments in

other contracts to be gradual if subsequent to the coal settlement

a general disinflation begins.

     Suppose that, in the first quarter of a heavy bargaining year

(e.g., the Tobacco contract cohort), a general disinflation from 10

percent to 3 percent begins and is thereafter expected to continue.

The important policy issue about how such a disinflation is engineered

through aggregate demand policy depends greatly on how union wage

settlements might develop. Table 6 shows the settlement pattern which

is consistent with the equations of the model and therefore with full

employment. The first six columns of Table 6 show the contract wage

settlements in percentage terms. These are simply the changes in

the (logs of the) levels of the wages determined as explained above.

The column labeled "1 Year Contracts" shows the current settlement for

workers signing one—year contracts in that quarter; that is,

x4(t,0) —                Similarly the column labeled "1st Year" in the
            x4(t—4,0).
2—year and 3—year contracts shows the percentage change in the cur-

rent settlement for those cohorts. The columns labeled "2nd Year"
                              — 18 —




and "3rd Year" show the deferred increase in the longer term contracts.

The effective wage change is simply the first difference of the log

of the aggregate wage w(t) from quarter to quarter (w(t) —   w(t—1)).
Because of the seasonal pattern of workers negotiating each quarter,

it is more informative to look at the change of w(t) over four

quarters which is shown in the effective wage change column labeled

"Year."

     The simulation begins in quarter 1 of year L Previous to this

first quarter the entries in Table 7 would have been 10 percent in all

columns with the exception of the quarterly effective wage change which
                       14 /
fluctuates   seasonally.—
    What is most striking about Table 6 is the gradual decline in

the inflation rate, especially in the early periods of the disinfla-

tion. The effective wage change decline is barely noticeable for a full

year. The decline is about one percentage point in the second year,

a large five percentage points in the third year, and about one more

percentage point in the fourth year. It is only after the new nego-

tiations are well beyond the overhang of past deferred wage increases

that noticeable declines in the inflation rate occur. Note, however,

that in the long—term contracts there is a definite sign that disin-

flation is underway: the third year deferred increases in the 3—year

contracts are down substantially relative to the previous settlement.

The third—year deferred increase in the settlement negotiated in quarter

2 is about half the previous third—year deferred increase.

     Table 7 shows the results of a similar disinflation in the case

where the contracts are indexed according to the assumptions of the
                                  —19—


model. It is assumed that on average, contracts have 30 percent

escalation. As one would expect, the actual effective wage change

occurs less gradually in this case as the indexing formulas permit

some change in the wage levels determined in previous contracts.

However, the difference is very small. Recall that there is no in-

dexing in the first year and that indexing reviews only occur annually.

Alternative assumptions might make a greater difference.

        It is useful to compare these results with the predictions of

other models of wage and price dynamics. The rate of disinflation

is considerably slower than what is implied by rational expectations

models with perfectly flexible prices. As mentioned in the intro-

duction, Sargent's (1980) finding that a quick disinflation occurred

without significant real costs after the central European hyper

inflation would not be expected in an economy with sticky prices or

wages. The simulations of this model indicate in quantitative terms

how large the difference in speed might be if the U. S. union wage con-

tracting is the source of stickiness. On the other hand, the speed of

disinflation is faster than what is implied by conventional expecta-

tions—augmented Phillips curve models which imply that the rate

of inflation cannot be reduced at all by aggregate demand policy without

an increase in unemployment. These models predict that inflation

would remain at 10 percent if unemployment doesn't rise above the natural

rate.


5. Concluding Remarks.

        The simulations presented in this paper have focused on a possible

scenario for union wage settlements during a disinflation in the
                                 — 20 —




context   of three—year.contracts. Although the scenario shows that

it is possible in principle for such a disinflation to occur without

any increase in unemployment, the path of the adjustments which we

have calculated shows extremely gradual changes in the first two

years of a disinflation program.

        Under the assumption of a fairly stable relationship between

money and nominal GNP, this implies a very gradual deceleration of

money growth during the early stages of disinflation. The shape of

the overhang of previously negotiated deferred wage increases implies

that a gradual reduction in money growth would permit the economy to

get past this overhang before starting the more rapid part of the

disinflation prograza)1 The difficulty with this in practice is

that wage negotiators have to be convinced that the deceleration will

come later even though it is not occurring today. (The last column

in Tables 6 and 7 have to be rational forecasts.) This credibility

problem is perhaps the central source of difficulty which is raised by

long—term union contracts during a period of disinflation. At the

heart of this credibility problem is a time—inconsistency problem

that   takes a particularly explicit form in this model of union wage
settlements: if   policymakers   find it optimal to ratify the over-
hang of   past deferred wage increases in the hope that negotiators will

begin to adjust their wage demands in the future, they will also

find it optimal to ratify the deferred wage increases in the future

if these adjustments do not take place.

1. Sachs (1979) has tabulated the different institutional arrange-

    ments for wage determination in the U. S. and several other

    countries. Branson and Rotemberg (1980), and Gordon (1982)

    have presented econometric estimates which suggest that

    aggregate wage inflation has more inertia in the U. S.

    U. S. collective bargaining.

3. A recent critical analysis of the pattern bargaining hypothesis

    is reported in Mitchell (1980), pp. 163—207.

4. As is described in more detail below, the disinflation similations

    are made as if the major union sector constituted the entire

    U. S. labor force. Since long—term contracts are more prevalent

    in the major union sector, the results are likely to be biased

    toward slow adjustment, and a useful extension of the model would

   be to consider an adjustment for such bias.

5. Such a path also exists for the more elementary models of

   wage contracts and has been explored by Phelps (1979).

6. The data is kept on file at the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

   Summaries and cross tabulations are reported in various issues

   of Current Wage Developments.

7. It should be emphasized, however, that this group may not be

   representative of workers in the U. S. where one—year implicit
                                     — 22 —




      contracts   seem to dominate most wage setting situations.

 8.   For a recent empirical investigation see Flanagan (1976).

 9. For forecasting purposes, it might be useful to incorporate

      the actual distribution during the forecasting period.

10. Although the data in Table 2 was used only as a general guide

      in designing the model, as a rough check on the adequacy of this

      aggregation procedure, we compared the behavior of the effective

      ge change as estimated using these aggregation assumptions

      and the data in Table 2 with the actual effective wage change

      compiled   by BLS using the full file on individual union settle
      ments. Although there were some discrepancies, our estimated
      series matched the major movements in the actual series. Pre-
      liminary   work with an   aggregation scheme which does not dis
      tinguish   between contracts of different length (i.e., an aggregate

      of all settlements in a given quarter) and which lumped all de-

      ferred increases into a single change over—thelife" of the

      contract, did not prove successful in generating a reasonable

      effective wage change series. Hence, it appears that a level of

      disaggregation at least as fine as that chosen here is necessary

      to achieve a satisfactory degree of accuracy.

11. Note that wages are set to equal the prevailing wage ex ante

      in equations (5) through (7), Surprise movements in other

      workers' wages may disrupt this goal, so that ex post there may

      be relative wage gains or losses. An unsettled issue is whether

      workers might try to "overtake" rather than just "catch—up" to

      other workers in order to make up these losses; such "overtaking"
                                         — 23 —




     is   ruled out by     the   behavioral assumptions in this model.

12. Rather than assume that a fraction of workers have indexed

     contracts, we assume that all workers are indexed though at

     a lower rate. For example, if 50 percent of the workers have

     contracts indexed at .6, then this is treated in the model as

     if 100 percent of the workers have contracts indexed at .3.

13. This corresponds to Phelps (1969) result for the elementary

     staggered contracts model. The details of the solution procedure

     are as follows. We added m(t) —          w(t)   k to the right—hand

     side of equations (5) through (7) and solved the model for a

     given m(t) path. We then summed up the squared differences

     [m(t) —   w(t)   —   k]2    over the solution period, and search over

     m(t) paths using the DFP algorithm to minimize the sum of squares.

     The minimum value was always zero. Clearly when m(t) — w(t) —           k   =   0,
     full employment conditions hold.

13. Specifically we assume that this begins at the negotiation time

     for the first cohort of those signing one—year contracts, for the

     fifth cohort of those signing two—year contracts, and the first

    cohort of those signing three—year contracts. See Table 5.

14. The entries in this last column were fluctuating seasonally accord-

    ing to the steady quarterly pattern 1.06, 2.66, 3,95, 2.33,

    before the disinflation began.

15. Phelps (1980) has considered these issues in the context of

    theoretical models of wage contracting.
