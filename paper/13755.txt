Minimally Altruistic Wages and Unemployment in a Matching Model

NBER Working Paper No. 13755

JEL No. D64,E24,J30,J64

                                           ABSTRACT

This paper presents a model in which firms recruit both unemployed and employed workers by posting
vacancies. Firms act monopsonistically and set wages to retain their existing workers as well as to
attract new ones. The model differs from Burdett and Mortensen (1998) in that its assumptions ensure
that there is an equilibrium where all firms pay the same wage. The paper analyzes the response of
this wage to exogenous changes in the marginal revenue product of labor. The paper finds parameters
for which the response of wages is modest relative to the response of employment, as appears to be
the case in U.S. data and shows that the insistence by workers that firms act with a minimal level of
altruism can be a source of dampened wage responses. The paper also considers a setting where this
minimal level of altruism is subject to fluctuations and shows that, for certain parameters, the model
can explain both the standard deviations of employment and wages and the correlation between these
two series over time.

       Job vacancies drop considerably in recessions, suggesting that recruitment costs are quite
procyclical. As emphasized by Rotemberg (2007b) in the context of the Mortensen-Pissarides
(1994) model, the procyclicality of recruitment costs implies that real wages should be much
more procyclical than they actually are. The model makes this prediction because the ease
with which firms can recruit workers in recessions strengthens firms’ bargaining position so
that Nash bargaining between firms and workers leads to substantially lower wages.
       This paper departs from the Mortensen and Pissarides (1994) model in several respects.
First, instead of assuming that wages are determined by a bargaining process, it assumes
that firms set wages unilaterally. As in Burdett and Mortensen (1998), firms act somewhat
monopsonistically in the model developed here. They realize, in particular, that reductions
in their wages lead only some of their to employees to depart. In efficiency wage terms, the
model of this paper is thus “turnover” based.1
       The result of this wage-setting assumption is that, unlike in the bargaining case, em-
ployee’s reservation wages no longer matter for wage determination. Instead, wages are
greatly affected by the way employees weigh wage and nonwage aspects of a job when de-
ciding among job opportunities. Nonwage aspects of jobs, and their role in creating job
satisfaction, are stressed in the managerial literature on “voluntary turnover,” and they
also play a role in the model of Nagypál (2005) that tries to explain the magnitude of this
turnover.2
       This paper also extends the canonical Mortensen and Pissarides (1994) model by con-
sidering not only a specification in which firms act selfishly but also one in which firms
act somewhat altruistically. This specification is motivated by Rotemberg (2007a), which
explains ultimatum and dictator experiments with a model where people react with anger

     For a discussion of efficiency-wage models in general and their division into models based on reducing
shirking, reducing turnover, improving selection, and increasing effort as a result of fairness considerations,
see Katz (1986).
   2
     For a discussion of the managerial literature, see Price (2001). Using exit interviews from a firm that
experienced a great deal of turnover, Sutherland (2002) found that most people who left this firm for another
job claimed that their reason for doing so was either higher wages or the opportunity to earn more overtime.
Still, even in this case, 18 of the 48 people who left for another job reported doing so for other reasons.
One difficulty with studying the sources of quits is that, as noted by Hinrich (1975), exit interviews do not
provide the same answers as questionnaires on people’s intention to quit.

when they observe someone acting with insufficient altruism. The underlying idea behind
this model is that people expect those with whom they interact to have a minimal level
of altruism and that, while they initially assume at least a minimally acceptable level of
altruism on the part of others, they get angry when people demonstrate a degree of altru-
ism below this minimal level. Several previous models of fairness, most notably Fehr and
Schmidt (1999) and Levine (1998), have been proposed to explain these experimental out-
comes, but Rotemberg (2007a) argues that they can do so only with implausible preference
parameters that are contradicted by other experiments. In contrast, when people’s reaction
to insufficient altruism is suitably strong, these experiments can be explained with plausibly
small degrees of altruism as in Rotemberg (2007a).3
       One reason to be interested in this particular model of fairness in the labor context is
that there are many recorded instances of workers who lashed out at their employer (or
ex-employer in the case of wrongful termination lawsuits) after feeling mistreated (Akerlof
and Yellen 1990, Rotemberg 2006). Bewley (1999) provides some evidence that firms are
concerned about these potential reactions. In his survey asking firms why they did not
cut wages in a recession, the most common answer was that “pay cuts hurt morale and
demotivate workers” (Bewley 1999, p. 174). However, the relationship may be asymmetric:
Rotemberg (2006) finds very little field evidence that workers increase their effort when they
face better-than-normal conditions of employment.4
       The model I propose should complement the literature that incorporates fair wage con-
siderations into macroeconomic models, much of which is also inspired by Bewley (1999).
This literature follows Akerlof’s (1982) gift-exchange model in which workers’ effort depends
   3
     There is, interestingly, also direct neurological evidence for this approach. Several investigators, including
Morrison et al. (2004) show that pain-related areas of the brain become activated not only when a painful
impulse is applied to a person but also when a person sees that someone else is being subjected to this
impulse. This “mirror-neuron” response of observers turns out to depend on the altruism that the person
being observed has evinced in the past. As shown by Singer et al. (2006), the neural response of subjects
when they see someone receive an electric shock are smaller when that person has previously been observed
making a low offer in a variant of a dictator game.
   4
     The field experiments of Gneezy and List (2006) show that high wages motivate workers only for a very
short period of time. Consistent with this, Akerlof and Yellen (1990) assume that effort reacts to wages only
when wages are below their reference level.



                                                        2
on the difference between the wage they receive and a reference wage. In the application
of this idea to macroeconomics, several distinct models of the reference wage have been
proposed. Danthine and Donaldson (1990) and Chéron (2002) assume that the reference
wage equals a geometric weighted average of the wage paid by other firms and the level of
income received by self-employed individuals, with the latter having a weight equal to the
unemployment rate. Collard and de la Croix (2000) and Danthine and Kurmann (2004)
assume instead that past wages are also an important component of the reference wage.5
This obviously introduces additional wage stickiness. Lastly, Danthine and Kurmann (2006)
lets effort depend on the relationship between the wage that the firm offers and the level of
labor productivity, on the grounds that the latter represents the firm’s capacity to pay. This
specification is somewhat related, though by no means identical, to Rabin (1993).
      Aside from avoiding the difficult problem of specifying reference wages, the altruism-
based model proposed here has the advantage of enabling straightforward consideration of
the limit at which workers do not impose any fairness considerations on firms. It seems
harder to consider this limit in models in which effort depends continuously on the wage
offered by firms. A second advantage of focusing on outcomes in which firms are somewhat
altruistic towards their workers is that this approach matches the content of at least some
companies’ mission statements. In the compilation of such statements in Abrahams (1995),
several companies promise to “‘care” for their employees. Gibson Greetings’ statement, for
example, says “We are a team... We trust, respect and care for each other” (Abrahams 1995,
p. 296.) Similarly, Tultex’s statement of values tells employees “We will create, through the
contributions of each of us, a quality of worklife that is recognized by the caring, openness
and understanding of each other” (Abrahams 1995, p. 549.) In a slightly different vein,
but also consistent with some form of altruism, Johnson & Johnson’s corporate “credo”
reads (in part) “We are responsible to our employees, the men and women who work with
us throughout the world . . . We must be mindful of ways to help our employees fulfill their
family responsibilities.” These statements may be irrelevant, though some effort does appear
  5
      This point of view is adopted also by Kahneman, Knetch, and Thaler (1986).


                                                    3
to go into their creation and dissemination. They may also be seen as profit-maximizing
strategies for recruiting good employees. Even in that case, the statements suggest that the
analysis of firms that pretend to be altruistic may be valuable.
   A final advantage of studying firms that are (or pretend to be) altruistic is that it allows
one to consider a new source of wage and employment fluctuations. These variables respond,
in particular, to changes in the level of altruism required by workers. When required altruism
rises, wages rise and this leads firms to curtail their employment. This force thus induces
a negative correlation between real wages and employment and thus serves to dampen the
positive correlation induced by the technology shocks considered in Mortensen and Pissarides
(1994) and Shimer (2005).
   Hall (2006) employs a similar device in that he assumes that there are systematic varia-
tions in the bargaining power of workers. One difference between the two approaches is that
Hall (2006) assumes that worker bargaining power is a deterministic function of the state of
the labor market. By letting workers have more power in a slack labor markets model, he
ensures that real wages fluctuate less in his model than they would if bargaining power were
constant. I consider instead a situation where the fluctuations in required altruism (that
induce countercyclical real wages) are not caused by changes in labor market tightness. This
has the advantage of being consistent with the relatively low correlation between wages and
employment.
   The analysis proceeds as follows. Section 1 lays out the basic monopsony model without
firm altruism. While inspired by Burdett and Mortensen (1998), this model differs in that
it has an equilibrium in which all firms pay the same wage. The existence of such an
equilibrium is due (in part) to the assumption that firms have multiple workers and that
the marginal revenue product of labor decreases when firms hire more workers. Thus, a firm
with systematically high wages keeps growing by attracting new workers and thereby finds
itself with more workers than is optimal. In Burdett and Mortensen (1998) this effect is
absent because each firm can accommodate at most a single worker (and must keep its wage
high after attracting a worker because it is committed to a policy of constant wages).


                                              4
    Section 2 rationalizes a model with minimal firm altruism and derives its equilibrium
properties. Section 3 explains the numerical values assigned to the model’s parameters
in the simulations whose results are reported in Section 4. Section 5 adds post-matching
training costs. As Silva and Toledo (2006) have shown, such training costs tend to improve
the performance of matching models when wages are set via bargaining. Training costs are
conceptually just as important when firms act monopsonistically, since firms can reduce their
training costs by raising wages so that employees remain at the firm. Unsurprisingly, the
introduction of these costs affects the quantitative performance of this model as well. Section
6 concludes.

The utility of worker j when employed by firm i is assumed to be

discount rate of workers, xij
                           t is the individual’s nonpecuniary utility from working at i (set

equal to xu if he were unemployed), while Ctj is an index of the individual’s purchases of a
variety of different products.
    Specifically, the index Ctj is given by the Dixit-Stiglitz aggregator

                                                         t is the quantity of good i bought

by j at time t. If this individual’s nominal spending at t is Stj and the price of good i at t
is pit , his utility is maximized when his individual purchases satisfy

      Using (2) and (3), it follows that the consumption index satisfies

                                            Ctj = Stj /p̄t .                                     (5)

      I assume that workers neither borrow or lend. This assumption becomes more plausible if
one assumes that workers have discount rates that exceed equilibrium interest rates (so that
they would like to borrow at current rates) while also assuming that bankruptcy provisions
allow them to escape from debt obligations. The result is that no one lends to them in
equilibrium. In practice, Kenickel, Starr-McCluer, and Sundén (1997) report that only
about 10 percent of U.S. households had no financial assets in 1992. Over half, however, had
no asset other than a “transactions account,” and some workers may exhaust these accounts
right before they receive their paychecks.6
      Since workers neither borrow nor lend, worker j’s real purchases Stj /p̄t equal his real
wage wtj when he is employed. When the worker is unemployed, his real consumption equals
the level of unemployment insurance Cu . The lack of borrowing and lending also implies
that the discount rate ρw is unimportant. The curvature parameter γ, by contrast, is shown
to be important below. To further simplify the analysis, I assume that expenditures on
unemployment insurance are financed by lump-sum taxes levied on the owners of firms.
      For unemployed workers, the nonpecuniary compensation x can be set to an arbitrary
value xu . In the case of employed workers, an important assumption for the analysis is that
each worker expects his own x to vary over time. This variability could capture changes
in people’s preferred locations. Or it could be due more generally to changes in individ-
ual tastes for the particular amenities offered by any particular employer. As stressed by
Nagypál (2005), this variability provides a rationale for worker mobility from job to job.
This is particularly important in the current model, because I concentrate on equilibria with
symmetric wages. When all firms pay the same wage, workers who care only about wages
have no reason to change employers.
  6
    While some borrowing, particularly “payday borrowing,” seems possible even for households without
financial assets, its scope may well be limited.



                                                   6
   The owner of firm i is assumed to choose her consumption path to maximize
                                                       ∞
                                                       X
                                                  Et          ρτ Cti ,                                (6)
                                                       τ =0

where Cti is the Dixit-Stiglitz aggregator introduced above and ρ is the owner’s discount rate.
The linearity of these preferences has two consequences. First, if owners can borrow and
lend at the nominal rate of interest it , it implies

                                                           p̄t (1 + it )
                                             1 = Et ρ                    .                            (7)
                                                                p̄t+1

This keeps owners indifferent between consuming a unit of consumption at t and increasing
consumption at t+1 by (1+it )pt dollars. This indifference must hold at all t if, in equilibrium,
the consumption of owners is positive in each period. Since the wage bill is lower than the
value of all goods produced in each period, owners’ Cti is indeed positive for all t and (7)
must hold. An even more immediate implication of assuming that the owners maximize (6)
is that firms that respond to their owner’s wishes use ρ to discount future profits when they
maximize the present discounted value of profits.
   Firms generate revenues by giving workers productive tasks and selling the proceeds.
The output of individual firm i with hit workers at t is zt f (hit ). When it charges a relative
price of pit /p̄t , its demand is Yt (pit /p̄t )−²t , where Yt are total final sales. Letting the firm set
its price so that it sells the quantity that it has produced, its real revenues at t are thus

                                                               1/²t
                               Rti (hit , Yt , zt , ²t ) = Yt         [zt f (hit )]1−1/²t .           (8)

This implies that the marginal revenue product of labor is
                                                       µ              ¶

                           dht                    ²t

where primes denote derivatives. The marginal revenue product of labor depends positively
on both technical progress zt and on ²t , the extent to which the product market is competitive
at time t. These variables increase labor demand at t, either by making labor more productive
or by reducing the monopolistic distortion that keeps labor demand low.

       Given the discussion above, the firm’s objective at time t is to maximize Πit

                                                      τ =0

where πti , its real profits at t, can be expressed as

                                        πti = Rti − wti hit − κ(vti ).                                  (11)

In this equation, κ represents recruiting costs, while wti and vti are the real wage and the
vacancies posted by firm i at t, respectively. An important assumption in (11) is that the
firm pays the same wage to all its workers. It is standard in turnover efficiency-wage models
to assume that firms do not know the outside opportunities available to their employees, so
it is optimal for them to pay the same wage to all their existing employees. On the other
hand, firms may wish to treat new employees differently from existing ones. Firms with
access to the relevant information may also wish to discriminate among new hires and let
their wage depend on their previous employment status. As a first cut at the problem, I
neglect these possibilities and imagine that each firm feels compelled to pay all its employees
the same wage. In a more complete model, this result might be derived from informational
imperfections and from firms’ desire to demonstrate their altruism.7
       The dynamics of the labor market are similar to those in Mortensen and Pissarides
(1994), with the proviso that firms that post vacancies attract both unemployed and currently
employed individuals, as in the job-to-job transition models of Krause and Lubik (2005) and
Nagypál (2005). Normalizing the labor force to equal one, let ht represent employment while
   7
    Levine (1993) provides evidence that the structure of wages within job ladders (that is, across seniority
for people doing similar tasks) is quite rigid. The compensation executives interviewed by Levine (1993)
were unwilling to institute significant changes in relative wages within an occupation even when they were
told that these relative wages had changed in the outside labor market. Quoting an executive, Levine (1993,
p. 1256) says “If you pay new workers more than senior ones, ‘You will have an employee revolt on your
hands.’” One cost borne by an existing employee when a new employee is brought in at a higher wage is that
the employee regrets not having sought alternative employment at an earlier date. An altruistic firm might
want to spare its employee this regret cost, and one way of doing so is to maintain a rigid wage structure.
  It is also worth noting that one of the issues that led to the unsafe tires discussed in Krueger and Mas
(2004) was the attempt by Firestone to lower the wages of new employees by 30 percent. For additional
discussions of the fairness benefits of paying new workers the same as existing ones, see Akerlof and Yellen
(1990) Bewley (1999).

ut equals the number of unemployed workers. Thus

                                                  ht + ut = 1                                               (12)

       Unemployed people are assumed to meet open vacancies randomly. Letting vt denote the
total vacancies posted by firms at t, the total number of meetings between the unemployed
at t − 1 and firms at t can be expressed as
                                                         Ã          !η
                                                              vt
                                            mut = ut−1                   .                                  (13)
                                                             ut−1

       This equation does not include a constant because the level of vacancies can be nor-
malized, rendering this constant unnecessary. This is identical to the matching function in
Mortensen and Pissarides (1994). I assume that the nonpecuniary utility of a particular
individual at a job xij
                     t is independently distributed over time and independent across indi-

viduals. This means that, as long as the equilibrium wage wt and the lowest possible level
of x on the job (xe ) satisfy

                                      (wt )1−γ        (Cu )1−γ

any person who meets an open vacancy chooses to become employed. Assuming a constant
rate s at which workers leave jobs for unemployment,8 the meeting function (13) implies that
employment evolves according to
                                                                    Ã            !η

                                    ht = (1 − s)ht−1 + ut−1                           .                     (14)
                                                                        ut−1

       Analogously to the meetings function for unemployed individuals, the number of meetings
at t between employers and people who were employed at t − 1 can be written as
                                                            Ã          !`
                                                                 vt
                                           mht   = m̄ht−1                    ,                              (15)
                                                                ht−1

     The use of a constant separation probability s simplifies the analysis. In the United States, this separation
rate does tend to rise somewhat in recessions. As a result, (14) overstates the extent to which vacancies need
to rise in booms if η is calibrated to match the relationship between the exit rate from unemployment and
the v/u ratio, as in Shimer (2005). As I discuss below, this leads me to use Mortensen and Nagypál’s (2005)
value for η.

                                           t represent the total number of firm i employ-

ees who meet new potential employers at t. The probability that a particular employee
will encounter a potential employer ought not to depend on his original employer’s size.
Therefore,

The approximation in the second line is valid when each firm represents only a small fraction
of total employment, because this situation implies that the product of vti /vt and hit /ht is
vanishingly small.

equilibrium where all firms offer the same wage. I thus assume that workers expect all firms
to offer the same wage in the future, and I compute conditions under which firms also desire

uses Fti to denote F ([(wti )1−γ − (w̃t )1−γ ]/[1 − γ]).
   I now study the profit-maximizing choices of wage and vacancy rates. To carry out this
analysis, I use (10) and (11) to rewrite the expected present value of profits as

    Πit = Rti (hit ) − wti hit − κ(vti ) + Et ρ(Rt+1
                                                 i      i
                                                     − wt+1 hit+1 − κ(vt+1
                                                                       i
                                                                           )) + Et ρ2 Πit+2 (hit+1 ).                (22)

   Since the firm is unable to influence workers’ beliefs concerning future wages, its choice
    i        i
of wt+j and vt+j affects profits only from t + j onwards. It follows from (22) that, if the
firm were able to choose the state-contingent levels of future wages and vacancies at t, it
would choose the same levels as would be chosen at future dates. The time-consistency of
the firm’s problem implies that an optimizing firm at t should not be able to increase Πit by
                         i
varying wti , vti , and vt+1 , while keeping constant its plan for future levels of the hi s. For the
state contingent value of hit+1 to stay the same in spite of changes in wages and vacancies

at t, vacancies at t + 1 must respond. Equation (21) can be used to compute the requisite
              i
variation in vt+1 . This is given by
                                     Ã                                                         !

       Because I consider the possibility that the vacancy cost function κ is concave, it is
particularly important to check the second-order conditions with respect to vacancies.9 These
   9
     Another second order condition that may of interest involves changing the wage simultaneously with the
level of vacancies. Rather than simply increasing wages and reducing vacancies while keeping employment
constant to first order (as is implicitly allowed for by combining (28) and (29), one can ask whether profits
fall if this is done further. I demonstrate that this second order is satisfied in an appendix available upon
request

conditions are necessary to prevent firms from preferring an oscillation between high and low
vacancy levels, which lowers average recruitment costs when κ00 < 0. Since the left-hand side
of (25) represents the derivative of profits with respect to vacancies, the second derivative of
profits with respect to vacancies can be obtained by differentiating this expression:
                                                                     Ã          !2

   This second derivative must be negative for the second-order condition to be satisfied.

This equation admits of a solution where employment, wages, and vacancies at t are the
same for all firms (equal to ht , wt , and vt , respectively). At this symmetric solution, Fti must
be equal to F (0), and, since F (y) = 1 − F (−y), F (0) = 1/2. Using F̄ 0 to denote the value
of F 0 (0), (32) becomes

The symmetric equilibrium values of wt , vt , ht , and ut must thus satisfy the four equations
(12), (14), (33), and (34). As long as the total number of firms is normalized to equal one,
aggregate sales at this equilibrium Yt equal the sales of each individual firm.
   One interesting special case occurs when workers have a constant marginal utility of
income, so γ = 0. In this case, (33) determines the level of vacancies at t for a given level

                                                                            13
of past employment ht−1 . Thus, employment is unaffected by dR/dh, the extent to which
firms benefit from an additional employee. Rather, (34) implies that changes in dR/dh are
simply reflected in wage changes.
      Given that workers consume all of their income, the parameter γ does not affect in-
tertemporal choices. It does, however, affect the relationship between the individual’s wage
(or income) and the number of dollars an individual is willing to give up for an additional
unit of nonpecuniary consumption. When γ = 0, the wage has no effect on this number.
From the point of view of firms, this means that the number of additional workers that
firms retain by raising the wage by one dollar is independent of the equilibrium wage and
depends only on the tightness of the labor market. At the same time, the number of extra
workers that firms attracts by posting an additional vacancy also depends on the tightness
of the labor market. Thus, the requirement that the firm be indifferent between attracting
an additional worker through extra vacancies and attracting the worker by raising the wage
determines the equilibrium level of labor market tightness and thus the level of employment.


2       Required Firm Altruism
One attractive feature of the monopsony model just described is that wages are clearly
set by firms, so workers are able to determine their employer’s attitude from the wages
she pays. Workers are, in particular, able to form an opinion about the altruism of their
employer. This fits both with common parlance (where the term “good employer” is often
used) and with the model of Rotemberg (2007a).10 In that model, the people who are
affected by a decision use their information to assess the altruism of the decision-maker. If
the affected party can reject the hypothesis that the decision-maker is minimally altruistic,
he becomes angry. In other words, his utility function changes so that he now derives utility
from harming the decision-maker. The opportunities available for workers to harm their
employers are quite numerous, since workers have ready access to their employers’ assets.
Indeed, workers have been observed to cause losses to their employers on several occasions.

      Typing “good employer” in Google returns about 250,000 hits.


                                                    14
Krueger and Mas (2004), for instance, show that unhappy workers at a plant in Decatur
were disproportionately to blame for the defective Firestone tires that were linked to Ford
Explorer rollovers.11
       As discussed earlier, the idea that firms wish to be perceived as altruistic towards their
workers fits with numerous corporate mission statements. One might imagine that people
expect firms to be differentially altruistic towards different employees, with particularly high
altruism reserved for employees who have been at the firm longer. While it is subject to
alternate interpretations, the use of seniority to determine who should be laid off might be
ascribable in part to a desire by firms to appear as if they cared more for employees with more
seniority. Some evidence that is somewhat consistent with this interpretation is provided by
Lee (2004). He points out that seniority rules for layoffs were introduced historically in the
United States at the request of workers, who viewed these rules as being fairer than those
that employers had used earlier.
       I thus consider both the case where firms act as if they cared about all employees equally
and the one where they act as if they were directly concerned only with those that have
already been at the firm in period t − 1. Since I impose the condition that wages have to be
the same for old and new employees, new employees also benefit from firm altruism in this
latter case. Let firm i’s actual altruism for all employees be denoted by λ̃Ai while its actual
altruism for its more senior employees is denoted by λ̃Ii . These altruism parameters are the
firm’s “types.” At each point in time, these are drawn from discrete distributions so that,
with j equal to either A or I, the probability that a firm’s altruism λ̃ji equals λ̄ at t equals
djt (λ̄).
       An altruistic firm derives vicarious welfare from the welfare of its employees. To ensure
that this vicarious welfare rises only if the employee is better off at i than he would be else-
where, I let the utility of altruistic firms depend on the average difference between employees’
material welfare at i and the material welfare these employees would have elsewhere. For any
  11
    See Rotemberg (2006) for further examples of harm caused by angry employees including wildcat strikes
and increases in employee theft.

particular employee, this difference depends on whether he has access to an alternate offer
or not. If he does not, his instantaneous material payoffs would equal [(Cu )1−γ /(1 − γ) + xu ]
if he lost his employment at i. Since the xs are independent across employees, the expected
difference for employees at i who do not have access to alternate employment is ψ 1i , where

                                                (wti )1−γ − (Cu )1−γ
                                      ψt1i =                         + x̄ − xu ,
                                                        1−γ

and x̄ denotes the unconditional mean of x.
   Now consider the welfare gains from having access to the job at i for employees who
also have access to an alternate job with a wage of w̄t . It is convenient to consider the
expected gains of an employee before he knows either xi or xj , the nonpecuniary benefits at
the alternate job. At this point, the employee does know that he will remain at i only if (20)
is satisfied. His expected gain from also having the job at i can therefore be written as

where g is the density of x. Since this individual decides to stay at firm i with probability Fti
and derives no utility from the job at i if he decides to leave, his expected gain from having
access to i’s job, conditional on staying, is ψt21 /Fti . This is also the average gain in material
payoffs across the employees who stay and have alternate employment opportunities.
   Depending on whether they have access to an alternate offer or not and whether they are
incumbents at the firm or are new hires, employees fall into four categories. Their respective
contribution to employment can be seen in equation (21), where the ones with outside offers
are captured by the terms that include Fti , while the last full term represents new hires.
Using (13) and (15), the expected material payoff gain of the incumbent employees at time

the firm’s employment and wages, only the former also depends directly on the firm’s own

The sign of this derivative is positive. By increasing vacancies, firm i raises the welfare
of both the unemployed people who thereby obtain jobs and the employed people at other
firms who decide to move because firm i offers them a better package of wage and nonwage
compensation.
   Now imagine that firm i maximizes

In this equation, λA and λI are the altruism parameters that govern the firm’s behavior. As
discussed below, they need not equal the firm’s actual altruism parameters. Using the logic
that leads to (24), Π̃it can be written as

In equation (40), the derivative of χAi
                                     t with respect to the wage has been set to the marginal

utility of income (wti )−γ multiplied by employment hit , while the derivative of χIi
                                                                                   t with respect

to the wage has been set equal to the expression in curly brackets. The validity of these
substitutions is demonstrated in Appendix 1.
       Since the second line of (41) is independent of v i or hi , the expression for the second
derivative of Π̃ with respect to v is the same as that for the second derivative of Π with
respect to v. Thus, the discussion of second-order conditions for the nonaltruistic case
remains valid here as well. Taking the ratio of (39) and (40), while using (15), (28), and
(29), one obtains

       An increase in firm altruism λI lowers the denominator of this expression so that, with
γ > 0, wti must rise to maintain this equality. Similarly, higher values of λA require higher
wages as long as ωti is small.12 This means that workers obtain information about the
altruism parameter that governs firm behavior from the wage that the firm pays. Following
Rotemberg (2007a), assume that workers care about this parameter and become angry if it
is demonstrably too low. Simplifying Rotemberg (2007a) somewhat, assume that workers’
altruism towards firm i at t is given by the function

                                                               ξ(λ̂it , λ̄t ).
  12
    For the parameters considered below, ω is indeed small enough that the right-hand side of (42) rises
with λA .

                                                                     18
In this function, λ̂i represents all the information that workers have about firm i’s altruism
parameters, while λ̄ represents the worker’s altruism threshold. In general, λ̂i need not
be a scalar and can include a wide range of data. Here, I specialize and give workers full
information about the firm’s actions and environment.
   If, using a test of size α, the information in λ̂i allows workers to reject the hypothesis that
λ̃Ai (or λ̃Ii ) is equal to at least λ̄, ξ is equal to a large negative number. If, instead, workers
are unable to reject the (statistical) hypothesis that their employer is minimally benevolent,
ξ equals zero. Workers thus give employers the benefit of the doubt, and this means that it
can be profitable for selfish firms to act as if they were altruistic.
   A negative ξ implies that a worker is willing to incur a cost of |ξ| units in exchange for a
reduction in employer utility of one unit. Given that workers have numerous opportunities
for causing harm to their employers, a large negative ξ should prove costly to firms. While
I do not model the nature of these costs explicitly, I assume that they equal Ξ.
   I now turn to the equilibrium determination of wages in the case where λ̃Ai = 0 for all
firms while λ̃Ii has a nondegenerate distribution with dIt (λ̄) = α. The same arguments apply
to the case where λ̃I = 0 for all firms while λ̃Ai has a nondegenerate distribution, as long
as ωti is either negative or small in absolute value, so I do not deal with this case explicitly.
Consider then an allocation where all firms with λ̃Ii ≤ λ∗ set a wage given by (42) with
λI = λ∗ , and all others set it with λI = λ̃Ii . It is immediately apparent that, for sufficiently
large Ξ, such an allocation cannot be an equilibrium unless λ∗ ≥ λ̄. If, instead, λ∗ < λ̄, some
firms would pay a wage that corresponds to an altruism level below λ̄, incurring the cost Ξ
by identifying themselves as insufficiently altruistic.
   In contrast, allocations where λ∗ ≥ λ̄ are equilibria as long as firms believe that lower
wages will identify them as having λ̃Ii < λ̄. The reason is that a test with size α does not
reject the hypothesis that firms paying the wage implied by λ∗ have an altruism parameter
of λ̄. Thus, ξ is zero for all firms paying this wage. Similarly, the hypothesis is not rejected
for firms whose wage is even higher, because their λ̃Ii exceeds λ∗ .
   It should be noted that, in the case of λ∗ > λ̄, the equilibrium beliefs above are not


                                                19
“reasonable,” in the sense that genuinely altruistic firms with λ̃Ii = λ̄ would want to pay
a lower wage. These equilibria with excessively high wages can be eliminated under some
additional assumptions. Assume, in particular, that a fraction a of firms with λ̃Ii = λ̄
believe that they have already demonstrated their true altruism parameter in other ways,
so they can set any wage they wish without fear of reprisal. Assume, on the other hand,
that workers do not see these additional signals even though they know that some altruistic
firms are naive in the manner just described. Now, consider a firm that deviates from a
proposed equilibrium with λ∗ > λ̄ by paying the wage that corresponds to λ̃Ii = λ̄. Using a
test of size of aα, workers are unable to reject the hypothesis that this firm has an altruism
parameter of λ̄. Thus, at least for this significance level, workers do not punish such a firm.
This eliminates all equilibria with λ∗ > λ̄ so the only equilibrium has λ∗ = λ̄.
   The analysis is simplified by assuming not only that naive altruistic firms are not punished
but by also assuming that no firm has an altruism parameter λ̃Ii that strictly exceeds λ̄.
This ensures that the only equilibrium is symmetric, with all firms acting as if λI in (42)
were equal to λ̄. As discussed above, a similar analysis applies when λ̃Ii = 0 for all firms
while λ̃Ai varies. I focus on outcomes where only one of the λj s is zero, while the other is
equal to λjt , with j equal to A or I. At symmetric equilibria of this type, (42) becomes

which is the analogue of (34) in the case where firms act altruistically. In this equation,
increases in λA and λI reduce the marginal revenue product of labor for a given wage and

                                                                               20
recruitment cost. Since an altruistic firm derives utility from its employment, it hires more
workers than a selfish firm and thereby reduces its marginal revenue product.
    Equations (43) and (44) go beyond the previous analysis in two ways. First, they add
time subscripts to the altruism parameters λA and λI . For these parameters to be varying
for all firms at the same time, one would have to assume that workers form new judgments
about their employers in each period and that their required level of altruism (as well as
the altruism of the most altruistic firms) is time varying. The implications of these rather
strong assumptions are considered further below.
    Second, (44) assumes that the number of employees and the number of vacancies posted
are also used as signals of a firm’s altruism. This is consistent with the full information
assumptions I have made, though the dependence of current vacancies on the expected
future altruism of the firm raises the question of whether workers at time t insist that this
altruism be equal to their current or their expected future λ̄. A second complication with
letting workers base their altruism judgments on the level of vacancies is that, while the wage
in (42) depends only on overall labor market conditions and the firm’s share of employment
and vacancies, the level of vacancies also depends on the productive opportunities available
to the firm. Workers’ information about these opportunities is likely to be much poorer
than that of employers, and workers may thus be unable to use vacancy data effectively to
judge a firm’s altruism. While a full analysis of this informational difficulty is beyond the
scope of this paper, I consider a simple alternative where firms set vacancies at the profit-
maximizing level. In other words, all the λ parameters in (44) are set equal to zero. This
yields a good approximation to the equilibrium where firms choose their vacancies without
being concerned with worker reactions, as long as most firms are indeed selfish (so that the
number of truly altruistic firms is fairly small).


3     Choice of Parameters
A disadvantage of this model relative to the Mortensen-Pissarides model is that more of
its parameters seem difficult to calibrate on the basis of microeconomic or steady-state

                                               21
observations. The parameters of the model are ρ, η, γ, s, m̄, `, F̄ 0 , and ψ 2 , while the
variables are u, h, v, w, dR/dh, κ0 , ω, ψ 1 , λA , and λI . To study the effect of shocks, one
must calibrate the steady-state value of many of these variables. Both the baseline and some
alternative values for the relevant parameters are displayed in Table 1.
   One purpose of studying a model with minimal altruism is to ascertain whether relatively
small degrees of altruism (or of altruism variation) can produce important consequences.
Thus, my baseline assumes that firms are selfish, so λA = λI = 0. I then compare the
results of this baseline with the situation where, on average, either λA or λI is equal to 0.4.
While this is a nontrivial level of altruism, it is important to stress that it would not lead
an employer to be willing to donate money to employees without receiving something in
return. Employers would, however, be willing to give a dollar to their employees if this led
the employees to receive $2.50.
   I treat the length of the period as being equal to one month and therefore choose ρ =
0.996, as in Shimer (2005). I also follow Shimer (2005) and set s = 0.034. According to
Shimer (2005), the average job-finding rate for the unemployed is 0.45. This should equal
the steady-state value of (v/u)η . Using (12) and (14), this implies that the steady-state rate
of unemployment is s/(s + (v/u)η ). Knowing η as well as the steady-state job-finding rate
(v/u)η , this formula for steady-state unemployment allows one to compute the steady-state
value of vacancies.
   Shimer (2005) and Mortensen and Nagypál (2005) calibrate the parameter η rather dif-
ferently, with the former choosing a value of 0.28, and the latter a value of 0.54. In effect,
Shimer (2005) uses the regression coefficient of the vacancy-unemployment ratio on the job-
finding rate as his estimate of 1/η, so he is treating the equality between the finding rate and
(v/u)η as an estimating equation. Mortensen and Nagypál (2005) calibrate this parameter
instead by considering the regression of vacancies on the unemployment rate itself. This
second regression is essentially equivalent to a regression of v/u on the finding rate, where
the finding rate is measured in such a way that its movements rationalize all unemployment
fluctuations. Since this relationship would require that the finding rate be somewhat more


                                              22
procyclical than it actually is, the resulting estimate of 1/η is smaller, and the estimated
value of η larger. I adopt the value of 0.54 in this paper, because, by capturing the magnitude
of the rise in vacancies resulting from a rise in employment, this parameter value is likely to
reflect more accurately the extent to which the marginal cost of hiring rises in booms.
   Because I am unaware of estimates of the matching function of the currently employed
with new employers, I set ` = η, so the elasticity of this matching function with respect
to vacancies is the same as the corresponding elasticity of matching between firms and
unemployed workers. The constant m̄ is based on Nagypál (2005), who shows that the
total volume of job-to-job transitions is equal to about twice the number of people who
become unemployed by separating from their employer. At a symmetric equilibrium, half
the workers who find alternate employment accept it. This means that the total number of
matches between employed workers and potential future employers, which equal m̄h(v/h)` ,
should equal 4s. This pins down m̄, because the calculations above provide the steady-state
values of h and v.
   Silva and Toledo (2006) use micro evidence to obtain an estimate of the average cost of
recruiting one worker. Their cost estimate is about 0.12 times the amount the individual
is paid in one month, and I thus set κ0 /w(dh/dv) equal to this value. Given the lack of
absolute measures of κ0 , ψ, and dR/dh, observations of the steady-state wage w do not help
to determine the parameters in (34) or in (44). Similarly, because the absolute value of
κ0 is unobservable, the observability of the steady-state w does not help to determine any
parameters that appear in (33) or in (43). Therefore, I normalize this average wage and set
it equal to 1.
   As in Rotemberg (2007b), I let marginal vacancy costs depend on the level of vacancies.
I consider, in particular, the recruitment cost-function

                                       κ(vti ) = κ0 (vti )ζv ,

where the standard constant-cost case obtains when ζv = 1. Rotemberg (2007b) argues that
the assumption that the vacancy-posting function has increasing returns to scale (so ζv < 1)


                                                23
makes it easier to rationalize the cyclical behavior of wages with the Mortensen-Pissarides
(1994) model. In the United States, vacancies rise sharply in booms, increasing marginal
recruitment costs considerably when ζv = 1. With such a big increase in recruitment costs,
workers are in a particularly strong bargaining position in booms, because their employer
has more to lose from their departure. As a result, wages must rise strongly as well. With
ζv smaller than 1, recruitment costs rises more modestly, and hence wage increases are more
muted. I thus consider both ζv = 1 and ζv = 0.66. This latter value is presented mainly for
illustration.
       When ζv < 1, κ00 < 0 and it becomes important to check the second-order conditions
because the concavity R with respect to h no longer suffices to guarantee this condition. As
can be seen in (31), what is needed in this case is that d2 R/dh2 be smaller than a negative
number that depends on k 00 . I now discuss the parameters that are needed to satisfy this
condition. With ζv = 0.66 and the values of the parameters chosen so far, the right-hand
side of (31) is equal to -0.71. To compute the left-hand side, one must make more specific
assumptions about the production function and the demand conditions facing the typical
firm.
       Assume the firm’s production function f (h) in (8) is given by hb − Φ, where Φ is a fixed
cost and b is a parameter. Using (9), the marginal revenue product at a steady-state equals

                                            Ā[hb − Φ]−1/² hb−1 ,

where ² is the elasticity of demand at the steady state and the constant Ā must be chosen
so the steady-state version of (44) is satisfied. When λA = λI = 0, ² = 3, b = 0.66, and
Φ/hb = 1/3, the left-hand side of inequality (31) equals about -0.76, so (31) is satisfied. The
inequality is violated, however, if the elasticity of demand is made arbitrarily large and fixed
costs are set to zero.13
       These production and demand parameters do not have a direct effect on the comovement
of employment and wages in the case where these variables are affected only by exogenous
  13
     Setting either λA or λI equal to 0.4 changes the Ā that satisfies (44). However, the effect of this on the
left-hand side of (31) is negligible for the baseline parameters.

                                                      24
changes in dR/dg. The reason is that, in this model, fluctuations in the marginal revenue
product of labor have the same effect on h and w regardless of whether they are due to
changes in technology z or changes in the elasticity of demand ². On the other hand, the size
of the changes in z or ² that are needed to justify these changes in dR/dh does depend on
demand and production function parameters. Another reason to calibrate these parameters is
that they are necessary to obtain implications regarding the movement of labor productivity.
   It must be pointed out, however, that the predicted movements in labor productivity
depend also on whether the movements in dR/dh are due to changes in z or to changes
in ². Indeed, in the case where employment changes are due exclusively to changes in ²,
setting b = 0.66 and Φ/hb = 0.4 leads the predicted comovement of labor productivity and
employment to resemble — in certain respects — the observed comovement in the United
States. As reported in Rotemberg (2007b), the regression coefficient of a detrended measure
of U.S. output on a detrended measure of employment has a coefficient of about 1.1. Using
the production function above, a 1 percent increase in h leads to a b/(1 − Φ/hb ) percent
change in output. Thus, the parameters just mentioned lead output to rise by the correct
percentage in response to a typical increase in employment. Unfortunately, the correlation
between labor productivity and employment is relatively low in the United States so changes
in ² cannot explain all the movements in labor productivity. A more promising approach is
to let productivity be affected by a variety of shocks, including changes in ² and z. With
a smaller value of Φ/hb , the former impulse would lead to movements in productivity that
are more countercyclical than the average movements that are observed empirically, while
the latter generally leads to movements that are more procyclical. This decomposition of
productivity movements is beyond the scope of this paper, however.
   The calibration of production and demand parameters is even more important if one
considers changes in firms’ required levels of altruism. An increase in required altruism
always raises real wages. However, the effect of this increase in real wages on the quantity
of labor demanded depends on b, ², and Φ. My baseline calibration for these parameters is
b = 0.75, ² = 3 and Φ = 0.2.


                                             25
   Survey evidence may someday be used to clarify how much typical workers value their
jobs as opposed to the alternative uses of their time. This knowledge might then allow one
to calibrate ψ 1 (the steady-state level of ψt1 ) and ψ 2 . So far, however, the existing evidence
on them is fairly scant. In the case where λA = 0 and λI ≥ 0, ωt does not affect (43), so
this equation links the tightness of the labor market with real wages in a manner that is
independent of ψ 1 and ψ 2 . It then follows that these parameters do not affect the relative
movements of wages and employment when both are being driven by changes in dR/dh. On
the other hand, ψ 1 and ψ 2 have large effects on (44) and thus on the vacancy choices of
altruistic firms. To keep this influence small, I set these parameters to relatively low values.
   Given the parameters chosen so far, one can compute the derivative of the pdf of nonpe-
cuniary benefits on the job F̄ 0 by using the steady-state version of (43). Because the wage
has been normalized to equal 1, this parameter is independent of γ and depends only on κ0 ,
on the λs and ψs, and on the parameters governing the matching of workers to firms. Using
the parameters just described, F̄ 0 equals 28.5, 19.7, and 18.3, depending on, respectively,
whether both λs are set to zero, λA = 0.4 (with λI = 0), or λI = 0.4 (with λA = 0). To gain
an idea of the implications of the value of F̄ 0 , it is worth considering only workers who have
an outside offer and computing the elasticity of their departure with respect to the wage.
For w = 1, this elasticity is given by F̄ 0 /F (0). Thus, the above values of F̄ 0 imply elasticities
greater than 36, which seem rather large.
   The implied value of F̄ 0 is large primarily because κ0 is relatively small. A low κ0 indicates
that wages are large relative to recruiting costs, and in this monopsony model this can be
rationalized only if employees are quite sensitive to wages when choosing whether to stay or
leave. This requires, in turn, that there be a large number of firms whose nonwage features
are comparable with those offered by any given employer, and this corresponds to a high F̄ 0 .
   This leaves the parameter γ, which governs both the substitutability of wage and nonwage
components of a job and the speed at which the marginal utility of income declines with
income. While it is standard to assume log utility γ = 1, the consumption commitments
model of Chetty and Szeidl (2007) can rationalize higher values. I therefore consider a


                                                 26
variety of values, with an eye towards understanding which values of γ fit most easily with
the observed labor market dynamics.


4       Results of Simulations
I consider two different types of simulations. In the first, there are fluctuations in dR/dh
that induce fluctuations in h and w. In the second, there are simultaneous fluctuations in
dR/dh and in either λA or λI . The first type is more similar to the exercise carried out
in Shimer (2005), where there is a single exogenous variable (technology in his case), and
the issue is how well the model reproduces certain features of the data. Shimer (2005) is
particularly concerned with reproducing the cyclical movements in productivity, but, as I
have just discussed, these hinge crucially on the underlying causes of the movements in
dR/dh. I therefore focus only on the relationship between real wages and employment.
      To obtain some analogues of the moments predicted by the model, I detrend monthly
data on the logarithms of total U.S. civilian employment and of the ratio of hourly earnings
of production workers in manufacturing to the consumer price index (CPI). These series are
detrended using the method of Rotemberg (1999), which is designed to keep the covariance
of the detrended value of the series at t and t − k low, while also ensuring that the detrended
value of a series at t is orthogonal to the difference between the trend at t and the average
of the trend at t + v and t − v. Because the series are monthly, k is set equal to 48, while
v is set equal to 15.14 In practice, this method is essentially a band-pass filter that differs
from Hodrick-Prescott in that only relatively low frequencies are allowed into the trend.
      I use data from January 1948 to August 2006. Because the removal of a smooth, two-
sided trend implies that detrended observations near the edges of the sample are inaccurate, I
trim five years of data from the beginning and the end of the series. The resulting detrended
real wage is fairly procyclical, and has a correlation of 0.41 with detrended employment.
Abraham and Haltiwanger (1995) suggest that CPI-deflated hourly earnings are particularly
procyclical relative to other aggregate real wage series. While these series may be somewhat
 14
      These are three times larger than the parameters Rotemberg (1999) recommends for quarterly data.


                                                    27
atypical, the exercise of mimicking their joint movements with the present model should also
be informative about the capacity of the model to match the movements in related series.
   When I consider the effects of a single shock, I am mostly concerned with ascertaining the
model’s capacity to match the “regression coefficient” of wages on employment. As can be
seen in Abraham and Haltiwanger (1995), statistics of this sort are often used to summarize
the extent to which real wages are procyclical. In the two series just discussed, this regression
coefficient equals 0.49. It is slightly larger than the correlation between the series because
the standard deviation of detrended wages is slightly larger than the standard deviation of
detrended employment. The former equals 0.017 while the latter equals 0.014.
   Since the model seeks to explain the movements of employment by the movements of
a single exogenous series, it is actually simpler to postulate a stochastic process for the
detrended employment series and then derive the implied movements in dR/dh. Given that
the first-order serial correlation of detrended employment equals 0.97, let the log of detrended
employment follow
                                      h̃t = 0.97h̃t−1 + eht ,                               (45)

where h̃t is the log difference between employment and steady-state employment, while eht
is an i.i.d. random variable. In the interest of matching the behavior of actual series, let
the standard deviation of eht be equal to 0.0036. This equals the standard error of the
autoregression reported above.
   The four equilibrium conditions — (12), (14), (43) and (44) — can then be solved using
Dynare. The model’s predicted regression coefficients for several different values of the
parameters are reported in Table 2. In addition to reporting regression coefficients of the
log of w on the log of h, Table 2 also reports coefficients from the regression of the log of
dR/dh on h. These give an idea of the extent to which the model needs “large impulses” to
generate realistic movements in employment. It is important to note that, by themselves,
increases in h lower the marginal revenue product of labor, so the exogenous rise in dR/dh
that raises employment must be larger than the actual increase reported in Table 2.
   With the baseline parameters of γ = ζv = 1, the model implies extremely large procyclical

                                                28
movements in real wages and dR/dh. This shows that this monopsony-based model can also
be subject to the difficulties uncovered by Shimer (2005). Even with selfish firms, it is
possible to ameliorate these problems significantly by increasing γ and lowering ζv .
   Equation (43) requires that the cost of attracting a worker by raising wages be the same
as the cost of doing so by increasing vacancies. In booms, the cost of attracting a worker
through vacancies rises. The higher is γ, the more the marginal utility of income falls for
workers when the wage rises. This implies that increases in wages are less effective as a
recruiting tool when wages are already high, so the cost of increasing employment by raising
wages rises with the wage rate. As a result, wages do not have to rise as much in booms for
them to become as costly as increases in vacancies as a recruiting tool.
   The effect of γ on the extent to which wages are procyclical is opposite here to the effect
in the standard market-clearing model of the labor market. In that model, a higher γ means
that the marginal utility of consumption falls more in booms, so the wage needs to rise more
to keep people indifferent between their old hours of work and slight increases in their hours
of work. Interestingly, the reduction in the marginal utility of income that occurs in booms
plays a role here as well, but here the effect is to discourage firms from using wage increases
to retain and recruit employees.
   Table 2 also shows that the extent to which dR/dh must rise to induce increases in
employment is quite comparable to the rise in wages that accompanies this employment
increase. Equation (43) determines wages from the degree of tightness in the labor market,
without much regard for dR/dh. Equation (44), on the other hand, makes it clear that
firms would not be willing to let the labor market become tight (which increases the cost of
recruiting with vacancies) unless dR/dh rose by essentially the same amount as wages.
   The last eight lines of the table show that required firm altruism can dampen the needed
changes in wages considerably. Indeed, for γ = 8, ζv = 0.66, the model nearly reproduces the
regression coefficient of wages on employment obtained when either λA or λI = 0.4. Firm
altruism has a number of effects that tend to make real wages less procyclical. First, increases
in wages lower workers’ marginal utility of consumption w−γ , and this decrease lowers an


                                              29
altruistic firm’s vicarious benefit from raising wages. This particular effect is larger when
λA = 0.4 than when λI = 0.4 because, in the former case, the reduction in the marginal
utility of income affects more people that the firm cares about.
       Second, an increase in h lowers the fraction of more senior employees because it is asso-
ciated with a rise in v/h, which leads to more turnover. This means that a firm’s vicarious
benefit from the utility of workers is smaller in booms, when λA = 0 and λI > 0. Such a
firm is thus less inclined to raise wages in economic expansions. However, this dampening
of real wage increases is only valid when firms care disproportionately about more senior
employees.
       Third, increases in wages raise the utility of being employed relative to the utility of
being unemployed, thus raising ψt1 and thereby increasing ωt . For a firm with λA > 0, this
increase in ω raises the attractiveness of increasing employment via vacancies rather than
via wages. This dampens the incentive of such a firm to raise wages. This effect turns out
to be quantitatively important and implies that wages are dampened more with λA = 0.4
than with λI = 0.4.
       The dampening of wage movements suggests that a model with positive λ̄ fits with the
interview evidence of Bewley (1999) in the sense that wages do not decline more in recessions
in part because firms are worried about appearing sufficiently altruistic. Admittedly, one
reason that altruism matters here is that workers’ marginal utility of income varies over time,
and the extent of this variation may be controversial. There are, however, two reasons to
imagine that this variation might well be substantial. First, as Chetty and Szeidl (2007) have
emphasized, most workers have considerable consumption commitments that are difficult to
unwind. This means that small reductions in disposable income can trigger large changes in
the elements of consumption that can be freely varied. The result is that the marginal utility
of consumption can fall dramatically even when income falls only by a small amount.15
  15
    Formally, this would require consumption in (1) to be equal to the wage minus the level of consumption
commitments C̄. The expression wt−γ in equations such as (44) must then be replaced by (wt − C̄)−γ . For
this expression to rise by 1 percent requires a smaller percentage change in the wage than is required to
increase wt−γ by 1 percent. The wage changes that are needed to balance changes in labor market tightness
are thus smaller when γ is larger.


                                                   30
   There is also a second reason for the marginal utility of income to vary substantially, which
has not been widely considered in the macro literature. This is the existence of altruistic
transfers within families and across friendship networks. In recessions, the unemployment
rate rises and employed workers can be expected to give up more of their paycheck to people
they know who have lost their jobs. This, presumably, ought to raise the marginal utility
of income of employed workers by more than is implied by the reduction in their wage. If,
for example, a spouse loses his or her job, the marginal utility of income of the spouse who
remains employed is presumably much larger.
   The importance of variations in the marginal utility of income for the conclusion that
firms smooth wages connects this model with models where observed wages are smooth be-
cause firms explicitly insure workers against income fluctuations. One difference between
these two approaches is that I rule out binding long-term contracts in my analysis, in part
because such contracts are quite rare among workers who occasionally experience unemploy-
ment. Contracts may, of course, be implicit as in the classic analysis of Azariadis (1975),
although this formulation raises the question of how these contracts are enforced. One way
of thinking about the model of this paper is that workers’ capacity for anger at insufficient
altruism provides an enforcement mechanism that allows for a certain degree of insurance,
though the details of this insurance are not identical to those of implicit-contracts models.
   So far, I have treated the required altruism levels as fixed. One reason to study models
where λ̄, and thus λA or λI , fluctuate is that the addition of such fluctuations to a model
with variable dR/dh adds a force that can make real wages countercyclical, reducing the
correlation between wages and employment. This potential source of countercyclical wage
movements is worth contrasting with the more standard idea that there are movements in
labor supply. Traditional labor supply shifts can be due either to preference shifts, as in Hall
(1997), or to wealth effects. As an example of the latter, increases in government purchases
reduce people’s wealth in standard models and increase their willingness to work at a given
real wage. Similarly, the expectation of future technical progress makes people feel wealthier
and reduces their willingness to work at a given real wage.


                                              31
       In matching models of the sort I have considered, these traditional movements in labor
supply tend to have a counterfactual implication. When people increase their willingness to
work at a given real wage, a matching model tends to predict an initial rise in unemployment
as more people seek work. This increase in unemployment leads to eventual increases in
employment (by increasing the number of workers who become matched to employers), even
without an increase in vacancies. The result is that vacancies and unemployment are no
longer as negatively correlated as they would be if the only changes were changes in labor
demand. Thus, matching models that include a labor supply channel, such as Merz (1995),
do not have a Beveridge curve where, as in U.S. data, the negative correlation between
vacancies and unemployment is nearly perfect.16
       In contrast, the model in this paper abstracts from labor supply variations by assuming
that the labor force is fixed. The combination of (12) and (14) implies that all movements
of employment lie on a Beveridge curve. This is not to say that changes in wealth cannot
play any role. Perceived increases in firm wealth, for example, may lead people to expect a
higher λ̄ and thereby increase real wages for any given level of employment. Drawing out this
connection is beyond the scope of this paper, however. Here, I simply consider exogenous
variations in λ̄. To simplify, I assume that λ̄ follows the AR(1) process:

                                          λ̄t = 0.96λ̄t−1 + eλt ,                                      (46)

where eλ is an i.i.d. random variable. The choice of the AR parameter is broadly dictated
by a desire to match the serial correlation of employment, though the correspondence is not
exact. One aim of the analysis is to study whether the standard deviation of λ̄ needed to
explain the broad features of employment and wage fluctuations is excessive. To make the
results transparent, I report the standard deviation of λ̄, which I denote by σλ , rather than
reporting the standard deviation of eλ .
  16
     Because Mortensen and Pissarides (1994) assume a constant labor force, the problem does not appear to
arise in their model if one simply modifies this model by allowing the utility workers draw from not working
to vary over time. This modification of the Mortensen and Pissarides (1994) model neglects, however, that
changes in the utility from staying at home would also lead workers to reduce their search activity in the
plausible case where this search is costly to them.


                                                    32
   In addition to fluctuations in λ̄, I continue to let dR/dh be subject to cyclical fluctuations.
Note that the existence of diminishing returns implies that dR/dh falls whenever reductions
                                                                d , which is the level of
in λ̄ lead to rises in employment. I thus introduce a variable dR/dh t

dRt /dht that would be induced by the current level of employment if ² and z were at their
steady-state levels. One can then write dRt /dht as

                                    dRt   d
                                          dR        g

where dR/dh is the steady-state value of dR/dh and dR/dh
nous variations in z and ². Assume further that the exogenous changes in dR/dh satisfy
                                    g
                                    dR           g

                                         = 0.96        + eR
                                                          t ,                                (47)

where eR                               λ
       t is i.i.d. and independent of e at all leads and lags. I let σR denote the standard
              g
deviation of dR/dh               R
                   t induced by et .

   The results of using Dynare to simulate this model for various parameters are reported in
Table 3. The first line of this table reports the standard deviations of cyclical employment and
wages as well as their correlation in the U.S. data discussed earlier. The issue considered here
is whether combinations of the two parameters σR and σλ can explain these three moments.
I show that this is not possible for certain model parameters, while it is possible for others.
This is obviously not a full estimation exercise, since many combinations of model parameters
fit these three moments equally well. Rather, Table 3 provides some guidance as to whether
the parameters that are able to replicate these moments are plausible.
   The table is constructed by varying σλ and σR so the correlation between detrended
employment and detrended wages equals 0.41 for all the specifications. When γ and ζv
are set at their baseline values of 1, one cannot choose values of σλ and σR to account for
the standard deviations of h and w. This can be seen by noting that, for the parameters
reported, one of these predicted standard deviations is larger than the observed one, while
the other is smaller. If one reduces either σλ or σR , the other must be lowered as well to
maintain the correlation between h and w. As a result, both the standard deviation of w

                                               33
and that of h fall, and one of these declines renders the model more counterfactual. The
same argument applies if either σλ or σR is increased.
    The root cause of this problem is that, as we saw before, the baseline parameters lead
wages to change much more than employment in response to changes in dR/dh. This leads
the standard deviation of wages to be too high relative to the standard deviation of employ-
ment. If one tried to increase the latter relative to the former by raising σλ , the correlation
between employment and wages would be too low, so the performance of the model cannot
be improved in this way.
    Letting γ = 8 and ζv = 0.66 comes closer to matching these moments, because, as we
saw, it ensures that dR/dh leads to less procyclical wages. Nonetheless, the moments cannot
be matched exactly. Even more troubling, the fit is actually worsened if γ is raised further,
because variations in λA around the steady-state value of 0.4 lead to procyclical movements
in real wages when γ ≥ 8.15. The reason for these procyclical movements is that (44) implies
that a more altruistic firm wishes to hire more unemployed people and, all else being equal,
this leads to an increase in vacancies when λA rises. A countervailing effect, obviously, is
that increases in λ lead wages to rise, reducing labor demand. However, this effect is weak
when γ is large, so the vacancy-increasing effect dominates for sufficiently large γ.
    As discussed earlier, one might prefer to assume that selfish firms do not increase their
vacancies when λ̄ rises, because, workers inability to observe dR/dh prevent them from using
a firm’s hiring level to determine its altruism. One crude way of capturing this informational
imperfection is to set λA = λI = 0 in (44), and the four last rows of Table 3 show the results
of this approach. In this case, increases in λ̄ still raise wages, but now they unambiguously
lead firms to lower employment. The result is that a lower value of γ, namely, γ = 6.5,
suffices to match all three moments, even when ζv is set to 1.


5     Adding Training Costs
There are several reasons to consider an extension of the model that incorporates post-
recruitment training costs. First, as discussed by Silva and Toledo (2006), these costs appear

                                              34
to be significantly larger than the costs of recruitment. Second, Silva and Toledo (2006)
argue that incorporating realistic costs of this type has an important impact on the cyclical
properties of the Mortensen-Pissarides (1994) model. It therefore seems important to analyze
whether the present model is equally affected by the incorporation of training costs.
      There are also two reasons to incorporate such costs that relate to the model itself. The
first is that, without training costs, the model has difficulty rationalizing the existence of
wages that are high relative to recruitment costs. It can do so only if the elasticity of worker
departures with respect to the firm’s wage is very high. With training costs, the firm has an
additional reason to fear worker departures, and this rationalizes the payment of relatively
high wages. The second is that concavity in training costs with respect to the number of
workers trained can contribute to satisfying the second-order conditions in the case where
the κ function is convex.
      To simplify the presentation of this section, I derive equilibrium conditions under the
assumption that the firm is selfish and λA = λI = 0. Adding the effects of altruism to these
equations is straightforward, because these effects are captured by the difference between
the equations in Section 2 and those in Section 1. The equations that correspond to (43)
and (44) for this combination, which are used in the simulations, are displayed in Appendix
3.
      Consider a firm that incurs training costs τ that depend on the number of individuals
newly hired by the firm. For firm i, the earlier analysis makes it clear that the number of
people newly hired at t equals hit − hit−1 (1 − s − (1 − Fti )m̄(vt /ht−1 )` ).
      Analogously to (24), the present discounted value of profits can thus be written as
                                                                                                Ã         !` 

Note that (49) is identical to (25), whereas (50) differs from (26) because raising wages now
has an additional advantage over raising vacancies as a device to increase employment. This
advantage is that the incumbent employees who stay at the firm do not require training and
thus reduce costs by τ 0 .
   Because (49) is the same as (25), the second derivative of profits with respect to vti can
still be written as (30). For the second-order conditions to be satisfied, this second derivative
has to be negative. As shown in Appendix 2, at a symmetric steady state this now requires

   The quantitative analysis of the effects of training costs is simplified by assuming that τ 0
is constant. Silva and Toledo (2006) suggest that the marginal cost of training one individual
worker equals about 13 times the cost of recruiting an additional employee. This implies
that τ 0 = 13κ0 /(dh/dv); so I calibrate τ 0 in this manner.
   Table 4 shows elasticities of wages and dR/dh with respect to employment in a model
where detrended employment is given by (45). Its last column displays F̄ 0 , the density of
F at zero. While it does not vary with γ, this density does depend on λ̄. With realistic
training costs, F̄ 0 is substantially lower than it was in Section 3. Increases in wages now
differ from vacancies as a method for increasing employment in that some of the employees
obtained by increasing wages do not require training. This leads firms to raise wages (relative
to recruitment costs) and therefore requires a smaller elasticity of employee departures to
ensure that wages are high.
   The entries in this table lead to two additional conclusions. The first is that the elasticities
of wages and dR/dh with respect to employment are reduced relative to those in Table 2,
but the reductions are modest. The intuition for this effect of training costs appears to be
somewhat different from that provided in Silva and Toledo (2006) for their bargaining model.
Here, γ > 0 implies that wages become less effective as a recruiting device when wages are
increased (because wage and nonwage aspects of jobs are not perfect substitutes). This
means that, when wages are already high in booms, wages are also not very effective relative
to vacancies in reducing a firm’s training costs for new employees. This further reduces the
firm’s incentive to raise wages in booms.
                                                    d vary in the model with training
   To complete the analysis, I now let both λ̄ and dR/dh
costs. The stochastic processes for these variables are once again given by (46) and (47),

                                                                37
and the results are displayed in Table 5. As before, the parameters σλ and σR are set so
the correlation between the logarithms of w and h equals 0.41. When γ and ζv equal their
baseline values, it remains impossible to match the standard deviations of employment and
wages by varying σR and σλ . On the other hand it is almost possible to do so while letting
ζv = 1 if one raises γ to equal 6. While this value is still substantial, it is lower than what
was needed in the absence of training costs.
    The last four rows of Table 5 show the results of assuming that firms set vacancies selfishly,
so that λA and λI equal zero in (55). With this modification, which makes real wages more
countercyclical in response to changes in λ̄, it is nearly possible to match the three moments
with a value of γ of only 4. The changes in λ that are needed are not trivial, but they are
still low relative to the steady-state value of 0.4. Interestingly, these variations in λ̄ do not
end up explaining a very large fraction of employment fluctuations, most of which remain
accounted for by changes in “labor demand.”


6     Conclusion
This paper has shown that parameters can be found in a matching model with monopsonistic
elements that mimic certain aspects of the joint behavior of real wages, employment, and
vacancies in the United States. Interestingly, the performance of this model is enhanced by
assuming that workers require that firms be minimally altruistic. This lends some credence
to the idea that required firm altruism can capture some of the fairness considerations that
employers and workers allude to when discussing wages. Nonetheless, it is important to
note that the model requires nonstandard parameter values in order to explain the standard
deviations of employment and wages as well as their correlation; so further work is needed
to see whether these values are consistent with other observations.
    The model is highly stylized, and numerous extensions could help to determine its ap-
plicability. A source of simplicity, but also an important shortcoming of the model, is that
it considers homogeneous firms. Particularly because the business cycle is associated with
differences in the rates at which different sectors expand and contract their employment, it

                                               38
would be useful to develop an analogous theory where wages differ across firms. Similarly,
the model covers only homogeneous workers and therefore does not make predictions about
wage dispersion within firms. Lastly, the model neglects variations in the extent to which
firms lay off workers over the business cycle, and this, too, seems to be a promising area for
further analysis.

in curly brackets in (40).

   Appendix 2: Second-order conditions

   Consider first the case without training costs. Differentiating (27) while noting that κ0
depends on v i , which in turn is given by (23), we obtain
                                                   Ã                                         !2

    Moreover, it follows from (28) that d2 hi /dv i2 is equal to zero, meaning that the number
