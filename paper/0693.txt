            Monetary Policy and Short-Term Interest Rates:
          An Efficient Markets-Rational Expectations Approach


                               ABSTRACT


      The impact of a money stock increase on nominal short—term interest rates

has been a hotly debated issue in the monetary economics literature. The most

commonly held view——also a feature of most structural macro models——has an

increase in the money stock leading, at least in the short-run, to a decline

in short interest rates. Monetarists dispute this view because they believe

that it ignores the dynamic effects of a money stock increase.

       This paper is an application of efficient markets—rational expectations

theory to analyze empirically the relationship of money supply growth and short-

term interest rates- This approach has the advantage over earlier research

on this subject in that it imposes a theoretical structure that allows easier

interpretation of the empirical results as well as more powerful statistical

tests. In the interest of ascertaining the robustness of the results, many

different empirical tests are carried out in this paper, and they uniformly

do not support the proposition that increases in the money supply are cor-

related with declines in short rates.

                              INTRODUCTION

       The relationship between money supply growth and nominal interest

rates is a hotly debated issue in the literaturej One view, associated

with "Keynesian" structural macro models, has an increase in the money

stock leading, at least in the short and medium runs, to a decline in

interest rates.2 An alternative view, associated with Milton Friedman

(1968, 1969), indicates that interest rates might rise in response to an

increase in money growth because the increase in money growth might lead

to a rise in inflationary expectations and hence a rise in interest rates

through a Fisher (1930) effect.

       Previous empirical work on this issue has ignored constraints implied

by the view that financial markets display rational expectations and are

thus "efficient." Financial market efficiency should not be ignored because

evidence supporting it is quite strong and recent work indicates that a

failure to impose financial market efficiency on macroeconometric models

can lead to highly misleading results.3 In addition, a failure to impose the

efficient markets (or, equivalently, rational expectations) constraints leads

to a larger number of parameters to be estimated in this empirical work, and

this leads to statistical tests with low power.4




       1Unless otherwise noted, whenever the phrase "interest rates" is used
in this paper, it refers to nominal interest rates.

       3See Fama (1970) and Mishkin (1978)

topic and references to this work can be found in Mishkin (1981).

       The theory of efficient capital markets and rational expectations sug-

gests an alternative approach for analyzing the relationship of money stock

increases and interest rate movements. A previous paper (Mishkin (1981a)

developed an efficient markets model of long interest rate determination,

and then estimated this model using postwar quarterly data. This approach

had the advantage of imposing a theoretical structure on the problem

that allowed easier interpretation of the empirical results as well as more

powerful statistical tests of the proposition that increases in the money

stock are correlated with declines in long rates. In addition, a Keynesian,

liquidity preference view of interest rate determination was embedded in the

efficient markets mc del and tested

       This paper is a sequel to the earlier paper in that it conducts a

similar analysis for short—term interest rates. The next section develops

a rational expectations (or, equivalently, efficient markets) model for

analyzing movements in short rates, and this model is estimated in the sub-

sequent section. This paper then concludes with an interpretation of these

results.

                                             THE MODEL

         The theory of rational expectations (or, equivalently, efficient mar-
kets   theory) indicates that interest rates in a bond market should reflect
all available information. To be more precise, it               implies   that the market
uses   available information correctly in assessing the probability distribution

of all future interest rates and hence:


(1)           E(rI$1) = E(rI1)
where

              r   = short—term(one period) interest rate at time t.

                  = information        available at time t-l.

 E(.   .. 1ti     = the     expectation conditional on t-l
                  =   the   market's expectation (unbiased forecast) assessed at t-l.
Em(       t1)
If    we denote the market's one—period—ahead forecast of the short rate of r

(i.e., r = Em(rtIt_1))                then (1)   implies



 (2)
        E(r   —
                  r.kti)      =   0


     Equation (2) above states that the forecast error for short rates
should be uncorrelated with any information or linear combinations of in-
 formation in tl• An              equivalent characterization of the rational expec-

tations model which satisfies (2) is thus:



 (3) r —      r   =   (x — x)s +
                                             4



where superscript e continues to denote the xnarketTs expectations con-

ditional on all past available information and

             = a variable (or vector of variables )      relevant   to the detenrnina—
                  tion of short—term interest rates,

        S    =a       coefficient or vector of coefficients,

             =    serially     uncorrelated error process (because E(ELt1) = 0    ).




The rational erpectations model (3) stresses that an unanticipated change5

in the short rate will occur only when unanticipated information hits the

market. This distinction between the possible effects from unanticipated

versus anticipated movements in variables is indeed an important feature

of recent eirical work (for exaanple,Barro (1977, 1978)).

        In order to make the rational expectations model above empirically

testable we must have a model of market equilibrium. Here we assume, as

in Fama (l976b), that the one—period—ahead forward rate equals the one—

period—ahead expected short rate plus a risk (liquidity) premium which

varies with the uncertainty in short rate movements. I.e.:



()      Ft
              =   r   + 5


and

             = a      +

        5                                                                e
            Since the anticipated change in the short rate equals r —
r4 —   r      is equivalent to the unanticipated change in the short rate.

               risk    (liquidity) premium for F.
              measure of uncertainty in short rate movements.

Combining the model of markec equilibrium with (s), we                          ha1e the rational
expectations      model estimated in this paper:


(6) r — Ft =           —a    —
                                 a1a
                                       +
                                           (x   —   X) +

       As Fama    (1976a) and Nelson and. Schwert (1977) make                    clear,    if the risk
premium,      '   has small variation relative to other sources of variation in

              then the model of market equilibrium is not critical to empirical

tests of the equation (6) model.                        Although this type of situation fre-

quently exists, making tests of financial market efficiency easy,8 this

is not the case here. Using a measure of uncertainty similar to Fama's

(l976b), the      amount of variation in rt_F attributable to the variation of
the liquidity premium is s-tatistically significant at the 1% level in the

1959—76      sample period used here.9 The                     appropriateness of this model of



     61n the case of 90 day treasury which are used here, the forward                            rate
at the end of a quarter is calculated as
                                            rsix
                  Ft
                       =    {1_(360_180                  t—l}
                                 (360—90 r1)
where all     rates    are in fractions and
                  rsix1 = six     month (180 day) bill                 rate   at end of   previous   quarter,
                       rt1 = 90 day bill                rate   at end of previous quarter.


     7A more precise wording of this point would state that, in this case,
tests o± hypotheses concerning the model of the liquidity premium would have
low statistical power.

  market equilibrium is thus an important factor that needs to be discussed

  further -when the results of the (6) model are analyzed.

           The research question posed in the Introduction suggests that the re-

  lationship of money growth and unanticipated changes in the short rate in


  a rational expectations model is of particular interest.10 Substitut-
  ing money growth for                   in equation (6) leads to:

  ()       r     —
                     Ft
                          =    —a   —
                                        a1a ÷ Sm(MGt   —
                                                           MG:)
                                                                  +


 where,

           MGt
                 =   the      money growth rate at time t.

 Thus, if unanticipated increases in the money stock are to have a negative
 correlation with unanticipated changes in short rates (as might be expected
 from      "Keynesian" macro—econometric models), this implies that the coeffi-

 cient on unanticipated money growth should be significantly negative in

 equation (7): i.e.,                    c 0•

        An important caveat is in order. The rational expectations model does

 not guarantee that equation (3) is a reduced form where                        -        is    exo-
 genous so that the estimates of S are consistent.11 it implies only that
    —   ris correlated with unanticipated movements in variables.

Another way of stating this point is to acknowledge that the rational ex-

pectations model does not indicate whether a significant S coefficient

implies causation from its unanticipated variable to short—term interest

rates. Regarding rational expectations, causation could run                         in   the

other direction, or it could be nonexistent as in the

case where new information is simultaneously
                                                                  affecting both unanticipated

      As aas been found in foreign exchange markets (See for

(1979)) quarterly changes in the spot rate, in this case of the short rate,
are
   primarily attributable to unanticipated movements in the spot rate. See
Fama (197Gb). Using the model of the liquidity premium estimated in (10),
the correlation of unanticipated short rate  movements, and the actual change
in short rates is high in the 1959—76
than .8. Thus, results obtained in this studyperiod
                                      sample         used here, being greater
                                               for unanticipated
short rates also apply to changes in short rates.                                        changes in

short rates and the right—hand—side variable. Thus, we must be careful in

interpreting empirical results on the 5t not to ascribe causation to the

results without further identifying information.

      The above caveat must be kept in mind especially when we analyze the

estimated Sm coefficient. If the money supply process is seen as exogenous

—   —a   view that has received some support in the literate 12--the inter-

pretation of the estimated 5    is straightforward. The finding of a sig-

nificant   negative 5 would then provide evidence supporting the "Keynesian"
position that increased money growth will, at least in the short—run, lead
to declines in short rates; and a failure to find this result would cast
doubt on this view. However, if   the    money supply process is not exogenous,
the   position taken by many critics of monetarist analysis, then the

estimated S coefficient might suffer from simultaneous equation bias and

give a misleading impression as to the effect of an increase in the money

supply on short—term interest rates. Because the analysis in this paper

provides no information on the exogeneity of the money supply process, the

5 estimates in the discussion of the empirical results are viewed only as
 in

providing information on the correlations of unanticipated money growth and

the unanticipated change in short rates. Interpretation of these correla-

tions is then deferred to the concluding remarks toward the end of the paper.

       The liquidity preference approach to the demand for money suggests

other relevant information which might be concluded in the X—vector of the



     12Sims (1972) contains a discussion of the differing views in the
literature on the exogeneity of the money supply process and finds evidence
which he interprets as supporting the view that causality runs from money
growth to income rather than the other way around. As Jacobs, Learner and
Ward's (1979) and Zellner's (1979)      criticisms of these causality tests in-
dicate, however, these tests do not resolve the issue of the exogeneity of
money supply process.

rational expectations model. changes in interest rates are related not only

to changes in the money stock but also to changes in real income, the price

level and inflation.13 Hence short—term interest rates might be related not

only to the growth rate in the nominal money stock, as in equation (7) ,                         but
also to the growth rate of real income and inflation. Adding this information

to the X—vector in the equation (6) model leads to the following:

                                                                                  +

This    equation is really a rational expectations analog tn the tvnical money

demand relationship found in the literature. In addition, equation (8) cap-

tures elements of interest rate models of the Feldstein and Eckstein (1970)

variety.

       The money demand view of equation ( 8                   )   indicates   that the income co-

efficient, , should be positive: i,e. y > 0.                            However, the signs of

the unanticipated money growth and                      inflation   coefficients are not as

straightforward because they depend on the time—series process of money

growth and          inflation,            P. positive effect of an unanticipated increase in

inflation (
                     it
                          > 0)      follows from the resulting reduction in real money

balances. The positive unanticipated inflation effect is further strength-
ened if the time—series process of inflation is such that, as in the Cagan

(1956) adaptive expectations model, an                      unanticipated   rise in inflation leads

to a higher expected inflation rate in the coming period. Then a Fisher

series process of inflation —     — that is,the more an unanticipated increase

in inflation leads to a continuing increase next period-—the larger the Fisher

effect and         should be. Since a surprise in money growth will affect short

will also not be independent of the time—series process of ney growth.

     We now turn to the actual estimation of the rational expectations

models of (7) and (8).

     Since misleading results can be obtained from efficient markets models

using averaged data, the data for bond returns are derived from security

prices at particular points in time. In keeping with this, an attempt has

been made to derive the other variables used here with data as close to

being end of quarter as possible. For this reason, Industrial Production

is used as a prov for real income in estimating equation ( 8   )   rather   than

a more broadly based National Income Accounts measure. Similarly, the CPI

has been used to calculate the inflation variable rather than the GNP de-

flator.


THE ESTIMATION THOD

     In order to estimate the efficient markets models of equations (7) and

(s ), measures of anticipated money growth, income growth and inflation must

be developed. Here, anticipations of variables in the information set X

are assumed to be optimal linear forecasts using tine—series models of the

following form:


(9           =       y +   u

          See Working (1960) for example0

      15In previous work (Misbkin (1981),   erneriments with quarterly aver-
aged data led to substantially worse fits for equations similar to (7) and
  8 ), fewer significant coefficients and no appreciable differences as to
the statistical significance of the S coefficients.

        A critical issue in the research strate used here is the methodolo&r

for choosing the specification of the time—series models of ( g         ).   It   is


difficult      theoretically to exclude any particular piece of infor-

mation available at time t—l as a useful predictor of an              variable.
For   example, economic theory cannot provide much guidance as to which vari-
ables to exclude in a money growth equation. Even though there is no
strong theoretical reason for expecting a particular variable to enter the
Z—vector, it might      be a.useful predictor of money growth because the person-

alities involved in policymaking could be such that they react to this

variable for their own inscrutable reasons. Thus the theoretical model

a researcher uses to explain this money growth specification might be

relatively unimportant in deciding the validity of his particular spe-

cification versus titat of another researcher.

        The discussion above suggests that an atheoretical statistical pro—

cedure might be superior to economic theory for deciding on the specifica-

tion of the time—series models in (           ) Furthermore,   because theory is less

of a useful guide in evaluating the time—series models needed here than is

true in other empirical work, it is more important to check for the robust-

ness of results by using several model specifications in estimating the
                                     13




rational expectations model0 In keeping with this line of thinking, two

procedures for specifying the time—series models of (12) are used in the

text, with several additional specifications in the results discussed

in the Appendix0

         The simplest equations which can be used to describe money grcwth,

industrial production growth and inflation are univariate time—series models

of the autoregressive type. Fourth order autoregressions are usually suc-

cessful in reducing quarterly data's residuals to white noise and are thus

used here0 The resulting estimates for I{LG, M2G, IPG and 71         can   be found in

Table 10        Note that there is a fair amount of persistence in the time—series
models for money growth and inflation, indicating that "price anticipation't

effects of the sort that Friedman (1968, 1969) discusses are potentially

important0

         More complex multivariate time series models have been estimated using

the following procedure0 Each of the four variables — — M1G, M2G, IPG, and

it   —   — was regressed on its own four lagged values as well as on four lagged

values of each of the other three variables and four lagged values of each

of the following variables: the unemployment rate; the 90 day treasury bin

rate;      the balance of payments on current account; the growth rate of real
federal government expenditure, the high employment budget surplus, and the
growth rate of federal government, interest bearing debt, in the hands of
the public.           (These other variables were selected because a reading of the
literature        on Federal Reserve reaction functions indicated that they might

help explain money growthJT) The four lagged values of each variable were

it imposes a discipline on the researcher that prevents his searching for

       Note that the because lagged nependent variables appear in the time—
series models of Tables 1 and 2, all the test statistics are only valid
asymptotically. The F—statistics which test the null hypothesis that the
lagged values of the following variables add no explanatory power to the Table

statistics are: 1.81 for w, 1.26 for IPG; 1.142 for UN; .47 for the growth
rate of real government expenditure; .79 for the balance of payments; .62
for the high employment surplus; •)43 for the growth rate of government debt,
and 2.146 for r. In the 2.2 regression, the FV4, 59) statistics are .140 for
ii; 2.17 for M1G; 1.65 for IPG; .25 for UN; .22 for the growth rate of real

government expenditure; .70 for the balance of payments on current account;
1.28 for the high employment surplus; and .14)4for the growth rate of
government debt. In the 2.3 regression, the F(1, 147) statistics are: .146
for the growth rate in real government expenditure; .09 for M1G; .70 for
the high employment surplus; 1.8)4 for the growth rate of government debt;
end 2.32 for UN. In the 2.14 regression, the FV4, 51) statistics are: 1,13
for M2G; .9b for r; 1.55 for IPG; 1,59 for the growth rate in real govern-
ment expenditure; 2.01 for the high employment surplus; and .33 for the
growth rate of government debt.

     19chow (1960) tests where the sample has been split into ecual halves
reveal that there is some instability in the coefficients for both the
unlvariate and multivariate Ml money growth model. The Chow test for the
model of 1.1 yields F(5, 62) = 2.73, while for 2.1 F(9, 514) = 2.9)4, both
of which are significant at the 5% level0 However, neither of the M2
money growth models displays this instability. For model 1.2 EU, 62) =

variate ii model displays coefficient instability: For model 1.3 EU, 62) =

 concept           of predictive content.20 One interesting feature of the multivariate

 money growth equations is that, in contrast with Barro's (1977) work, no

 fiscal policy or unemployment variables were found to be statistically

 significant at the five percent level.

       Before turning to the procedures for estimating the rational expecta-

tions model, the measure of short rate uncertainty (oh) used here requires

some discussion, Fama (1976b) calculates                         as the average of the absolute

values         of the changes in the spot rate during the year before t and during
the year following t.                Because   the risk (liquidity) premium must be set
conditional on available information — — in this case that known at t—l —                    —



allowing             to be calculated from information not available at t—l does

pose some conceptual difficulties, An alternative, though similar, measure

of         is used in this study. The difference between the forward rate and

the spot rate, i.e., r_F was regressed on measures of o, calculated as

the average absolute change of the bill rate over a number of previous

quarters, where the number of quarters was varied, The best fit was ob-

tained with                calculated from eight previous quarters of changes in the

bill rate,           The results are as follows

         prefer not to refer to this as Granger—causality here because this
nomenclature has led to much confusion in the literature. For a discussion
of this point see Zellner (1979).


     21Sheffrin (1979) also finds that fiscal policy variables do not help
explain money growth.

As in Fama (1976b), increased uncertainty in short rate movements does lead

to an increased risk premium and this effect is statistically significant at

the 1% level. In addition, the         measure used here outperforms the Fama

measure that is constructed from information 'unavailable at t—l. The above

measure of       is used in the empirical tests that follow. However, its

specification is not a critical issue to the outcomes: use of a Fama measure

of      or the exclusion of    from the model altogether does not

alter the results appreciably.

     One way to proceed in estimating the rational expectations model is to

use a two—step procedure outlined in the recent work of Barro (1911, 1978),

After estimating the time—series models of Tables 1 and 2, the residuals

from these regressions can be used as proxies for the corresponding

unanticipated variables in estimating equations (8) and     (11).   Tests of

whether   only unanticipated changes are related to r÷ —   r could then also
proceed as in Barro (1977).
     Although    the empirical results using the above approach are not unrea-

sonable and are similar to those produced here in the text (see the Appendix),

thore are serious econonetric criticisms of this approacb.22 However,

an econometric technique which does not suffer from these criticisms is

outlined below.23

     22See Mishkin (1980)

     23The technique used here is quite similar in concept to that proposed
by Sargent (1979) ,although it is somewhat easier to execute and notationally
simpler.

        In matrix notation, the rational expectations model can be written as:


(11) r — F                =           — a a1 ÷ (X —         +
                                 —a                   Xe)


where

        r —F nxl
                  a
                      0
                              nxl
                      a       nxl
                  a1 = 1 x 1


X and X = n               x Ic
          e
            kx 1
              =

          c nxl
          n = number of observations

          Ic =    number of right—hand—side variables in X.


The linear time series model for X, whether univariate or multivariate can

also be written as:


(12) X = Zy + U


where

     Z = an n x m matrix of lagged variables, where m is the number of

              variables,

     y = m x Ic matrix of coefficients,

    U = n x Ic matrix of white noise error terms.

The optimal linear forecast of X is then



Ci3) xe    = Zy


and substituting this into (ii) we have;
                                            18



(14) r —   F   =   —a   — oa   +   (x   —   zy)   +



     The system in (12) and (14) can be stacked into one regression system

with n(k+l) observations, and it can be estimated by non—linear least squares

methods imposing the constraints that the y#          in   (12) and (14) are equal. In

order to obtain more efficient parameter estimates as well as consistent test

statistics, corrections must be made for heteroscedasticity both within and

across equations in this system.25
                                                                                26
     This procedure is superior to the alternative two—step procedure0

More efficient parameter estimates of 8 and ','        will   result because both

(12) and (14) make use of information from each other in the estimation

process. In addition, it generates a simple test of the model which is

similar to recent tests of "rationality" in the literature that proceed
along the lines of Modigliani and Shiller (1973).21 It is a simple like—


     25The following ].terative procedure was used to correct for heterosce—
dasticity in these estimates. In the first stage estimation of the non-
linear system, if Goldfeld—Quandt tests indicated that heteroscedasticity
existed within an equation, the variables in this equation were weighted
using a time trend procedure outlined by Glesjer (1969). Furthermore, the
variables in each equation of the system were appropriately weighted so that
each equation individually had the same sum of squared residuals. After the
first stage estimation, the sum of squared residuals for each equation were
calculated and were then used to weight the variables in each equation so
that the sum of squared residuals were the same in all cases. Then the non-
linear system was estimated all over again. This resulted in a similar sum
of squared resiudals in all equations of the (12) and ( 14) system so that no
further iterations were performed. Some experimentation did indicate that
no appreciable differences in the results occured if some modification of
this iterative procedure was used which left the sum of squared residuals
reasonably equal for all the equations. For further details on this esti-
mation procedure, see Mishkin (l980)

econometric issues in using the joint non—linear procedure.

lihood ratio test for whether the (12) and (14) system satisfies the non-

linear constraints implied by the equality of '        in   (12) and (14). The

likelihood ratio statistic, —2 log(Lc/Lu), is distributed asymptotically

as 2(q) where q is the number of non—linear constraints

        Lc =   likelihood   of the estimated constrained system,

        Lu =   likelihood   of the estimated unconstrained system.

In this non—linear Least squares system, the likelihood ratio statistic is


       n(k +    l)(log(SSR°)   —
                                   log   (SSR"))


where

       SSRc = sum of squared residuals from the constrained system,

       SSR' = sum of squared residuals from the unconstrained system,


THE RESULTS

      Because there is no strong theoretical reason for estimating the

rational expectations model with one monetary aggregate versus another, un-

anticipated growth rates of both Ml and M2 are used in estimation. The

resulting      estimates and test statistics of this data appear in Table 3,
Panel A of this table contains estimates where only univariate models of
the   form found in Table 1 are used in (12), while Panel B uses the multi—

variate models of the form found in Table 2, The estimates of the y co

efficients      are not presented here because they are similar to those found
in Tables 1 and 2.
      The first issue we should look at is whether the non—linear constraints
implied by the model are satisfied. The likelihood ratio tests reported in
Table 14 indicate that they are not. The marginal significance levels in
Table 1 are the probability of obtaining that value of the likelihood ratio
statistic or higher under the null hypothesis that the non—linear constraints
are valid. They indicate that the constraints are rejected at the 5% level
in six out of eight cases, How should we interpret these rejections?

    The non—linear constraints are generated by two hypotheses: i) rational

expectations and 2) the model of       market equilibrium in equation (6). A
rejection of these constraints could thus result from the failure of either
hypothesis.    In the situation where use of the appropriate model of market

equilibrium is unimportant in the test results because it contributes so

little variation to the variable of interest, then rejections of the non-

linear constraints indicate that expectations are not rational. In this

case the rationale for the analysis of this paper would disappear. However,

as discussed in the previous section, the contribution of the model of

market equilibrium to the variation of r      —        appears to be large. A re-
                                                  Ft
jection of    the non—linear constraints is then likely to result from a poor
specification of this market equilibrium model.
     There    is a substantial body of evidence supporting the rationality of

expectations in bond markets,28 and this leads to a suspicion that it is

the model of market equilibrium that causes the rejections in Table

Fortunately, if this is the source of the rejection, the rational expecta-

tions model estimated here is still a valid framework for analyzing the re-

lationship of money growth and short interest rates, With rational expec-

tations, the unanticipated X —          variables   will be uncorrelated with any

past information, among which can be included the determinénts of the

risk premium which is set at t—l. Therefore, if some determinants of this

risk premium have been excluded from the market equilibrium model, with the

resulting rejection of the non—linear constraints, this will not lead to




     28
       see for example, the survey in Fama (1970) as well as more recent
work such as Mishkin (1978, l981a, b) and Sargent (1979).

        29
          With a suitable transformation of the unconstrained system outlined
in Abel and Mishkin (1980), additional evidence is available on the potential
misspecification of the model of market equilibrium. The unconstrained system
where the y are not equal in (12) and (14) can be rewritten as

(12')                          X=Zy+u
(14')

where the y's are constrained to be equal in (12') and (14'). Therefore, the
non—linear constraints tested in this paper are equivalent to ctO in the
above system. It is now easy to see the following point: If the liquidity
premium is related to the variables in Z yet they have been excluded from the
model of the liquidity premium, then this could explain the rejections of
the non—linear constraints found here. To make this conjecture plausible,
we should expect that a model of the liquidity premium which is related to
Z would have reasonable characteristics. For example the Fama—type model of
the liquidity premium in equation (10) does generate plausible values. The
resulting liquidity premiums (at annual rates) have a mean of 57 basis points
and a standard deviation of 30 basis points. They also move smoothly: their
autocorrelations for lags of one through four quarters are respectively .96,
.91, .85, and .78. In the model which leads to the strongest rejection of
the non—linear constraints, model 3.7, we could attribute this rejection to
the fact that a more appropriate specification of the liquidity premium is
(S =
      a0 + a1o ÷ Zc*, where Z contains the four lagged values of money growth
(N20) and treasury bill rates (r). This latter specification leads to values
for the liquidity premium that are somewhat more variable and less smooth
than the equation (10) specification, but not appreciably so. The liquidity
premiums from this expanded specification have a mean of 57 basis points,
a standard deviation of 46 basis points and four lagged autocorrelations of
.75, .56, .49 and .29.
          Viewing the rejections with the benefit of the system (12') and (14')
also has the advantage that it provides us with potentially interesting infor-
mation on the liquidity premium. The results in Tables 4 and 6 indicate that
the liquidity premium could be related to money growth and interest rates as
well as the variability measure a. However, they give no indication that the
liquidity premium is in addition related to the other variables in Table 2;
,    IPG, UN and BOP. The results here thus point out a direction for future
research on the liquidity premium. Following Nelson (1972), I also conducted
more direct experiments on the relation of the liquidity premium to lagged r
and UN with negative results. Experiments with lagged values of r—F also did
not add explanatory power to the model of the liquidity premium.

inconsistent estizates of the        coefficients030 Since the derivation of a

better model of the risk premium is not necessary for acheiving reliable

estimates of the 8's, this tricq research issue, which is beyond the scope

of this paper, is left as a subject for future research.

      The unanticipated 1410 coefficients in Panel A do not support the view

that an unanticipated increase in money growth is correlated with an unan-

ticipated fall in short rates. Not only are both of these coefficients in

model 31 and 3.2 positive rather than negative, but they are also signifi-

cantly different from zero. The coefficients are not numerically small

either. They indicate that a i% surprise increase in Ml is associated with

a 28 basis point unanticipated increase in the bin rate.31 The Panel B

estimates of the MlG coefficients indicate that the above conclusion on the

relationship of short rates and 141 growth is not altered as a result of us-

ing multivariate versus univariate time—series models to describe expecta-

tions formation. Again both coefficients are positive, although in this

case neither is significantly different from zero0

      How different are   the   results found here from those that might be in-

ferred   from 'tlceynesian" structural macro—econometric models? The response of
one such model, the NPS (MIT—PENN—SSRC) Quarterly Econometric Model (1917),
to   a 1% surprise   increase   in Ml growth   was   analyzed   with a simulation tech-

nique discussed in Mishkin (l979)32 The MPS modal indicated that this 1%



       30This depends on a proper specification of eqpation (15) so that X — Zy
is   uncorrelated with any past information used to set the risk premium0

         basis point is defined as 1/100 of a percentage point0 I.e., a one
basis point rise in a 5% short rate would denote an increase to 5.0l%

       32More details on this simulation experiment are given in Mishkin (1981a).
                                 22


Ml surprise led to an immediate decline of 88 basis points in the bill

rate. This strongly constrasts Tflth the finding here that even the least

positive Ml coefficient is more than five standard deviations away from

this figure.

     The similarity between the money growth as well as other coefficients

estimates   in going from Panel A to Panel B is encouraging for it gives us
confidence that the results found here are robust to changes in the models
describing eectations,33 Additional results described in the Appendix
also support this view. Note that the asymptotic t—statistics for the
money growth and inflation coefficients in Panel A tend to be higher than
those in Panel B, thus yielding stronger results0 This lends some support
to the position taken by Feige and Pearce (1976) that forecasts from uni—
variate time—series models may be "economically rational" expectations.
     The coefficients on unanticipated M2 growth tell a similar story to the
the Ml growth coefficients0 They also do not support the view that unan-
ticipated   money growth is associated with an unanticipated decline in short

rates. The Panel A results for M2 are not as strong as the Ml results in

supporting a positive correlation between unanticipated money growth and

short rates: both M2 coefficients are positive, but neither is significantly

different from zero. However, in Panel B, one of the positive N2G coef-

ficients is statistically significant while this is not the case for the

M coefficients.

     The results on the unanticipated inflation and industrial production

coefficients in Panel A do conform to our priors. In both the Ml and M2



     23
       As Feige and Pearce (1976) have argued, nnce past information on the
variable to be forecast is used in forecasting, other information might have
little incremental predictive power. The similarity of results in Panel A
and B gives some credibility to this viewpoint and this issue is discussed
more extensively in Mishkin (1980
                                  23




rational expectations models, these coefficients are positive and the in-

flation coefficients are significantly different from zero at the 1% level0

The Panel B results for inflation are similar to those in Panel A, although

flow only the inflation coefficient in the M2 model is significant. The

results on unanticipated industrial production growth continue to be weak

in Panel B, and here these coefficient now have the "wrong" sign although

they are insignificant.

        The rational expectations model does not specify whether the X — Xe

variables    should be described by seasonally adjusted rather than seasonally

unadjusted data. This is an empirical issue that cannot be settled easily

on theoretical grounds because it is not clear whether market participants

concentrate on seasonally adjusted versus unadjusted information0 For this

reason, the (15) and (17) system has also been estimated with seasonally

unadjusted data for the X's over the 1959—76 sample period0 The resulting

estimates and test statistics appear in Tables 5    and 6 and were obtained

with the same techniques as the previous estimates with seasonally adjusted

data.

        A comparison of the Tables 3 and L with the Tables 5   and   6 results

indicates that the use of adjusted versus unadjusted data is not a critical

factor in this research0 The likelihood ratio tests of the non—linear con-

straints in Table 6 have similar marginal significance levels to those in

Table 1, and now five out of eight tests reject these constraints at the 5%

level0 In addition the coefficient estimates are similar to those in Table

 ,and the Panel A money growth, inflation and industrial production growth
coefficients have larger asymptotic t—statistics than those in Panel B.
        There are two important differences in the adjusted versus the unad-
justed results, The unadjusted industrial production coefficients now all

is even statistically significant at the 5% level0 Of even greater in-

terest are the stronger results on the relationship of money growth and

short rates when seasonally unadjusted data is used0 Not only are all the

      A wide range of empirical tests exploring the relationship of money

growth   and short—term interest rates have been conducted in this paper and
in   the Appendix. A guiding principle in this research has been the use

of many different empirical tests of the model in order to provide infor-

mation on the robustness of the results. The pursuit of this goal has led

to model estimation where there have been variations along the following

dimensions: 1) the choice of the monetary aggregate, 2) the choice of

the relevant variables to include in the X—vector, 3) the use of season-

ally adjusted versus seasonally unadjusted data, )-) the specification of

the time—series models used to describe expectations formation, 5) the

sample period and, 6) the econometric estimation technique.     Even though

some of these model estimates should be more reliable than others for the

reasons discussed earlier, the large number of estimates provide informa-

tion on the sensitivity and reliability of the results reported here.

       The results uniformly support the following conclusion. There is no

empirical support here for the view that unanticipated increases in the

money stock are negatively correlated with unanticipated changes in short

interest rates. This conclusion is similar to that found in a previous

paper, Mishkin (l981a),which conducts a parallel analysis of long—term

interest rate behavior. However there are two aspects of the research

methodolor used here which raise questions about the general validity of

this conclusion.

       As has been discussed in the te, the 8 coefficients in the rational
                                 26




expectations models are not invariant to changes in the time—series pro-

cesses of the money growth, income growth and inflation variables. Thus

the conclusions derived from the estimates in this paper only provide in-

formation on the relationship of money growth and short rates for this

postwar sample period0 However, realize that many structural macroecono—

metric models which display a negative relationship between money growth

and short rates have been estimated using a sample period which overlaps that

used here. Thus the results reported in this paper are certainly of in-

terest in evaluating these models.

     A further difficulty with the research methodolor followed here is

that misspecification of (15), which describes expectations formation,

could   invalidate the results on the relationship between money growth and
short rates. This is possible because misspecification of expectations
formation   could lead to inconsistent and biased   coefficients. However,

the robustness of this paperts results to different specifications of the

time—series models describing expectations provides evidence that this

misspecification problem may not be very severe0

        Given the conclusion reached above, how should we interpret it? If

we are willing to accept exogeneity of the money supply process in the

postwar period, the interpretation is clear cut. The evidence here would

then cast doubt on the commonly held view that an unanticipated increase

in the money stock will lead to an unanticipated decline in short—term in-

terest rates. Not only does this suggest that the Federal Reserve cannot

lower short interest rates by increasing the rate of money growth, but it

also requires some modification of the monetary transmission mechanism
                                  27




embodied in structural macro—econometric models. it is plausible that an

unanticipated increase in money growth may not induce unanticipated decline

in short rates because it leads to an iiediate upward revision in expected

inflation. Thus, there is still a potential effect on real interest rates

from unanticipated money growth and the evidence in no way denies that there

are potent effects of money supply increases on aggregate demand,

       As was mentioned in Section II of the paper, if unanticipated money

growth is not exogeneous, then the       coefficient estimates are inconsis-

tent and can lead to misleading inference, Particularly disturbing in this

regard is the case where the Federal Reserve smooths interest rates so that

an unanticipated increase in short rates causes a Federal Reserve reaction

of an increase in unanticipated money growth0 The resulting positive cor-

relation of c and MG —     MGe   would then tend to bias the $m coefficient
                t      t     t

upward. Thus, even though the estimated B is positive, we cannot rule out

the view in structural macroeconometric models that an exogenous increase

in money growth leads to a decline in short rates, despite the empirical re-

sults of this paper.

       Note however the nature of money growth endogeneity that is required for

the above statement to be the case, If money growth is endogenous in the

sense that the Federal Reserve modifies money growth within a quarter only

 in response to past public information available at the start of the quarter,

this does not result in MGt — MG; being correlated with s. Hence the exis-

tence of Granger (1969) "causality" running from interest rates to money

 growth does not imply that the estimates of       will be inconsistent, Tests

 of the Sims (1972) variety therefore cannot shed light on the consistency of

 the       estimates. If we are not to reject the concn view that increases in
       m
                              28




money growth lead to short interest rate declines, research of a fairly

subtle sort is needed to demonstrate that unanticipated money growth is

positivelt correlated with the contemporaneous error term, s. Hence,

this issue cannot be resolted without further research.

             Estimates of the Rational Expectations Models
                 Using the Two—Step Procedure



     The models in Table 3 were also estimated with the Barro (1917) two—

step procefure over the 1959—76 sample period. The resulting coefficient

estimates were not appreciably different from those in Table 3 with the

Mfl coefficients ranging from .20 to ,29, the M2G coefficients from ,09

to .16, the IPG coefficients from 003 to .o6 and the it coefficients from

037 to .67, In order to gain further information on the robustness of the

results, also estimated were rational expectations models which used re-

siduals from eighth order autogressive models of the X—variables, as well

as residuals from multivariate models of the X—variables which excluded

the four lagged values of a variableonly if they were not jointly signi-

ficant at the ten percent level (rather than the five percent level as in

the text), The results were quite close to those above, and again the

evidence did not support a negative relationshop between unanticipated

money growth and short rates0

     Because the Federal Reserve may have changed its reaction function in

the 1970's by paying more attention to the monetary aggregates than it did

previously, it is possible that the results might change substantially if

the 1970's are excluded from the sample period, Two—step estimates of the

Table 3 models over the 1959—69 sample period did not support this con,jec—

tune, The money growth coefficients remained positive, although they did

decline somewhat: the MW coefficients ranged from .11 to .20, while the

M2G coefficients ranged from .03 to ,l2. The IPG coefficients ranged from

_,314 to ,03 and the ii coefficients from '37 to 0530
