                  Can We Sterilize? Theory and Evidence



                               Abstract



This paper is a highly selective review of our knowledge about the scope

for sterilized intervention in foreign exchange markets under alternative

exchange-rate regimes. Section I demonstrates the potential importance of

simultaneous-equations bias in single-equation econometric studies of the

capital-account offset to monetary policy under fixed exchange rates. The

empirical record suggests that, in the case of West Germany, sterilization

was a feasible short-run monetary strategy in the 1960s. Section II notes

that there is considerable recent evidence of imperfect asset substitutability

under the managed float. While limited substitution between bonds of dif-

ferent currency denomination is a precondition for the efficacy of sterilized

foreign-exchange intervention, it is no guarantee of efficacy. Whether

limited substitutability can in fact be exploited in a predictable manner

by central banks is a distinct, and unanswered, question.

     Under managed floating, as under the Bretton Woods system, central

banks have intervened heavily in the foreign exchange market. As before,

they have often attempted to divorce their intervention activities from their

money supplies through offsetting operations in domestic financial markets.

An official purchase of foreign exchange can be sterilized through a cor-

responding open-market sale of domestic securities. The transaction, which

is equivalent to an official forward sale of domestic currency, leaves rela-

tive money supplies unchanged but alters the relative supplies of foreign-

and domestic-currency bonds available to the public.

      Regardless of the exchange-rate regime, sterilized intervention may be

viewed as an attempt to attain independent exchange-rate and money-stock tar-

gets in the short run. For this to be possible, bonds denominated in different

currencies must be imperfect substitutes in private portfolios. If feasible,

sterilization may or may not be useful in attaining the long-run objectives

of the Central Bank.

      This paper is a highly selective review of our knowledge about the

scope for sterilization. Section I demonstrates the potential importance

of simultaneous-equations bias in single-equation econometric studies of

the capital-account offset to monetary policy under fixed exchange

rates. The empirical record suggests that, at least in the case of West

Germany, sterilization was a feasible short-run strategy in the 1960s.

Section II notes that there is considerable recent evidence of imperfect

asset substitutability under the managed float. Whether this limited

substitutability can be exploited in a predictable manner by central banks

is a distinct, and unanswered, question.

 I. The Scope for Sterilization under Fixed Exchange Rates

       When the exchange rate is fixed and capital is internationally mobile,

the central problem of monetary management is the endogeneity of the home money

supply. Domestic credit expansion aimed at affecting internal markets causes

an incipient weakening of the exchange rate. To maintain the official parity,

the Central Bank must intervene in the foreign exchange market by buying high-

powered money with foreign reserves. In this manner, attempts to alter the

domestic source component of the monetary base are impeded, even in the short

run, by offsetting movements in its domestic source component. If the offset

to domestic credit expansion is complete, the monetary base is determined

independently of the Central Bank's policies by the saving and portfolio deci-

sions of the public. In particular, attempts to sterilize reserve flows through

offsetting domestic credit measures cannot succeed, even temporarily.

      The Central Bank can affect the monetary base through open-market operations

only when domestic- and foreign-currency bonds are imperfect substitutes in inâ€”

vestors' portfolios; under perfect substitutability, the capital-account offset

to domestic credit measures is immediate and complete, provided there are no lags

in portfolio adjustment (see Robert Mundell). However, limited substitutability

is in itself no guarantee of monetary autonomy. If a rational public anticipates

the future tax liabilities implied by the government's debt and the Central Bank's for-

eign reserve holdings, and so "internalizes" the public-sector budget constraint,

official operations in interest-bearing assets will not alter outside asset sup-

plies. Accordingly, such operations will have no influence on the domestic inter-

est rate or money supply even when various risks drive a wedge between home and

foreign interest rates (see the author (1982) and Alan Stockman)

      The offset coefficient--the fraction of any domestic credit expansion

reversed by Central Bank foreign reserve losses in the same quarter--provides
                                           3




 a useful summary measure of the scope for a domestically-oriented monetary

policy.      In reality, this offset depends on the current-account as well as the

capital-account response to domestic credit creation. Empirical studies of the

offset coefficient have typically assumed that the capital-account response is

dominant in the short run, and so regard the current account and income as pre-

determined. The offset coefficient is therefore interpreted as a measure of

capital-account sensitivity to domestic credit expansion, with a coefficient

of unity indicating a complete offset.

           Within the foregoing framework, there are essentially two approaches to

 empirical estimation of the offset coefficient. The first, a reduced-form ap-

 proach, derives from the bond- and money-market equilibrium conditions and the

 Central Bank's balance sheet an approximate linear equation relating the quarter-

 ly capital-account surplus (CAP)to the change in domestic credit over the quarter

 (LDC) ,   the change in the foreign bond rate        the change in nominal income

 (iY),the current account balance (CURR),a vector X of additional, exogenous de-

 terminants of the capital account, and a mean-zero stochastic disturbance



 (1)               + ci1DC +
           CAPt=                    + a3zY1+ a4CURR-I- X + Ut



As observed by Victor Argy and Pentti k'ouri and by Kourj and Michael Porter, (1)

can be used to estimate the offset coefficient -cx1. Because the domestic interest

rate has been eliminated from the reduced form (1), the estimation problem caused

by the potential endogeneity of that variable is avoided.

       The second, structural approach to estimation looks directly at the asset-

demand equations underlying (1), Using structural parameter estimates to compute

the implied offset to credit policy. Examples of this second approach are the
                                       4




studies of West Germany by Richard Herring and Richard Marston and by the

author (1980a),and the study of Mexico in the 1970s by Robert Cumby and the

author (198la). The structural approach suffers from several disadvantages

relative to the reduced-form approach. For example, it may be less robust

with respect to certain specification errors in structural equations. Also,

unlike the reduced-form approach, it cannot be implemented when there is unlimited

substitutability between domestic and foreign bonds. However, the structural ap-

proach avoids an important econometric problem which may bias reduced-form estimates.

       That problem is the endogeneity of the domestic credit variable tDC in

(1) when the Central Bank follows a sterilization policy. If domestic credit

is systematically varied in response to the balance of payments, the regressor

     will be correlated with the disturbance u to the capital-flow equation (1)

Accordingly, ordinary least squares (OLSQ) estimates of the parameters in

(1.) will be inconsistent. In recognition of this problem, Argy and

Kouri used instrumental variables to estimate (1) by two-stage least squares

(2SLS). However, most single-equation studies, including Kouri and

Porter, report OLSQ estimates of the offset coefficient, and convey the impres-

sion that the simultaneous-equations bias imparted to those estimates by Central

Bank sterilization activities is likely to be unimportant in practice.

       A detailed examination of the West German case illustrates the po-

tential importance of the sterilization bias. The Kouri-Porter reduced-form

estimate of the offset coefficient for West Germany (1960:1 -   l970:IV)   is .77, a

figure that indicates a substantial capital-account response to domestic credit

movements. Table I reports estimates of the Kouri-Porter equation based on the

revised Bundesbank data series used in Manfred Neumann's study of offsetting

capital flows. The estimated offset coefficients do not differ sig-

nificantly from unity.2"

Note:  Standard errors appear in parentheses. All equations were estimated with a constant term, but estimates of the
constant are not reported. S4 is a seasonal dummy variable equal to 1 in the fourth quarter and 0 in all other quar-
ters.  SPEC1, SPEC2, and SPEC3 are dummy variables associated with periods of speculative capital movements. SPEC1 =
+1 in 1961:1, -l in 1961:11, and 0 in all other quarters; SPEC2 = +1 in l968:IV, -1 in 1969:1, and 0 in all other quar-
ters; and SPEC3 = +1 in 1969:111, -l in 1969:IV, and 0 in all other quarters. The three estimation procedures used
were ordinary least squares (OLSQ), the Cochrane-Orcutt iterative procedure (CORC), and two-stage least squares (2SLS).
The instrumental variables used in forming the 2SLS estimates are described in the text.
                                        5




       Structural estimates of the offset are considerably lower. Simulation of

Herring and Marstons dynamic multi-equation model yields an offset similar to that

estimated by Noun and Porter only after asset markets have been allowed to adjust

over a period of sixteen quarters. The one-quarter offset is much smaller.

Similarly, the structural model of Obstfeld (1980 a) yields a short-run offset

between .10 and .15.

       A substantial portion of the discrepancy between the structural and

reduced-form estimates is explained by the inclusion of periods of speculative

turbulence in the reduced-form data samp1e.- When the KoÃ¼ri-Porter equation is

estimated instead over the tranquil sub-period 1961:111 to 1967:IV, the OLSQ

estimate of the offset coefficient drops to .56. The latter estimate is still

large compared to those produced by the structural studies.

       The remaining discrepancy can be attributed to the sterilization bias.

Herring and Marston report a Bundesbank domestic-credi.t policy reaction func-

tion in which domestic credit responds not only to the balance of payments, but also

to lagged inflation and to the lagged percentage change in manufacturing orders. If

u in (1) is serially uncorrelated, the latter two variables are correlated with

LDC but not with u, and may be used as instrumental variables for ADCt

calculating a 2SLS estimate of the offset coefficient../ This estimate,

reported in Table I, is insignificantly different from zero, and thus is very

different from the OLSQ estimate over the same sample period. A formal test,

due to Jerry Hausman, shows that the hypothesis that there is no sterilization bias

can be definitively rejected. To implement the Hausman test, add to (1) the

variable ADCt, which is the predicted value from an OLSQ regression of         on

the instrumental variables, including the other regressors in (1). The hypo-

thesis of no sterilization bias is equivalent to the hypothesis that the co-

efficient of LDC is zero. The result of QLSQ estimation (with standard errors

in parentheses) is:
                                                6

               (.148)       (.077)            (.287)          (.020)           (.076)


                                     +   1.049 S4 +       .620    tDC   + Ut
                                         (.478)          (.242)




The hypothesis that the coefficient of                  in (2) is zero is easily rejected.

        The message of this exercise is that reduced-form OLSQ offset estimates

should be interpreted with caution. In the case of West Germany, at least, struc-

tural offset estimates appear more reliable; and they suggest that the short-run

offset to Bundesbank domestic credit policy was rather moderate in the l960s.

These tentative conclusions relate exclusively to the feasibility of sterilization

as a short-run or temporary policy. Did the Bundesbank's short-run monetary

autonomy afford West Germany any long-run independence from monetary developments

abroad? The speculative turbulence of the years 1968-1973 is evidence that it
         4/
did not.


II. The Scope for Sterilization under Managed Floating

        When the exchange rate floats, the nominal money supply becomes a policy-

determined variable which may be set by the Central Bank at any desired level.

The freedom from offsetting reserve losses is largely illusory, however, for

central banks are usually unwilling to live with the exchange-rate consequences

of their monetary decisions. As Charles Kindleberger prophetically observed in

1969, "Along with one more variable there is one more target--the exchange rate."

       If foreign- and domestic-currency bonds are perfect substitutes, Central

Bank operations involving nonmonetary assets will have no effect on equilibrium

exchange rates and interest rates, except, perhaps, in the very short run. As in

the case of a rigidly fixed exchange rate, the Central Bank can attain independent

exchange-rate and money-stock targets only if it can alter the expected nominal
                                                7




yield differential between foreign and domestic bonds. On a portfolio-balance

view of exchange-rate determination, in which bonds of different currency denom-

ination are imperfect substitutes, debt management may be an independent instru-

ment of exchange-rate policy.      (See, for example, William Branson, Lance Girton

and Dale Henderson, Peter Kenen, Kouri, and Obstfeld (l980c).)

       A number of recent econometric studies conclude that bonds differing in

their currency of denomination are not viewed as perfect substitutes by in-

vestors even when the bonds are identical in all other respects.                (See Cumby

and the author (198lb), Craig Hakkio, and Lars Hansen and Robert Hodrick, among

others.)    Cumby and the author investigate the stochastic properties of weekly

time series of the form



(3) c1 = log(S1)          -
                              log(S)
                                       -
                                           Rt
                                                +
                                                    R

where S is the U.S. dollar price of currency j at time t, R is the one-week

Eurodollar interest rate, and R is the one-week interest rate paid on Euro-

currency deposits denominated in currency j.              If dollar bonds and currency-j

bonds are perfect substitutes, then, in an efficient asset market, the ex post

nominal return differential            must be uncorrelated with information available

to investors at time t. In fact, lagged values ,
                                                                  Â£l,...   of the expost excess

return do help forecast          for all currencies examined. This evidence indicates
that       is the sum of a white-noise forecast error and a time-varying risk

risk premium. The latter separates the expected nominal yield on dollar

bonds from that on bonds denominated in
                                                    currency j.
       Of course, the foregoing evidence does not imply that Central Bank fin-

ancial operations can influence the risk premium in a predictable manner. Even

if government securities are outside assets, stochastic models of international

asset pricing leave one doubtful that a small country's sterilized intervention

operations can have a significant effect on its exchange rate. And a large
                                     8




country would have to intervene massively to have much impact..1'

      There is little econometric evidence concerning the effects of sterilized

intervention. Regressions of exchange rates on supplies of government-issued

interest-bearing debt cannot shed much light on the issue, for an increase

in government borrowing may affect the exchange rate by signalling additional

future money creation. A more promising approach, adopted by Jeffrey Frankel,

is to regress the ex post excess return (3) on financial variables in an attempt

to   identify    the determinants of the risk premium. In tests on U.S.-German

data, Frankel could find no financial variables that help in explaining the

ex post nominal return differential. This finding is not evidence against the

existence of a risk premium; but it does suggest that the static models of in-

ternational asset pricing underlying the portfolio-balance view may be inade-

quate. The evidence does not support the proposition that sterilized intervention

has been a potent policy tool in recent years.

   In these equations, the domestic credit variable is defined as the increase

in the net domestic assets of the Bundesbank plus the increase in required re-

serve holdings by private banks. It is equal to the variable NDA + L in Neumann.

This measure captures the importance of reserve requirement changes as an

instrument of monetary management in Germany.

   Kouri and Porter argue that the inclusion of additional dummy variables

in periods of heavy speculation reduces the bias in OLSQ estimates. In fact,

the effect of dummy variables on the estimated offset is quite small for the

data set used here.


   The inflation rate is the rate of increase in the German WPI. Data are

taken from the 1973 Supplement to the IMF's International Financial Statistics.

Data on manufacturing orders (in the form of an index) come from the OECD's

Historical Statistics.

   For a theoretical discussion of sterilization as a long-run policy, see

Obstfeld (1980b).

   The argument here assumes that the Central BanUs decision to undertake

sterilized intervention does not convey to the market new information regard-

ing future monetary growth. Michael Mussa discusses that possibility.
