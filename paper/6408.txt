What Explains Changing Spreads on Emerging-
Market Debt: Fundamentals or Market Sentiment?

NBER Working Paper No. 6408
February 1998
JEL No. F3


                                            ABSTRACT


       In this paper we analyze data on nearly 1,000 developing-country bonds issued in the years

1991-96, a period that spans the recent episode of heavy reliance on bonded debt. We analyze both

the issue decision of debtors and the pricing decision of investors, minimizing selectivity bias by

treating the two issues jointly. Overall, the results confirm that higher credit quality translates into

a higher probability of issue and a lower spread. Importantly, however, we find that observed

changes in fundamentals explain only a fraction of the spread compression in the period leading up

to the recent crisis in emerging markets.
