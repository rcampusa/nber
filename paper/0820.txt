                  The Changing Economic Value of Higher Education
                             in Developed Economies
                             A Report to the 0.E.C.D.




                                      ABSTRACT



     This   paper analyses the changing economic value of higher education

in the major 0.E.C.D. countries. The first part of the study examines

data on earnings by education or earnings in occupations composed of per-

sons with different educational attainments. A second part looks at un-

employment rates and the occupations attained by college graduates. Both

the relative earnings data and the unemployment and occupational attainment

data suggest that the heralded decline in the economic    value of higher
education   in the U.S. is not a unique North American phenomenon, but rather,

a general development throughout the developed world, On the basis of

evidence on elasticities of substitution and the observed growth in the

supply of college graduates the paper suggests that the decline in the

premium to the educated reflects movement along a reasonably well—defined

demand for graduates schedule due to the growth of the college and university

systems of the various countries.

          One of the distinctive aspects of modern economic growth has been

increased investments in higher education. During the 1950s and l960s college

and   university systems expanded throughout the developed world, fueled by the
belief that education offered a sizeable economic return to the individual and
was an important means of societal growth. With rare exception, policymakers
and analysts viewed higher education as a major road to economic well—being and

in some instances as a panacea to social problems, including reduction of income



                       '"
inequality. Resources flowed into higher education in unprecedented amounts.

sities came to employ more persons and to account for a larger share of gross
national product than the steel or automobile industries.1 Spurrea by a relati—
vely high rate of return and good job opportunities, an    increasing pro1ortion of

young persons chose to enroll for hiher education.

          The 1970s witnessed a marked chane in the economic position of the

highly educated through most of the western world. The     job market for graduates
underwent a significant turnaround and growth of   enrollments levelled off or

declined   relative to the relevant age group. While the timing and magnitude of
the   change differ among countries, there was a general reversal of the boom of

previous decades.

          This paper examines the quantitative dimensions of the changing economic

status of the highly educated, and considers the economic forces that appear to

underlie the changes. Section I analyzes several indicators of the state of the

graduate market in severalcountries the earnings of graduate workers relative
to nongraduates, where these are not available or sparse, the earnings in occu-
pations where graduates predominate to those where they do not, unemployment
rates for graduates; and the composition of jobs obtained by graduates. It
                                           —2—

 finds noticeable declines in the earnings of graduates relative to other

 workers, reductions in the proportion of graduates in jobs traditionally filled

 by college—level workers, and noticeable increases in graduate unemployment.

 Section II seeks to explain the observed changes in terms of a relatively

 simple supply—demand model of the graduates market in which the increase in

 relative supply of graduates exceeding increases in relative demanu reduce the

economic advantage of college or university traininb. In addition, some con-

sideration is given to the alternative hypothesis that the decline in the uni-

versity premium is due to trade union or governmental efforts maintain the ear-

nings of the less educated in a period of slow economic growth.



I. Quantitative Dimensions   of   Change

        A sizeable and growing body of evidence has found that the economic

position of hiahly educated workers, particularly recent or young graduates,

underwent significant deterioration relative to that of other workers in the

U.S. in the 1970s. Is this pattern of a declining premium to higher education

also true of other developed countries, or is it a development distinct to the

U.S.?

        To answer the question, this section examines evidence on the earnings

of educated workers relative to less educated workers or on the earnings of

workers in occupations composed largely of graduates to those in other

occupations, on graduate unemployment, and the type of jobs obtained by gra-

duates in a large number of developed countries. While the quality of the data

and the timing of changes differs from country to country, the evidence presents

overwhelming support for the proposition that the_economic_advantages of higher

education declined throughout the developed_world in the period_studied. In a
                                          —3—

majority    of the countries moreover, the bulk of the decline occurred in the
early part of the decade, with the position of graduates more or less stabi-
lizing toward    the end of the l9IUs.

           Table 1 summarizes   the earnings data. Where possible the information
relates the    earnings of college graduates to nongraduates, but in some cases, I

report   ratios of incomes in occupations where graduates predominate to those
in occupations where they do not. This assumes that at least some inferences
can be made about education premium from occupational earnings patterns. In
several cases the published data show breaks or jumps due to changes in defini-
tions or methods of computing averages. Where this occurs I report both fiaures
and infer changes in ratios over the entire perioo from the sum of the two
changes.    The precise definition of earnings or incomes differs across

countries; fringe benefits, which have become an increasingly important part of

the returns to labor in recent years, are generally excluded, and aLl of the

data relate to before—tax earnings. Exclusion of fringes     undoubtedLy biases the
figures, though its effect on changes in ratios is ecjuivocal. On the one hand,

fringes tend to be a higher proportion of pay among the higher paid; on the

other hand, the fringes of the manuaL workers have increased greatly in recent

years, with many fringes traditionally given to the higher—level workers now

given to other workers in enterprises. Overall, because the major changes found

in the data are quite sizeabie, I doubt that lack of data on fringes seriously

distorts the pattern.

         One other aspect of the data deserves attention. Sometimes the figures

reported relate to workers of al.L ages, at other times, they refer to starting

wages or the wages of young workers. While it would have been desireahie to
                                 —4—

obtain consistent figures for each country, I was limited by the published

data sources. Analyses of U.S. figures show larger declines in the relative

earnings of younger graduates than of older graduates, which suggests that

the decline in relative earnings was concentrated among new graduates. If

this is generally the case, the data for all workers in several other

countries understates the dimensions of the decline among the graduates of

the 1970s.

        With this brief discussion of the data and calculations behind us,

let us now examine the figures in Table 1, country by country, beginning

with the English—speaking nations where migration might be expected to cause

similar patterns of change.


English—speaking countries

        For the United_States, Table 1 shows declines in the income of

college graduates relative to high school graduates of sizeable magnitude

from 1969 to 1974, followed by rough stability in the ensuing period, with

some increases and some decreases in the ratios. In all cases, however,

the end of decade income ratios lie far below the ratios at the outset of

the decade. The biggest declines occur for younger workers and for those

with doctoral degrees. Detailed analyses of these patterns of changes

suggest that they translate into declines in rates of return of 3—4 per-

centage points, from the 10%—liZ levels of the late 1960s to perhaps 7%

in the 1970s.2

        The figures for Australia in Table 1 reveal a similar pattern of

declining advantage to the college educated. In this case I have incomes

for university degree holders and for all persons without degrees. Since the

latter includes persons who have not graduates secondary school, the ratios

tend to be higher than those for the U.S. With respect to the trends of

     (primo dirigente) with other professional positions within and outside the

     total income of a clerk classified as l-3 (commisso cap l13) and an admi-

interest what stands out in the data is the sizeable percentage point decline

in the advantage for the more highly educated, with greater declines in the

first half of the decade for all but the 45—54 year olds. In contrast

to the U.S. data, the magnitudes of the changes in Australia show possibly

greater deterioration in the relative position of older graduates than

of younger graduates.

        The next country in the table is Canada for which the data relate

the income of university graduates to the income of various groups of less

educated workers, overall, and by age. Because of changes in definitions in

the published figures I compare 1969 to 1974 and 1975 to 1978 separately

and obtain changes over the whole period by summing the 1969—74 and 1975—78

changes. While magnitudes of change differ among age groups, with the

24—34 group showing much smaller drops in relative income than is found in

the U.S. or Australia, the overall pattern is consistent. As in those

countries, the relative earnings of college graduates fell in the period

under study, by large amounts.

        The evidence for the United Kingdom on educational groups in (a) and

(b) is based on the ratios of starting salary from the Leeds University

survey to the average earnings of other workers. The drop from 1968 to

1974 is uniform and large, with the institutionally—induced change in youth

apprentice rates severely reducing the advantage of graduates over youths.3

The decline is particularly marked for those in the Arts and Social Sciences

and for female graduates and, because of declines in the nonmanual to manual

income ratios for the United Kingdom, are exceptionally large relative to the

inceoms of manual workers. From 1974 to 1978 there is a general but modest

rise in the ratios, a pattern which is more consistent than that found

in the U.S. The occupation data in lines 5—7 show comparab].e trends for

various groups of highly qualified workers. Note that in these comparisons

the base group are nonmanual workers. Contrasts with manual workers would

reveal much more striking declines.
                                      —16—




Japan

         Figures for Japan in lines (a) 1—3, taken from a University of Wisconsin

dissertation, show a pattern of decline in the relative earnings of graduates by

age which began in the mid—1950s and proceeded through the early 1970s, of a

magnitude similar to that obtained in the more recent decade for the English—

speaking countries. The data also show a more pronounced drop in relative inco-

mes for younger as opposed to older graduates, similar to that found in the

U.S., U.K., and Canada.

        Lines (b)1 and (b)2 carry the analysis through 191b. They give the

ratios of average earnings of college graduates to elementary and high school

graduates. These figures provide further evidence of a fall off in the relative

pay of college graduates in Japan, with an overall drop of about 10 percentage

points for both men and women.


Continental Europe

        The remaining countries in Table 1 are on the continent of Europe. I

had greater probleras obtaining data for the continental countries than for

others and have been forced to rely in several cases on earnings by occupation

rather than by education. To the extent that, as seems reasonable, part of the

fall in the economic advantage to the highly educated takes the form of a

downgrading in occupations (this is definitely the case in the U.S. and Japan),

the occupation data will understate the actual deterioration in the position of

graduates.
                                         —11—

           Possible understatement notwithstandin5,, the evidence in Taule 1 shows

that for an countries there is a large droj in the income of those in jobs

reuirina more education relative to workers in jobs requiring less education.

           The French data, in particular, show a marked fall in the advantage of

executives and managers compared to nonmanual 'employees' and manual workers and

a sizeable but less marked dro in the earnings of technical workers relative to

manual workers. Consistent with the pattern found in the English—speakin

countries, moreover, most of the decline in the ratios occurs in the first part

of the l9IIJs, from 1969 to 1916. Lines (c) 1 and 2 for France present data on

educational differentials themselves, but for an eary period. They reveal a

fall off in the advantage to bachelor's graduates but not to hiher degree reci-

pients in the 1960s.

                 Two sets of figures are given for Italy: (a) ratios of average

        earnings of university graduates to elementary and secondary school graduates

       and (b) ratios of the starting wages of public sector executives to other

      workers in the public sector. The college earnings data show an enor-

      mous decline in the relative earnings of graduates from advantages far

       exceeding those in the U.S. in 1967 to figures comparable to those in the U.S.

      by 1977. The public sector differentials reveal a similar pattern.

           For Denmark the data are limited to part of the work force: central

government employees coverec by collective bargaining coritracts.They have the

disadvantage of providing no information on the private sector but the advantage

of relating to the academic degree recipients of concern. The figures tell a

clear   story: in Denmark   in the other countries we have examined, the rela-
                             as

tive earnings of the more educated fell.
          The   final country in the table is Germany, where the   data relate the pay

of   technical employees with higher qualifications to that of employees with
lower q_ualifications. The figures show a sizeabLe drop for the hihest group

relative to the lowest and more modest declines for the highest relative to

other groups. As in Japan, however, the drop appears to have begun in the l9bUs

rather than in the 1910s.

        The conclusion that in Continental Europe, as in the English-speakiflb

countries and Japan, there was a marked fall in the relative income of the

highly educated in the periods covered is inescapable.



Interpretation
        The Table 1 data support the following claim: In the English_speaking

countries, in Japan, and in the Western European countries, the relative ear-

nings of highly educated workers or of those in occupations dominated by the

highly educated fall sharply in the l9TQs. In most of the countries, moreover,

the declines appear to be greater in the early part of the 1970s than in the

latter part, possibly because of the potentially lar,er impact of the slowdown

in the world econon in the latter years on less educated workers. It is of

some interest to note that evidence on nonmanuaJ to manual differentials or on

skill differentials amon nnual workers also have followed such a pattern. In

six of the seven Common Market countries for which data are available from

Eurostat, the nonmanual to manual worker earnings ratio fell, with the greatest

 decline in the early part of the decade.5 Marsden's 1981 analysis of pay dif-

 ferentials in Britain, West Germany, France, and Italy provides additional sup-

                                            'there is evidence of a similar long—
 port for our analysis. He concludes that

 term reduction in the differential for higher—paid nonxianual occupations' in all

 of those countries with some indication that the decline showed at the end of

 the 1910s (p. 309). While declines in higher paid nonmanual worker earnings to
                                         —19—

manual worker earnings do not necessarily imply declines in the relative pay of

graduates, such a pattern is consistent with the evidence in Table 1 about the

rewards to higher education.

Unemployment and non-price indicators

          Market adjustments to changes in the supply—demand balance involve more

than simply   movement of relative prices. If    the economic position of the highly

educated deteriorated, as indicated by the wage data in Table 1, we might aLso

expect   unemployment and nonprice indicators of economic status to show co-

parable   declines as well.6
          Table 2   summarizes available data regarding the types   of jobs obtained
by graduates and various indicators of unemployment. Measures of the proportion

of graduates in 'college—level' occupations proviae a statistic that is easier

to intetpret than unemployment rates, as declines in the proportion in jobs tra-

ditionally requiring a degree can be taken at face value as indicative of a

deterioration in market conditions, Because unemployment varies cyclically,

particularly for manual workers, on the other hand, comparisons of the rates for

both college graduates and less educated workers are complicated: the ratio of

the rates may decline, while the difference may widen for cyclical rather than

reasons of structural change in the market. One way of dealing with this

problem is to regress the unemployment rate of graduates on the unemployment

rate for other workers and examine deviations from the regression line. I have

made such calculations for the U.S. but not for other countries.

          The U.S. data in lines 1 and 2 highlight one of the most important

aspects of the declining market for graauates in that country: the decline in

the percentage of graduates finding employment in the job areas normally held by

college graduates, the one—digit professional and technical category. When one
                                               —20-.


focuses Ofl   the   marginal as opposed to the average likelihood of obtaining

professional, technical and kindred jobs, the story of deterioration is even

stronger.      From 1962      to   1965, the number of college graduates in the labor

force grew by 14,011,000, whereas the number of graduates with professional jobs

grew by 2,915,000 —          implyinb   that 131o of the additional college workers got pro-

fessional employment. From 1969 to 197b, by contrast, when the number of gra-

duates grew by 5,096,000, the number obtaining professional jobs grew by just

3,751,000 — a       146%   rate   of employment in the professions. From 1976 to 1979, the

number of graduates increased by 3,106,205, while the number working as pro

fessionals increased by 1,627,000 — a 1414% rate of enloyment in the

professions.T

          The U.S. unemployment rates show a noticeable increase in the rate for

graduates, but as noted earlier this could represent either a structural change

or a normal cyclic pattern. To see whether the period under study deviates from

earlier periods I regressed the rate of unemployment of collebe graduates on the

rate for hih school graduates and the rate of unemployment of professional

workers on the rate of unemployment for blue collar workers. Figure 1 shows the

results. As can be seen by the dark areas, there does appear to be a structural

change,   with graduate (professional) employment worse relative to high            school


(blue   collar) unemployment than in          the   past.
            The Canadian data show similar patterns of change,        with the graduates'

unemployment rate rising sharply, from less than               to 14.1% in   1911 but then

falling     to 3.14% in 1917. As the nongraduate rate also rises substantively, it

 is unclear if the orseriing in the position of graduates is more or less than

would be expected under pre_1910s conditions. If the U.S. patterns are any

 indication, the graduates' situation would appear to have worsened.

           The story for the United Kingdom is similar, with the evidence in line 1

showing a definite worsening in the ease with which first degree recipients find

jobs: the proportion still seeking employment in December of the year was 3% in

1962, in 1979 it was still 11%, whereas the rate of total unemployment rose more

modestly. In 1962 the ratio of the percentage of first degree university graduates

still seeking permanent employment to the total unemployment rate was 1.4; the

figure rose to 1.9 by 1969 and was still at that level in 1979. However, our

data do not extend to the recent doubling of total unemployment in the British

economy.

           The limited figures I have obtained for Japan show a drop in the propor-

tion of graduates in professional and technical jobs, though in Japan, unlike

the U.S., the majority of graduates are employed in managerial and clerical

rather than professional jobs.

           Turning to the European continent, the Belgium data are perhaps the most

striking as they show a tripling in the proportion of the unemployed persons

receiving unemployment compensation accounted for by those with university

education, an increase that has to far exceed the increase in the university

share of the work force over the period.

           The figures for Denmark show sizeable rates of unemployment for selected

groups of highly qualified workers, except engineers. Compared to the average

rate in the country, the figures reveal higher rates for graduates of arts and

sciences and academics, a pattern consistent with data for the U.S. which

suggest a greater worsening in the market for academic fields.8

           The Italian data by education which I have obtained do not give normal

rates of unemployment. They distinguish between graduates looking for their

first job, the experienced unemployed, and the employed. I use the fitures to

calculate three types of statistics. The ratio of graduates looking for first

jobs to degrees granted in line 1 for Italy is an indicator of the difficulties

new graduates may have in obtaining work. As the data compared are different

    (graduates seeking first job will include those from previous years' classes),

the magnitude should not be taken as an unemployment rate, as normally           defined.
The trend, however, is sufficiently striking to suggest a distinct worsening in

the position of graduates, consistent with reports of major problems in the

Italian marketplace. Line 2 records the percentage of the experienced

unemployed who are graduates. It shows that university graduates have more than

tripled their share of unemployment in the period 1970—1979 froiri 0.7% to 2.6%;

since the graduate share of the work force has not come close to tripling (from

implies        a distinct trend in relative unemployment rates. Finally, lines 3 and 4
record         the relevant unemployment rates, where the number of persons seeking

first jobs are included in both the numerator and denominator of the statistic.

These data show a rate for graduates in excess of that for the entire work force

in the decade.

               In France the data for unemployment rates by occupation show noticeable

increases in the rates for professionals and executives and for middle level

executives. Whether these increases are more/less/about what would be expected

on the basis of past patterns of cyclic change we have not deterrnineu.

In Germany the proportion of the unemployed in scientific and technical occupa—

tions rose by nearly 80% in the space of just seven years.

                  Overall, while the data in Table 2 suffer from various problems of non—

    comparablity across countries, the preponderance of the evidence suggests that

    the unemployment of graduates and their employment prospects worsened in the

    1970s, probably though not definitely, to a greater than normal extent during an

    economic slowdown. Since the 1970s were a period of sluggish economic growth,

    however, it is important to recognize that the unemployment of the nongraduate

    labor force tended to increase more in percentage points than did the graduate

    unemployment rate.

 11. EconOmic Determinants of Change
             What factors exLain the observed declines in the economic position of

highly educated workers in the O.h.C.D.             countries shown in tables 1 and 2?

             in this section I seek to explain the observed patterns in terms of

changes in the relative supply and demand for graduates, with the              principal
moving force being the rapid expansion of higher education of the l960s. I

develop a small supply—demand model designed to pin down the key forces at work

and    examine empirical evidence regarding the magnitude of the relevant paratue—
ters of change. Finally, i consider one possible alternative explanation of
change:       that the decline in the relative position of graduates stems not from

the increased supply of graduates but rather from trade union and governmental
                                                          educated workers in the face of
policies which maintained the position of less

an overall drop in the market for labor of various types.


The supply-demand framework

             Let X =   rate   of change in the location of the demand curve for univer-

 sity graduates relative to the demand for other workers; S =           rate   of change in

 the position of the supply of university graduates relative to other workers;

 o =   the   elasticity of demand for university graduates relative to other workers

 which in the current context can be represented by the elasticity of

 substitutiOn, c =       the   elasticity of supply of university graduates defined

 "relative to the number of potential students.

             Then the change in relative demand for graduates will be:

              (1) E=X-OW
 where E =      rate   of change in relative employment of graduates arid
                                                                               W =   rate   of


 change in relative pay of graduates. The change in the relative supply of gram-
                                           —31—

duates will be:

           (2) Es =   S   +   eW


where Es      relative supply.

        Assume, for simplicity, that the labor market clears, so that E = Es.

Then the economic advantage received by college graduates will depend on the

shift (s, x) and slope (e, a) parameters as follows:

           (3) W=(x—s)/(c+a)
        Equation (3) shows, that when shifts in supply for educated labor exceed

shifts in demand, relative wages will fall. The extent of the fall is con-

ditioned by the elasticity of substitution between more and less qualified labor

and the elasticity of supply. Figure 2 shows graphically how the effect of

changes in supply and demand depends critically on the relevant elasticities.

Taking the demand side first, panel A distinguishes between the extreme case in

which the elasticity of substitution between more/less educated workers is inf i—

nite and the case in which it has a more modest value. In the infinite elastic

case, changes in the demand for and supply of educated labor have no effect on

relative wages. Turning to supply, panel B shows a similar situation with an

infinite and noninfinite elasticity of supply. It makes the point that if

investments in human capital are perfectly elastic at a going rate of return, as

is often implicitly assumed in human capital models, then relative wages are

fixed at a level solely suppJ' determined.

        What has happened to the four determinants in the period studied?


Shifts in supply (s)

        Two   factors     caused a significant increase in the supply of highly edu-

cated workers in the 1910s: the entry of the 'baby boom' generation into the

 labor market (which, of course, differed somewhat in timing across countries)

 and the increased propensity of young persons to enroll in higher educational

programs over the period. Because of the time lag between decisions to enroll

in university and graduation and entr,y into the job market, we take the increase

in the supply of graduates due to the enrollment expansion of the 1960s as a

shift in supply (s) in the 1970s.

        Table 3 presents comparable international data which document this well—

known phenomenon and provide some magnitude of the changes. It shows that bet—

ween 1960 and 1910 the absolute and relative number of persons entering univer-

sities (and thus graduating in the l970s) doubled or even tripled in many

countries. Data for a limited number of countries for which I have figures on

graduates confirm that the tremendous increase in enrollments showed up in gra-

duates in the l9TOs. Between 1970 and 1916 in the U.S. the ratio of 25—34 year

old college to high school graduates rose from .38 to .57 —— a50% rise.9 In the

U.K., the number of degrees granted 20—24 year olds rose from .ii6 to .i44 from

1970 to 1975,10 while in Japan the number of new college graduates relative to

new high school graduates increased by over 5O, from .24 in 1970 to .37' in

1975.11 Any economic explanation of the declining economic value of higher edu-

cation will rest heavily on the striking increase in supply in the period.


Shifts in Demand

        In the absence of detailed country studies of the employment of gra-

duates by sectors and of sectoral rates of growth, along the lines of the fixed

coefficient model often used by governmental forecasters, it is difficult to say

much about the demand side for the bulk ci' the countries. On the basis of

detailed analyses of the U.S. and general knowledge of development elsewhere,

mic premiUJTl to high levels of education in terms of a decline in relative

for   graduates.   Relative demand for graduates appears to have increased in the

period, though at declining rates over time, as the technologically intensive

industries and education and the government sectors——all of which employ large

proportions of graduates——grew, often rapidly. That demand increased does not,

of course, imply that the pattern of demand shifts did not contribute to

observed changes in the relative incomes of graduates, for had it increased more

rapidly, the observed decline would have been more modest.


Elasticity of Subst itut ion

          As shown in (3), one of the key parameters in determining the extent to

which increases in supply of graduates relative to demand redace relative wages

is the elasticity of substitution between more and less educated workers. What

do .re knoi about the magnitude of this parameter?

          In the 1960s, several analysts concluded that the key elasticity was

quite high, sufficiently large to yield a roughly horizontal demand curve.       The

basic   mode of analysis was to regress the relevant income ratios on relative

quantities, and certain control variables, assuming that relative quantities are

predetermined by past supply decisions. The first three stu.dies listed in Table

1 summarize the results of this work. Using a small sample of countries, Bowles

obtained a value of o of over 200. With a sample of 28 states from the United

States, Dougherty obtained a more moderate but still very high estimate of over

8. Since the impact of changes in the relative supplies on relative wages

depends inversely on the elasticity of substitution, the value of 8 implies only

modest impacts of chanbes in relative supply on wages: an increase of, saj,
                                       —37—

100%   in the relative supply or graduates wouLd reduce relative ourninbs by just
0.13 Psacharopoulos and Rinchiifte divided the country sample by derec of
development, finding an esserit Laity infinite elasticity in the developed
countries of concern. Since the relative income of graduates reneained const'snt
or increased in the 1950s and 19b0s, despite the increased supply of graduates,
these estimates were accepted as beinb rou,,hb in accord with reaLity anti taken,
by some, as reruting the "fixed coefficient" model of demand used by the
0.I.C.D., amou others, to analyse the grauuate and skiLled worker market.
         In the 1970s, concurrent with the observed decline in the relative posi-
tion or graduates, new estimates based on better data and models provided a very
different picture of the relevant ebisticity. Tinbergen amplified the country
and state models to deal with the likely interaction of supply and denisrad in
determining relative wages and quantities, and obtained quite different reouLts
trots Bowles and Dougherty. His el.asticitteu ranged from about 1/2 to 2.00.      L


used time series data for the United States to determine the iqiact of growth in
the relative number of raduates on relative earuinss arid obtained est1nateu of
a similar magnitude, ranging from I to 2.6. Helat Lveij moderate results were
also obtained between more and Less educated workers by Layard and )illon. By
the mid—lyTOs the value of the substitution elasticity parameter appeared to be
on the order of 1 to 2, which is of a magnitude that permits sizeable increases
in supply relative to demand to reduce the premium to highly educated workers.

Elasticity of supply
         The second key parameter in equation (3) is the elasticity of the supply

of students to universities. While research on this topic did not begin in ear-

nest until   the mid—l970s, we have at this point several studies, which though

usin   different data and methodologies, all           suggest   that the elasticity is on

the order of perhaps 1.5.

           Table 5 summarizes    these    studies in a format comparable to that used in

different forms of data, they obtain comparable magnitudes. Time series estima—

tes for the U.S. and U.K. range from 0.1 to 1.7, cross—country comparisons yield

estimates of 0.5 to 2.6;       anaLyses       using individual data and a more structural

           For the U.S., moreover, there is survey evidence whIch suggests that,
contrary to the traditional views of educators, students are hihly aware of,
and responsive to economic rewards. earty 50 percent of freshmen surveyed by
the   American Council of Education in 1971 agreed, for example, that a major

reason for going to college was that it would enabLe them to get a better

job.12 Nearly one—third cited "aole to make more money" as a verj important

reason for going to colleme. Similar results are obtained with questions

relating to choice of career. My 1969 survey of college students showed that

their expectations of salaries and of lifetime income profiles over fields

mirrored actual market circumstances.13

           If there is indeed a non—negligible supply response to economic

opportunities, one would expect, at the least a slowdown in the growth of

enrollments relative to the relevant population in the 1910s. Columns 3) and

5—6 of Table 3 and figures 3 and )4 examine this expectation. The columns in the

table contrast percentage changes in the enrollments and in ratios in the

1960—1910 period to the 1970—76 period. In each countr' the rate of               increase
enrollments decelerates; in all but one the ratio of enrollments declines

becoming negative in the U.S. and France and droing to below 1.07a in the
                                   —40--


Netherlands, Belgium and Canada.

        The figures give more detailed time series information for the U.S. and

U.K. It shows the drop off in enrollments in the U.S. in the 1970s, con-

centrated among men, and reveals a similar fall in the U.K. toward the end of

the period, concentrated among women. Note that the figures for the U.K.

show a decline in the proportion enrolled in the period covered, in contrast

to the O.E.C.D. figures. One reason for this divergence is that the O.E.C.D.

figures refer to university—type higher education whereas the participation

rates in Figure 4 refer to all higher education, including teacher training

where enrollments have been dropping especially rapidly.

        We conclude that there is a substantial elasticity of supply with

respect to salaries but that the elasticity is far from the infinite value

which would rule out a supply—demand explanation of observed changes.

The s             arid   exp lariat ion of change
             The preceding analysis suggests that the decline in the premium to
higher education found in Section 1 can potentially be explained as the resuLt
of a sizeable shift in supply of graduates, which exceeded the increase in
demand, in conjunction with elasticities of substitution on the order                 of 2.1)

and    elasticities of supply on the order of 1.5. Using (:3) and those values of
o and    c, we would expect increases in relative number of gradustes to              reduce the

educational premium with an elasticity of about 0.3. If             we tako the increases

in    relative enrollment from 1960 to lY(b/19       shown   in lable 3   as   irid.icative of

the    change in relative supply of young graduates over the period, and. assuije
moderate increases in        relative demand   for graduates,   e.g. l) per year, which          is
about the estimate I obtained for the U.S. (reeiuan, 1910, tabLe 5, p.    the          ),
resultant figures suggest that the supply—demand explanation wilt fit the
observed experience to a reasonable extent: on avera0e, the growth rate of
relative enrollments in the final column of Table 3 is nearLy )4.0% per annum;
taking S = 4.o)'; X = 1.0% and i/ c + c) = .30 in equation (3) , these figures
yield a decline in the university premium of about 1% per annum, which Is
roughly in accord with the        general   magnitude of declines in   most    countries.
Since, of course, the timing and magnitude of changes differs considerably amon0
countries, this     exercise is meant     solely td show that the proposed explanation
is not grotesquely out of line. In the one case where I have tested the exFla—
nation using a regression model, (see Freeman, H. in Griliches, Z., W. KrelLe,
Li.   Krupp, and 0. Kyn, 19(5), all of the 19b9—1        chari0e   in the U.S. was attri-
buted to the rapid growth of the relative supply of graduates. Note that the
reversal in growth of supply in the late l9(Us in the U.S. is crudely consistent
with   the   observed slackened decline! modest improvement in relative earnlri0s

ratios at that time; cyclical factors, however, were also at work.
        What about alternative explanations of the changes?

        Uric potential hypothesis is that in a period of stow/dec tirlinb growtn ot
real earnings, as characterized the 1910s, trade union/noverrlmeritat activities
to maintain the real position of manuaL workers rather than the supp1ydemarn1
market figures stressed here underLie the observed patterns. In the one case                  in

which I have examined this       hypothesis,     the data suggest that while union acttvL—
ties have operated in the predicted        direction,      they have not been sufficientLy
sizeable to explain the observed patterns. Specifically in the U.S., where
about 20% of the labor force is organized, trade unions have raised their wabes
relative to those of nonunion manuaL workers by perhaps 5 percentage points in
the    period   studied; if we assume, at an extreme, that halt of nongraduaten were

organized, this implies at most a 21/2 percenta,e point increaze in manual                worker
earnings    and thus a 21/2   point   decrease   in the   colleue   premium,   coripareu to
observed changes of 14—20 percentage points.

The future
          Are the developments of the 1910s a permanent or a transitory
phenomenon? Will the preuhia to hiher education continue to decline, stabilize,
or rise in the future? In terms of the analysis given, the answer depends on
what   Tinbergen has called the 'race' between the growth of suppLy and the growth
of   demand.1       On the supply side, demographic forces and the reduced propensity

to enroll in higher education shown in Table 3 suggest that the principal cause

of the falling premia——rapid expansion of supply——will be arrested in the next

decade.    In some    countries, notably the United States, demographic factors are

likely    to lead   to an actual improvement in the economic status of yourmo gra—

 duates as the number of young persons falls in the 1980s, decreasing the number

 of young graduates and raising their wages. In other o.h.C.D. countries the

 demographic   patterns will produce declines in the number of young        persons at the
 end of   the 1980s, suggesting that any improvement in the position of graduates

 will not   begin until then. The demographic chauge is likely to have less impact
 on nongraduate workers because they tend to be more ready substitutes for older
workersthan are new university—trained personnel. In other countries, the
demographic swings are less dramatic, suggesting more modest chauges in the
market  in ensuing periods. On the demand side, it is difficult to forecast how
technology and related factors will shift relative demand schedules. Diverse
forecasts, based on varying assumptions about future economic developments,
suggest no extraordinary change in relative demands, which leaves the shifts in
supply as the main moving force in the market.
           While there may be some upswing and while there is unlikely to be any
further deterioration in the relative economic position of graduates, at least
in the l980s, I do not believe the market will rebound in general to such an
extent as to restore pre—1910s graduate/nongraduate differentials.

           In this regard, it is of some value to contrast the position of hi0hly

educated workers across countries. Mi else the same, if the relative earnings

on return to college declined with level of development, one could be more

likely    to expect the reduced premium to   persist than if development were unre-
lated    to premium. 'Ible 6   summarizes   data   gathered   by G. Psacharopoulos which
shows a sizeable drop in private returns to college training with          development,

which    lends support to the notion that the diminished premium of the 1910s will
be more than a transient phenomenon.

           Another clue to the future may      be   found in the evidence given by
30jtovk'       in his 196 paper on the trend in professional. earnings. Scitovsky

examined data from 1810—1900 to the 1950s, finding a downward trend in most
western    countries in      the ratio of professional earnings to the earnings of' other

workers,    though his data revealed diverse patterns of' change for different pro-
fessions in      different   periods. That the development at' the 1970s are at least
consistent with some long—run changes also suggests they will. not be entirely
reversed    in ensuing decades.

Conclusion

          This   paper has examriinec diverse data on the changing    economic position

of   graduate workers in the major devetopen        countries. It hss found
           i) An overall trend in the 1910s and in some cases earlier toward a
lower graduate to nongraduate income ratio.
          2)    A distinct time pattern to the decline, whIch was most severe in
most countries in the early part of the decade.
          3) A worsening in the uneiqployment position of graduates, in some cases
relative   to the unemployment position of other workers.

          l) A reduction in the upward trend and in some cases a reversal of the

trend in enrollments as a proportion of the relevant age group.

           5) Estimates of substitution between more and less educated workers and

elasticities of' the supply of students on the order of 1—2, magnitudes which

permit shifts in supply and demand to have a sizeab.Le effect on wages.

          The paper has advanced the hypothesis that the decline in the coLLege

premium is in fact due to the increase in supply during the period in condunc—

tion with the elasticity values given above. It has speculaten that the 1980s

will see a better market f'or graduates but not a return of the pre—19(Us econo-

mic   advantage.
