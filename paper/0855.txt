            Speculative   Hyperinflations in Maximizing Models:
                            Can We Rule Then Out?

                                  Abstract



         Knife—edge stability is a common property of dynamic monetary

models assuming perfect foresight or rational expectations. These models

can be closed with the assumption that the economy's equilibrium lies on

the unique convergent path (the saddlepath). While this empirically

plausible assumption yields sensible results, aggregative models are not

specified in sufficient detail to allow one to prove that the saddlepath is

the unique equilibrium path. Brock (1974, 1975) and Stock and Scheinkman (1980)

have advanced models in which individual preferences are more fully

specified and in which, under certain conditions. the uniqueness and stability

of equilibrium can be rigorously demonstrated. This paper shows that

these uniqueness conditions are economically unreasonable.        Therefore, the

question these maximizing models address remains unresolved.

Introduction                                   -




       In   his seminal papers on monetary perfect—foresight equilibrium,

Brock (1974, 1975) asked whether explosive price—level paths can be

equilibrium paths when the money supply grows at a constant rate. By

deriving the demands for money and goods from the optimizing decisions

of infinitely—lived agents, Brock was able to argue that, at least in the

conLext of one simple model, such "hyperinflationary equilibria" can be

ruled out under a few economically reasonable assumptions. Brock's conclusion

have provided an important theoretical justification for the convergence

assumption typically used to close saddlepath—stable macroeconomic models
                            1/
with rational, expectations.—

       In subsequent work, Brock has modified his earlier conclusions,

however. Brock (1978) demonstrates than an additional, less intuitive,

condition is needed to preclude explosive (but not implosive) price paths

in a continuous—time version of his discrete—tine model. Brock and Scheinkman

(1980) prove that a similar condition is necessary to rule out hyperinflationa

equilibria in certain overlapping—generations models of money demand. And

Scheinkman (1980) does the same in a variant of the dower (1967) cash—in—

advance model. These papers are among the few attempts to justify rigorously

the stability assumption first proposed by Sargent and Wallace (1973) and

now a ubiquitous feature of dynamic monetary models.-'

      Here, we re—examine and evaluate the assumptions needed to preclude

hyperinflationary equilibria in the models of Brock and of Brock and Scheinkman.

We establish that the additional condition suggested by Brock (1978) is

uscessary and sufficient to rule out hyperinflationary equilibria in the

discrete—time version of his model, as well as in its continuous—time

version. Further, we interpret the condition and show it implies that

agents must have infinitely negative utility when their real balances are

zero. Unless money is essential in this extreme sense, speculative

hyperinflationary paths along which the economy is eventually demonetized

are equilibrium paths.

      Our results show also that speculative hyperinflation can be ruled

out in Brock and Scheinkman's (1980) overlapping—generations economy

only if agents, in the absence of money, have infinitely negative utility

when old.

I.   The Brock Model in Discrete Time



          In this section we study a discrete—time version of Brock's (1974,

1975) infinite—horizon dynamic monetary model. The treatment of the model

allows the market period length to be an arbitrary, exogenous constant, h.

The continuous—time model analyzed later may be obtained as the limit of

discrete—time models as h +     0.   A demand for money arises in the model

through the assumption that an agent's instantaneous utility depends on

his stock of real balances as well as his consumption level. Like Brocic,

we focus on utility functions that are separable..2!

         The model is one in which identical agents with perfect foresight

choose   time paths for consumption and nominal money balances that   maximize

the   present   discounted value of their instantaneous utility streams. A

market period has length h, and the individual must consume at a constant

rate c during each period t. The cumulative intra—period utility derived

from this consumption is hu(c). Similarly, the cumulative intra—period

utility derived from holding nominal money balances        over the period is

hv(M/P), where         is the period—t money price of the single consumption

good. The individual's objective is thus to maximize



         Ii     I h[u(c) + v(M/P)](l - oh)tTh                             (1)
              t= 0



where time, t, is measured in steps of length h. In (1), (1 — dh)      is the

representative agent's fixed subjective inter—period discount rate, which

naturally depends on the period length h. The functions u() and v() are

increasing in their respective arguments, strictly concave, and obey the

where m denotes real balances N/P.

        At the beginning of each period, a typical individual receives hy

units of the consumption good and, from the government, a nominal cash

transfer of         dollars. Unconsumed units of the consumption good perish

at the period's end. The individual's flow budget constraint is therefore

given by



           Mt — Mt_h — Pthy —       Phct     +                                (3)




Agents have perfect foresight concerning the future paths of the price level

   and transfers              and we therefore do not distinguish, in (3) or below,

between actual and anticipated variables.

           Let At denote the Lagrange multiplier associated with constraint (3).

         Markets    are assumed     to   clear at the beginning of each period. Be-
cause the level of government            consumption is not directly relevant to the
issues   discussed here, it is set equal to zero. In equilibrium, the denand

for consumption during period t, hc, must equal available output hy, and so



          CL = Y

                 Mt_h


for all t.
          By   combining the market—clearing conditions (7) and (8) with (6), we
obtain a first—order difference equation in m.

          Equation (9) embodies both the first—order conditions of individual

 optlmality (the Euler conditions) and the requirement of market equilibrium.

 The equation must be satisfied by any equilibrium path of real balances.

 While there are many Euler paths for real balances——paths which satisfy (9)——

not all are equilibrium paths. We now discuss a condition under which all

but one of these "candidate" equilibria can be ruled out.


II. The Infeasibility Condition and the Uniqueness of Equilibrium


         By definition, hyperinflationary equilibrium paths are paths along

which the price level is unbounded even though the monetary growth rate re-

mains constant. To study the existence of such paths, we assume that                         is


constant     at level          This enables us to employ the diagrammatic technique
introduced     by Brock (1974, 1975). For notational simplicity, the temporary

assumption that the period length h equals unity is also made.

         Define Mm) mu'(y) — v'(m)]                  and B(m)    mu'(y)(8Ia). As shown in

Figures 1(a) and 1(b), the B(m) schedule is a straight line of slope u'(y)(BIG)

emanating from the origin. If lin v'(m) —                    (assumption (2cfl, the A(m)

    <   1,   A(m) and 5(m) intersect at some i >             ;, as   shown. Whether they

intersect at m 0 as well depends on the shape of vN. If lim ACm) —

             The Euler equation (9) may be written as

                   Mm0),
 Using (10), m2, m3,... may be found in the sane manner. Although every path

 generated this way satisfies the necessary conditions of individual optimality

 and the market—clearing requirement, not every choice m0 initiates an equi—

 librium path for the economy. Faced with the given path of cash transfers and the

 tnplied path of the price level, individuals may find it advantageaus to plan

 consumption and money—demand paths inconsistent with aggregate intertemporal

 equilibrium.

           The Euler path initiated by      — m is the steady—state path. This

 path is an equilibrium, for it satisfies the transversality condition



           urn Stt()m — 0,                                                    (11)




 which is sufficient for individual optinality.2—' Eacistence of a perfect—

 foresight equilibrium is therefore established.

           Uniqueness can be established only by ruling out Euler paths that

 originate to the right or left of i.       Brock has shown that paths initiated

 by m0 >   mare   not equilibrium if mild conditions are imposed on v('). tror

 an alternative discussion, see Gray (1981).] Real balances grow without bound

along these paths, and an individual can always gain by choosing at some point to

reduce his real balances forever below the level indicated by the Euler equation.

           Consider now paths initiated by m0 <    ;. Along   these hyperinflationary

 paths, real balances decline monotonically over time even though the money

 growth rate is constant at a.     We   now argue that all such paths may be ruled

 out as equilibria if, and only if, the following infeasibility condition holds:



           lim mv'(m) >0.                                                     (12)
           m+ C
                                        8




         The argument is as follows. First, return to Figure 1(a), which

is drawn on the assumption that (12) does hold. By inspection, any

solution to (10) initiated by m0 < in       requires   that    eventually become

negative. These paths are infeasible. and may           therefore   be excluded from

the class of possible equilibrium paths.' it follows that when (12) is

valid, the steady—state path is the unique equilibrium path.

          When mv'(m)   • 0 as m 0, as in Figure 1(b). most Euler paths start-
ing to the left of ;         are again infeasible. However, Euler paths which pass

through ;,   such as the one depicted in Figure 2, are not infeasible: While
the price level becomes and remains infinite after a finite number of periods,

real balances need not become negative to generate a path satisfying (10).

There exists a countably infinite number of these paths, all of which obey

the transversality condition (11) un addition to (10)1 and and are, in fact,
                                            9/
perfect—foresight equilibrium paths. —

          The nature of these hyperinflationary paths requires comment. First,

why do agents hold positive real balances at any tiie if they expect the

 price level to become and remain infinite after a finite number of periods?

The reason is that in, the equilibrium real money holding in the period before

the price level becomes infinite, satisfies v'(in)            u'(y). Thus, agents are

 content to hold ;      >0   without attempting to increase consumption above y.

 The   utility gained by consuming a dollar just equals that lost through the
 concomitant   reduction in real balances. The individual is not concerned that

 his dollars will be worthless next period.

           A second question relates to the fact that v'(O) —          . Since   the


 marginal utility of money grows without bound as m +          0,   will it not pay for

 the individual      at some point to "consume a little less and harvest a large
                                           10/
 marginal    utility from money services"?— To answer this, suppose that an
A(rn\ 5(m)                    6(m)




                                     rn

Individual does add a dollar to his money holdings at some tine t before

the price level jumps to infinity. Two possible strategies are to consume

the dollar before the price level jumps or to hold the dollar forever.

Now the first—order condition (6), which must hold along an Euler path,

guarantees      that for all n with                 <



                          n—l
                                  i
                                                                                         (13)

                                   v'(m+j)/P+j          + $"u'(y)/P..



Thus, the individual cannot gain from strategy one because he is indifferent

between consuming a dollar in period t and consuming it in period t+n.

         Consider strategy two next. If the price level becomes infinite at

tine t+T, then v'(mt+T_l)                v'()       u'(y); and by setting n — T—l in the multi-

period arbitrage condition above, we obtain


                          T_li
                      •
                                $ v'(m+i)/P+i.                                            (14)
                           i— 0


The gain from holding an extra dollar forever when it is known that money

will lose its purchasing power at tine t+T is given by


          T-l
                                         t    + lim {     S   Sit(M/P)/P}                 (15)

 When urn mvS(m) —        0, expression (15) equals the right—hand side of (14),
      rn. a
 so the gain from holding an additional dollar forever just equals the gain

 from consuming the dollar at time t.                   Therefore,   strategy two, like strategy

 one, cannot augment individual welfare.

              A final question is the following: Even when liz my' (in) > 0, as in
                                                                          UI-to

dition   (12) precludes this type of path. First, note that condition (14)

is still valid along the path described. But the right—hand side of (14)

is now strictly smaller than (15). which is the gain to the individual from
adding an extra dollar to his money holdings at time t
                                                       and holding the dol-
lar   forever. Since this gain exceeds the sacrifice u'(y)/P necessary to

obtain the dollar, the hypothetical path we have been considering cannot

be equilibrium. The argument makes clear that in a sense, condition (12)

implies that money has intrinsic value even when the price level is in-

finite. We discuss in Section IV whether it is reasonable to rule out

hyperinflationary equilibria on this basis.

           It is worth digressing briefly to note that the problem of hyper—

                                                                 If urn my' (in)
inflation does not disappear when agents' lives are finite.
                                                                 m.D

— 0 and agents choose an initial real—balance level that

real balances m at some point before their lives end, the price level will

still become infinite in the next period.

           We conclude that when the infeasibility condition (12) does not

hold, there exist a countable infinity of hyperinflationary Euler paths

 that cannot be ruled out as equilibria. The next section shows that when

 trading
           takes place continuously, there exists a continuum of hyperinfla—
 tionary   equilibria if (12) is false.

III. The Brock Model in Continuous Time


         The previous section's results carry over, with only slight modif 1—

cation, to the continuous—time limit of the discrete—time mode1AJ As long as

Un my' Cm)      0,   there   exist feasible hyperinflationary equilibrium paths

satisfying the Euler equation (10) and the transversality condition (11).

We now show that as the market period h •                      0, the set of real—balance levels
     initiating a feasible hyperinflatioflary equilibrium path grows more

dense.    In the Unit of continuous—time trading, any m3 lower than the
unique   steady—state value ; initiates                   an   equilibrium path when lin             my' (m)

          To demonstrate these results, we continue to assume that
                                                                                                      =    for

all t. With trading period h, (9) may be written as



                                                 —                 —

where i E (M+h —                   —   (a   —1)/h and, by assumption. ô, ii <                   1.    By (16),

          We now show that when                  C   in, the    successive real—balance levels

 generated by (16) become more closely spaced as h +                       0.       Thus, when (12) fails,

                                                                                     path becomes more

Since m falls over time along an explosive price—level path. it must be

proved that DO/ah C 0 for m < in. Differentiation of (18) yields




              —   [v'() — v'(m)l/u'(Y)      + 6uh{[hv'(m)/u'(Y)] —      1).                   (19)




By (18) and the concavity of v('), the foregoing expression is unambiguously

negative when        C in.   Thus, as h + 0, the distance between m+h and

along a feasible Euler path shrinks.

          In the limit of continuous time, (16) becomes the differential equation

Iv. An Interpretation of the Infeasibility Condition


         While the infeasibility condition (12) Is central to the discussion

of "speculative" hyperinflationary equilibria, its interpretaL].1 remains

elusive. It states that an agent holding nominal balances N who adds a dollar

to his money holdings reaps a gain (1/P)v'(M/P) which is bounded away from

zero no matter how high the price level P. In this sense, condition (12)

implies that money is essential to the welfare of agents.

         The nature of this essentiality is made more precise by the following


theorem. If tim mv'(m) > 0, then tin v(m)
                                             rn—'-0




Proof. Let urn mv'(m) = a > 0, and suppose, contrary to the assertion of the
                rn* 0
Theorem, that v(O) is finite. Since v() is strictly concavc



             v(m) —     v(0)   > my' (m)                                                   (21)




for any m > 0. Choose m* to be small enough that v(m*) — v(O) <                      and

 Im*vt(m*) — aJ < e, where e< a/2. Then, by (21). c > v(m*) —                v(O)    > m*v'(m*)

> a —   a.     But the foregoing string of inequalities implies that C > aIZ and so

contradicts the assumption that c < a/2. It follows that v(0) cannot be finite,

that is, there is no positive m* small enough that v(m*) —            v(0)    C C.



             According to the Theorem, a utility—of—money function satisfying

the infeasibility condition (12) has the property that v(O) =               —. The
converse is not true, however. Any concave function v() such that v(m) =

 [log(m)]        for in < exp(—2/3) has the property that v(O) — but also

satisfies urn mv'(m)               0. thus, the assumption v(0) =   — is   necessary, but
                 0

not sufficient, to preclude hyperinflationary equilibria.
                                            14




            The Theorem shows how important money must be if hyperinflationary

equilibria are to be excluded. It must be true that if an agent is de—

prived of his real balances, no finite increase in his endowment nf the

consumption good can restore him       to   his previous utility level. This re-

quirement seems inconsistent with the view that the utility—of—money

function v(•) captures money's role in reducing the frictions that would
                                                 14,
characterize a complex barter economy. —

           As was shown    in   Section III, the infeasibility condition (12) ex-

cludes hyperinflationary equilibria by ensuring, in effect, that money has

some intrinsic value even when the price level is infinite. Starr (1980)
points out that           "the economy is effectively demonetized when the
price of money is zero so that monetary transactions——available at any posi-
tive    price——are discontinuously unavailable at a null price." If      there is a
discontinuity    in agents' opportunity sets at P —     , the Unit of mv'(n) as
m   •   0 becomes economically irrelevant. On this view, it is of doubtful

validity to rule out hyperinflationary equilibria in the Brock model even by

appealing to condition (12).

V. Eyperinflationary Equilibria in an Overlapping_GeneratiOns Economy
        The   infeasibility condition (12) that ilin mv'(m) > 0 is formally
                                                   rn.0
identical   to a condition Brock and Scheinlcman (1980) have used to rule out
hyperinflatlonary       equilibria in certain overlapping_generations models of

money demand. The condition they use refers, however, to the function

giving the utility of old—age consumption.

        To derive the Brock—Scheinkluan condition, consider an economy with

a stationary population in which agents live for two periods.        Two genera-

tions, the "young" and the "old,        coexist at each date t. Each   agent re-

ceives y units of       perishable output while young but none while old. Only
by accumulating money in       youth can an individual consume in old age.

        The lifetime utility of an Agent young at date t       is given by

              12              1
                           u(c) +
                                       2




where c is his consumption while young and c+l his consumption while old.

The constraints facing this agent are:



                                                                               (22)

 In (23), 11t+l denotes cash transfers from the government,     bestowed   exclusive—

            Under perfect foresight, individual utility maximization implies

 that

       by (23) and (25). Thus, in equilibrium,


                  —                           —                                                 (27)

Denoting M+i/M by a                (>   8),       we   may write (27) as a difference—equation in m,


                      —        —                                                                 (28)
                          m)        (8/a)u'(n+i)m+i.

           If money is held, the foregoing difference equation must govern the
                                                                               l5
economy's evolution in perfect—foresight equilibrium.— The stationary

statei defined by u'(y —                  ) = (/a)u'(ni)           clearly provides one equilibrium.

Can there exist, in addition, hyperinflationary equilibria along which m

0? To answer this question, note that as tnt •                          0, the left—hand side of (28)

approaches zero as well. As Brock and                         Scheinkraan (1980) observe, however, if
                                      17




         un mu'(m) > 0,                                                   (29)
         iuO


the right—hand side of (28) is bounded away from zero as         0. Condition

(29) Is therefore sufficient to rule out hyperinflationary equilibria in

this overlapping—generations economy.

         The inequality (29) is formally identical to (12), which pre-

cludes hyperinflationary equilibria in the Brock model. In par-

ticular, the result of section IV shows that in order to rule out hyper—

inflationary paths for the overlapping—generations economy, it must be as-

sumed that   u(O) =   —. This   assumption seems more plausible than the assump-

tion v(O) = — needed to rule out explosive price—level paths in the Brock

model.

         It should be noted, however, that (29) does not rule out hyperinfla—

tions if, say, because of government lump—sum redistribution of endowments,

an old agent's income is £      > 0 instead of zero. In this case, the difference

equation (28) becomes



         rnu' (y — a —   nit)   (N)u' (c + m+t)m÷i*                        (30)




and the right—hand side of (30) goes to zero as m • 0 even If (29) holds.

Thus, whIle (29) may be a reasonable assumption, it will exclude hyper—

inflationary equilibria only in extreme cases.

 VI. Concluding Remarks

        Dynamic monetary models assuming rational expectations or perfect
foresight    occupy a central position in modern macroeconomics. Because

expectations are self—fulfilling in these models, there are many "candidate't

equilibrium price levels, each corresponding to a different expected in-

flation rate. When a model is well—behaved, exactly one expected infla-

tion rate can be justified exclusively in terms of market fundamentals,

that is, the expected future values of (and possibly past innovations in)

the exogenous variables driving the economy. The corresponding price

is said to lie on the convergent manifold of the system. All others ini-

tiate price paths that are fueled in part by speculative anticipations
                                                        -
unrelated to actual market conditions.

        In   an influential paper. Sargent and Wallace (1973) demonstrated the

intuitive appeal of closing perfect—foresight monetary models with the as-

sumption that equilibrium prices lie on the convergent manifold. Host

subsequent authors have adapted the convergence assumption and have found

that it delivers economically sensible results. Nonetheless, there re-

mains the theoretical question of whether any forces guarantee that an econ-

omy of maximiziElg agents will never find itself on a divergent specula-

tive equilibrium path. Wallace (1980), among others, has argued that in-

convertible fiat money is valued only for its expected future purchasing

power and that monetary equilibrium is therefore bound to be "tenuous":

The   price of money may be   zero in equilibrium, and there will exist hyper—

inflationary    equilibrium paths along which money eventually passes out of
use.
         Brook (1974, 1975), however, provided an infinite—horizon maximizing
                                             19




model   in   which money, while remaining a store of purchasing power, also

has an intrinsic value to agents. He modelled this intrinsic value by

assuming, with Samuelson (1947). that real balances are an argument in

consumers' separable utility functions. The money_in—the—utility—function

device was intended to capture money's role in facilitating trarsactionS.

Brook (1978) subsequently provided a condition on the utility function

necessary and sufficient to exclude hyperinflationary equilibria in a

continuous—time version of his discrete—tine model. A similar condition

was found by Brook and Scheinkman (1980) to rule out explosive inflation

in a class of overlapping—generations models.

         This paper has shown that unless money is essential in the very

strong sense that agents have infinitely negative utility without it, one

cannot rule out hyperinflationary equilibria in Brook's model. This is true

in discrete time as well as in continuous time. On the view that money has

intrinsic value because it reduces transactions costs, it is implausible to

assign it this much importance. In the context of Brook and Scheinkman's

 (1980) overlapping—generations economy. hyperinflation can be excluded if

agents have infinitely negative lifetime utility when old—age consumption

 is zero. But this is so only if agents have no means of avoiding a zero

 consumption level in old age without holding money.              If government lump—sum

 transfers      or "reverse bequests" from children to parents are introduced,
 speculative equilibria reappear.
             The convergence assumption used to close a wide class of forward—
 looking monetary models yields sensible results and has considerable intuitive

market equilibrium. Money may   be   sufficiently essential to preclude

hyperinflationary equilibria, but a robust theory demonstrating this has

yet to appear.

2. Calvo (1979) studies local uniqueness of equilibrium in models

with capital. Cray (1981) obtains results similar to Brock's in a model

in which money is held because it reduces transactions costs.



3. A number of problems may arise when the utility function u(c,m)

is non—separable. In particular, when                        <   0, there may be multiple
convergent equilibria even if both goods are everywhere normal. [See

Obstfeld (l98].)j This paper ignores the possibility that there exists

more than one convergent equilibrium path. It is concerned only tjith the

possibility that an economy possessing a single convergent equilibrium

path may also possess divergent equilibrium paths. Calvo (1978, 1979)

and Taylor (1977), the latter in the context of an ad hoc model, describe

economies with multiple convergent rational—expectations equilibria.

 to rule out hyperinflatioflary equilibrium paths.

13. these hyperinflationary paths are equilibrium because they satisfy the

continuous—time transversality condition lint eätuT(y)m = 0.   See Arrow and

Xurz (1970) or Brock (1978).



14. Fischer (1974) provides a detailed discussion of the possible roles for

real balances in production and utility functions. Brock (1974) also contains

a brief discussion of the money—in—the—utility function approach. He shows

it is equivalent to assuming that each agent derives utility from consumption

and leisure, where leisure is an increasing function of real balances because

money saves transactions tine. flowever, this story does not provide a plausible

rationalization for the infeasibility condition (12). While it may be reason-

able to assume that utility is infinitely negative when leisure is zero, it

is not reasonable to assume that an agent who does not hold money will have no

leisure time. Gray (1981) specifies a somewhat different role for money,

in which real balances reduce the output cost of transactions. rather than

their cost in terms of leisure. The condition necessary for uniqueness of equi-

librium in Cray's model is formally identical to (12), except that a transactions

function replaces the utility—of—money function. The Theorem of Section IV can

be used to prove that Gray's uniqueness condition holds only when transactions

costs eat up more than one hundred percent of output in the absence of money.

Thus, it is impossible to rule out speculative hyperinflations when the demand

for money arises from Gray's transactions technology.



15. Of course, nothing precludes the Pareto inefficient nonmonetary equilibrium

in which the price of money is zero at all times.   If everyone believes money

will be worthless next period, it will be in the present model.

16. In addition, speculative hyperinflations are conspicuously absent

from the historical record: Explosive monetary growth seems to be an

adequate explanation of all observed byperinflations. Flood and Garber

(1980) subject this proposition to an econometric test, finding no evi-

dence that the post—world War I German hyperinflation was unjustified in

terms of underlying monetary conditions.
