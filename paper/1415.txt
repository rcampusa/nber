                Modeling the Term Structure of Interest Rates Under

                  Nonseparable Utility and Durability of Goods



                                    ABSTRACT



     This paper investigates the term structure relations implied by a two-

good model in which goods are durable and the preference function of con-

simters may   be nonseparable both over time and the decision variables. The
parameters characterizing preferences are estimated and the implied restric-

tions on the comovements of consuxnptions and the returns from following

different investment strategies in bonds are examined. Both the durability

of goods (modeled by a linear service technology) and the nonseparability of

preferences over services from goods are important factors in explaining

the time paths of individual returns, However, substantial evidence against

our model is obtained when the restrictions associated with two different

investment strategies are studied simultaneously. Specifically, the differ-

ence between the sample mean returns are too large relative to the difference

between the sample covariances of the returns and the marginal utility from

acquiring a unit of the numeraire good. Our findings suggest that these

disc;epancies are not a consequence of either the relatively small variabil-

ity in aggregate acquisitions of goods, or our small estimates of relative

risk aversion.

1.   Introduction

     Equilibrium term structure relations have been deduced under various

assumptions about preferences, technology, and the joint distribution of

the underlying sources of uncertainty in the economy.    For instance, Cox,

Ingersoll and Ross (1978, 1981), Lucas (1978), Hansen and Singleton (1982,

1983), Ferson (1983), Marsh (1983), and Sundaresan (198L), among others,

have deduced restrictions on bond returns for parameterizations of models

with time—additive preferences defined over a single consumption good.   To

date, most versions of these models that have been implemented empirically

have not been consistent with the observed comovements of asset returns

and consumption.1       These findings, together with the complementary

evidence reported here, suggest that the representations of returns

implied by models with time—additive utility do not capture the relative

or absolute risks associated with investing in bonds with different

maturities.

     In this paper we explore the relations among optimal consumption

decisions and the (real) term structure of discount bond returns in the

context of a dynamic model in which preferences of consumers' are

non—time—separable functions of purchases of nondurable and durable goods.

The choice of this framework is motivated primarily by the following two

considerations.     First, by introducing durable goods into the consumers'

choice problem and allowing for interactions among the utilities obtained

from durable and nondurable goods, we may be able to represent more

accurately the linkages between consumption choices and interest rates.

In particular, the demands for consumption goods depend not only on the

current prices of goods, but also on the rates at which current

consumption can be exchanged for consumption at future dates.         This
                                        2

dependence has been evidenced recently in the large fluctuation in demand

for durable goods corresponding to the historically large fluctuation in

interest rates. Second, even though preferences in terms of services from

goods are time—separable, the durability of goods and the associated

technology for producing service flows from these goods induce a

nonseparable utility function with purchases of goods as the arguments.

We show that an implication of non—time—separability of utility is that

shifts in the term structure may affect demands for consumption goods

directly, and not only through the marginal utility of wealth as in the

case of time—separable preferences.            As a consequence, there is
potentially more scope for bonds with different terms to maturity to

differ in their risk characteristics.

     The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.      In section two

we describe the equilibrium relations among marginal rates of substitution

of consumption and returns on bonds with different maturities that form

the basis of our empirical analysis.        Empirical evidence suggesting that

the "consumption risk" inherent in a single—good model with constant

relative risk averse preferences cannot explain the average, real returns

O U.S. Treasury bills with various maturities is also presented.          Our

non—time—separable specification of preferences for nondurable and durable

goods is described in section three. There we also make more precise the

manner in which the marginal utilities from acquiring goods depend on the

durable character of goods.   The time series properties of these marginal

utilities, and in particular their covariability with returns, are

potentially very different than those of the marginal utilities from

single—good models.

     In   section four we describe the data and econometric methodology used

in estimation.     In addition, it is shown that the specification of the

technology for producing services from goods, together with the maturities

of the bonds studied, determine the autocovariance structure of the

disturbances in our estimation equations.     In section five the parameter

estimates are presented and the extent to which the restrictions, implied

by our model, on the moments of consumptions and returns on securities

with different terms to maturity is assessed.    In addition to using formal

statistical procedures, the fit of our model is evaluated by comparing the

sample means of the returns to the sample versions of the corresponding

covariance expressions which, according to the theory, equal the mean

returns,     The sensitivity of these expressions to changes in the

parameters governing relative risk aversion and the non—separability over

time of preferences is also investigated.          Concluding remarks are

presented in section six.

2.    Equilibrium Term Structure Relations

      In this section we describe an equilibrium relation among bond

returns that is implied by a large class of dynamic models. Additionally,

we present some new evidence that a single—good version of the term

structure relation with time—separable utility is not consistent with the

risk structure of discount bonds.       These observations serve to motivate

our non—time—separable, multi—good specification of preferences which is

presented in section three.

      Suppose that, among other investment opportunities, consumers are

given the choice of K investment strategies involving default—free,

pure—discount bonds. These strategies may include, for example, buying an

i—period bond and selling it after n periods (n < ),      or   rolling over a

sequence of n one—period bonds.       Let      denote the total return (one

plus the rate of return) from following the kth investment strategy from

date t to date t+n, where prices and payoffs are denominated in terms of a

numeraire good.2 Also, suppose that the uncertain economic environment is

such that the first—order conditions of a typical consumer's intertemporal

optimum problem imply the relation3



(1)                           for k = 1, 2, ..., K,
          Et[mtrJ        1,



where rr.tn is an individual consumer's marginal rate of substitution of

consumption of the numeraire good at date t for consumption at date t + n

and EE'] denotes the mathematical expectation conditioned on information

available at date t, I, which is common to all agents.

      To deduce testable restrictions from (1) requires assumptions about

preferences, the distributions of mt and returns, or possibly both,       In

order to study the links between acquisitions of goods and returns on
                                         5

bonds with different terms of maturity, without imposing assumptions on

the joint distribution of the endogenous variables              and          we

proceed by restricting only the functional form of utility. Consequently,

our empirical results are robust to alternative specifications of
technology and the distribution of the exogenous shocks.        As in previous

empirical studies, our specification of preferences allows for exact

demand aggregation, so mt,n can be interpreted as the marginal rate of

substitution for a representative consumer.

     Since we are not assuming that                and rn are drawn from a
particular family of distributions, the conditional mean of [m r )
                                                                      t,n   ,n

cannot be evaluated explicitly as a function of the elements of I.

Therefore, instead of basing estimation and inference directly on (1), we

exploit the implication of (1) that in equilibrium               — 1) must be

orthogonal to all of the elements of agents' information set. That is,



(2) Et(rnt,nrn —          =O   for all       c




where EE] denotes the unconditional expectation.           Given a parametric

specification of' preferences and time series observations on consumptions,

the kt1 return and a set of instruments, z, a consistent estimator of the

population mean in (2) can be constructed without prior knowledge of the

distributions of the variables. The orthogonality conditions (2) restrict

the comovements among the returns on the K investment strategies and are

the basis of' the subsequent empirical analysis.

     There is another relation that is implied by (1) and which resembles

more closely the restrictions on bond returns tested in the literature on

the traditional expectations models. Specifically, forming the difference

of' the versions of (1) for two returns          and    gives

which implies that



('4)    EEmt,(r, —   r,)zt]       O for all zt c



Although estimation and inference can proceed using the orthogonality

conditions in (4), these latter conditions are not equivalent to (2).

More precisely, (2) requires that the mean of tmtnrnzt] equal the mean

of z for the n—period return on any investment strategy.        On the other

hand, ('4) requires only that the means of the products Emtnrnzt:I be

equal for all returns, which is clearly a weaker requirement than (2).

Nevertheless, tests based on (14) may be of interest because of tax

considerations (see section four).

       The equilibrium relations (1) and (3) allow for the relative
riskiness of the K   investment   strategies to vary over the business cycle.

This can be seen more directly as follows: From (1) and the definition of

conditional covariance it follows that the risk premium for a security

with return      over the riskiess real security that pays off a unit of

the numeraire at date t+n is



(5) Ettr] — 1/EtCmt,]
                               _Cov[r, mt,]/Et[m].

As in Breeden (1979), risk is measured by the conditional covariabilty of

returns with the marginal rate of substitution of consumption.            Now

forming the difference between the respective versions of (5) for

strategies j and k gives

If    the securities are not equivalent in terms of the insurance which they

provide against consumption risk, then the conditional covariances of

rn and            with mt,n will differ and, hence, their mean returns will

also be different.          We emphasize that the tests of the term structure

relations (2) and (14) conducted in this paper allow for the conditional

covariances in (5) and (6) to vary over time and to change sign.
Moreover, it is not necessary to specify precisely how these covariances

change over time with changes in the state of the economy.           Thus, our

empirical methodology is not subject to Cornell's (1981) criticism of

tests of asset pricing models based on consumption—beta representations.

       Prior to specifying mt, and deducing our estimation equations from

(2) and (14), it will be useful to review previous empirical specifications

of dynamic asset pricing models, and to explore in more detail the nature

of'   their   rejections.      ne approach has been to restrict the joint

distribution of        mt, and returns and to specify preferences
parametrically.      For instance, Hansen and Singleton (1983) rejected at

conventional significance levels a model of real returns on one—month

Treasury bills and stock returns in which preferences were of the constant

relative risk averse type and returns were assumed to be jointly

lognormally distributed with rn1. Subsequently, Fersori (1983) considered

three—month Treasury bills and reported a chi square statistic with a

marginal significance level of .026 for a quarterly version of the same

model. He also found that a model in which consumers exhibit constant

absolute risk aversion and in which consumption is assumed to be normally

distributed (returns and           are jointly lognormal) could be rejected at
                                       8

the .001 level.         Together, these findings suggest that the joint
hypothesis that (1) obtains and returns and the marginal rates of

substitution are lognorrnally distributed is not supported by the data.

This conclusion is evidently not a consequence of mis—measurement of

consumption    or other non—financial aggregates. One of the tests conducted
by Hansen and Singleton (1983) did not require accurate measurement of
consumption and allowed for shocks to preferences. The evidence against
these asset pricing relations may, of course, be a consequence of imposing
distributional assumptions.     However, Hansen and Singleton (1982) provide
substantial evidence against a single—good model      with constant relative

risk    averse preferences, but without distributional assumptions imposed,
using   returns on a stock index and a one—period Treasury bill.

        To confirm that these observations apply to bond returns with various

maturities, and to explore further the nature of the rejections, we

re—estimated the single—good model with constant relative risk averse

preferences considered in Hansen and Singleton (1982) using Treasury bill

returns and orthogonality conditions of the form (2).        This particular

model is of interest because of the attention it has received in previous

theoretical and empirical studies.         Furthermore, under the additional

assumption that the marginal rates of substitutions and returns are

jointly distributed as log—normal variates, a log—linear version of an

expectations theory of the term structure of real interest rates can be

derived from (3)5       This log—linear expectations theory embodies as a

special case a discretetime version of the local expectations theory

deduced by Ccx, Ingersoll, and Ross (1981) from their general equilibrium

model under logarithmic utility and by imposing special assumptions about

the evolution of the state variables in the economy.6

       Estimates were obtained for the composite consumption good
"nondurables plus services" along with the one—month return on one—month

Treasury bills (TBILL1) and the three—month return on three—nonth Treasury

bills (TBILL3) constructed by Ibbotson and Siquefield (1982) and Huizinga

and Mishkin (1983), respectively.      The estimation procedure proposed by

Hansen aid Singleton (1982) assumes that growth rates of consumption and

returns are strictly stationary stochastic processes.7          It does not

restrict returns or consumption to be drawn from a specific family of

distributions.     The results for the time period January 1959 through

December 1978 are reported in Table I.             Both of the chi square

goodness—of—fit statistics for testing the three over—identifying

restrictions suggest that the model is not consistent with the data.

Furthermore, the estimated coefficients of relative risk aversion (CRRA)

are near zero, which seems implausably small.

      It is instructive to interpret these findings using the relations

 among "consumption risk" and mean returns implied by this model. The risk

 premium for the return on an n—period investment strategy is given by (5).

 This expression is not directly useful for our empirical analysis for the

 same reasons that we are not studying (1).           Namely, we do not have

explicit expressions for the conditional moments in (5).            There is,

however, an unconditional counterpart to (5) that also must hold in

equilibrium and which is useful for interpreting the empirical results

reported in Table I.         Using (2) and the definition of unconditional

covariance, it follows that



(7) EErJ — EIzt)/E[mtnzt)           —
                                        Cov[r,,   mt,zt]/E[mtzt).


The parameters governing preferences must be such that the first and

second moments of mt are consistent with (7) for all n—period returns on

default—free discount bonds and all z c               In particular, if    is

chosen to be the constant unity, then (7) simplifies to a relation among

the mean "excess return" of         about 1/EEmt,] and the covariance of the

return and

     The sample versions of the left and right hand sides of (7),

calculated using the estimated values of the preference parameters and

setting z equal to unity, are also displayed in Table I under the

headings ER and RP, respectively.              The magnitudes of Cov[r
m1   /E[mt,nJ   for   TBILL1 (n1) and TBILL3 (n3) are two and five orders of

magnitude too small, respectively, to be consistent with the magnitudes of

the sample mean excess returns on the left—hand—side of (7).        Moreover,

the signs of RP are not consistent with the signs of ER.        None of these
                                      11


calculations require returns or       to be drawn from a specific family of

distributions.

      A common feature of previous preference—based studies of the term

structure, which may account for their failure to replicate the moment

restriction (7), is that they assume preferences are separable both over

time and across decision variables.        In the next section we argue that

introducing the desired level of consumption of services from durable

goods may substantially affect the time—series behavior of consumers'

marginal rates of substitution, and their covariability with returns.

Consequently, both the left and right hand sides of (7) will be affected

by introducing a richer specification of preferences. Before turning to

this discussion, we acknowledge that the exclusion of taxes from many of

the previous studies may also explain their findings.8 The robustness of
our empirical results to the introduction of taxes is assessed in section
four, where we discuss the implications of introducing a tax on the income
of a "representative investor" for the forms of (2) and (4).

3.    Non—time—separable Preferences for Nondurable and Durable Goods

      Consumers are assumed to have preferences over the service flows from

nondurable        and durable goods, and to rank and alternative sequences of
consurnptions      of services using the utility functional9

In (8), c is the consumption of services from nondurables plus services

at date t, dt is the consumption of services from durable goods at date t,

      (0,1) is a subjective discount factor, and                 and y are preference
                                                                      *5 *(.)
parameters.        In terms of the composite service flow {ct dt                }, utility

is both time separable and of the constant relative risk averse type, with

coefficient of relative risk aversion (1—1).                   Although utility is a

time—separable function of services, it is implicitly a non—time—separable

function of the past acquisitions of goods that yield the services. For

both discussing the links between shifts in the term structure and

consumptions, and the subsequent empirical analysis, we shall work with
the "indirect" utility function obtained from (8) by expressing *      I

in terms of past acquisitions of goods.

      Following Telser and Graves (1972), all consumers are assumed to have

have access to linear technologies that transform consumption goods
                                                                                     *

the purchases of nondurable goods, c, since some of the goods classified

as nondurable may in fact provide services for more than one period (one

month).         By including m lagged values of c, we are at the same time

assuming that services are provided by nondurable goods for only rn

periods. All of the empirical relations considered subsequently allow for

        c (fO j=1,...,m)        as a special ease.

       The technology for producing services from durable goods is also

assumed to be linear, with d being proportional to the sum of the stock

With this service technology, dt depends on the acquisitions of durable

goods infinitely far into the past. Substitution of (9) and (11) into (8)

gives the desired utility function defined over purchases.

       Let nondurable goods be the numeraire.                Then the first—order

conditions for the maximization of (8) with respect to the decision

variables c arid dt and subject to the consumer's budget constraint are:

of (12) is the marginal utility with respect to c and the left—hand—side

of (13) is the marginal utility with respect to dt.                 These expressions

state simply that the marginal utilities with respect to c, and dt must

equal the marginal utility of wealth in units of c and d, respectively.

       The marginal utilities of goods in (12) and (13) involve the expected

values of the marginal utilities of future services, because goods

purchased at date t provide services in both current and future periods.

The forms of these relations depend directly on the specifications of the

service technologies.     For instance, nondurable goods acquired at date t

provide services for rn      future periods according to (9) .                     The    term

pays off one unit of durable goods at t+1.                              The interpretation of the

rental price relation (19) is similar to that of (17).                                The relatively

simple relation (19) arises because the price of a claim to a unit of'

durable goods for one period is the price of a unit of dt less the present

value of the price at date t+1 of a claim to the remaining stream of'

services from date t+1 onward yielded by the good. A claim to a unit of'

durable goods for one period contributes e                         to    a unit of' services from
                                                                                          ft

The demands for services given in (20) are functions of only                                   and the

time—separable in service flows. However, the service prices          and

are linear combinations of the prices of discount bonds with payoffs

denominated in goods and, therefore, changes in these bond prices will in

general affect demands for both goods directly as well as indirectly

through         It is these good—denominated bond prices that have been

considered in previous consumption—based, intertemporal asset pricing

models.

     For the special case with in = 0      in (9), c c, q =           1,    and

preferences are time—separable along the nondurable goods dimension.

Nevertheless, changes in bond prices still have direct effects on the

demands for both goods through        If, in addition to in   0, preferences

are logarithmic (y    0),   then Ct is proportional to        [see (16)3 and

focusing on (12) alone leads to a special case of the time—separable model

of c and returns tested in section two.     Thus, only if m=0 and 'r=O will

the effects of changes in bond prices on c, be restricted to the indirect

effects on the marginal utility of wealth.      Changes in interest rates

affect dt directly for all admissible values of y and m.

     While the entire class of constant relative risk averse preferences

defined over c alone is not a special case of (8) , our model is
consistent with a richer set of dynamic interactions among consumptions

and returns than the single—good model of section two. Whether or not our

model is consistent with the observed comovements in consurnptions and

returns is an empirical issue to which we turn next.

 L•    The Econometric Model and the Data

       An important characteristic of the utility function (8) combined with

the linear technologies (9) and (11) is that, under the assumptions of

interior optima, complete contingent claims markets for goods, and

invertability of the lag polynomials in (9) and (11), (12) and (13) hold

with Ct and dt being aggregate per capita variables (Eichenbaum and Hansen

19814).   The invertability of the lag polynomials is a technical condition

that, among other things, implies that the existence of contingent claims

markets for goods assures that there are complete markets in services, and

vice—versa. Henceforth we shall assume that, given the production

technologies of the economy, there is a sufficiently rich set of

contingent claims available to investors to assure that (12) and (13)

apply to the aggregate quantities used in the empirical analysis.

       Expressions (12) and (13) cannot be used directly for empirical

analyses since the marginal utility of wealth is unobserved. Let MU0(t)

denote the marginal utility of acquiring the numeraire good at date t

(i.e., the left—hand—side of (12)).         Then an alternative expression

involving MU0(t) that does not depend on       is obtained by substituting

the relation rn      MU(t+n)/MU(t) into (1):



(21)       EtEMU(t) — MTJc(t+fl)r,n]   0.




Fror (21) we are able to construct a set of orthogonality conditions like

those in (2) upon which estimation and inference can be based.

       The riarginal utility of wealth can be eliminated from (13) by
substituting (12) into (13).     The resulting expression still cannot be

used directly in our empirical analysis, however, since it depends on the
                                      20

infinite order polynomial in the lag operator [1—(1—9)L]. Instead,
we substitute (12) into (18) to obtain



(22)        (1)8t{c*Td*(1_T} = Et{[1_(1_O)L]pdtMUc(t)}/9


The intratemporal relation (22) linking the marginal utility of services

from durables and MU0(t) involves lag polynomials of finite orders m and

one. This relation will also be exploited in estimation and inference.

       Throughout this discussion we have abstracted from taxation of

income. One consideration that arises when there is taxation is that the

prices of securities that span two tax years must reflect the value of the

option of taking losses or deferring gains (Constantinides 1983).     At a

more fundamental level, if there is an income tax, then the relations (21)

and (22) will in general not hold.    Further, aggregation across consumers

is in general not possible in the absence of complete markets for both

taxable and noritaxable contingent claims.   Here we restrict our comments

to the latter case of "doubly complete" markets (Dammon 1983) and abstract

from end—of—year tax options in order to assess the implications of

taxation for models in which the representative consumer paradigm is

applicable.    We do allow for the marginal tax rate of the representative

investor to vary over time as a function of income)2

       Suppose that the income tax from selling a security at date t+n must

be paid at date t+T CT > n), and that at that time the consumer's marginal

tax rate for ordinary income is g,. Then relation (21), for example, must

be modified to
                                               21

(23)      ErMu0(t) —   MU0(t+n)r         +
                                             MU0(t+T)(rfl    —   1)]   0.




The last term in (23) represents the present value of the loss (gain) from

the payment of taxes (tax deduction).               This term will vary over time with

changes in the consumptions, the marginal tax rate of the consumer, the

returns on securities, and the length of time between the date the

security is sold and the tax payment date.                Consequently, unless     is

near zero, or the present values of the gains and losses over the sample

period are on average approximately zero, the omission of tax obligations

from (21) may affect both the consistency of the estimates and the

validity of the inferences.          Similar observations potentially apply to

expression (3), which with taxes becomes



(214)
         Et[NU(t+n)(r _r,n) —            MU0(t+T)g(r _r,)]              0.




When g is known to the investor at the investment date t, and n:t, as

would be the case with three—month holding periods and quarterly tax

payments, (214) simplifies to



(25) EJMU C
          (t+n)(r1<    —   r3     )] =   0,
                  t,ri      t,n



which is equivalent to (3).         If the dates r and n are nearly the same,

then (214) and (25) will be nearly the same. Thus, we expect tests based

on (25) to be relatively robust to the presence of an income tax which is

consistent with our representative consumer model.

        In proceeding with estimation, we shall assume that the decision

interval of consumers coincides with the sampling interval of the data,
                                     22

which is one month. This assumption permits the use of the published data

on consumption, without introducing problems associated with temporal

aggregation. However, if decision intervals are much shorter and the time

series properties of the consumption rates for this interval are different

than the properties of the monthly data, then our estimation and inference

procedures may yield incorrect conclusions.

     The only ways of circumventing temporal aggregation problems that we

are aware of is to impose strong distributional assumptions on the series

or restrict preferences to be of a very special form.      For the reasons

given in section two, we choose not to impose distributional assumptions

on any of the variables in the model. One can exploit Rubinstein's (1976)

result that, for time—separable utility of the logarithmic form, the

intertemporal marginal rate of substitution of consumption m,1 is equal

to the reciprocal of the real return on the aggregate wealth portfolio.

If the latter return is measured by the value—weighted return on the NYSE,

for example, then tests can be conducted without restricting the decision

interval or having to use consumption data [see Hansen, Richard, and

Singleton (1981) and Brown and Gibbons (1983)L13 Clearly, however, in a

model with durable goods, as considered here, the wealth of consumers

includes the value of the stock of durable goods.     Consequently, all of

the measurement problems that affect consumption—based tests will

potentially affect tests that exploit Rubinstein's result and which
measure wealth correctly.

     Suppose the holding—period returns from K investments over n periods

are to be used in the econometric analysis.       The disturbances in our

econometric analysis are constructed from (21) and (22) by substituting

from (12) for MiJ0(t). Specifically, we shall interpret the variables

processes. This assumption is               maintained throughout our empirical

analysis.

     Given that the disturbances are stationary stochastic processes, it
follows from Wold's decomposition theorem that the disturbances have
a moving average representation. Our model of the term structure of
interest rates further restricts the covariance structure of the
disturbances Ukt.           In particular, the number of nonzero autocovariances of
       depends     on   the number of periods, n, over which the kth return (k=1,
...,    K)    is computed and the degree            of   non—time—separability of
                                                         24

preferences.           Hansen and Singleton (1982) show that when n > 1 and

preferences are separable over time the autocovariance function is that of

a moving average process of order n—i; that is, E(uktukts)                                   0,   s     >


           This follows from the observation that with time—separable

preferences Ukt is not observed by agents until date t+n (i.e., Ukt

1.   ),    so (ul_E4uk4)                  U1    is an n—period ahead forecast error.
Eichenbaum, Hansen and Singleton (1983) show that when n1 the
disturbances in a model with non—time—separable utility have the

autocovariance structure of a moving average process of order equal to one

less than the maximum number of leads of the decision variables that

appear in the estimation equations. In (26) and (27), (rn+1) future values

of c and dt appear when n1.                         Thus, the disturbance uK+1,t follows a

MA(m) process (m+1 less one). Combining non—time—separable utility with a

n—period maturity (n > 1) leads to a disturbance,                                      't+n÷m Hence,

E[uktuk               EEuktEts(ukt$)J                    0 for s > ns-rn and the disturbance

follows a MA(n+m—1) process, k1, ..., K.                                Similarly, (ukt_uLt), k       2.,



is a disturbance corresponding to (25) and it will also follow a MA(n+m—1)

process. These observations are exploited when constructing estimators of

the unknown parameters.

     Following Hansen and Singleton (1982), we proceed with estimation by

choosing            dimensional vectors Zkt with elements in                          and exploit the

fact that EEZktUkt] = 0, k=i, ..., K+1.                       Specifically, let b0=(,y,,8,cz1,

Treating g0(b) as a function of b                                         where c is the admissible

parameter space, the method of moments estimator of g0(b) is given by



       gT( —                 Zth(xt         ,   b)



The function g(b) can be constructed from the sample information

[(xt,Zl,...,zKlt),t1,..,T}. Assuming g,..(') is a continuous
function of b, a consistent estimator of b0 can be constructed by

minimizing a quadratic form in g(b) by choice of b c 2• Hansen (1962)

shows that the optimal estimator of b0 is obtained by minimizing the

criterion function

     S0 =           EtZtutuZJ.


This expression for     can be simplified in our case because the matrix of

instruments is predetermined with zeI and, therefore, the process

tZtut:t=_,...,c} inherits the autocovariance structure of {utJ.       That   is,

Erztutuz]=o for L > n+rn, so (Ztu} has the autocovariance
structure of an MA(n+m—1) process.      Hence, the theoretical model of the

term structure implies that

If, as in our empirical analysis, n > m, then the last                rows and

columns of the matrices E[Z tut U'    Z'

follows a moving average process of order m. These zero restrictions are

imposed in the estimation a S0.

     The optimality of the estimator obtained by minimizing the criterion

function, JT(b), requires a consistent estimator of the weighting matrix

     which depends on b0.      Hence, the estimation procedure requires two

steps. First, the identity matrix is substituted for S in the criterion

function to obtain initial estimates of the parameters.       These estimates

are used to construct estimates of the disturbances, which in turn are

used to construct the estimator of S0 proposed by Hansen (1982) and Hansen

and Singleton (1982). The criterion function with the resulting estimate

of the weighting matrix, S, is then minimized to obtain the optimal

estimates of the parameters.    In practice, we repeated the last step using
                                           27
a revised estimate of S calculated using the parameter estimates at
convergence from step two.            This assured that the final parameter

estimates were not sensitive to the estimate of the weighting matrix.

       The empirical specification of our model requires making an
assumption about the timing of agents decisions within each month.             The

real return,         ,   is   computed using the price at the end of month t and

the real payoff from the security at the end of month t+n.             Consumption

data measured at the end of month t represent purchases during month t. We

assume that consumers know the payoffs from securities at the end of month

t when making their purchase decisions for month t or, equivalently, that

they make their purchase decisions at the end of month t.              If instead

consumers were assumed to make their decisions at the beginning of the

month, then they would be able to use c, to predict returns over month t.

Hence, our assumption about the timing of agents purchase decisions

represents a conservative assumption with respect to consumers'
information set.

      The sample period for the empirical analysis is January 1959 through

December 1978.     Several considerations influenced this choice,         Monthly

data on consumptions are available only after January 1959.            The use of

monthly data allows us to get closer to point to point sampling over a

three month holding period than quarterly data. More recent observations

on returns are not considered, because of the well known change in

operating   procedures by     the Federal Reserve in October, 1979.

      Monthly data on real purchases of nondurables plus services and real
purchases of durable goods were obtained from the           CITIBASE   data tape.
These series were deflated by the monthly population series published by

the   Bureau of Census in order to obtain the per capita        real series {Ct}
                                    28

and {dJ. The service flow series {c} was then constructed endogenously

using equation (9).   We used equation (11) to compute the service flow

series fd) endogenously as a function of the initial stock of durable

goods and the current and past purchases of durable goods.     The initial

value of the stock of durable goods was set at the net value in December

of the stock of durables computed by Musgrave (197g).15      Then equation

(10) was used to construct the real per capita series {kt}. The price of

durable goods relative to nondurables plus services was computed by

dividing the implicit price deflator for durables by the deflator for

nondurables plus services.   The returns on one—month Treasury bills are

taken from Ibbotson and Sinquefield (1982), and the returns on three— and

six—month bills are those constructed by Huizinga and Mishkin (1983) from

the CRSP government bond tape.   Real returns were calculated by dividing

the numerator and denominator of the nominal returns by the value of the

implicit price deflator for nondurables plus services (the nurneraire) for

the month corresponding to the maturity and purchase, respectively, of the

security.

 5.    Empirical Results

       The results from estimating the model with a single return (K=1) are
                                                                                           *

          The instrument vector, z, associated with the disturbance ult in

 (26) included the constant unity, the lagged value of'                  the       real rate of

return on the security, and the first lagged value of the growth rates of

real per capita consumption of nondurables plus services, real per capita

purchases of durable goods, and the relative price of durables:

To construct the intratemporal orthogonality conditions associated with

the disturbance u2             (27), we set Z2t equal to z1.

       In addition to the parameter estimates and estimates of their

respective standard errors, we report a statistic for testing the validity

of the overidentifying restrictions implied by the model.                              Five linear

combinations of the B sample orthogonality conditions are set to zero in

estimating    the 5   x   1 vector b0. There are an additional B —                 5    independent
linear combinations of g(b) that are not set to zero in estimation, but
that should be close to zero if the model is valid. Hansen (1982) shows
that a test of the null hypothesis that the population counterparts of

these B—5 linear combinations of (b) are zero can be based on the

product of the number of time series observations and the minimized value

of the criterion function.           This statistic is distributed asymptotically

as a chi—square with R—5 degrees of freedom (DF) under the null

hypothesis.
                                     30

     The computed values of this statistic for the single—return runs

(R=10) are displayed in column 7 of Table II.         The probability values

(1—significance level) of the statistics are given in parentheses.       None

of these statistics provide strong evidence against the model, although

there is substantially more evidence against the model when the return

used in estimation is the one—month return on a one—month Treasury bill

(TBILL1). One interpretation of the latter finding is that the reliance

on information that is gathered at quarterly intervals in constructing the

monthly data distorts the time series properties of the monthly, relative

to the quarterly, series.16 To the extent this is the case, the results

for the three—month returns, which are based on monthly data point—sampled

at quarterly intervals, may be more reliable.

     The parameter estimates displayed in Table II are qualitatively

similar for all of the securities.       The point estimates of the concavity

parameter, y, range from —.1922 for TBILL1 to —1.0209 for the three—month

return from rolling over three one—month bills (ROLL1). The estimates of

the lag for consumption of nondurables, , are economically plausible. In

all cases, the 's are positive and, except for ROLL1, are at least twice

as large as their respective standard errors.         The estimates of the

allocation parameter 6 are also plausible.      The estimates of the discount

factor, 6, are, however, slightly greater than unity,       This could be a

consequence of the occurance of negative ex post real returns in terms of

the nurneraire during the estimation period. Values of 6 less than unity

are within two standard errors of the point estimates.          Finally, the

estimates of the proportion of the capital stock consumed each month, e,

range from .0027 per month (3% per year) to .0082 per month (10% per

year). This fairly wide range of depreciation rates is symptomatic of the

imprecision with which 8 is estimated.
                                      31

      There are two differences between the models discussed in sections

 two and three that may explain the large values of the test statistics

 displayed in Table I relative to those in Table II for the three—month

 return on a three—month Treasury bill (TBILL3).          First, the utility
 function (8) j a nonseparable function of the acquisitions of nondurable

and durable goods at each date (i.e., the cross—partials of (8) with
respect to c and d are nonzero).    Second, the model described in section

three incorporates the non—time—separable service technology (9) for
nondurable goods.    To determine which difference best accounts for the

better fit of the model with utility function (8), we estimated a version

of a one—good model with the period utility function             where ct is

given by (9).    The chi square statistic with two degrees of freedom is

15.92 with a probability value of .9996, so again the one—good formulation

of the model is not consistent with the data.           We conclude that the

noriseparabjj.jty across decision variables at a point in time is an

important ingredient in the better fit of our two—good model.             In

particular, despite the imprecision with which I   is   estimated, the point

estimates of Y along with the comparisons across the alternative models

suggest that investors are more risk averse than logarithmic utility

(1=0, which implies separability across decision variables).     At the same

time, the estimated value of   is .2923 with a standard error of .063, so

a non—time—separable service technology is common to both models.

     Estimates obtained using the three—month returns from two different

investment strategies (K=2) are displayed in Table III.          The column

labeled "Returns" should be read as follows, "TBILL3 & ROLL1" indicates

that the estimates were obtained with the disturbance of the equation

associated with each of these returns given by (26) with n=3 and r3
                                         32

equal to TE1LL3 for ki and ROLL1 for k=2.                 Thus, we are testing

simultaneously the restrictions implied by (2) for T3ILL3 and for ROLL1.

On the other hand, "TBILL3 & TB6H3—TBILL3" indicates that the first

disturbance is given by (26) with r3 TBILL3 and the second disturbance

is given by the difference between the versions of (26) for the
three—month holding period return on a six—month Treasury bill (TB6H3) and

TBILL3.       In this case, we are testing simultaneously restrictions implied

by (2) for TBILL3 and restrictions implied by () for TB6H3—TBILL3.            In


all cases the instrument vector associated with the disturbance u1 for

the first return listed was z1 given by (28).           When   DF6 (R   11) the
instrument vector associated with the disturbance for the second return

(or the difference between two returns) was              1}; while for DF      7

(P =   12),    z (1,rnn _}17
       The parameter estimates are similar to those displayed in Table II,

with the exception of the y'S and a's. The range of the point estimates

of .   in   Table III is from —1.5038 for TBILL3 & TE6H3 to —2.6302 for TB6}-13

& ROLL1.         These point estimates are suggestive of a higher level of

relative risk aversion than those in Table II, although again the

estimated standard errors are large.          Also, the a's and their respective

standard errors are substantially smaller in Table III than the estimates

obtained for the three—month returns in Table II.

       Perhaps the most notable difference, however, is that all of the test

statistics displayed in Table III provide substantial evidence against the

model.        This result seems particularly striking because, for DF:6, the

larger test statistics are a consequence of including only one
orthogonality condition for the disturbance u2 associated with the second

return.        Indeed, adding the lagged value of the second return to z2.
                                       33

(increasing DF from 6 to 7) has little incremental effect on the test
statistics or the estimated parameters.

     From the results displayed in Tables I through III we conclude that

there is a vector of admissable parameters for which our model is

consistent with the comovements of consumptions and the return on any

single security (Table II).         Recall that the single—good model with

time—separable preferences was not consistent with these aggregate

comovements (Table I). At the same time1 our model fails to capture the

joint behavior of consurnptions and any two returns (Table III).   In light

of' the findings for the individual securities, the latter conclusion seems

not to be a consequence of our omission of' the future tax obligations for

the representative agent. For if tax considerations of the type discussed

in section four are important, then there should be more evidence against

the model in Table II. Furthermore, by comparing rows three and five in

Table III, it can be seen that replacing TB6H3 by TBILL3—TB6H3 has little
                               18
effect on the tes staistics.

     A second possible explanation for the large test statistic in Table

III is that    larger value of m is required to adequately represent the

technology for producing services from nondurable goods. We pursued this

possibility by setting m2 and re—estimating the model with TBILL3 &

T36H3. The estimated value of the coefficient on ct2 in         2' was of

the order 1O, and the probability value of the test statistic was

approximately unity. Thus, increasing the number of lags in the service

technology for nondurable goods does not alter the conclusions drawn from

Table 111.19

    We turn next to an examination of the counterparts of the
unconditional covariance restrictions in (7) for the model with
                                              314


non—time—separable utility.         From equation (21) and the definition of a

covariance, it follows that

expressed in terms of MU,.jt+9) instead of MU(t+), since it is the former

variable which is used in estimation and assumed to be a strictly

stationary stochastic process.            Also, marginal utilities are studied

instead of the marginal rates of substitution that appear in (7), because

with non—separable preferences the marginal rates of substitutions are

ratios of agents' marginal utilities which involve conditional
expectations that are unobserved to the econometrician.           Finally, we have

chosen to study (29) with z.                  1, since this instrument led to a

substantial increase in the test statistics in Table III over those in

Table II.

       We calculated the sample versions of the left (ER) and right (RP)

hand sides of (29) using the estimated parameter values from the TBILL3 &

TB6H3 run with DF5 in Table III, and by replacing population moments by

their sample counterparts.      Estimates of ER and RP were calculated for

several values of y, holding the other parameters fixed at their estimated

values. These results are displayed in Table IV.             Notice, first of all,

that for the value of y from Table III (y             —1.581) the estimates of ER

are approximately two orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding

estimates of RP.       Nevertheless, for each return, (ER_RP is zero for

 values of y within the range (—1.58,—2), which is well inside a one

 standard—derivation confidence interval about              '.       This finding is
 consistent with the small probability values of the test statistics

 displayed in Table II — the restriction (29) for each return is nearly

satisfied at the point estimates.2°

      The latter result warrants further discussion, since much attention

has been given to the role of risk aversion in explaining the temporal and

relative behavior of asset returns.         Increasing y leads to an increase
                            *
in the volatility of MU0(t+3) and, therefore, in a perfect certainty
environment a large value of    yf may be required to reconcile the smooth

behavior of consumptions with the relative choppy behavior of returns over

time Esee e.g., Grossman and Shiller, (1931)].                   In an uncertain
environment, however, what is relevant for explaining average differences

between returns is the covarianee of returns with Mu0(t+3) relative to

EEMU(t+3)].     Values of y between         —1.581 and —2 generate sufficient

variability in M!J(t+3) and the appropriate covariability of MU(t+3) and

the returns to satisfy the restrictions in (29) for individual securities.

This was not the case with the singlegood model discussed in section two.

     Much stronger evidence against our model is obtained from the
two—return runs, because these runs impose restrictions on the relative

values of the risk premia for TBILL3 and T66H3 that are not imposed in the

singlereturn runs. Specifically, forming the difference of the versions
of (29) for two returns gives



                                                                 *

The null hypothesis that the restriction (30) holds is implicitly being

tested when the model is estimated using both TBILL3 and TB6}-i3.          The

sample versions of the left (ER1—ER2) and right (RP1—RP2) hand sides of

(30) are reported in column six of Table IV.       At the estimated value of y

(—1.581), ER1 — ER2 is three orders of magnitude larger than RP1—RP2, a

finding which is reminiscent of the result in Table I for TBILL3.

Moreover, increasing      has a negligible effect on the difference between

ER1_ER2 and RP1-.RP2.    Over a wide range of values of' the risk aversion

parameter, the relative values of the sample covariances of MU0(t+3) and

the returns are not consistent with the relative values of the sample mean

returns.     In this sense, the model fails to capture the relative risk

structure of the two securities.

       For the non—time—separable specification of preferences (8), RP1—RP2

is not a monotonic function of y.        The difference between ER1—ER2 and

RP1—RP2 is minimized among the y's considered at y        —25.   Nevertheless,

from Table IV it is clear why the estimated value of y is not closer to

—25.    Increasing yt leads to an increase in EEMUc(t)J/EEMU:(t+3)], since

acquisitions of nondurable and durable goods evidenced positive growth
                              21               *           *
during   the sample period.        Eecause E[MU(t)J/EEMu(t+3)J increases

substantially relative to the increase in Rp, the required level of the
                   k
average return E[rt1 increases rapidly with increases in tyl so that the

signs of ER and RP are not consistent with the theory for values of' I'd >

2. The weight given by the criterion function to making IER—RPI small in

estimating the parameters prevents y from approaching —25.

       The final experiment we conducted was to let      range between 0 and

.8, holding all of the other parameters (including y) fixed at their

estimated values. Estimates of ER and RP for TBILL3, calculated using the
                                     37

growth rate of purchases of nondurable goods for Z in (29), are displayed
in Table V. At the estimated value of a for the TBILL3 run reported in
Table II (a     .538k), ER and RP are an order of magnitude apart, but

ER—RPI is zero at a value for a between .2 and .Lt, which is within

two—standard errors of a•    Values of ER and RP for TEILL3 computed using

the point estimates reported in Table III for the TBILL3 & T36H3 run with

DF   6 are also displayed in Table V. For the parameters from the TBILL3

& T36H3 run, the values of ER and RP for TBILL3 do not have the same sign

at the estimated value of a (a = .2891).    Also, IER — Rp decreases with

increasing a, a pattern which is consistent with the estimate of a of

.5383 obtained when only TBILL3 is studied. The relatively large value of

ER—RP at a = .2891 from the TEILL3 & TB6H3 run, compared to the value of

IER—RPI at a    .538k from the TBILL3 run, reflects the tradeoffs involved

in attempting to set different sets of sample orthogonality conditions to

zero in estimating the parameters.   In both cases, the largest difference

between ER and RP occurs at a = 0,         which is the value of a that

corresponds to time—separable utility along the nondurable goods dimension.

6.   Concluding Remarks

     In this paper we have argued that specifying utility to be a

nonseparable function of the purchases of nondurable and durable goods at

each date allows for much richer term structure relations than models with

separable preferences.    The empirical findings support this view in that

our model with nonseparable preferences is consistent with the observed

comovements of individual real returns on short—term Treasury bills and

aggregate consumptions.     More precisely, for plausible values of the

parameters governing preferences, both the variability of marginal

utilities, and their covariability with returns, were consistent with the

average values of the ex post real returns. In contrast, the consumption

risk inherent in previous models with time—separable utility functions

defined over a single decision variable is not consistent with average

real returns on Treasury bills.

     Wnen the implied restrictions on the real returns from following two

different investment strategies with Treasury bills were studied

simultaneously, substantial evidence against the model with nonseparable

utility was obtained.     Thus, this model is not consistent with observed

comovements of real returns on alternative investment strategies.   In the

light of the pattern of parameter estimates and test statistics,

considerations associated with taxation of income appear not to be the

explanation for this finding. A potential explanation for the large test

statistics emerges from examining the restriction that the difference

between the mean returns from two investments be proportional to the

differences between the covariances of the marginal utility of consumption

and each return.   The magnitudes of the covariances are not consistent

with the relative values of the sample means of the returns and in this
                                       39

 sense   the model does not capture the relative riskiness of the two

 investment strategies. Moreover, increasing relative risk aversion, even

 to extreme values, is virtually of no value in attempting to satisfy these

 moment restrictions. This is the case even though the variability of ex

 post marginal utilities increases with increases in

        Previously, Hansen and Singleton (1982) found that a model with a

 time—separable utility function defined over purchases of nondurable goods

 was not consistent with the comovements of returns on stocks and Treasury

bills.      Our results suggest that incorporating durable goods and

non—time_separable technologies for producing services from goods [at
least as in (8)—(11)] is also not sufficient to reconcile representative

agent, asset pricing models with the observed comovements of security
returns.     What is needed to explain the relative risk structure of
securities is a model in which the marginal utilities have very different

covariance properties with returns than those that have been studied to
date.    Modifications of representative agent models to incorporate money

through the imposition of a cash—in—advance constraint (e.g., Lucas 1983)

is one way of affecting the time series properties of'   marginal   utilities.

However, the analysis in Singleton (1984) suggests that such a
modification to our nonseparable model does not improve the fit for real

Treasury bill returns.        Alternative incomplete market structures for

contingent claims that rationalize a monetary economy with an active

policy authority, or models in which agents are differentially informed,

may be required to explain the temporal behavior of Treasury bill returns.

Such models may not lead to testable restrictions expressed in terms of

aggregate consumptions or wealth, in which case empirical analyses will

require disaggregated data.
                                      140


     Finally, we note that our analysis [Dunn and Singleton (1983)3 of

returns on stock, long—term government bonds, and GNMA mortgage
pass—through securities provided little evidence against a model with a

separable utility function.         For comparison, we re—estimated our

nonseparable model with durable and nondurable goods using the
value—weighted return on the New York Stock Exchange from the CRSP tapes

and the long—term government bond return series constructed by Ibbotson

and Sinquefield (1982) .    The   resulting test statistic provides little

evidence against the model [x2(7)      7.75].    Thus, there seems t be an

important difference between the ability of representative agent, asset

pricing models to capture the comovements among certain "long..term"

securities and short—term Treasury bills        This pattern of results also

warrants further examination.

  1Contrary to most studies, Dunn and Singleton (1983) did not find much
evidence against a single—good model with time—separable utility using
returns on stocks, long—term government bonds, and Ginnie—Mae mortgage
pass—through securities.   In the conclusion, we comment further on the
similarities and differences among the results reported here and those in
our earlier study.

      The following discussion is easily modified for the case of coupon
paying bonds.

  3Sufficient conditions for (1) to obtain in discrete—time are given in
Rubinstein (1976), Breeden and Litzenberger (1978), Lucas (1978), and
Brook (1980) for models with time—separable preferences.   Extensions to
models with multiple goods and certain types of non—time—separable
preferences are provided in Prescott and Mehra (1980), Kydland and
Prescott (1982), and Eichenbaum, Hansen, and Singleton (1983).
Continuous—time versions of (1) were deduced by Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross
(1978), Breeden (1979,1983,19814), and Richard and Sundaresen (1981) for
models with time—separable utiity.

 Since {xt} is a normally distributed stochastic process, the conditional
expectations are linear functions. Further, the conditional variances are
constants and, hence,                  is a constant. Thus, by choosing         to be the
return from buying and holding an n—period, pure discount bond and

                   st
over a sequence of ri one—period, pure discount bonds, we obtain a
log—linear, return—to—maturity expectations model of the real term
structure of interest rates with a constant intercept

  By expressing             as (y)nl, where 't,n is (one plus) the yield to
maturity on the n—period, pure discount bond, we obtain

which is a version of the familiar expectations model for yields to

maturity, with a constant intercept                     The constant       is sometimes

referred to as a risk premium associated with n—period securities.
However, while            is a constant, the conditional covariance in (6) is in
general not a constant under the assumption of lognormality. Thus, a risk
premium defined in terms of the levels of returns and mt,n is time—varying
in this model. These log—linear, expectations models can be expressed as
linear expectations models in terms of continuously compounded returns.

  6Until recently, attention was focused primarily on versions of the
expectations model, with perhaps the most attention being given to the
linear expectations model,       which  states   that the expected
yield—to—maturity on a long—term bond is an average of the expected
returns of future one—period bonds.                    Roll (1970), Shiller (1979),
Singleton (1980), Hansen and Sargent (1981), and Shiller, Campbell, and
Schoenholtz (1983), among others, have provided substantial empirical
evidence against linear expectations models using yields on nominal bonds.

     time series {x) is strictly stationary if the marginal distribution
of (xt ,...x )     is   the same as the distribution of (xt
                                                                      +T•••Xt    for
      1       n                                                   1         n
all t1,...t, t.    This does not require that moments of conditional
distributions be constant.   A brief discussion of the estimation
procedures is presented in section four; see Hansen and Singleton (1982)
for details. For instruments we used the constant unity, lagged values of
the per capita growth rate of real consumption of nondurables plus
services, and lagged values the real rates of return on the two
securities. For each return, there were five orthogonality conditions
used to estimate two parameters, leaving three overidentifying
restrictions to be tested.

  8Constantinides and Ingersoll (19814) and Dammon (1983) discuss some of
the implications for bond pricing of taxes in an environment with
heterogeneous investors.

  9Similar utility functions were studied by Kydland and Prescott (1982)
and Eichenbaum, Hansen, and Singleton (1983),     They assumed preferences
were defined over consumption of nondurable goods and leisure; consumption
of durable goods did not enter explicitly. Here we include durable goods,
but omit leisure choices thereby assuming that utility is separable across
leisure and consumption goods.

  10We have chosen to normalize a to be unity instead of requiring that

      a.      1. Our analysis is invarient to the particular normalization
j1
chosen.

           sufficient
                 condition for the polynomial in the lag operator to have
a one—sided inverse is that all of the roots of the polynomial lie outside
the unit circle (i.e., have absolute value greater than one).

         the taxation of ordinary income is considered, since short term
bonds are studied in this paper. Also, in the subsequent discussion, the
tax rate may depend on the level of nominal income, but the returns are
after—tax real rates of return.

  13lnterestingly, Hansen, Richard, and Singleton (1981) rejected this
version of the time—separable model at small marginal significance levels,
using monthly stock returns. Their findings provide further support for
our claim in section two that the evidence against this class of models is
not due entirely to mismeasurement of consumption.

  114When investments     over different holding periods are studied, the
disturbances in the associated estimation equations will have
correspondingly different autocovariance structures.     For instance, the
disturbance in the equation for the three—month bill discussed in section
two follows a moving average process of order two and the disturbance in
the equation for the one—month bill is serially uncorrelated. This fact
was taken into account in both the estimation and inference.

  15This estimate of the initial stock of durable goods is less than ideal
since   it
         is based on the assumption of straight—line depreciation, which
is inconsistent with the geometric decay implicit in (10).          It can be
                                        148

shown however that, under the assumption of invertible lag polynomials in
(15), and certain regularity conditions on the capital stock,
rnismeasurement of the initial stock does not affect the large sample
properties of the estimates or test statistics.

  16This interpretation was suggested to us by Doug Breeden.

  1We also estimated the model with the order of the returns reversed
(i.e. with z2 given by (28) and Z1 consisting of the single instrument
unity) and found that the results reported in Table III are insensitive to
this reversal.

  18Unfortunately, attempts to estimate the parameter using only returns
in difference form failed in that the minimization algorithm did not
converge.

  19Bcth the point estimates and the test statistics for the model with
m2 were sensitive to the choice of starting values and the estimate of
the weighting matrix. Nevertheless, the results from all of the runs with
m2 were qualitatively the same and as described in the text.
  2The estimated pairs (ER,RP) obtained using the point estimates from
the runs in Table II are: ER   —3.0378—05 and RP = 1.3575.-OS for TBILL3;
and ER = '4.73114_OLI and RP   1.25143—05 for T66H3.

  This finding suggests that there is a positive relation among {'Y and
the average value of the riskfree real rate in our model,
   *     ft
EEMU(t)/NU(t+3)J. Verification of this relation in our model is not
possible, however, because the riskfree rate involves agents' conditional
expectations.     Mehra and Prescott (1983) obtained a positive relation
between risk aversion and the average riskfree real rate in the context of
their single—good model with time—separable utility.
