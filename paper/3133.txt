 FORECASTING AGGREGATE PERIOD SPECIFIC BIRTH RATES: THE TIME SERIES PROPERTIES
               OF A MICRODYNAMIC NEOCLASSICAL MODEL OF FERTILITY


                                        ABSTRACT

     This article demonstrates the value of microdata for understanding the

effect of wages on life cycle fertility dynamics.     Conventional estimates of

neoclassical economic fertility models obtained from linear aggregate time

series regressions are widely criticized for being nonrobust when adjusted for

serial correlation.   Moreover,   the forecasting power of these aggregative

neoclassical models has been shown to be inferior when compared with

conventional time series models that assign no role to wages.     This article

demonstrates,   that when neoclassical models of fertility are estimated on

microdata using methods that incorporate key demographic restrictions and when

they are properly aggregated, they have considerable forecasting power.

        This article demonstrates the value of microdata for understanding       the

effect of wages on fertility dynamics.       Neoclassical   economic models of

fertility    assign a central role to male income and female wages, yet empirical

evidence on the importance of these variables as predictors of fertility is

weak.     Much of the available evidence is based on linear time series regression

analyses of aggregate date (Burr end Ward 1979, Ward end Butz 1980, Wilkinson

1973). McDonald (1981) noted that when serial correlation is properly accounted

for in such models,    the coefficients   of the wage and income variables often

become statistically insignificant.       McDonald also noted chat aggregative

neoclassical    models are inferior in their forecasting power when compared with

conventional rime series models chat assign no role to wages and incomes.              This

negative assessment of the value of neoclassical fertility models is widely held

in the demographic community (Little 1981)

        Our article argues that this assessment may be premature. The apparent

inferiority    of aggregate neoclassical time series models of fertility may

reflect only the informationsl     loss from using aggregate data end may not

provide evidence about the value of economic models for forecasting.        Analysis
of sggregate data in this context is especially dangerous, because the

underlying microrelationships     between the economic variables and fertility are

intrinsically    nonlinear,   Wage and income coefficients of sn aggregate linear

time series regression are not simply related to the wage and income

coefficients    of the underlying microequstions.     This article demonstrates    thst

when neoclassical models of fertility are estimated from microdsta and are

properly aggregated, they have considerable forecasting power.

     This article draws its microestimatesfrom a companion paper (Heckman and

Walker [1989)) in which we estimate the effects of wages snd income on life
cycle fertility dynamics using microdata for four five-year birth cohorts of

Swedish women.       In our companion paper we formulate and estimate the parameters

of a micro stochastic process of individual fertility dynamics.        From our model

we are able to detecmine what features of fertility are affected by economic

variables.     From a common set of estimated parameters that characterize the full

reproductive process, we can predict any dimension of life cycle fertility:

completed fertility,      length of interbirth intervals,   and parity-, age-, or

period-specific      birth rates.   In this article, we simulate the best fitting

microfertilitymodel estimsted in our earlier work to predict aggregate annual
birth rates for each cohort.        We use the predicted aggregate rates to take up

the challenge     implicit in McDonald's work and ask how well our aggregated
nonlinear neoclassical model of fertility forecasts aggregate time series snd

how well it competes with linear neoclassical and autoregressive models fit on

aggregate    data.

        In our companion paper we find strong evidence of wage and income effects

consistent with neoclassical models of the timing and spacing of births.        In

this article we find that linear neoclassical models fit on aggregate data are

sensitive to the treatment of serial correlation.        This aspect of our work

reproduces McDonald's findings. We find, however, that the best fitting micro

nonlinear model of the timing and spacing of births when aggregated performs

better than autoregressivemodels in predicting fertility rates for most

cohorts.

        This article proceeds in the following way.     Section 2 summarizes the

empirical results reported in our companion paper on the effects of wages and

income on the timing and spacing of births.        Section 3 presents linear

regression estimates of the neoclassical model fit on aggregate time series

data.     Section 4 discusses the procedures used to aggregste microfertility


                                             2
equations    into annual aggregate birth rates.       The predictive   ability of the

micro model for forecasting aggregate period-specific         birth rates is assessed.

We compare the forecasting power of the aggregated model with the forecasting

power of linear autoregressive models without economic variables. The article

concludes with a summary.


                             2. ESTIMATES FROM A NEOCLASSICAL
                         MICRODYNAMIC MODEL OF SWEDISH FERTILITY


     This    section   summarizes the findings reported in Heckman and Walker (1989)

on the microrelationshipbetween wages and the timing and spacing of births in

Sweden.     Our summary is in three parts.       We first present the specification of

the stochastic birth process model used to estimate life cycle fertility

behavior.     We then discuss the microdata analyzed and place our estimates in

context with a brief overview of the relevant Swedish economic environment.             We

conclude this section with a brief discussion of the main empirical findings

from our previous work.


                              2.1   A   Stochastic Birth Process

     A stochastic birth process model is the natural scheme for describing

fertility    dynamics.    The model represents the reproductive process in terms of

random waiting times between births.           The initial conditions of the process snd

the probability mechanism generating the waiting times between births completely

specify the model.

    We use the hazard function (also called the occurrence rate) to characterize

the reproductive process. We assume that the sample paths of birth durations

conditional    on the regressors are absolutely continuous random variables (with

respect to Lebesgue measure),        so they have a well-defined conditional density.

To incorporate the effect of regressors, we model the conditional hazard, where
the conditioning is on regressors        as well as the survivor time. We parameterize

the hazard function for the kth birth         conditional on the (possibly time

varying)    regressors    Z in the following way:



            (tk!z)
                     â€”
                         exp(ako
                                   jl aklj(tkkJ
                                                  -
                                                      1'kj Z'$k) kl< k2
where the vector Z can include any known functions of the regressors. Yashin and

Arjas     (1988) demonstrated that absolute continuity of conditional duration times

is sufficient to justify the widely used exponential formula
                                                             connecting the
integrated conditional hazard function and the survivor function. They also

presenced alternative criteria that justify the exponential formula. Parity

dependence is incorporatedby estimating a separate set of coefficients for each

parity. The middle term on the right aide of equation (1) captures duration

dependence and encompasses common specificationa         frequently used in economics

and demography (Beckman and Walker 1987).

        In our empirical analysis we also control for potential misspecification

errors cauaed by unobserved variables that, if measured, would be included in 2.


Fecundability,    which differs across women is a natural source of such variables.

We estimate birth process models using an extension of the nonparametric           msximum

likelihood estimator of Beckman and Singer (1984) to multiple spell models.             Our

extensiOn expends their estimator to include defective duration distributions

(Beckman and Walker 1987).         This extension allows for parity-specificsterility.

Upon obtaining parity k some fraction of women (say                may become or choose to
                                                            Irk)

become permanently sterile, whereas      remain at risk to progress to the next
                                    l1tk

parity.     Although it is possible to parameterize the stopping proportions, lrk

to depend on regressors      (see Beckman and Walker 1987), the models whose

estimates    are reported in this article do not do so.




                                             4
     A variety of specification casts are available to select the preferred or

bast fitting modal.     In multismultistataduration analysis, modal selection ia

difficult because the analyst must often choose among nonneatad specifications.

To evaluate competing specificationa we use a predictive criterion baaed on the

classical       goodness-of-fit   teat.   The teat compares the predicted parity

distribution from a fitted modal with the parity distribution observed in the

sample.     Pa apply the teat at four ages    (20,   25, 30 and 35).    Significant

departures between fitted and actual parity distributions          at any one of the ages

tested is evidence of model misapecification.         Although our test examines only
one aspect of a multivariate duration distribution,          we find it to be empirically

powerful:    only one specificationwith economic variables passes the full set of

goodneas-of-fit    tests for all cohorts at all ages.


                        2.2 Microdata and the Swedish Context

     The data analyzed in this article and our companion paper are from the

Swedish Fertility    Survey.   It is a retrospective     survey of native born Swedish
women conducted by Statistics Sweden in 1981.          The data consist of random

samples from four five-year birth cohorts       (1936-1940        1951-1955) with

approximately    500 woman in the first cohort and 1,000 women in the other three

cohorts.     In addition to information on the characteristics         of their childhood

households,    respondents   gave complete event histories     on their births,

marriages,    and cohabitation (consensusl unions) and on their labor force

participation.     Hoem and Rennermsim (1985) documented the accuracy of the data.

     The survey did not gather individual wage and income information.            To

circumvent this problem we construct for each gender a time series of income

using summary measures of personal tax returns by age for selected years

published by Statistics Sweden. The selected years are 1960, 1965, 1970, 1974,
1975, 1976, and 1977. We regress these income measures on calendar time toime to

generate a complete age-and gender-specific    time series of predicted annual

income. See appendix B of Beckman and Walker (1989) for more details. The

predicted male income series is used in our empirical analysis.    We use the

predicted female income series and annual hours of work information from the

Swedish Ferrility Survey to obtain an age-specific time series of female wage

rstes.

     During the sample period (1948-1981), the Swedish labor market wss
characterizedby centralizedwage setting and explicit egalitarian wage

policies.   Operationally,   the wage policies compressed interindividual wage

variation by increasing the rate of growth of wages of low-wage workers

(primarily women) while reducing the rate of growth of wages of high-wage

workers and workers   in profitsble industries (Bjorklund 1986; Flanagan 1987).

This instirurional structure of wage determination has two important

implications for our microanalysis.     First, it implies that the observed

dramatic change in relative female wages from 65% to 90% of male wages in the

manufacturing sector during the period 1950-1980 is due to an exogenous force.

Second, it lends credibility to our use of aggregate wages    in an analysis of

individual fertility histories, since aggregate wage policy uniformly applied

accounts for much of the wage growth of individuals.

     During the postwar period, the Swedish government enacted a variety of

proratal child care programs and other social programs designed to promote the

equality of the sexes in the marketplace and in the home. Many of these programs

were only available to working women (or to women who had some work experience)

and the benefits of such programs became increasingly more generous over the

course of our sample period. These programs tend to weaken the negative effect

of female wages on fertility. Higher-wage women are more likely to work and


                                         6
hence qualify for child support payments.


                               2.3   Empirical   Evidence

     In Heckman and Walker (1989) we present an extensive empirical analysia of

the individual fertility histories     found in the 1981 Swedish Fertility   Survey.

The beginning of the observational period is age 13 for all women. Our baseline

hazard specification   includes female wage and male income variables,   a set of

background variables that are intended to control for the initial conditions of

the fertility process and a parity-specific      mover-stayer representationof

unobserved heterogeneity or omitted variablea. Such a model allows unobservables

to assume two values. One value implies that the individual     does not go on to

have additional births. The other value implies that the woman may go on to have

additional births, For each parity we estimate the proportion of women of both

types and the value of the unobservable for the women who may go on to have

births. In Heckman and Walker (1989), we determine that this specification       of

unobservables   is the one that produces the best- fitting models, It is important

to note that this specification implies that unobservables are distributed

independently   across spells even for the same woman.

     According to neoclassical theory and common sense, a woman's access to a

male partner's income is expected to have a positive effect on the probability

of her giving birth.    An increase in the female wage is expected to reduce the

probability of a birth. In the jargon of neoclassical economics,     the substitu-

tion effect dominates the income effect of a wage change on fertility.

     Table I reports the estimated wage and income coefficients and associated

                                                                         of
asymptotic standard errors of the best-fitting version of the parameters

equation (1) for each cohort for the first three births, which effectively

account for all births in Sweden and for all births in our sample. The pattern




                                           7
of the estimeted coefficients in Table 1 is representative of the
                                                                  many models we
fit.    Notice that the estimated wage and income effects are consistent with

neoclassical theory. Estimated femsle wage effects are statistically significanc

and numerically important in explaining the timing and spacing of births. Higher

wages lead to fewer births and to the postponement of births. In results

reported in our companion paper, we find that these estimated wage effects are

robust to the inclusion or exclusion of education, marital status, time trend,

age, unemployment,     and policy variables.   Estimated male wage effects are also

consistent with neoclassical theory but are less robust to the inclusion or

exclusion of marital status variables. Higher male income leads to more births

and closer spacing of births.      Our estimates   are robust to the inclusion or

exclusion of other control variables.

       We also estimate models using a second time series of
                                                             wages-gender-specific
real avetage manufacturing wages. No detail by age is available for this series,

but it is available on an annual basis. Wilkinson (1973) used these wages in his

time series study of Swedish fertility.        The manufacturing wage series is the

only gender-specific    wage series available frompublished sources for the entire

period under consideration.      Estimated effects of wages based on manufacturing

wages are qualitatively the same as those based on the age-and period-specific

tax table wages. The concordance of the estimates based on the two
                                                                   wage series

suggests that interpolation     in the first series produces little bias. Models

using the second wage series, however, fail goodness-of-fit       tests.

       In a limited Monte Carlo study we investigate and reject the hypothesis

that our estimated wage effects are the result of an errors-in-variables      problem

arising from using aggregated instead of individual wages and income.       Our

analysis also rejects the hypothesis that the estimated wage and income effects

are the manifestation of a spurious regressions phenomenon due to the use of


                                           8
time-trended wage and income variablea.        Estimated wage effects on fertility    are

also insensitive to the specification of duration dependence and unobserved

heterogeneity.   See appendix C of beckman and Walker El989).

     The intercohort pattern of the estimated wsge and income effects is

consistentwith the introduction and enhancement of work-conditionedchild

benefit programs during the sample period.        In Table 1 notice that the estimated

female wage effect decreases    (in absolute value) across cohorts for all birth

orders.    Wald teats using tha unraatricted parameters reject the hypothesis of

equality of wage coefficienta acroaa cohorta for all birth orders.        Because

market work entitlea women in the later birth cohorta to larger child benefits,

the eatimated female wage coefficient reflecta leaa of a substitution affect and

more of an income effect on fertility for later rohorta of women. Moving from

the earlier to the later cohorts,    the eatimated male income effect decreaaea       for

the first birth interval,   increasea   for the second birth interval, and exhibita

little pattern for the third birth interval.        Wald tearr indicate that eatimated

male income effects are atatiarically significantly different across cohorts

only for the first birth interval.      This evidence suggeata that the growth in

the availability of child care benefita permits later cohorts of women to be

increaaingly less dependent on their partner'a income to initiate the fertility

procesa,   Because of the drift in the estimated parameters      across cohorta, we

are unable to pool the four cohorts into a common model of life cycle fertility.

Our estimates    suggest the potential danger in pooling data acroas cohorts of

women, aa is done in many aggregate     fertility analysea.

     Theae aatimatea   and the eatimates   reported in Beckman and Walker (1989)

provide evidence in aupport of neoclassical economic models of fertility. This

evidence   is in sharp contrast to the evidence from linear time aeriaa regression

rodela fir on aggregated data, criticired by McDonald (1981         We compare


                                           9
aggregated versions of our model with aggregate linear time series models in

Section 4. We first discuss estimates    of linear aggregative models.


                     3. ESTIMATES OF LINEAR NEOCLASSICAL MODELS
                                     OF FERTILITY


       In this section we report estimates of linear neoclassical models of

fertility   fit on aggregate data.   We structure the aggregate analysis to match

as closely as possible the preceding micro-analysis.      Our atudy provides

evidence on the aggregationbias that arises from using linesr models to

approximate an intrinsically nonlinear microdynamic birth process. To maintain

comparability with the micro-analysis,    we aggregate birth histories in the

Swedish Fertility Survey to obtain calendar-year-specific     birth rates; we use

the aame wage and income series as covariatea and fit aeparate regressions for

each cohort.

       Table 2 reports the results of an aggregate time series analysis of the

kit of year-specific     birth probabilities.   We follow Lee (1981) and exploit

basic demographic   information by estimating rates rather than levels. The number

of women at risk to give birth is known and hence need not be estimated. Use of

the logit transformsrion    imposes the constraint   that women csnnot have more than

one or fewer than zero births in any year.

       The upper panel reveals that linear regression models have the expected

signs and significance levels that accord with neoclassical priors.        The Durbin-

Watson statistics, however, indicate serial correlationproblems.         The lower

panel shows that correcting for first-order serial correlation robs the linear

neoclassical model of any statistical precision.      Estimated wage coefficients

are largely insignificant   or "perverse.t' Table 3 duplicstes the format of Table

2,   except that for the models with estimates reported in this table male income



                                         10
is interacted with an aggregate marital atatua variable to produce a model that

is similar to the birth proceas model fit in our microanalysis.       The interaction

of marital status and male income variables captures the notion that male income

is relevant only when women are married. The reaults in Table 3 mirrot thoae in

Table 2. So do resulta for models fit aggregating within cohorta for each year.

Our estimates   of theae models exhibit the aame aensitivity to adjustments for

serial correlation noted by McDonald (1981). These results vividly illustrate

the danger of using linear models on aggregate     data to test the validity of an

intrinsically nonlinear microdynamic model.


                    4. EVALUATION OF ThE TINE SERIES PROPERTIES
                                   OF ThE MICROMODEL


     In this section we return to the microdynamic model of fertility and ask

how well it forecasts aggregate period-specificbirth rates.       We assess its

forecasting   ability both in absolute and in relative terms.     In absolute terms,
we compare predicted annual birth rates from the birth process model with

aggregate annual birth rates observed in the sample.     This comparison is an

absolute measure of the performance of the birth process model, since a

correctly specified micro-model of fertility should be able to predict the level

and the movement over time of aggregate birth rates.     To measure the forecasting

ability of the micromodel in relative terms we compare the within- sample mean

squared error of its predicted annual birth rates with that obtained from

autoregressivemodels fir on aggregate data. The recent work of McDonald (1981)

suggests   that autoregressive   moving average (ARMA) models without economic

variables dominate linear neoclassical models on a mean squared error criterion.

We investigate whether this dominance relationship also applies to the

aggregated version of our estimated nonlinear microdynamic model of fertility.

                           4.1 Aggregation of the Microdynainic
                                     Fertility Model


       Before presenting our empirical results we describe the procedure used to

aggregate     the estimated bicth process model to produce period-specific         (annual)

birth rates.       The aggregation procedure uses the fact that our estimated birth

process model provides a complete description of the stochastic          process

generating life cycle fertility.       To obtain period-specific   birth races from our

estimates     we must transform the internal time of the birth process (i.e., the

sum   of    all psst and current birth intervals)   into the external time of the

calendar.      This is accomplished once we set the calendar date of the start of

the process.       Recall that our date allow the observational period to begin at

age 13. Our empirical results are not affected when we use later starting ages

in the range 14-17 to estimate the model.

       To obtain predicted snnusl birth rates for e cohort, we calculate for each

individual      in the cohort her predicted annual birth rate by integrating the

estimated birth process model over the sample period using the individual's

observed covarists path. We produce calendar year rates for each woman using- the

date of onset of the process, her previous birth intervals, and incomplete

current spells to bring her to the current year. We sum         these   individual   rates

over all members of the cohort to produce the estimated aggregate rate.

       More formslly, let r[k] denote the calendar date of the ktF birth, with

r(O] equal to the calendar date of the initiation of the process.            For

expositional convenience assume that the process starts at calendar time zero,

r[O]O.        Consider then the probability    that woman i, with observed covariste

path   1,    will have a birth at calendar time r. Virtually all Swedish women have

three of fewer births,       By the law of total probability.

intervals    and the current incomplete                   interval give tha current calendar year at

                                          Micromodel


        Tests of the time series properties of the microdynamic model of fertility

use   the   predicted aggregate calendar year birth rates in the following way.         We

subtract the rates predicted from the birth prucesa model from the sample rates

for the cohort to obtain period-and cohort-specific        prediction errors.     We

investigate     autocorrolation   patterns in these residuals.   Our analyaiE does not

directly respond to the recent work of McDonald (1981)       .   His   study compared the

stability and quality of forecasts from linear neoclassical models of Australian

first births in levels with the stability and forecast power of conventional

tir.e   series models that assign no role to wages and incomes. We follow the

advice of Lee (1981) and focus on forecasting birth                whereas McDonald

focused on forecasting birth           els, ignoring the information available    from the



                                             14
number of women alive by age.      He analyzed first births over all cohorts of

women, whereas we consider the first three births of four cohorts of women.

Fourth births are rare in Sweden, and there are very few in the Swedish

Fertility Survey. Our evidence of cohort drift in Sweden suggests that

McDonald's demographic dependent variable, which is aggregated over all cohorts,

is unlikely to be explained by any stable economic model based solely         o   wcges

and incomes.

     MaCurdy (1986) established that     under the   null hypotheais of   no serial

correlation,   valid large-sample teats of serial dependence in the residuals can

be conducted ignoring the contribution of estimation error to the fitted

residuals.     His results apply without modification    to our model, because our

estimated parameters are JN consistent where N is cross section sample sIze.

     Table 4 preaenta an analysis of the residuals defined as the differene

between predicted and actual birth rates by cohort.       For each cohort first-and

second-order   autoregressivemodels are fit.     Except for Cohort 2, there is

strong evidence that the best-fitting model predicts the level of fertility

since the estimated intercept terms are not statistically       significantly

different from    0.   Only the model for Cohort 2 exhibits first-order serial

correlation    in the residuals.   There is no evidence of serial correlation in the

residuals    from the models fit for the other cohorts.

     Table 5 reports mean squared error calculations for the birth prooesa

model. Table 6 reports mean squared error calculations       for autoregress'Je

models, with one and two lags estimated in the logits of the birth ratesThe

mean squared error in both tables is defined for the pgits        of   the birth rates

For our data, N is large relative to T (the number of time series observationa

and assuming both N and T become large, under standard conditions estimation

           We   examine     the ability of miorodynamic models to account for time series
varIation           in cohort fertility.    This exercise ia especially interesting in

light of recant negative assessments of the value of neoclassical theory for

preoioting births (McDonald 1981).              Wa find that, for moat cohorts of Swedish

women, our estimated modela paaa the time series spaoifioation teata used by

McDonald (1981) to discredit linearized versions of neoclassical models applied

to Auatralian data. The mioromodel that fails to predict the aggregate                time

series also fails to pass micro goodneoa-of-fit              tests.   Aggregated neoclassical

miorodynamit s,odels explain the time series better, in the sense of mean squared

error of forecast, than do time series autoregreaaions.                The poor previous

    Note:aThia MSE is computed by taking the sum of the squared
          difference between the logit of sample birth rates and the
          logit of predicted birth rates and dividing by the number of
          annual observations. Periods with no sample births are deleted
          to make the logit transform well defined. They are always initial
          periods for each cohort.
