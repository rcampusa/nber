     This   paper analyzes the "debt crisis" of the l930s to see what

light this historical experience sheds on recent difficulties in

international capital markets. We first consider patterns of overseas

lending and borrowing in the 1920s and 1930s, comparing the performance

of standard models of foreign borrowing in this period to the l970—80s.

Next, we analyze the incidence and extent of default on sovereign debt,

adapting models of debt capacity to the circumstances of the interwar

years. We consider the choices available to investors in those foreign

loans which lapsed into default in the 1930s, emphasizing the distinction

between creditor banks and bondholders.    Finally, we provide the first

estimates of the realized rate of return on foreign loans floated between

the wars, based on a sample of dollar and sterling bonds issued in the 1920s.

 1.   Introduction



      Observers familiar with the history of international lending

approach the "debt crisis" of the 1980s with a sense of deja vu. The

debt—servicing difficulties experienced in recent years by many Latin

American and Eastern European nations represent only the latest in a

series of similar episodes stretching back over a period of centuries.

Not infrequently did the problems encountered by sovereign borrowers

culminate in default, the widespread defaults of the 1930s being merely

the most dramatic and generalized instance of a repeated phenomenon.

Quite often, defaulting debtors were able to re—enter the international

capital market only to default again, occasioning criticism of creditors

for engaging in reckless lending ascribed to myopia or excessive

competition.

      The widespread defaults of the 1930s offer the most suggestive

precedent for recent difficulties. In the l930s as in the 1980s,

illiquidity was not confined to any one country or region. In neither

instance can the problems experienced by external debtors be attributed

exclusively to domestic economic and political developments rather,

they must be linked to disturbances to the   world   economy including, in




                                       1
each instance, real interest rate shocks, commodity price fluctuations

and exceptionally severe recessions in industrialized regions. The

extent of the parallels has tempted many observers to see in recent

developments the potential for a replay of the collapse of international

capital markets witnessed in the 1930s.

     Skeptics object that institutional arrangements governing

international lending have changed so fundamentally that interwar

experience contains few meaningful lessons for the 1980s. Perhaps the

most prominent institutional innovation is the switch from bond to bank

finance, a development which, by changing the provisions of loan

contracts and reducing the number of creditors party to negotiations, is

said to facilitate rescheduling of debt as an alternative to outright

default. The International Monetary Fund now provides illiquid

borrowers an external lender of last resort which at the same time

serves the capital market in a signaling capacity, providing information

on domestic adjustment programs. Analogous to the foundation of an

international lender of last resort, the establishment of domestic

lenders of last resort, the spread of deposit insurance and the

implementation of macroeconomic stabilization policies are said to have

diminished significantly the likelihood of a business cycle downturn on

the scale of the Great Depression, thereby reducing the danger that

borrowing countries will again be so severely affected by vicissitudes

in the industrialized world.

     In the absence of a systematic analysis of the interwar record with

which recent developments might be compared, it is difficult to

determine the relevance of this historical experience to recent

difficulties in international capital markets. To provide a basis for




                                      2
 comparison, this paper sets out to analyze the pattern of borrowing, the

 incidence of default and the returns realized by foreign lenders. Its

 first part describes the contours of international lending in the 1920s

 and 1930s. Drawing on work by Eaton and Gersovitz (1981) and other

 investigators of the experience of the 1970s, we use regression analysis

to summarize cross—section variations in the pattern and magnitude of

sovereign indebtedness. The next part of the paper considers the

incidence and correlates of default, estimating variants of modern

models of debt capacity to explore the extent of association between

standard measures of economic structure and performance and subsequent

interruptions to debt service. In the final part of the paper we

provide a long—run perspective on default and on the remedies available

to creditors. The provisions of loan contracts are reviewed with an eye

toward analyzing the scope for renegotiation. We then present new

estimates of the rate of return on foreign loans floated in the 1920s,

disaggregating these estimates between loans in default and loans in

good standing as a way of constructing a measure of the costs of default

as incurred by lenders, and comparing realized rates of return on loans

made in different years, to different countries and to different classes

of borrowers.

     We are conscious that this paper only skims the surface of a topic

with many additional dimensions deserving exploration. Our defence is

that establishing the quantitative dimensions of international borrowing

and lending in the 1920s is a necessary precondition for analyzing other

quantitative and qualitative aspects of the problem certain to be of

interest. In the concluding section to this paper, we therefore

indicate the most promising directions for research.

2. Who_Were   the   Lenders?



     Between the    wars,   international lending remained the almost

exclusive preserve of the United States and a few countries of Northwest

Europe. Of the long—term foreign investments outstanding in 1938, the

vast majority were assets of the United States, United Kingdom,

Netherlands, France, Switzerland and Belgium. The U.S. and U.K. alone

accounted for nearly 2/3 of the gross value of long—term foreign

investments (inclusive of foreign loans, corporate securities and direct

investments but excluding war debts and reparations).1/ Hence interwar

trends and fluctuations in foreign investment are largely trends and

fluctuations in American and British lending.

     No country had as illustrious if controversial a history of foreign

lending as the United Kingdom. The traditional figures suggest that

more than 55 per cent of total British investment in the period 1871—

1913 was directed overseas.2/ World War I occasioned a considerable

liquidation of Britain's external assets, and in the second half of the

192Os the share of new capital issues for overseas borrowers declined

from its prewar range in excess of 50 per cent to 37—44 per cent before

slumping to very much lower levels in the 193Os. Nonetheless, in 1938

Britain's gross—external—asset—to—gross—national—product ratio remained

an impressive 79%.3/ Of these investments, half were placed in Empire

countries and 15 per cent in each of North and South America, with the

remainder split evenly between Europe and Asia—Oceania. 58% of total

overseas new issues floated between 1920 and 1934 was comprised of

public borrowing and 7% of railway bonds, with the remainder allocated

to sundry industrial and commercial ventures. British imperial lending

in other assets.4/

       Tight credit conditions in London and official restrictions on the

export of capital combined to encourage foreign borrowers who had

traditionally floated new issues in Britain to turn increasingly to the

United States. Except for British Dominions and colonies upon whose

borrowing the Colonial Stock Act of 1900 conferred preferential

treatment or who continued to borrow in London for political as much as

economic reasons, for much of the 1920s London and New York were in very

real competition in the flotation of overseas loans.5/ For the United

States, large—scale foreign lending was a recent development. The long—

term—foreign—asset/national—income ratio of the United States was still

less than 9 per cent on the eve of World War 1.6/ In contrast to

Britain, America's foreign assets doubled over the course of the war

and,   after fluctuating in the immediate postwar years, soared in the
mid—'twenties. Compared to their British counterparts, American
investors   exhibited a stronger preference for direct over portfolio

investments. Still, some 40% of American long—term foreign assets took

the form of portfolio investment, of which 2/3 were government

securities.7/ In contrast to Britain, where considerations of empire

dominated, the geographical distribution of American investment seems to

have been influenced if not governed by considerations of proximity.

Nearly 40% of total American foreign investment was in Canada, 30% in

Latin America and the West Indies and 20% in Europe, with the residual

scattered across Africa, Asia and Oceania.8/

       Figure 1 depicts the pattern of American foreign lending in the

interwar years. [Figure 1 here] In the 1920s it is dominated by the




                                        5
 steady increase in new lending, which was maintained in each year

 between 1920 and 1927 with the exception of 1923, when Prance's

 occupation of the Ruhr and attendant political uncertainties increased

 the perceived riskiness of foreign investment. Conclusion of the

Locarno Pact and successful placement of the Dawes Loan in 1924

signalled full recovery of the international capital market, which

continued to expand until 1928 when its growth was stifled by the

portfolio shift toward domestic assets associated with the Wall Street

boom. By 1929 new foreign lending had fallen back to 1924 levels,

before recovering slightly in 1930 following the collapse of the stock

market. In 1931, with the further deterioration of economic conditions

and the first defaults abroad, lending slumped to near—negligible

levels, with Canada the only remaining major foreign borrower. By 1932

even Canadian loans had dried up, and lending remained depressed for the

duration of the 1930s.

     While long—term capital continued to flow out of the U.S. on

balance until the second half of 1931, as early as the beginning of 1929

the U.S. was draining liquidity from borrowing regions; in other words,

from 1929 new lending fell short of the sum of interest and amortization

receipts.9/ To the extent that timing conveys information about the

direction of influence, the curtailment of lending cannot be seen simply

as passive response to unanticipated default.

     Figure 2 indicates that U.K. foreign investment generally moved in

step with American capital exports, but it also shows that U.K. lending

exhibited certain distinctive characteristics. [Figure 2 here] Unlike

American lending, which rose steadily throughout the 'twenties, British

lending was marked by a mid—decade slump, leveling off in 1922—23 and

 declining through 1925 before recovering through 1927. As in the       U.S.,

 overseas lending peaked in 1928 and fell thereafter, though not as

 precipitously or to such low levels. While it is tempting to ascribe

 the mid—decade slump in lending to tight credit conditions associated

 with Britain's return to gold, government policy toward new capital

 issues for overseas borrowers probably played the dominant role.     The

 fluctuations in Britain's gross capital outflow depicted in Figure 2

 closely mirror the changing intensity with which informal controls on

 capital export were enforced.1O/

     Together,  the two figures suggest that the U.K. contributed less
than the U.S. both to the rise in the gross indebtedness of borrowing
regions   and to the pronounced cyclical movements in their liquidity
position. In fact, the U.K. contributed nothing at all to the former

during the interwar years. While the gap between the total capital

inflow and outflow of the U.S. swings from large positive numbers in the

late 1920s to large negative numbers in the 1930s, British interest and

amortization receipts exceed the value of the new lending throughout the

interwar years, albeit by a smaller margin in the 1920s than in the

1930s.



3. Who Were the Borrowers?



     In contrast to foreign lending, which remained the preserve of a

small number of industrialized economies, a wide range of countries

engaged in foreign borrowing between the wars.   According to Lewis's
(1945) estimates of total long—term foreign indebtedness, the regions

with the largest gross international obligations in 1938 were North




                                       7
America and Asia. North American debts were almost entirely offset by

foreign assets, since the U.S. was by this time a net creditor, but

Canada's foreign assets of US$2 billion were dwarfed by foreign

liabilities three times that size. Whether one considers gross or net

foreign liabilities, Canada rather than the countries facing highly—

publicized debt—servicing difficulties was the world's most heavily

indebted nation by the end of the interwar years.11/

       The leading debtors of the Asia—Oceania group, Australia and India,

were   like Canada members of the British Empires The foreign obligations
of both countries, owed predominantly to the United Kingdom, largely
took   the form of sovereign and government—guaranteed debt. However, the

foreign obligations of these two debtors were only marginally in excess

of those of China and the Netherlands East Indies. Chinese debts were

inflated by Japanese claims against the portion of China it occupied in

1938 and otherwise concentrated in the form of British direct investment

in Shanghai. The debts of the Netherlands East Indies were half in the

form of Dutch—owned and controlled tin mines and smelters, oil wells and

refineries and plantations, and half government bonds and industrial

debentures.

       After North America and Asia—Oceania, Continental Europe was the

most heavily indebted region. Even excluding war debts and reparations,

more than a quarter of Europe's gross foreign obligations was comprised

of Germany's external liabilities. After having attained creditor

status in the decades preceding World War I, some 90% of German foreign

assets had been liquidated during the war or as part of the postwar

settlement Germany then received extensive capital inflows between the

time of the Dawes Loan in 1924 and the imposition of exchange control in




                                        8
 1931. The countries of Eastern Europe were also external debtors; the

bulk of their external obligations took the form of sovereign debt,

although western investment in extractive industries such as Romanian

oil, Polish zinc and Yugoslav copper and bauxite achieved significant

levels.

     Given the attention devoted to Latin American debt, it is

Interesting to note that the value of Latin America's gross external

obligations was smaller than the obligations of these other continents.

Concern may have been heightened by the fact that Latin American debt

was heavily concentrated in certain countries. Thus, Argentina ranked

behind only Canada and Australia in terms of the value of gross external

debt. However, only 1/6 of this total was public debt; the rest took

the form of direct foreign investment, of which British investment in

Argentine railways and private enterprise comprised the majority.

Brazil, the second largest Latin American debtor, contrasts sharply with

Argentina. Nearly 2/3 of Brazil's gross external debt represented the

obligations of federal, state and local governments. The finance of

railway construction is indicative of the two national strategies: where

Argentine railways were largely British owned and controlled, Brazilian

railways were owned by the state but financed by foreign borrowing.



4. Cross—SectIon Analysis of International_Borrowing



     To summarize the pattern of international indebtedness between the

wars in a fashion which facilitates comparisons with studies of recent

decades, we estimate variants of the borrowing models advanced by such

recent investigators as Eaton and Gersovitz (1981), Edwards (1984) and




                                      9
Riedel (1983). While these authors each provide a theoretical rationale

for their favored specification, we do not justify or defend their

estimating equations. The results of estimating their equations are

reported here only as a way of providing a basis for comparison between

the 1930s and 1970s.

      With the exception of consumption and investment, reliable

estimates of which are simply unavailable, we have assembled information

on the major variables used in recent empirical analyses.12/ Table 1

reports estimates of the equation proposed by Eaton and Gersovitz to

explain the stock of debt held by borrowing countries. Total external

central government debt is related to GDP, population, openness, a

measure of export variability and the rate of growth of GDP. Eaton and

Gersovitz use export variability to proxy for income variability and

argue that it should be positively related to desired borrowing. They

use openness to proxy for the magnitude of the penalty incurred with

retaliation against default, which they argue should be positively

related to desired lending. The sign of the coefficient on income

growth is theoretically ambiguous. Eaton and Gersovitz suggest that the

rate of income growth should be positively related to the demand for

borrowing, since some consumption out of future income is desired now,

but that it may be negatively related to the willingness to lend, since

"rapidly growing countries may have less to fear from the future effects

of   a credit embargo..."13/ If borrowers are on their demand—for—debt
schedules, this variable's coefficient should therefore have a positive
sign; but if   they   are credit—rationed, as it   is   reasonable to assume was
the   case after 1930, the sign should be negative.

should be interpreted cautiously for a number of reasons, not the least

of which is potential simultaneity bias. The general impression

conveyed by these estimates is that the Eaton—Gersovitz model provides a

less adequate account of international indebtedness in the 1930s than in

the 1970s. While the results are consistent with the notion that the

level of debt is positively associated with export instability and

degree of openness, the coefficients are not statistically well

determined. The only coefficient which differs from zero at standard

confidence levels in every year considered is that on the log of GOP; in

no case can we reject the hypothesis that this coefficient equals unity.

However, there is some tendency for the coefficient of GOP to shrink in

size as the 1930s progress, indicating that relatively high—income

countries had the greatest tendency to repay previously—acquired debts.

By the end of the decade relatively low—GOP countries were left most

heavily indebted. The predominantly negative coefficient on GOP growth

can be taken as indicative of credit rationing.

     The results from pooling the time—series and cross—section data are

quite satisfactory and give a somewhat clearer picture, with positive

coefficients on all regressors except the growth rate of GDP, all

significant at the 5 per cent level except that on export instability.

The coefficient on the log of GOP is so close to unity and so well

determined that it seemed sensible to try debt per unit output as the

left—hand variable. The consequence of deflating the stock of debt in

this way is to give predominantly better determined coefficients on the

remaining regressors, with no qualitative changes. The results from

the pooled equation for 1930—38 are characteristic:

     All this uses Eaton and Gersovitz's explanatory variables for the

purposes of comparative description of the data. We have not sought at

this stage to use on our data the disequilibrium modelling approach

which they employ. This is not because we think it inappropriate —

quite   the contrary, as our verbal discussion above suggests. We

believe, however, that it requires a tighter theoretical specification

and perhaps better data than we have developed so far. Although from a

quantity—rationing modeller's standpoint we might criticize the "quasi

reduced form" underlying Table 1 (see Portes and Winter, 1980), it still

provides interesting information about the data we do have.

     Edwards (1984) has suggested that the stock demand for debt is

better viewed in terms of the government's problem of selecting its

optimal portfolio of assets and liabilities. Hence stocks of

international reserves and foreign debt should be simultaneously

determined, and the latter will depend in general not only on the

variables suggested by Eaton and Gersovitz but also on the value of

reserves. We have estimated a variant of Edwards's reserve demand

function, using gold reserves as our dependent variable, and obtained

results remarkably similar to his as reported in Appendix Table Al. We

then added reserves to the equation reported in Table 1, hut neither OLS

nor instrumental variables estimates indicated that reserves had any

impact on the level of debt.14/

     Another attempt to permit balance—of--payments developments as

reflected in reserves to influence the accumulation of external debt is

provided by Riedel (1983), who analyzes flow supplies and demands for

new borrowing rather than stocks of debt. Riedel relates the flow of

borrowing to the following ratios: reserves to imports, debt service to

exports, the government budget deficit to GDP, investment to national

income, and income per capita. Results of estimating this equation are

reported in Table 2, where we have added dummy variables for Latin

America and British Empire countries (where the latter include only

Australia in our sample) to flag any differences in their experiences

and have dropped the investment ratio due to absence of data. The

overwhelming impression is, as anticipated, one of pronounced shifts in

the relationship of net lending to its determinants between 1928 and

1935. The coefficients on per capita income suggest that high income

countries had the greatest tendency to borrow before 1932 and,

consistent with Table 1, to repay thereafter. Although the regional

dummy variables are unstable across periods, they suggest on balance

that both Australia and the Latin American countries had unusually high

propensities to borrow until the total collapse of international capital

markets after 1931.

     Whether countries experiencing the initial effects of the Great

Depression were able to use foreign funds to help finance the shock is

sensitive to whether or not 1931 is included in the sample. The




                                     13
positive coefficient on the reserve ratio for the period prior to 1931

suggests that even at this early date countries experiencing balance—of—

payments difficulties found it relatively difficult to borrow abroad.

This coefficient becomes negligible, however, when the period is

extended through 1931. Similarly, when 1931 is included in the sample,

the positive coefficient on the fiscal deficit suggests that countries

which chose to run deficits in response to the impact of the Great

Depression initially had some ability to finance them through foreign

borrowing. This evidence dissipates when 1931 is excluded from the

sample. Whether the sensitivity of the results to inclusion of 1931 is

due to the appearance that year of the first defaults, to the increasing

inadequacy of our reserve measure given pronounced shifts between gold

and foreign exchange, or to some other peculiar feature of 1931 remains

to be determined.



5. Factors in Default



     Part of the explanation for the incidence of default lies in

special national circumstances, including particular primary commodity

endowments, domestic economic policies and the uses to which borrowed

funds were put. Yet in the 1930s as in the 1980s, developing countries

were subjected to common external shocks which affected both the costs

and benefits of interruptions to debt service. The list of common

external disturbances —   recession   in the industrialized world, declining

relative prices of primary products, rising real interest rates and

resurgent protectionism —   will   have a familiar ring to those who follow

the current situation. It is important therefore that observers struck




                                         14
 by the resemblance of the 1930s to the 1980s should not lose sight of

 the greater severity of the earlier shocks.

     A severe business—cycle downturn in the United States could not but

exercise a powerful influence over the liquidity and solvency of

sovereign debtors. The obvious indicator of this influence is size: in

 1929 the U.S. accounted for more than half of the industrial output and

nearly 40% of the primary product consumption of the 15 leading

industrial economies.15/      Another indicator is the magnitude of the

contraction: one need only note that the Harvard Economic Society index

of the volume of manufacturing fell by 25% between October 1929 and

October 1930 and that real GDP fell at twice the rate typical for the

first year of a recession.16/

     One of the principal channels through which these deflationary

pressures were transmitted to developing regions was via primary

commodity prices. In 1929, the most important agricultural goods in

world trade were, in declining order of importance, cotton, wheat,

sugar, coffee, silk and rubber.17/ Countries were variously affected by

their luck in the "commodity lottery,t' to use Diaz—Alejandro's (1983)

term. Between 1929 and 1930 the fall in average annual dollar prices

ranged from nearly 20% for wheat and tin to 30% for cotton, sugar and

silk and 40% for rubber.18/     In many cases the fall in export prices

understates the impact on primary commodity exports. Export volumes

declined with export prices as foreign demand curves shifted inwards and

domestic producers moved back down their supply curves. The decline in

foreign demand attributable to the depression was reinforced by

protectionist initiatives which heavily affected foreign food producers.

Ironically, the measures which created special difficulty for foreign




                                       15
debtors —   tariff   and nontariff barriers to imports of foodstuffs — were

adopted by industrial countries to bail out another class of debtors,

namely farmers hit by falling agricultural prices. Together, recession

and protection depressed the export revenues of 41 primary product

exporting countries by some 50% between 1928/29 and 1932/33, an

unprecedented shock by recent standards.

     Another way of gauging the shock to indebted regions is in terms of

the change in real interest rates. The fall in U.S. prices that got

underway in the final quarter of 1929 raised ex post short—term real

interest rates to more than 15%.19/ While the real interest rate shocks

of recent years are by no means to be dismissed, they pale in comparison

with the shocks experienced after 1929.



6. Cross—Section Analysis of the Incidence of Default



     Existing accounts tend to portray decisions in the 1930s of whether

to default on sovereign debt in one of three ways: (i) as the result of

idiosyncratic national circumstances about which it is difficult to

generalize, (ii) as a function of "bandwagon effects" that proved

irresistible even to basically solvent debtors once the initial defaults

occurred, and (iii) as the only feasible alternative available to

developing countries given the magnitude of the shock to the world

economy. Yet the incidence and extent of sovereign default varied

enormously across countries. None of these approaches provides much

help in understanding that incidence or that extent. This is in

contrast to modern models of debt capacity, in which the incidence of

rescheduling is assumed to be systematically related to a vector of




                                        16
 national characteristics proxying for its costs and benefits, such as

 the ratio of debt to GNP and various measures of trade performance.20/

 In   this section, we adapt these debt—capacity models to the
 circumstances of the 1930s to examine the extent to which country—
 specific    variables associated with the costs and benefits of default

help to explain its incidence. If these variables possess explanatory

power, then it will be necessary to supplement if not replace existing

characterizations with an analysis of the incidence of sovereign default

in the 1930s couched in terms of its differential costs and benefits

across countries.

       As in modern studies of rescheduling, empirical analysis is

complicated by the fact that the variable of interest —    in   this case

sovereign default — can take on a number of forms of varying severity.

Least serious was to be in default on sinking fund payments only. The

Dominican Republic, for example, while continuing to service faithfully

its dollar debt, temporarily fell into default on sinking fund early in

the 1930s, before making a proposal in 1934 concerning readjustment of

amortization which received the endorsement of the Foreign Bondholders

Protective Council.21/      More serious was to be in default on all or a

portion of interest payments. Most serious of all was repudiation, a

rare event in the interwar years.22/ The best available     indicator would
appear   to be the share of dollar— and sterling—denominated government

and government—guaranteed debt in default as to interest or sinking

fund . 23/

      Our measure of default is constructed from data covering national,

state and provincial, municipal and government—guaranteed debt. The

share of dollar— and sterling—denominated debt in default as to interest




                                        17
or sinking fund is calculated for the period from 1934, the first year

for which the newly—established Foreign Bondholders Protective Council

published information on arrears, through 1938. The explanatory

variables include proxies for the burden of the debt, the degree of

openness, the severity of the external shock and the stance of domestic

economic policy. Given their significance in Table 2 above, dummy

variables for Latin America and Australia are added to test whether

political or economic factors not otherwise accounted for help to

explain the incidence of default. The external—government—debt—to—

national—income ratio is used as a measure of debt—servicing

requirements —   in   other words, the burden of the debt. We proxy

openness by the ratio of exports to GDP and the severity of the external

shock by the percentage deterioration in the terms of trade after 1929.

It is likely that simultaneity will affect any attempt to estimate the

impact of the current export share on the incidence of default, since

countries which defaulted may have run policies or experienced sanctions

which subsequently influenced their reliance on trade. Therefore, we

use the lagged export share as a proxy for openness, employing two

alternative formulations: the 1928 export share and the export share six

years prior to the year for which the dependent variable is defined. It

is similarly possible that simultaneity may contaminate the coefficient

on the change in the terms of trade after 1929, since countries which

defaulted may then have run policies or experienced sanctions which

influenced the evolution of relative prices. As an alternative to the

change in the terms of trade between 1929 and the year under

consideration, we employ the change in the terms of trade between 1929

and 1931.




                                        18
     The next two variables are indicators of the stance of fiscal and

monetary policies. To avoid problems of simultaneity, both variables

are measured as percentage changes between 1929 and 1931, since

countries which defaulted thereafter subsequently had available

different policy options than countries that continued to service their

external debt. The fiscal policy variable is defined as the percentage

change in the central government budget deficit. Data on other levels

of government, while desirable, are not available on a consistent basis.

The monetary policy variable is defined as the percentage change in the

ratio of gold reserves to note circulation. Almost all the countries in

the sample remained on the gold standard into 1931; in the long run,

therefore, their money supplies were endogenously determined. In the

short run, however, governments could attempt to influence money supply

and any domestic economic conditions it affected through domestic credit

creation which would have as its eventual consequence a loss of

international reserves. Therefore, the greater the rise in the ratio of

reserves to money supply, the more restrictive was monetary policy.

While it would be desirable to include other foreign assets in addition

to gold and to use a broader measure of money supply than notes and coin

in circulation, adequate data are not available for the range of

countries included here.

     Two—limit probit analysis is used to analyze the incidence and

extent of default in light of the fact that the observed dependent

variable is obtained as zero for countries which did not default) as

unity for countries in default on all their obligations, and as a range

of intermediate values for countries partially in default.24/

    Pooled time—series cross—section results are reported in Table




                                     19
3.25/ The   results are striking for their conformance with basic

economic intuition. First, the most heavily indebted countries, as

measured by the debt/income ratio, appear to have had the greatest

tendency to default. Second, countries which experienced relatively

severe deteriorations in their terms of trade also had a tendency toward

default. This is true regardless of the terms—of—trade measure used.

Thus) the commodity lottery looms as important not only for explaining

the impact of the Depression on primary—producing countries but also in

explaining their response.

     These results seem quite inconsistent with the notion that all

developing countries experiencing the Great Depression had no

alternative but simply to opt for default. Rather, they suggest that

the magnitude of the debt burden and severity of the external shock

influenced the extent to which countries fell into arrears. At the same

time, they are inconsistent with the view that non—economic factors,

such as political ties to the principal creditor countries, provide the

entire explanation for the incidence of default. This is not to say

that the regional dummy variables can be dismissed. That for Australia

has a negative sign which differs significantly from zero at any

reasonable confidence level, indicating that the extent of default was

significantly less than predicted by the economic variables included in

the equation, a result tempting to interpret in terms of Australia's

political and cultural ties to the United Kingdom.    In contrast, the

incidence of default among Latin American countries is sufficiently well

predicted by the economic variables in the equation that the coefficient

on the Latin American dummy retains no residual explanatory power.

                                2 Oa
     The coefficient on the change in the budget deficit is positive and

differs significantly from zero at the 90 per cent confidence level or

better when the dummy variables for region are included. In other

words, governments which ran austere budgetary policies in response to

the Great Depression were best able to avoid debt—servicing

difficulties. Those which engaged in what were by the standards of

1929—31 relatively heterodox fiscal policies had the greatest tendency

to default. The obvious interpretation of this result is in terms of

the absorption approach to the balance of payments —   that,   ceteris

paribus, deficit spending raised domestic absorption of imports and

exportable goods, reducing the foreign—exchange receipts available for

servicing external debt.

     The coefficient on the monetary policy variable indicates that

countries experiencing relatively large increases in the ratio of gold

reserves to currency circulation had the greatest tendency to default.

This result is inconsistent with the notion that countries engaging in

expansionary monetary policies were driven to default by any balance of

payments difficulties that resulted. Similar results have been found

when estimating debt capacity models for the 1970s and interpreted to

indicate that sovereign debtors anticipating eventual default hoarded

reserves to finance subsequent import purchases whose expense could no

longer be defrayed by additional foreign borrowing.

    An alternative explanation for this result would appear to be the

inadequacy of gold as a proxy for international reserves and of note

circulation as a proxy for money supply. Consider for example the first

of these problems. Countries in our sample held gold and convertible

foreign exchange in various proportions. The use of gold reserves as a




                                     21
proxy for the total would not be a problem if those proportions remained

constant. However, Nurkse (1944, p.41) notes that the share of foreign

exchange in the gold and exchange reserves of 18 debtor countries for

which he has information fell from 33 to 15 per cent between 1929 and

1931. Yet certain countries swam against this tide; Australia, for

example, liquidated a major share of its gold reserves and replaced them

with foreign exchange. Hence eliminating the dummy variable for

Australia, as in columns (iii) and (iv) of Table 3, alters the

coefficient on the monetary variable, which no longer differs uniformly

from zero at the 95 per cent confidence level.26/

     The mystery of the monetary variable should not be permitted to

detract from the other conclusions. Overall, the results suggest that

basic economic intuition and simple economic variables go a long way

toward explaining the incidence and extent of sovereign default in the

1930s.



7. The Scope for Renegotiation



     To understand the scope for renegotiation, it is necessary to

consider the mechanics of foreign borrowing. Procedures in London and

New York were quite similar. The first step for a sovereign borrower

wishing to obtain funds on the London market was to issue a prospectus.

Typically, the terms of the offer and solvency of the debtor had already

been examined by a reputable issuing house, which endorsed the loan by

attaching its name to the prospectus.27/ In New York, specialized

marketing houses played an analogous role. The revenues accruing to the

managing houses took the form of the spread between the bonds' purchase




                                     22
price (the price received by the foreign borrower) and the sales price

(the price paid by the ultimate bondholder).

     Flotation might be undertaken by a syndicate of issuing houses and

banks. Since different institutions might have a comparative advantage

either in negotiating an acceptable loan contract with the borrower or

in marketing the bonds, it was not uncommon for one syndicate to resell

a loan to another before making the bonds available to the public.

Short—term advances were often extended to the foreign borrower in

anticipation of successful placement of the loan. To market the

securities, issuing houses based primarily in New York and Chicago

employed itinerant bond salesmen and established branch offices across

the United States and Canada. Some New York banks established special

security affiliates which could directly serve in this capacity without

violating American branch banking laws. If at first observers hailed

the verve with which these travelling salesmen trumpeted the virtues of

foreign bonds, after the first defaults they accused these same

promoters of a variety of excesses.28/ The facility with which these

securities were marketed is evidenced by the extent of sales to persons

of relatively moderate means. Although the available statistics are

incomplete, they suggest that in the 1920s the mean value of lots of

foreign bonds was less than $5000. Since this figure is inflated by a

small number of very large purchases, the typical lot would appear

smaller still had we an estimate of the median. For example, the face

value of the average holding of Chilean bonds in the 1930s appears to

have been no more than $800 when the 4% of largest holdings is

eliminated.29/ The small size of holdings and large number of

bondholders is often credited with creating a severe free—rider problem




                                     23
 in the event of default and negotiation.

      There was little scope for litigation as an avenue for obtaining

 satisfaction from defaulting debtors. American and British courts had

no jurisdiction over foreign sovereigns, who could be sued in their own

courts only with their consent.30/ One way in which lenders attempted

to protect themselves was by writing into loan contracts provisions

which earmarked certain revenues for debt service. Unfortunately,

nothing prevented a foreign government from also breaching these

provisions if it fell into default on interest or amortization.

Bondholders therefore tried to enlist the aid of their governments.

Government involvement could range from informal negotiations through

diplomatic representations and economic sanctions to armed force. The

U.S. State Department maintained a policy of official noninterposition

in negotiations between American bondholders and foreign governments,

although diplomats and officials did not hesitate to express their

interest in a settlement. The British, in contrast, permitted the

bondholders to delegate a British minister to the foreign country, or

his consul—general, as their local agent, a practice certain to raise

questions   in the debtor's mind about the capacity in which the minister
was negotiating.31/ The use of armed force, however nostalgically
viewed   by bondholders, was basically a thing of the past. The U.S.

Securities and Exchange Commission advised bondholders to eliminate from

their consideration the use of force as a means of debt collection.32/

     This left economic sanctions. The threat of sanctions in response

to Germany's 1933—34 default illustrates the use of this instrument. In

the summer of 1933 the German government declared a moratorium on the

overseas transfer of interest payments.33/ Negotiations between the




                                      24
head of the Reichsbank and foreign creditors ensued, yielding a

compromise under which Germany agreed to meet a portion of its

obligations. The Dutch and Swiss rejected the pact, however, and

threatened to impose sanctions. The credibility of their threat was

enhanced by the fact that both countries ran trade deficits against

Germany, implying that the costs of German retaliation were likely to

exceed the benefits. The Germans settled separately with both

countries, with Dutch and Swiss nationals ultimately receiving full

interest on their Dawes and Young plan bonds and cash payments of 3 1/2

to 4 1/2 per cent on most other German bonds.

     Similar threats were then issued by and agreements reached with

Sweden, France and Belgium. The mere opening of debate over sanctions

in the British Parliament was sufficient to prod Germany into action.

Before the measure could be passed into law, a German delegation arrived

in London, and within a month an agreement was reached providing for

full interest payments to British nationals on Dawes and Young plan

bonds.34/ In contrast, the nationals of countries whose governments

maintained their policy of official noninterposition received less

favorable treatment. The U.S. State Department protested such

discrimination against American bondholders, but to little effect.35/

     Bond finance and the associated free—rider problem are blamed for

the difficulty of negotiating settlements when debt—servicing

difficulties arose. Under bank finance, illiquid debtors can turn to

their creditors, who are relatively few in number, for bridging loans,

while insolvent debtors can negotiate a mutually—acceptable sharing of

losses. Under bond finance, creditors were allegedly too many and bond

covenants too inflexible for illiquidity to result in anything but




                                     25
 default or for insolvent debtors and their creditors to achieve a

 mutually—acceptable sharing of losses. In fact, there existed a number

 of mechanisms for internalizing the externalities that gave rise to free

 riding.   The major difference between the interwar and postwar periods
 lies not in the prevalence of negotiations designed to achieve an
equitable   sharing of losses, since negotiations were commonplace in both

eras. Rather, the difference is the extent to which some form of

default was a necessary prerequisite for getting negotiations

started .36/

      The fact that bond issues were floated by issuing houses and banks

meant that there existed agents sufficiently few in number and large in

size to have in principle provided bridging loans. Such short—term

loans and advances had been common in the 1920s (see de Cecco, 1984).

Moreover, it was in the banks' interest to tide over illiquid debtors,

since they suffered embarrassment from default on bonds with whose issue

they had been associated. It is troubling, therefore, that little such

lending occurred after 1929. It could be that the debt crisis was

quickly recognized as a problem of insolvency rather than illiquidity,

and that money center banks rationally refused to throw good money after

bad. This hypothesis imputes considerable foresight to the lending

institutions. Moreover, it overlooks the possibility that their very

unwillingness to provide short—term credit may have been directly

responsible for transforming what remained a problem of illiquidity into

one of insolvency. The banks' unwillingness to provide short—term loans

preceded by a year the onset of default. For example, in 1930 Bolivian

officials confronted with debt—servicing difficulties visited New York

to "treat with" American banks. Negotiations to obtain short—term loans




                                      26
were unavailing, and in 1931 Bolivia became the first Latin American

debtor to default, setting off a chain reaction.37/ The alternative

hypothesis is that, with only the goodwill of their customers rather

than their own assets at stake, financial institutions had little

incentive to bear the risk that what might appear to be illiquidity was

really insolvency. If so, then a major difference between bank and bond

finance is that under the latter, default was a necessary precondition

to the successful restructuring of a loan. It does not follow, however,

that under bond finance there was little scope for serious negotiation.

     If default ensued, a readjustment program might be negotiated by

the issuing house or by a committee it organized. Issuing houses

characterized themselves as "moral trustees" obliged to protect the

bondholders' interests.38/ Bondholders recognized, however, that the

issuing house was likely to be torn between the interests of two sets of

customers: bondholders and foreign borrowers. Moreover, the indebted

government was the issuing house's single largest customer, with whom

the lender was likely to have established a valued long—term

relationship. Given the potential for conflict of interest, most

readjustments were therefore negotiated not by issuing houses but by

independent committees. The legal status of these committees varied:

some obtained the physical deposit of bonds which they were authorized

to use at their discretion; others took a proxy or power of attorney

from bondholders who retained possession of their certificates; and

still others received no legal authorization from bondholders, who they

could claim to represent only informally.

     The British Corporation of Foreign Bondholders (known less formally

as the British Council and less favorably as the "conscience of the




                                     27
 loanmongers") was the oldest such organization, having been founded in

 1868.39/ With six of its 21 members appointed by the British Bankers'

Association, six by the London Chamber of Commerce and nine by the

Council as a whole, it could claim to represent the interests of both

the City of London and the bondholding community. Until the end of 1933

there existed no comparable organization in the United States.40/

American practice was to form ad hoc committees in response to

individual defaults. The shortcomings of the method were notorious.

Administrative expenses were inflated by the inability to exploit the

scale economies offered by simultaneous negotiations with various

debtors. Ad hoc committees could not bring the same pressure to bear as

so august an institution as the British Council. Moreover, rivalry

among competing committees undermined the credibility of each. Multiple

committees might be formed for various reasons, including competition

for profits, since the organizers typically received a commission paid

Out of debt service charges upon the conclusion of a settlement. More

often, rival committees were formed when issuing houses established one

and disenchanted bondholders another. The two then competed for

support, employing newspaper publicity and agents who were paid on a

commission basis to secure the deposit or registration of bonds. Not

only did this encourage committees and their agents to make extravagant

promises, but a debtor government was faced with the problem of

determining which committee best represented its creditors. In 1933 the

Foreign Bondholders Protective Council was finally established in the

U.S. on a nonprofit basis. It proved a popular vehicle for subsequent

readjustment negotiations, although its critics continued to suggest

that it was unduly influenced by the banks.




                                     28
    Readjustment plans were signalled by the publication of a decree or

simply an annoucement that bond covenants were henceforth modified. If

the plan was a result of successful negotiations, its acceptance would

be recommended by the bondholders' committee involved. A new coupon was

specified and the principal might be adjusted. A new date by which the

loan would be called was specified. Bondholders indicated their

acceptance of the arrangement by cashing a coupon and, when requested,

by exchanging an old certificate for a new one. If acceptance of the

offer was recommended by a prominent agency such as the Foreign

Bondholders Protective Council, few options remained for dissident

bondholders. In theory, they could withhold their coupons and form

another committee to negotiate a better settlement. In practice,

foreign governments had little further interest in negotiations once

their good standing had been restored by the seal of approval of the

Foreign Bondholders Protective Council. Only the possibility of

widespread dissatisfaction with the terms negotiated by the councils

provided a check on the process.

    How the bondholders fared under these arrangements is an empirical

question, to which we now turn.



8. The Impact of Default and Bondholders'   Ability to   Recover



     Little is known about the realized rate of return on foreign bonds

purchased during the 1920s. Madden et al. (1937) estimated the current

rate of return on foreign dollar bonds (excluding Canadian issues) on an

accrual basis; as shown in Table 4, they took interest as it accrued

plus or minus gain or loss on redemption as a percentage of the amount

Notes: Rate of return on foreign dollar bonds (exclusive of Canadian
issues) is from Madden et al. (1937), p.154. This is interest paid in
cash as a percentage of the amount invested adjusted for principal
repaid in cash. Rate of return on Latin American securities quoted on
the London Stock Exchange at the end of each year is from the South
American Journal (January 20, 1940), p. 44. This is dividends,
interest, arrears of interest and bonus as a percentage of the book
value of investment.




                             2 9a
of bonds valued at the original purchase price.41/ The figures reveal

that over the decade of the 1920s the current rate of return on dollar

bonds fluctuated in the range of 7—8 per cent. The highest rates of

return occurred at the beginning of the decade; then between 1923 and

1929 the rate of return exhibited no obvious trend. With the onset of

the Depression, that rate declined to 6.90 per cent in 1930, and in 1931

the first defaults combined with the repurchase of bonds for

cancellation at prices below par reduced the yield further. Additional

defaults continued to depress the yield until 1934, when the redemption

of Netherlands East Indies, Swiss and French issues on a gold basis, in

conjunction with the depreciation of the dollar, temporarily raised the

return .42/

      The rate of return on a class of sterling assets, sterling bonds in

Latin America, was calculated on a similar basis in 1940 by the South

American Journal. These estimates appear in the second column of Table

4.   One is struck first of all by the fact that throughout the 1920s the

required rate of return on sterling bonds in Latin America was below the

rate of return on foreign dollar bonds, perhaps reflecting the greater

perceived riskiness of American loans. With the onset of default, the

rate of return falls by roughly 50 per cent, not unlike the percentage

decline in the current return on dollar bonds. Yet it is not known

whether the returns on Latin American bonds are representative of

British investments abroad.

     The inevitable limitation of estimates constructed in 1937 or 1940

is that they have no way of incorporating the impact on the rate of

return of subsequent interruptions to debt service, notably those

associated with World War II, or of subsequent settlements between




                                      30
creditors and defaulting debtors. Many Italian dollar bonds, for

example, went into default in the autumn of 1940, and no additional

interest was paid until 1947. Most German bonds which fell into default

in 1933 or 1934 were only validated in 1955 as part of the London

Agreement, after which service was resumed. Several early Latin

American defaults, such as Bolivia's in 1931, were not settled until

after World War II.

     We have therefore constructed new estimates of the realized rate of

return on bonds issued on behalf of overseas borrowers in the United

States and United Kingdom during the 1920s. Tracking these bonds,

sometimes for more than half a century, proves to be a daunting task.

Rather than attempting to follow all overseas issues, we took random

samples of 50 dollar bonds for foreign borrowers issued in the United

States in the period 1924—1930 and 31 colonial and foreign government

loans offered for subscription in London in the period 1923—1930.

     Dominick and Dominick, in their annual reviews, provide a listing

and brief report on all foreign dollar issues.43/ Out of approximately

300 bonds, we selected every sixth one listed by this publication to

form our sample of 50. The source for information on sterling bonds was

the publications of the London Stock Exchange.44/ Our procedure for

selecting sterling bonds was the same as with dollar bonds except for

the sampling factor and the treatment of Australian loans. Since

Australian issues were so heavily represented in sterling loans offered

on behalf of overseas governments, to insure adequate geographical

coverage we included one in five rather than one in six of the colonial

and foreign government issues listed by the Stock Exchange and

stratified the sample by including only half the Australian loans which




                                     31
would have otherwise been selected.45/

     We then collected information on interest and principal paid, as

reported on dollar bonds by Dominick and Dominick through 1937 and by

the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council thereafter. Comparable

information on sterling loans was extracted from the Stock Exchange

Yearbooks and the Stock Exchange Daily Official List. Since amounts

paid fluctuated by year, as our measure of the yield we calculated the

internal rate of return.

     Assumptions had to be adopted in order to estimate these rates of

return. For example, in many cases no information was provided on the

share of bondholders who accepted a plan offered by a foreign government

in settlement of its default. Lacking evidence to the contrary, we

assumed that bondholders accepted the plan. When two options were

offered in settlement of default, it was straightforward to construct

the overall rate of return by weighting the rates under the alternative

plans by the shares of bondholders which accepted each. When no such

information   was provided, we were forced to assume that half the
bondholders accepted each alternative. Only interest paid in cash is
included. Interest paid in scrip or blocked balances is not counted as

a component of the rate of return until the year it actually accrued to

the lender in sterling or dollars.

     Our estimates of the internal rate of return on the two samples of

bonds, weighted by the value of the initial issues, are 0.72 per cent

for the entire sample of dollar bonds and 5.41 per cent for sterling

loans. If we restrict the sample of dollar bonds to those issued by

governments or with government guarantees (all the sterling loans in our

sample are in this category), the IRR is 3.25 per cent, much closer to




                                      32
 the comparable sterling loan figure.

        The first observation to be made is that these numbers are

positive, a fact not previously known. A second observation is that

investors in sterling and dollar bonds appear to have fared differently

in the long term. While the internal rate of return on sterling issues

is quite close to the statutory rate under the bond covenants, the

return on the full sample of dollar issues is small relative to the

statutory rate. The latter is only ten per cent of the average rate of

return on foreign dollar bonds for the period 1924—1930 as it appears in

Table   4.   Moreover, the 1924—30 returns in Table 4 underestimate the

yield   to maturity since   they deflate interest payments by the initial

sales   price of the   bond.46/ Similarly, our internal rate of return

calculations    may overstate   the return received by typical American

investors,    some of whom may have resold their bonds to the defaulting
government    at deep discounts in transactions of which we have no record.

     On the other hand, converting the time series of returns on each

sterling loan into dollars at the applicable exchange rates and

recalculating the IRR gives somewhat lower IRRs, reflecting the secular

depreciation of sterling. The average IRR falls by 0.6 per cent and

therefore comes closer to the figure for dollar bonds. The pattern does

not change much, however, nor would any of the results reported here.

     By themselves, the adequacy of these yields is difficult to gauge.

Comparisons with the yields on other bonds may be helpful; these are

provided in Table 5. Note that no correction for default has been made

to the municipal, railroad and corporate bond yields in the table; doing

so would require another extensive calculation. However, the yield on

high grade municipals was not dissimilar from the yield on U.S. Treasury

bonds, a default—free asset. In comparison, the realized rate of return

on foreign dollar bonds is disappointing. Note that the same cannot be

said of sterling loans: their internal rate of return exceeds the

average yield on consols over the period.

     One way to gauge the impact of default on the realized yield is to

regress the internal rate of return (IRR) on a constant and a dummy

variable for default. Since all the sterling bonds in our sample are

government—issued or government—guaranteed, for comparability here we

use only the subsample of dollar bonds which are government or

government—guaranteed (although in fact a regression for the full sample

of 50 dollar bonds gives results almost identical to those for the

subsample of 33). Weighted least squares (WLS) is used where the

weights are the value of the bond issue relative to the mean value of

issues in the sample. This yields:



     IRR   (dollar   bonds) = 6.74    —    11.02    DEFAULT     n = 33

                             (2.08)        (2.87)             S.E.= 12.17




     IRR (sterling         = 5.82     —    1.68     DEFAULT     n = 31

           bonds)            (0.06)       (0.48)              S.E.   0.98



with standard errors in parentheses. The constant terms can be

interpreted as the internal rate of return for issues on which there was

no default. It is clear that differences in the return to bonds on

which there was no default do not account for the very different

experiences of British and American investors; rather, the greater cost




                                             34
of default on American issues more than accounts for the difference.

That differential in constant terms which exists is, however, consistent

with the information on the rate at which interest accrued in the 1920s

as summarized in Table 4.

     In each case, the internal rate of return on foreign bonds that

fell into default was significantly less than the rate of return on

bonds which continued to be serviced despite the best efforts of the

bondholders' protective committees and the American and British

governments. However, according to the point estimates of the dummy

variables for all issues experiencing some form of default, an

interruption to debt service on dollar bonds reduced the internal rate

of return by, on average, 11 per cent. On sterling bonds the cost of an

interruption to debt service averaged in contrast less than 2 per cent.

That the return on continuously serviced sterling loans was lower than

that on comparable dollar loans while the cost of the average default on

dollar loans was higher reinforces the hypothesis that this differential

default risk was recognized in the 1920s and incorporated into the

required rate of return on the two categories of assets.

     As an accounting exercise, the weighted rates of return can be

regressed on vectors of dummy variables for year of issue, location, or

type of borrower. In this way the returns realized by investors in

different types of bonds can be compared. Table 6 reports WLS

regressions of the internal rate of return against a constant term and a

vector of dummy variables for year. The first year in the sample — 1923

for sterling loans and 1924 for dollar loans —   is   the omitted

alternative, and its average rate of return is the constant term. It has

been argued that the quality of loans deteriorated as the decade




                                     35
 progressed and that this should have been reflected in the realized rate

 of return. There is weak evidence to this effect in the case of dollar

bonds. Realized rates of return are lower for loans issued in most

years after 1924, but only the return on 1927 issues is significantly

less than the return on 1924 issues at standard confidence levels. The

variation in the internal rate of return on sterling bonds by year of

issue is quite different. For reasons that are not obvious3 that rate

is significantly lower for loans issued in the period 1924—1926 than

either before or after.

        Table 7 shows regressions of the internal rate of return on a

vector of geographical dummy variables. The omitted alternative is

Germany, so the rate of return on German bonds is picked up by the

constant term. The positive coefficients suggest that investors in non—

German bonds did relatively well; the returns on Central American, South

American, Western European, Eastern European and Japanese bonds are all

significantly greater than the returns on German bonds at the 90 per

cent confidence level or better. It is not suprising that the rate of

return on German bonds proved particularly low, since most of them fell

into   default   in 1933—34   after   which no interest was paid for two or even

three   decades. Nor is it surprising that the return on West European
bonds was significantly higher, since most of those in the sample were
continuously     serviced, the Italian bonds providing a notable exception.

However, the difference between Germany on the one hand and Japan, Latin

America and Eastern Europe on the other is intriguing since default

occurred on all the Japanese and East European dollar bonds and most of

the South American dollar bonds in the sample. However, while the

German bonds remained in default for two or three decades, the Japanese

bonds in the sample fell into default only in 1942 and service was

resumed as early as 1952. Partial interest continued to be paid on many

of the South American bonds, and readjustments, involving conversions to

new principal and interest amounts, were offered on the South American

bonds in our sample between 1936 and 1948.

     In contrast, there is little statistically significant variation by

borrowing country or continent in the rate of return on sterling bonds.

It appears that British investors, perhaps due to their government's

anticipated threat of trade sanctions, were able to secure a positive

rate of return on their German investments which did not fall

significantly short of the return on other overseas loans.

     In a similar accounting exercise, Tables 8 and 9 show regressions

of the weighted internal rate of return on a vector of dummy variables

for type of borrower, where national government is the omitted

alternative. Despite the preoccupation of many commentators with

sovereign default, it appears that investors who lent to national

governments ultimately received respectable rates of return. According

to Table 8, concerned with dollar bonds, only returns on loans to

corporations and to banks affiliated with national governments (which

include in this sample the Mortgage Bank of the Kingdom of Denmark, the

German Central Bank for Agriculture, the National Bank of Panama, the

Mortgage Bank of Chile, and the Mortgage and Agricultural Mortgage Banks

of Colombia) fell significantly short of the returns on loans to

national governments at the 95 per cent confidence level. Table 9 shows

for sterling bonds that the rate of return on loans to national

governments was virtually indistinguishable from the return on to

corporations and on British Funds. (British Funds was the name given to




                                     37
loans insured or guaranteed by the British government itself.)

Contemporary preoccupation with defaults by national governments may

have been justified insofar as sovereign default encouraged or provided

a rationale for defaults by the country's other foreign borrowers. But

the settlements provided by national governments which defaulted on

their sterling obligations, such as Italy, Chile, and Colombia, appear

to have been relatively favorable to the creditors, yielding internal

rates of return in the range of 3 to 5 per cent.




9. Directions for Research



     In this paper we have focussed exclusively on three aspects of

interwar experience with external debt and default: the pattern of

borrowing, the incidence of default, and the returns realized by the

lenders. Despite conscious efforts to circumscribe the range of issues

considered, important aspects of each question have been left untouched.

Thus, we have not considered the role of the League of Nations in the

League Loans of the 1920s and their relationship to the expansion of the

international capital market. Nor have we considered the similarities

and differences between the Kemmerer Missions to Latin America and IMF

conditionality. A further omission especially relevant to our analysis

of default is the treatment of war debts and reparations generally and

the 1931 Hoover Moratorium in particular.

     Another intriguing issue which we have not yet begun to address is

the relationship of default to the subsequent economic performance of

the borrowing countries. Whether default dLsrupted trade and capital




                                     38
flows in ways with serious implications for the subsequent growth of the

capital—importing economies is a question with obvious implications for

our assessment of the management of recent debt—servicing difficulties.

                               Data Appendix



       The macroeconomic data used in our cross—section analysis are drawn

from   a variety of sources.   While problems of comparability between the
statistics of different countries will be familiar to many readers, who
are used to interpreting the results of international cross sections

with   special care, an additional cautionary word is in order. A number

of the series used here, notably the national income accounts and price

deflators, must be regarded as approximations. We have attempted

therefore to maintain a provisional tone in interpreting the results.

Major series are as follows.



National Income Gross domestic product is used wherever possible. For

Europe   estimates are drawn from Mitchell (1976). Data for South America
can be found in CEPAL (1978) and for Central America in Thorp (1984).
Constant   price series for Latin America were adjusted to current prices

using Wilkie (1974). The series for Japan is from Mitchell (1982) and

for Australia from Butlin (1977).



Balance of Trade Special trade, which excludes gold and silver bullion

and specie. The value of imports and exports for the majority of

European countries is from Mitchell (1976). For Austria, Hungary,

Czechoslovakia, Poland, Latin America, Australia and Japan, figures are

from the League of Nations publications on trade and payments listed at

the end of this appendix.




                                       40
Terms of Trade   Import   unit values divided by export unit values,

normalized to 1929=100 and drawn from sources described above.



Population From League of Nations Statistical Yearbooks.



Central Government Revenue and Expenditure For Europe, from Mitchell

(1976). For other countries, from League of Nations Statistical

Yearbooks.



Exchange Rates From League of Nations Statistical Yearbooks. Where

both market rates and official rates were reported, market rates were

used. For Spain, the Burgos rate was used because it exhibited more

variability than the Madrid rate.



Prices   Few reliable consumer price indices are available for this

period. The wholesale price index was used where available while

composite price indices were used for certain Latin American countries.

These indices are drawn from League of Nations Statistical Yearbooks,

except for Central America, data for which is from Thorp (1984).



Money Supply and Gold The only comparable monetary measure is total

central bank note (and, where available, coin) circulation, from

Mitchell (1976), except for Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland,

Latin America, Australia and Japan, in which cases it is drawn from

League of Nations Statistical Yearbooks. Gold reserves are drawn from

these same sources.




                                        41
Debt and Debt Service Domestic and external debt, along with total and,

where available, external debt service (interest plus amortization) were

drawn from League of Nations Statistical Yearbooks. These are end—of—

year figures. Where Statistical Yearbooks provide no information, data

are   drawn from the League's Memoranda on Public Finance.


Default and Arrears    Data on these variables are found, for sterling

bonds,   in the Reports of the Council of the Corporation of Foreign
Bondholders   and, for dollar bonds, in the Annual Reports of the Foreign

Bondholders Protective Council.



       The following countries were included in the cross—section analysis

of borrowing: Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico,

Australia, Japan, Honduras, Ecuador, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland,

Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway,   Spain, Sweden,
Guatemala, and El Salvador.


      The following countries were   included in the cross—section analysis

of   default: Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Argentina, Brazil,
Colombia,   Mexico, Australia, Japan, Chile, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland,

Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Costa

Rica, and El Salvador.

1.     65.1% to be exact. These figures are from Lewis (1945), pp. 48—50.

Note that foreign investment in the U.S. and U.K. has not been netted

out from the totals. Since the ratio of long—term liabilities to assets

was 61% for    the U.S.   but only 5% for the U.K., netting   out inward
investment would change the picture somewhat for the U.S. but not the
U.K.     While these statistics are the best available, they are not

without    their limitations. The most serious is the omission of short—
term    lending, on which adequate information is not available. Although

Lewis (1945, p.7) warns that some direct investments may simply have

been missed in compiling the totals, a more serious source of bias is

likely to be the fact that bonds are valued at par. This is problematic

for bonds in default which traded at a considerable discount. On the

other hand, the market value of many direct investments was considerably

above book value in 1938. For Britain at least, Lewis suggests, the two

sources of error roughly cancel out.



2. These traditional figures have been criticized by Platt (1984) for

making unduly conservative assumptions about the repatriation of foreign

funds and hence for overestimating the value of outstanding stocks. But

if the required adjustments would moderate the apparent dominance of

overseas assets in British portfolios, they would still fail to alter

the picture of Britain's prewar dominance in international capital

markets.




                                          45
3. Long—term assets only, from Lewis (1945), are included in the

numerator, while Feinstein's (1972) estimate of GNP at market prices

comprises the denominator.



4. In the case of nongovernmental lending, just over half the total

took the form of bonds and sligher under half the form of shares. These

figures from Royal Institute (1937) are based on calculations by Robert

Kindersley, published annually in the Economic Journal.



5 The Colonial Stock Act enabled certain trusts to invest in the bonds

of colonial but not foreign governments. If a trust was not governed by

specific instructions about assets in which to invest, statute limited

foreign investments to East India stock, English corporations with

direct foreign investments, guaranteed Indian railways, and registered

and inscribed stocks of colonial governments. The importance of these

restrictions has been questioned on the grounds that the vast majority

of trusts were in fact governed by specific instructions and defended on

the grounds that in the 1920s foreign governments and municipalities

which attempted to borrow in London were forced to pay at least 1 1/2%

and up to 2 1/2% more than comparable entities within the Empire. See

Edeistein (1981), p.83.



6. Foreign asset estimates are those of Lewis (1945), while GNP is from

U.S. Department of Commerce (1976).   If Dunn's (1926, p.3) estimates of

foreign assets are preferred, the ratio is still lower.




                                      46
7. For information on the composition of U.S. portfolio investment

circa 1930, see Royal Institute (1937), p.189.



8. Considerations other than proximity also influenced the

international distribution of American loans. Before the War, for

example, investment in the West Indies and northern portions of Latin

America was actively promoted by the State Department as a way of

minimizing European financial influence in the region. See Angell

(1933).



9.   This "cross—over point," after which the debt—service obligations of

foreign borrowers exceed the value of new lending, is given considerable

emphasis in recent accounts of sovereign borrowing in the 1980s.

According to Kaletsky (1985, Table 2.1), the recent cross—over point was

1982—83. Note that the reason the gross outflow in Table 1 appears to

turn negative in 1937 and 1940 is that American direct foreign

investment is included on a net basis, since these are the only

estimates available.



10. Of course, the two explanations for the stagnation of British

capital exports are not incompatible, since restrictions on capital

exports were imposed largely to strengthen the exchange rate and ease

the transition back to the prewar parity. See Moggridge (1971).     Short

descriptions of these regulations and their changing nature are provided

by Richardson (1936) and Cairncross and Eichengreen (1983).

11. Her liabilities were split approximately 60—40 between the U.S. and

U.K. and between portfolio and direct investment. See Lewis (1945).



12. These data are described in the appendix.



13. Eaton and Gersovitz (1981), p.302.



14. Before dismissing Edwards's hypothesis, one should note the

possibility that gold stocks are an inadequate measure of reserves.



15. This 40% figure refers to consumption of nine major commodities.

See Lewis (1949), p.57. While the share of imports in GNP was not high

by modern standards, the sheer size of the American economy still

permitted changes in an import share which was low on average to

affect world markets powerfully on the margin. See the discussion in

Dornbusch and Fischer (1984).



16. Industrial production figures are from Tinbergen (1934), while GDP

estimates   are those reported in U.S. Department of Commerce (1976).


17.   Taylor and Taylor (1943), pp. 10—12.


18.   These figures overstate the change in the terms of trade, since

U.S. wholesale prices were falling as well (by 9% on average between

1929 and 1930, according to Tinbergen (1934), p.212).



19. These are the calculations of Summers and Delong (1984), p.53.

Feder, Just and Ross (1981). The debt—capacity literature is surveyed

by McDonald (1982). A recent discussion of the costs and benefits of

default from the policymaker's perspective is provided by Diaz—Alejandro

(1984).



21. For details, see the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council's

Annual Report for 1934.



22. The two notable instances of repudiation in this period are a

partial repudiation by the Mexican government in 1914 and the Soviet

government's repudiation of debt contracted by the Czarist and Kerensky

regimes.



23. These two denominations of debt comprise the very great majority of

the total. Only dollar— and sterling—denominated debt are considered

because, while the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council provides

information on the former and the British Corporation of Foreign

Bondholders on the latter, information on the status of debt denominated

in other currencies is much more difficult to obtain. Details on these

data can be found in the Data Appendix.



24. The two—limit probit model is a generalization of the Tobit model

to the case where the data is censored at both tails. Rosett and Nelson

(1975) provide a description of the estimator.




                                     49
25. Estimates based on data for individual years are entirely

consistent with the pooled time—series cross—section results discussed

in the text, although statistically less well defined, due presumably to

limited degrees of freedom.



26. For further discussion of Australian policy toward gold reserves in

this period, see Eichengreen (1985). Another possible explanation for

the sign of the monetary variable is simultaneity bias —   that   countries

which defaulted then capitalized on the opportunity to promote recovery

via monetary expansion. However, most of the movement in this variable

takes place before the second half of 1931, when the serious defaults

began. Moreover, replacing this variable with the gold/currency ratio

over the period 1928—30 does not alter the result.



27. To maintain their good reputations, the issuing houses supposedly

had an interest in insuring that the prospectus contained accurate

information. Committee on Finance and Industry (1931), paragraph 387.



28. "These agents for the first time taught the small investor in a

hundred small provincial towns, and in the countryside of the Middle and

Far West, to link their fortunes with those of the Governments and

enterprises of distant lands whose very names he often scarcely knew.

It was an astonishing achievement of modern organisation, and for its

first purpose of inducing the investor to lend his money, and making

this money available in the continents which most needed capital, it was

extremely successful. But, as we shall see, at the other end of the

operation, namely the examination of the character and purposes of the




                                     50
 loan, the capacity of the borrower and the likelihood of his using the

money productively, the methods adopted were less satisfactory. There

was too much competition and too little caution." Salter (1933), pp.99—

100. Compare the anecdotal accounts of lending in the 1980s reported in

Darity (1985).



29. Similarly, 80 to 90% of dollar bond purchasers in the 1920s took no

more than $5000, with 45 to 65% of the total value of an issue typically

taken by this category of buyer. These amounts need to be multiplied by

six to express them in mid—1980s prices. The figures reported are based

mainly on a survey of 24 representative American bond houses conducted

in 1924—26. See Morrow (1927) for details. Estimates of the average

value of holdings of Chilean bonds are from the Annual Report for 1935

of the Council of Foreign Bondholders, p.99.



30. In the 1970s, this situation was altered. The U.S. Foreign

Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 and the U.K. State Immunity Act of 1978

distinguished a nation's commercial activities from its acts as a

sovereign power. This legislation established the legal liability of

foreign governments for purely commercial acts and permitted such

governments to waive their immunities from litigation. The effect of

these acts has, however, been questioned. See Kaletsky (1985), chapter

4. Even in the 1920s, the situation was different for loans to

nongovernmental entities. Loan contracts for private foreign bond

issues were nominally subject to the laws of place of performance, not

those of foreign debtor. Disputes over private loans floated in New

York or London were therefore heard in American or British courts.




                                     51
 Thus, when in 1934 two German shipping companies contended that they

 were precluded from complying with the terms of their loan contracts by

German exchange control, the U.S. District Court in New York ruled that

"..As the contracts were made here and were to be performed here, the

German law relative to performance is of no legal significance in the

courts of this country." Madden et al. (1937), p.282. However, such

jurisdiction as American or British courts claimed over foreign private

debtors was usually of little significance. In practice, creditors

could use a legal decision to obtain satisfaction only if the defendant

had attachable assets abroad. Not surprisingly, the notable instances

where arrears were paid in full or an acceptable readjustment plan was

offered involved shipping companies, like those cited above, with

attachable assets anchored in American ports.



31. See Securities and Exchange Commission (1936), vol. IV, pp. 28—29.



32. Securities and Exchange Commission (1936), vol. IV, p.25. This new

restraint was ascribed to the adoption of a more balanced attitude by

the major powers. Royal Institute (1937), p.99. A more pragmatic

interpretation is that, however effective against an isolated debtor,

gunboat diplomacy was an impractical response to (geographically)

widespread default.

35. The treatment of these bondholders is described in the Fifth Annual

Report of the Bank for International Settlements. On State Department

protests, see Securities and Exchange Commission (1936), vol IV, p.24.

Whether American restraint is attributable to principle or to the fact

that the U.S. ran trade deficits against few of the defaulting nations

(Brazil, Colombia and Cuba being the notable exceptions), U.S. policy of

delinking the trade and debt issues clearly influenced the course of

negotiations. In its negotiations with Colombia, for example, the

bondholders' representatives threatened that failure to settle would

cause the adoption of increased tariffs on Colombia coffee. (See the

1934 Annual Report of the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council, p.95.)

Knowing U.S. policy, the Colombians appear to have discounted the

threat. As Colombian President Lopez put it, "this threat does not

modify in any way the intent of the Colombian Government to study

quietly the best plan to meet the external obligations of the

Republic..." Securities and Exchange Commission (1936), vol. IV,

pp. 378—379.

40. There had been two notable attempts to form central protective

agencies in the United States: the nonprofit Latin American Bondholders

Association incorporated in New York in 1931, which failed after

managing to secure only $515 in membership fees, and the for—profit

American Council of Foreign Bondholders, which was only slightly more

successful in attracting subscribers.



41. Madden et al. speculate that inclusion of Canadian dollar bonds

would reduce somewhat the avarage yields shown in the table. According

to U.S. Department of Commerce (1932), p.14, the average annual yield

offered on new Canadian issues floated in the U.S. ranged from 7.03 in

1920 to 4.19 in 1931, and averaged 5.32 over the period.



42. American loan contracts, both domestic and foreign, typically

contained provisions which specified repayment in terms of "gold dollars

of the standard weight and fineness." When Roosevelt issued an

Executive Order in June 1933 abrogating the gold clause provisions of

all U.S. government bonds, setting the stage for the devaluation of the

dollar, questions arose about the treatment of analogous clauses in

other bond contracts. In following months, many foreign debtors chose

to continue to honor the gold clauses in their liabilities. Most,

however,   quickly followed the American government's lead, making payment
in    depreciated dollars. In this   they were encouraged by the attitude of
the   American Executive itself. Creditors whose assets contained gold

clauses were characterized by the U.S. Attorney General as "a

privileged class....squatters in the public domain, and when the

Government needs the territory they must move on." (Cited in Feuerlein




                                         54
and Hannan, 1941, p.23.) Various steps were taken to relieve domestic

debtors, principally farmers, of the obligation to make repayment in

gold. Most foreign debtors took this as justification for their

decisions to make payment in current dollars.



43. Dominick and Dominick (1924—1937).



44. Issues of the Stock Exchange Yearbook were supplemented as

necessary by the Stock Exchange Daily Official List.



45. In the calculations to follow, the return on individual issues is

weighted by the value of the loan. To adjust for stratification, we

doubled the weight on each Australian issue included in the final sample

of sterling loans.



46. Most of the bonds in the sample sold at considerable discounts and

were expected to yield capital gains when redeemed at par. The most

dramatic case is the German United Industrial Corporation's Hydro-

Electric First Mortgage, a 20 year bond which sold at 84.5 per cent of

par due to its relatively low 6 per cent coupon.
