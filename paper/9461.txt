                                           ABSTRACT

Nontrivial diversification possibilities arise when a factor model describes security returns. In this
paper, we provide a comprehensive examination of the merits of various strategies for constructing
basis portfolios that are, in principle, highly correlated with the common factors underlying security
returns. Three main conclusions emerge from our study. First, increasing the number of securities
included in the analysis dramatically improves basis portfolio performance. Our results indicate that
factor models involving 750 securities provide markedly superior performance to those involving
30 or 250 securities. Second, comparatively efficient estimation procedures such as maximum
likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood factor analysis (which imposes the APT mean
restriction) significantly outperform the less efficient instrumental variables and principal
components procedures that have been proposed in the literature. Third, a variant of the usual Fama-
MacBeth portfolio formation procedure, which we call the minimum idiosyncratic risk portfolio
formation procedure, outperformed the Fama-MacBeth procedure and proved equal to or better than
more expensive quadratic programming procedures.

       One of the basic tenets of investment management is that diversification pays: risk can be

reduced by spreading investments across a large number of imperfectly correlated assets. The

merits of diversification are particularly clear in linear factor models for equity returns. These

models assume returns are generated by a small number of common factors plus an additional

random component that can be diversified away in large portfolios. Linear factor models form

the basis of the arbitrage pricing theory (APT) of Ross (1976, 1977). They are also widely used

in quantitative investment management for a variety of purposes including risk management,

alpha detection, and performance evaluation.

       One agnostic and prevalent approach to implementing factor models is to treat the

underlying common factors as unobserved random variables, and to infer them from the

covariance structure of returns. In this approach, the factor model parameters of individual

securities are estimated and then used to form basis or reference portfolios to mimic the common

factors. Cross-sectional regression based on factor sensitivity and idiosyncratic risk estimates

remains the most widely used portfolio formation procedure. In theory, these basis portfolio

returns will be both highly correlated with the common factors and relatively free of

unsystematic risk. In practice, there is no guarantee that a basis portfolio formation procedure

based on a finite sample will mimic the factors sufficiently well. Performance differences might

be expected across portfolio construction and factor model estimation procedures and might well

vary with the number of securities included and/or the number of factors being considered. It is

clearly important to know which methods do a good job of mimicking the common factors and

which do not.

       Which strategy is best? This is an empirical question that has not been previously

addressed. In this paper, we remedy this omission by providing a comprehensive examination of




                                                1
different basis portfolio formation strategies. In particular, we provide a detailed analysis of the

performance of variants of all of the portfolio formation procedures and estimation methods that

have been proposed in the literature, as well as an examination of the performance gains in cross-

sections of up to 750 securities.

       The paper is organized as follows. The next section briefly reviews multifactor models of

asset returns and their implications for the behavior of diversified portfolios. The third section

delineates the different portfolio formation methods considered while the fourth describes the

estimation methods used to generate the inputs to these procedures. The fifth section analyzes the

problem of basis portfolio performance evaluation. The penultimate section empirically

compares and contrasts different estimation methods, different portfolio formation procedures,

and different numbers of securities. The final section provides some concluding remarks.

       1. Diversification in Multifactor Models of Asset Returns

       A return generating process within which it is easy to characterize diversifiable risk is

given by the following linear factor structure:

        R%t = E + Bδ%t + ε%t ; E[δ%t ] = E[ε%tδ%t′] = 0; E[δ%tδ%t′ ] = I K ; E[ε%t ε%t′ ] = Ω   (1)

where R%t and E are N-vectors of returns and expected returns, respectively, B is an NxK matrix of

factor loadings, δ%t is a K-vector of mean zero common factors normalized to have a KxK identity

covariance matrix IK, and ε%t is an N-vector of mean zero disturbances with positive definite

covariance matrix Ω. The assumption that Ω is positive definite implies that no asset contains

only factor risk. No substantive assumptions are made in (1) except for the existence of the

relevant first and second moments.1 In particular, no assumption has yet been made regarding the

potential to diversify away idiosyncratic risk.




                                                             2
          Additional structure can be placed on (1) by assuming that the common factors are the

dominant source of covariation among returns or, equivalently, that the residuals represent

diversifiable risk. The residuals will be diversifiable if a weak law of large numbers applies to

them. Chamberlain and Rothschild (1983) provide a particularly convenient sufficient condition

for such a weak law of large numbers to hold: that the largest eigenvalue of Ω remains finite as

N→∞.2 Chamberlain and Rothschild (1983) termed (1) coupled with this constraint on Ω an

approximate factor structure.

          What diversification opportunities arise in a world with an approximate factor structure?

An arbitrary portfolio with weights wp has first and second moments of returns given by:

          R% pt = w′p R% t = w′p E + w′p Bδ%t + w′pε%t ; Var[ R% pt ] = b′p bp + σ ε2%p
                                                                                                      (2)
               = E p + b′pδ%t + ε% pt ; σ ε2% p = w′p Ωw p

where Ep is the portfolio’s expected return, bp is a Kx1 vector of the portfolio’s factor loadings,

and ε% pt is the portfolio’s residual return at time t. Portfolio p is a well-diversified portfolio if its

weights are of the order 1/N and the sum of squared weights converges to zero (i.e., wp′wp → 0).

The idiosyncratic risk of a well-diversified portfolio vanishes in the limit when returns have an

approximate factor structure because σ ε2p = w′p Ωwp ≤ w′p wpξ max (Ω) → 0 where ξmax(Ω) is the

largest eigenvalue of Ω.

          A well-diversified portfolio with no exposure to factor risk (i.e., bp = 0) generally exists

unless a vector of ones approximately lies in the column span of B. Such a factor-neutral

portfolio cannot be formed from a finite asset menu if the factors can be normalized so that Bι=ι,

where ι is a suitably conformable vector of ones. A convenient sufficient condition for the

    At this stage, these moments can be either conditional or unconditional.



                                                                  3
existence of such a portfolio in the infinite dimensional case is that the covariance matrix of the

                                                                             ∑
                                                                                 N
rows of B is nonsingular in the limit.3 That is: Var[ B] =               1
                                                                         N       j =1
                                                                                        ( β j − β )( β j − β )′ is positive

                                    β j and βj is the jth row of B. Note that the return of such a portfolio (if

it exists) must converge to the riskfree rate as N → ∞ or else there is an arbitrage opportunity.

The possibility of creating a riskless portfolio from a set of risky assets is one of the main

differences between mean-variance analysis in finite and infinite-dimensional asset markets.

       The main restriction on the limiting behavior of well-diversified portfolios involves their

expected returns. Since the returns of any K+1 well-diversified portfolios are perfectly correlated

in the limit under these assumptions, their limiting expected returns must be linearly dependent

as well. Accordingly, there exists a K-vector λ and a constant λ0 such that Ep → λ0 + bp′λ for all

well-diversified portfolios p. Note that this mean restriction is not the APT, a theory that converts

this exact expression for well-diversified portfolio expected returns into an approximate

expression for individual asset expected returns. Hence, this analysis is free of the controversy

surrounding the APT.

       2. Basis Portfolio Formation

       A statistician seeking to estimate δ%t in (2), given a priori knowledge of R%t , B, E, and Ω,

would naturally use generalized least squares. This is the minimum variance linear unbiased

estimator:


2
  In what follows, all limits will be taken as N→∞, with N left implicit to avoid notational
clutter.
3
  Set Bι = ι + η and consider a unit cost portfolio wp. The sum of its betas is given
by w′p Bι ≡ b′pι = w′pι + w′pη. Hence, this sum will generically be one if p is well diversified and η
can be eliminated via diversification. A column vector of ones will approximately lie in the span
of B if, for example, one of the common factors is unanticipated inflation and all but a finite
number of securities returns are equally affected by this factor.


                                                          4
        δˆtGLS = ( B′Ω −1 B)−1 B′Ω −1[ R%t − E ] = δ t + ( B′Ω −1 B)−1 B′Ω −1ε%t ; Var[δˆtGLS − δ%t ] = ( B′Ω −1 B)−1 (3)

where ( B′Ω −1 B) −1 B′Ω −1ε%t is the error in tracking δt. The estimator δˆtGLS is consistent if the

smallest eigenvalue of B′B grows without bound as N→∞, the usual OLS consistency condition.

The rate at which δˆtGLS converges hinges on two factors: (a) the structure of Ω and (b) the

dispersion across the rows of B. Ceteris paribus, convergence is faster when the securities used

in estimation have smaller idiosyncratic variances, lower correlations among their idiosyncratic

risks, and greater differences among their risk exposures. The last factor is well understood in a

regression setting: precise estimates of the covariance between the dependent and independent

variables are hard to obtain in small samples if the independent variables vary little across

observations. Similarly, large cross-sections are needed to obtain precise factor estimates if

securities typically possess similar risk exposures. For example, suppose two of the factors are

unexpected changes in expected inflation and unanticipated inflation but only a small fraction of

the assets respond differently to them (i.e., inflation has a neutral impact on most security

returns). In this case, accurate estimation of both common factors would require a much larger

cross-section than would typically be needed to merely eliminate idiosyncratic risk.

       In practice, the choice among basis portfolio construction methods is further complicated

by the need to estimate B and Ω. The estimation of Ω requires the placement of constraints on its

functional form. Popular choices are the statistical factor analysis model, in which Ω is diagonal,

and the principal components model, in which Ω is a diagonal matrix with equal variances.

Measurement error in the estimates of B and Ω can impair the small sample properties of basis

portfolio estimators and, as a consequence, large cross-sections may be needed to produce

reliable basis portfolio estimates.



                                                          5
        In what follows, we consider four procedures for constructing basis portfolios. Two of

the methods involve biased and unbiased versions of the generalized least squares estimator

discussed above. Unbiasedness is not a particular virtue, particularly in the presence of

measurement error and in the absence of a natural scale for the latent factors. Hence, it may be

desirable to seek a biased estimator with potentially lower variance. The other two methods use

mathematical programming procedures that constrain the reference portfolios to be well-

diversified, which might mitigate some of the harmful effects of both sampling error in and the

imposition of constraints on Ω.

        Before considering alternative portfolio formation procedures, it is useful to translate this

statistical formulation into the language of optimal portfolio formation after the fashion of

Litzenberger and Ramaswamy (1979) and Rosenberg and Marathe (1979). The generalized least

squares estimator provides what we usually refer to as Fama-MacBeth portfolios, after rescaling

the portfolios to cost a dollar.4 In particular, we choose the N portfolio weights wj to mimic the

jth factor so that they:

        min w′j Dw j subject to w′j b j = 1; w′j bk = 0 ∀ j ≠ k                                   (4)
          wj



where bk is the kth column of the sample factor loading matrix B and D is the diagonal matrix

consisting of the sample idiosyncratic variances.5 The solution is the unbiased minimum

idiosyncratic risk portfolio that mimics the jth unobservable common factor. We rescale the

weights wj so that the portfolio costs a dollar (i.e., w′jι = 1 ) to maintain comparability with other

basis portfolio formation procedures.

4
 Of course, Fama and MacBeth (1973) used the ordinary least squares estimator. Our usage is,
however, common.




                                                      6
       An alternative method that produces what we term minimum idiosyncratic risk portfolios

involves choosing portfolio weights wj so that:

        min w′j Dw j subject to w′jι = 1; w′j bk = 0 ∀ j ≠ k                                    (5)
         wj



In principle, this procedure should produce minimum idiosyncratic risk portfolios whose

fluctuations are proportional to the common factor. In contrast to the unbiased OLS estimator,

the proportionality factor need not equal one.6 This is easily seen by comparing (4) and (5).

       It is easy to distinguish these minimum idiosyncratic risk portfolios from the more

familiar Fama-MacBeth portfolios in the one factor case. Assume for simplicity that the

idiosyncratic variances are identical (i.e., D = σ ε2 IN). In this case, the Fama-MacBeth portfolio

solves the programming problem:

        min w′w subject to w′b = 1                                                              (6)
         w



with solution w = (b′b) −1 b prior to rescaling so that the portfolio weights sum to one where b is

the vector of sample factor loadings. Similarly, the minimum idiosyncratic risk portfolio satisfies:

        min w′w subject to w′ι = 1                                                              (7)
         w



which is solved by the equally weighted portfolio w = N1 ι. Thus Fama-MacBeth portfolio weights

are proportional to the individual security sample factor loadings (i.e., the betas) and, thus, take

advantage of the differing information content of individual securities regarding the fluctuations

in the common factor. Minimum idiosyncratic risk portfolios, however, are merely well-



5
  Note that we are now ignoring off-diagonal elements of Ω such as industry effects. As a
consequence, our procedures actually are better characterized as weighted least squares or
diagonal generalized least squares.
6
  Let B = (b1b2…bK) and suppose we are interested in mimicking the jth factor. The minimum
idiosyncratic risk estimator is D-1B*[B*′D-1B*]-1 where B* = (b1b2…ι…bK) and ι is a vector of
ones in the jth column.


                                                     7
diversified and do not exploit such information. Note that the factor loading of the minimum

idiosyncratic portfolio is the average beta of the securities (i.e., b = N1 b′ι ) while that of the Fama-

MacBeth portfolio is unity prior to rescaling.

        The diversification properties of Fama-MacBeth portfolios depend on the normalization

of the common factors. If the factors are normalized so that factor loadings are typically close to

one,7 both procedures yield portfolio weights of order 1/N. However, Fama-MacBeth portfolios

have very large weights in finite cross-sections when average factor loading estimates are on the

order of 0.001 to 0.0001 as is typical in daily data under the normalization Var (δ%t ) = I K . This is

not a problem when the factor model parameters are measured without error but it is a potentially

serious source of difficulty when large factor loadings can reflect measurement error as well as

responsiveness to common factors.

        The comparative merits of minimum idiosyncratic risk and Fama-MacBeth portfolios in

the presence of measurement error can be investigated more fully by again considering the one

factor model:

        R%t = E + βδ%t + ε%t ; E[ε%t ε%t′ ] = σ ε2 I N ; σ β2 > 0                                    (8)

where β ≠ βι is the N x 1 vector of the (not identical) population factor loadings and the

idiosyncratic disturbances are assumed, for simplicity, to have zero means, common (known)

variances σ ε2 , and to be distributed independently of one another. Suppose that we measure the

factor loadings β with error:

        b = β + υ ; E[υ ] = 0; E[υυ ′] = Συ                                                          (9)


7
  We are not aware of any study in which the factors are normalized to ensure that the typical
loading is unity. The following transformation yields typical loadings of one. Transform B so



                                                                8
where υ is an N vector of the deviations of the sample factor loadings from their population

counterparts with υ assumed to be independent of δ%t and ε%t ∀ t. 8 We also normalize the factor

loading estimates such that b′b = b′ι. This normalization implies that 0< b <1 to ensure that the

sample variance of the bi’s is positive. The Fama-MacBeth procedure yields a basis portfolio

with a sample loading of unity and with weights that sum to one. Finally, we assume that the

                                                                                  ∑          β j [i.e., N1 ∑ j =1υ j ≈ 0 ] to simplify

the arithmetic.

        In this setting it is easy to characterize the behavior of the Fama-MacBeth portfolio and

the relations between its returns and the common factor. The portfolio returns are:

         R%tFM = (b′b) −1 b′[ E + βδ%t + ε%t ] = (b′b) −1[ β ′E + β ′βδ%t + β ′ε%t + υ ′E + υ ′βδ%t + υ ′ε%t ]
                    1                                                                                                            (10)
               ≈      [ β ′E + β ′βδ%t + β ′ε%t + υ ′E + υ ′βδ%t + υ ′ε%t ]
                   Nβ

where the approximation b ≈ β implies that N β ≈ b′b. The variance of Fama-MacBeth portfolio

returns as well as their squared correlation with the common factor are (approximately) given by:

                                 1
        Var[ R%tFM ] ≈                   [( β ′β 2 + β ′Συ β )σ δ2 + β ′βσ ε2 + E ′Συ E + σ ε2tr (Συ )]

  We assume that our estimates are unbiased for simplicity. The assumption that υ is independent
of δ%t and ε%t is less innocuous since we typically estimate factor loadings and form basis portfolios
on the same sample. Accounting for such problems would complicate the analysis considerably
without altering the basic point. For example, if b were estimated from an ordinary least squares

        It is easier to evaluate the corresponding quantities for the minimum idiosyncratic risk

portfolio because it ignores the information in the betas. Hence, its returns and their

corresponding moments are:

        What are we to make of this tedious arithmetic? The latent nature of the factors makes

their scale arbitrary, making high correlation the appropriate objective as opposed to low

tracking error. When β is measured without error [i.e., υ = 0], the Fama-MacBeth portfolio

return is more highly correlated with the common factor than that of the minimum idiosyncratic

risk portfolio since:

The same cannot be said when there is sampling error in the betas: the squared correlation of

minimum idiosyncratic risk portfolio returns with the common factor is unaffected by

measurement error in b while that of the Fama-MacBeth portfolio falls in the presence of

sampling error.

        For example, consider the special case in which b is estimated by ordinary least squares

regression of R%t − E on δ%t , in which case the error covariance matrix is (approximately):

                σ ε2
        Συ ≈          IN                                                                                      (14)

and variance of δ%t with their population values for ease of exposition. The squared correlation of

the Fama-MacBeth portfolio with the common factor is then:

which will be smaller than that of the minimum idiosyncratic risk portfolio when:

         T (σ β2 + β 2 ) 2 σ δ2 < (T + 1) β 2 (σ β2 + β 2 )σ δ2 + β 2 (σ E2 + E 2 + σ ε2 )                                     (16)

which can easily obtain when the sampling variation in the betas is small or, equivalently (given

the normalization       1
                        N   b′b = b and the approximation b ≈ β ), when β is close to one. Note that the

variances of sample betas computed with respect to the usual market proxies are often quite

small.

         While both of these procedures produce well-diversified basis portfolios in the limit, they

may not do so in finite asset menus. This possibility led Chen (1983) to employ (proprietary)

mathematical programming methods to produce well-diversified basis portfolios with a finite

number of securities. Such portfolios might suffer only marginally from errors in estimating the

factor loadings and idiosyncratic variances due to the diversification constraint. Accordingly, our

other two portfolio formation procedures involve quadratic programming subject to fixed upper

and lower bounds as in:

         min w′j Dw j subject to w′jι = 1; w′j bk = 0 ∀ j ≠ k ; l j ≤ w j ≤ u j                                                (17)
          wj



where ℓj and uj are the fixed lower and upper lower bounds. We examined two choices for these

bounds. Following Chen (1983), we produced portfolios with non-negative weights (i.e., ℓj = 0)


                                                                11
that could take on maximum values of one to two per cent. We also examined portfolios that

were merely constrained to be well-diversified with weights taking on maximum and minimum

values of plus and minus one or two per cent. We experimented with constraints as large as five

per cent in absolute value and the results did not differ materially from the ones presented below

and, hence, are not reported.

          Finally, we formed sample factor neutral portfolios for each portfolio formation method.

These portfolios are used to construct the excess return basis portfolios analyzed below. The

differences among excess return portfolios are also best illustrated in the one factor case with

identical and uncorrelated idiosyncratic risks. In this case, the required orthogonal portfolio

solves the programming problem:

                                                                        1    σ β2 + β 2     β 

                                                                             σ β          σ β 

The corresponding excess return portfolio weights are obtained by subtracting these weights

from w = N1 ι , the minimum idiosyncratic risk portfolio in this case as noted in (7) above. This

yields:

                           1    1    σ β2 + β 2    β     β

The Fama-MacBeth excess return portfolio solves the programming problem:

               ex ′ ex             ex ′        ex ′                            1

                                                             ex
                                                                =                     ( β − ιβ )     (20)

          These manipulations yield one nontrivial insight — the minimum idiosyncratic risk

procedure produces weights for excess return portfolios that are proportional to the Fama-

MacBeth excess return portfolios. Not surprisingly, the factor of proportionality is the average

factor loading β . Once again, when the average factor loading is much less than one, the Fama-


                                                        12
MacBeth procedure will produce very large positive and negative portfolio weights. In contrast,

the minimum idiosyncratic procedure yields a well-diversified excess return portfolio. A similar

result arises in the multiple factor case.

        The choice of basis portfolio formation procedure should be a second order consideration

since well-diversified portfolios possess no idiosyncratic risk in the limit and so any K

imperfectly correlated well-diversified portfolios should suffice. In this section, we have argued

that the construction of reliable basis portfolios in practice requires a large enough asset menu so

as to virtually eliminate idiosyncratic risk and an asset menu with sufficiently different factor

sensitivities so as to allow statistical discrimination among the factors. Further, we have shown

that asymptotically efficient basis portfolio formation procedures that make use of sample

differences in factor sensitivities may have inferior small sample properties to those methods that

simply emphasize diversification and orthogonality.

        3. Estimation Methods

        The choice among estimation methods involves different tradeoffs than the choice among

basis portfolio formation procedures. The tradeoff here is between statistically efficient but

computationally costly methods such as factor analysis, and less efficient but less costly methods

such as instrumental variables or principal components. The question is whether comparatively

inefficient methods provide performance comparable to that of computationally burdensome

efficient estimation methods.

        When the factors are not observed, estimates of B and Ω may be obtained from the

covariance structure of returns, Σ = BB′ + Ω. When returns are normally and independently

distributed — that is, when δ%t and ε%t are jointly normal and serially independent — the higher

moments of returns contain no information about these parameters. In these circumstances, the



                                                13
log likelihood function is given by:

                       NT        T      1 T
         L (Σ | S ) = −   ln 2π − ln Σ − ∑ ( R%t − R )′Σ −1 ( R%t − R )
                        2        2      2 t =1
                                                                                                      (21)
                       NT        T      T
                    =−    ln 2π − ln Σ − tr ( S Σ −1 )
                        2        2      2

since the sample covariance matrix S = T1 ∑ t =1 ( R%t − R )( R%t − R )′ follows a Wishart distribution.
                                            T




        Unfortunately, the estimation of B and Ω when security returns possess an approximate

factor structure requires the imposition of further constraints on Ω. The two main alternatives

are factor analysis and principal components: Ω is a diagonal matrix D in the former while

Ω = σ ε2 I N in the latter. This observation highlights the intuitive distinction between factor

analysis and principal components — factor analysis implicitly involves weighted least squares

estimates of the factors and factor loadings (where the weights are the estimated idiosyncratic

variances) while principal components provides the corresponding ordinary least squares

estimates. Hence, factor analysis should tend to perform better than principal components when

there is nontrivial cross-sectional variation in idiosyncratic variances.

        We used two relatively inexpensive techniques for estimating the statistical factor

analysis model. The first is a modified version of the EM algorithm as applied to factor analysis

in Lehmann and Modest (1988), which used an iterative multivariate regression procedure. The

first two steps of the EM algorithm in this paper are unchanged but the third step is new:

        1. Given B and D, compute the minimum variance biased estimator of the factors

             via δˆtBGLS = ( I + B′Ω-1B)-1 B′Ω-1[ R%t - E ]; 9




9
    δˆtBGLS has lower mean squared error than (3) since it uses the information in the
normalization Var (δ%t ) = I K .


                                                       14
       2. Estimate B and D via multivariate regression of R%t on δˆtBGLS and

                                                                               ½           -½
       3. Compute the MLE of B given D from step 2 via B = D Γ(D,S*)Λ                           (D,S*) where
                                                                                                      -½   -½
           Λ(D,S*) is a diagonal matrix comprised of the K largest eigenvalues of S* = D SD

           and Γ(D,S*) are the associated eigenvectors. Return to step 1 if the algorithm has not

           converged.

This revised EM algorithm usually converges much more rapidly than the conventional EM

algorithm.10 We refer to this below as unrestricted maximum likelihood.

       The second technique, which we refer to as restricted maximum likelihood, makes use of

the information on B implicit in the vector of sample mean security returns when the APT is true.

In this case, expected security returns are linear combinations of the product of their factor

loadings and a set of factor risk premiums. In order to exploit this information, we also

performed maximum likelihood factor analysis subject to this constraint by maximizing:

                                    NT        T      T               T
       L ( B, D, λ0 , λ | S ) = −      ln 2π − ln Σ − tr ( S Σ −1 ) − ( R − ιλ0 − Bλ )′Σ −1 ( R − ιλ0 − Bλ ) (22)
                                     2        2      2               2

where λ is the vector of factor risk premiums and λ0 = 0 if a column of ones lies in the column

span of B. We used the unrestricted estimates of B and D from maximum likelihood factor

analysis as starting values and then obtained these restricted maximum likelihood estimates using

a variant of the EM algorithm.

       Principal components has been advocated by Chamberlain and Rothschild (1983) and


10
   We found it necessary to create this modification because the conventional EM algorithm
spent a great deal of time slightly refining the factor loading estimates in the neighborhood of the
maximum of the likelihood function. Jones (2001) uses a very similar iterative principal
components procedure that differs in how the D estimate is updated. He shows that the resulting
factor estimates are consistent as N→∞ when B is time invariant if the factors are serially
correlated and the residuals are heteroskedastic and provides a method for dealing with missing-
at-random data along the lines of Connor, Korajczyk, and Uhlaner (2002). See Lehmann (1992)
for related results.


                                                       15
Connor and Korajczyk (1986,1988) as an inexpensive alternative to maximum likelihood factor

analysis. This method requires the extraction of the K largest eigenvalues of S and their

associated eigenvectors or, equivalently, the K largest singular values of the matrix of returns

and their corresponding singular vectors. We extracted all of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of

S and scaled each eigenvector by the square root of the corresponding eigenvalue to set

Var (δ%t ) = I K . We then estimated D by substituting the transformed eigenvectors associated with

the K largest eigenvalues for B into the model Σ = BB′ + D.11

        Finally, instrumental variables is another inexpensive alternative to maximum likelihood

factor analysis, a variant of which was employed in Chen (1983). The basic idea is quite simple:

substitute consistent estimates of the factors for the factors themselves in (1) and estimate the

factor loadings and idiosyncratic variances by ordinary least squares regression. Following

Madansky (1964) and Hagglund (1982), we normalize the factors so that IK is the factor loading

matrix of the first K securities, making are the corresponding factors correlated, and decompose

the vector of returns into three components:

        r%1t = R%1t − E1 = δ%t + ε%1t
        r%2t = R% 2t − E2 = γ 2′δ%t + ε%2t                                                            (23)
        r%3t = R%3t − E3 = Γ3′δ%t + ε%3t

where r%1t , r%2t , and r%3t are the demeaned returns on the first K, the K+1st, and the last N–K–1 assets,

respectively, and γ 2 and Γ 3 are the corresponding factor loading vector and factor loading matrix

of the K+1st and the last N–K–1 assets, respectively. Consider the regression of r%2t on r%1t :



11
     Connor, Korajczyk, and Uhlaner (2002) avoid the comparatively expensive
eigenvalue/eigenvector decomposition by using a two-pass cross-sectional regression method
that is a close cousin of the EM algorithm. They also consider methods for dealing with data that
is missing-at-random.


                                                    16
           r%2t = γ 2′r%1t + u%2t = γ 2′r%1t + ε%2t − γ 2′ε%1t                                 (24)

Clearly application of ordinary least squares will lead to biased and inconsistent estimates of γ2

since r%1t is correlated with its own idiosyncratic disturbance term. If instead we first

regress r%1t on r%3t :

           r%1t = Πr%3t + u%3t                                                                 (25)

and then replace r%1t in equation (24) with the fitted values from this regression, ordinary least

squares can then be used to estimate γ2 consistently. This estimate is consistent because the fitted

values from (25) are purged of ε%1t and the idiosyncratic disturbances ε%3t are uncorrelated or

sufficiently weakly correlated with ε%2t by assumption. Repeated application of this procedure

after swapping r%2t with each element of r%3t yields consistent estimates of the corresponding rows

of Γ3. Finally, solution of the matrix equations:

           Γ′( S − ΓΦΓ′ − D)Γ = 0
                                                                                               (26)
           Diag ( S − ΓΦΓ′ − D) = 0

yields estimates of the factor covariance matrix Φ and the idiosyncratic variances D. The Φ

estimate can be used to transform Γ into B by implicitly rescaling the factors to be uncorrelated

with unit variances.

          4. Basis Portfolio Comparison

          It would be a simple matter to determine which combination of basis portfolio formation

procedure and estimation method works best if the factors were observed. Of course, we would

not need to construct basis portfolios if we observed the common factors. One heuristic approach

to comparing basis portfolios is to examine the behavior of their weights and the sample means

and variances of their returns in order to check whether the results appear to be reasonable. For



                                                                 17
example, basis portfolios ought to be well-diversified in order to diminish idiosyncratic risk. The

quadratic programming portfolios are well-diversified by construction but the same need not be

true of Fama-MacBeth or minimum idiosyncratic risk portfolios in finite samples. Similarly, the

sample moments of basis portfolio returns can reveal peculiarities in their performance. For

example, we have examined basis portfolios with mean returns and standard deviations as high

as 120 percent and 450 percent per month, respectively. Good basis portfolios probably do not

exhibit such behavior. Unfortunately, searching for reasonable reference portfolios in this

fashion is not likely to eliminate many candidates.

       Fortunately, some plausible large sample approximations facilitate the comparison of

well-diversified basis portfolios. The sample mean vector and covariance matrix of R% pt are given

by:

               1 T %                         1 T %                           1 T

where λ0 is zero if a vector of ones (approximately) lies in the column span of B and is the

riskless rate otherwise. Sδε p , the matrix comprised of the sample covariances between the actual

factor realizations and the idiosyncratic returns of the basis portfolios, should be close to its

probability limit of zero in large samples (i.e., S p ≈ B p Sδ B p′ + Sε p ). Similarly, the sample mean

vector ε p will be close to zero as well if the basis portfolios are large, well-diversified, and

constructed so that their weights are not systematically related to the ε% pt realizations (i.e.,

R p ≈ ιλ0 + B p λ ). We do not assume that Sε p is close to zero since ε p will converge to zero faster

than Sε p for well-diversified portfolios of large numbers of securities.

        Now consider the usual χ2 statistic for testing the hypothesis that the K mean excess

returns of the basis portfolios over λ0 are all zero:

        T ( R p − ιλ0 )′S p−1 ( R p − ιλ0 ) ≈ T λ ′B′p S p−1B p λ ; S p−1 = Sε−p1 − Sε−p1B p ( Sδ−1 + B′p Sε−p1B p ) −1 B′p Sε−p1
                                                                                                                                      (28)
                                              ≈ T λ ′[( B′p Sε−p1B p ) −1 + Sδ ]−1 λ ; B′p S p−1B p = [( B′p Sε−p1B p ) −1 + Sδ ]−1

The structure of Sp simplifies matters considerably and the χ2 statistic is (approximately)

bounded by the maximum attainable value of T λ ′Sδ−1λ . When B′p Sε−p1B p is large (i.e., when

ξ min ( B′p Sε−1B p ) is large), [( B′p Sε−1B p ) −1 + Sδ ]−1 is small and the χ2 statistic will be large as well.

Ceteris paribus, reductions in the idiosyncratic variances and increases in the factor loadings of

the basis portfolios will increase the percentage of basis portfolio return variance explained by δ%t

and, thus, the χ2 statistic. Hence, the usual χ2 statistic for testing the joint significance of mean

excess basis portfolio returns can rank different combinations of portfolio formation procedures

and factor loading estimation methods.

        For example, in the one factor case discussed earlier, the χ2 statistics for the Fama-

MacBeth and minimum idiosyncratic risk portfolios with no measurement error in β are

generically occur for N sufficiently large. Sampling error can indeed cause minimum

idiosyncratic risk portfolios to outperform their Fama-MacBeth counterparts.

         This reasoning points to a problem with testing the APT after using the χ2 statistic to

assess     basis       portfolio         performance.             Consider      the    fitted   multivariate   regression

of R%t − ιλ0 on R% pt − ιλ0 and a constant:

         R%t − ιλ0 = αˆ + Bˆ ( R% pt − ιλ0 ) + εˆt                                                                  (31)

where α̂ is the vector of estimated intercepts, B̂ is the estimated factor loading matrix, and εˆt is the

fitted residual vector. The population value of α will be zero if the APT is true and the basis

portfolios measure the common factors with negligible error. The usual χ2 for testing this

hypothesis is:

         T αˆ ′Σˆ ε−1αˆ = T [ R − ιλ0 − Bˆ ( R p − ιλ0 )]′Σˆ ε−1[ R − ιλ0 − Bˆ ( R p − ιλ0 )]
                       = T [( R − ιλ0 )′S −1Σˆ ε Σˆ ε−1Σˆ ε S −1 ( R − ιλ0 )]                                       (32)
                       = T ( R − ιλ0 )′S −1 ( R − ιλ0 ) − T ( R p − ιλ0 )′S p−1 ( R p − ιλ0 )

where Σˆ ε is the sample residual covariance matrix of εˆt . The last equality follows directly from

three observations: (1) αˆ = Σˆ ε S -1 R; (2) Bˆ = Sω p (ω ′p Sω p ) −1 ; and (3) Σˆ ε = S − Sω ′p (ω ′p Sω p ) −1ω p S



                                                                    20
where ωp is the NxK matrix of portfolio weights of the true basis portfolios. This representation

makes economic sense: the difference in squared Sharpe ratios measures the performance

improvement in mean-variance space arising from the addition of the individual securities to the

basis portfolios, which will be zero, apart from sampling error, if α = 0.12

          Thus the χ2 statistic for testing the null hypothesis α = 0 is the difference between the χ2

statistics for testing the joint significance of two sets of mean excess returns, those of individual

securities and those of the basis portfolios. Choosing the basis portfolios with the largest χ2

statistic minimizes the test statistic for α = 0 and thus reduces its power, although the magnitude

of the bias when the APT is false cannot be analyzed without further assumptions. Fortunately,

this problem can be mitigated to a considerable extent by using known empirical anomalies such

as those associated with market to book, firm size and dividend yield to increase the power of

tests of the APT since basis portfolios tend to be well-diversified while the anomalies are not.

That is, characteristics such as small market to book or firm size, zero dividend yield, or high

dividend yield are clearly not distributed uniformly over securities.

          Finally, it is worth emphasizing a major limitation of the analysis. It is not possible to

test analytically whether the differences in χ2 statistics are significant at conventional levels

because they are dependent across portfolio formation and estimation procedures.13 Hence, the

results that follow should be thought of as suggestive ones to be weighed along with other

evidence such as the sensitivity of absolute and relative mutual fund performance measures to

alternative basis portfolio construction methods as documented in Lehmann and Modest (1987).

          5. Empirical Results

          Evaluation of basis portfolio performance requires consideration of the frequency of


12
     This was first noted in Jobson and Korkie (1982).


                                                  21
observation, the sample period, the asset menu, and the number of postulated factors. The main

virtue of daily data is the increased precision of second moment estimates while the biases in

mean returns associated with bid-ask spreads and the biases in second moments arising from

non-trading and thin trading constitute their principal defects. As in most investigations of the

APT, we opted for the putative virtues of a large sample and used daily data to estimate the

factor loadings and idiosyncratic variances.

          We estimated factor models for four subperiods covered by the CRSP daily returns file:

1963 through 1967, 1968 through 1972, 1973 through 1977, and 1978 through 1982. In each

period, we confined our attention to continuously listed firms in order to have the same number

of observations for each security and ignored any potential selection bias associated with this

choice. This yielded samples of 1001, 1350, 1350, and 1346 securities and 1259, 1234, 1263, and

1264 daily observations in these four subperiods, respectively. To guard against any biases

induced by the natural progression of letters (General Dynamics, General Electric, etc.), we

randomly reordered the securities in each subperiod.

          We also made choices as to the number of securities and the number of factors included

in the analysis. In order to study the impact of the size of the asset menu on reference portfolio

performance, we estimated factor models for the first 30, 250, and 750 securities in our randomly

sampled data files for each period after seeing little improvement in experiments with larger

cross-sections. We chose to remain agnostic about the true number of factors and examined

models containing five, ten, and fifteen factors, although for obvious reasons we did not estimate

a fifteen factor model with only thirty securities. We also normalized the models so that the

factors were uncorrelated with unit variances and that B'D-1B was diagonal. This is the standard



13
     The bootstrap could be employed here under suitable regularity conditions.


                                                 22
normalization in the literature, although it is worth noting that Fama-MacBeth portfolios are not

invariant with respect to normalization.

       We first provide evidence on the diversification properties of alternative combinations of

Fama-MacBeth and minimum idiosyncratic risk portfolios and estimation methods, omitting the

quadratic programming portfolios since they are well-diversified by construction. There are

several ways to quantify the diversification properties of reference portfolio weights. We confine

our attention to one simple summary measure: the sum of squared portfolio weights, which

converges to zero as the number of assets grows without bound when a portfolio is well-

diversified. The minimum sum that can be attained with portfolio weights that sum to one is the

inverse of the number of securities: 0.03333 for thirty securities, 0.004 for 250 securities,

and 0.001333 for 750 securities.

       Table 1 summarizes the diversification properties of Fama-MacBeth and minimum

idiosyncratic risk portfolios across estimation methods, numbers of assets, and factors. For each

combination, we report two numbers: the average sum of squared portfolio weights across both

factors and sample periods and the sample standard deviation of the sum of squared portfolio

weights. These quantities are given by:

where k indexes factors, t refers to time periods (where T=4), and i indexes firms. Obviously,

these measures are descriptive and are not appropriate for inference without further assumptions.

       The overwhelming message of Table I is that Fama-MacBeth portfolios formed under the

usual factor model normalization are extremely poorly diversified. In contrast, minimum

idiosyncratic risk portfolios proved to be quite well-diversified with mean sums of squared

weights only ten to twenty times the minimum attainable ones. The contrast is striking — Fama-

MacBeth portfolios yielded values of wk′ wk between 40 and 50,000 times those of minimum

idiosyncratic risk portfolios. Examination of the results for individual basis portfolios (not

reported here) reveals that similar differences occur in the disaggregated data as well. In fact,

every minimum idiosyncratic risk portfolio was better diversified than its Fama-MacBeth

counterpart. The evidence is less clear on the comparative performance of different estimation

methods. Minimum idiosyncratic risk portfolios formed from principal components estimates

appear to be slightly better diversified than those computed from the other three estimation

methods but the difference is slight and is reversed often when individual basis portfolios are

compared.

       What accounts for the sharp contrast in the diversification behavior of these two portfolio

formation methods? As noted earlier, the answer is scaling: Fama-MacBeth portfolios are the

minimum idiosyncratic risk portfolios with a loading of one on one factor and loadings of zero

on the other factors prior to rescaling to cost a dollar. Factor loading estimates as usually

normalized are typically much smaller than one (on the order of 0.001 to 0.0001 in daily data)

and, hence, some weights must be very large and positive to insure a portfolio loading of one on

the factor being mimicked while others must be large and negative in order to have loadings of

zero on the other factors. This problem does not arise in the CAPM context since the natural beta

on a market proxy is one. By contrast, minimum idiosyncratic risk portfolios need not have any

particular loading on the factor being mimicked and they need only have small positive and

negative weights to insure orthogonality to the other factors.

       The remainder of this section is devoted to the evaluation of alternative methods using

the χ2 statistic (28). Tables 2 through 4 contain aggregate χ2 statistics summed over the four

subperiods, a valid procedure since sums of independent χ2 statistics are distributed χ2 as well



                                                24
and the subperiod statistics are independent by assumption. Few nontrivial differences in

performance are obscured by aggregation and we summarize any relevant ones in the text. Table

2 provides the fitted χ2 statistics based on daily data and five, ten, and fifteen factor models for

various combinations of portfolio formation procedures, estimation methods, and number of

securities in the asset universe. Table 3 presents the same statistics based on daily returns from

the subsequent five-year period to guard against any overfitting caused by using the same sample

to estimate the factor models and to compute the χ2 statistics.14 These statistics are based on a

smaller number of securities since not all securities were continuously listed during both five

year periods. Table 4 contains the same statistics computed from weekly returns in order to

mitigate any bid-ask spread bias that might inflate mean basis portfolio returns.

          Each table contains a plenitude of information. Panels A, B, and C report on 5, 10, and 15

factor models, respectively. The four columns listed at the top of each table correspond to the

four portfolio formation methods under consideration: minimum idiosyncratic risk, Fama-

MacBeth, positive weight quadratic programming, and well-diversified quadratic programming.

Eight combinations of estimation methods and numbers of securities comprise the rows of each

table: maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood factor analysis with 30, 250, and

750 securities and principal components and instrumental variables with 750 securities. The χ2

statistic for the null hypothesis that the raw and excess mean returns of the K basis portfolios are

all zero along with the associated marginal significance level (in parentheses underneath it) is

reported for each portfolio formation method, estimation method, and number of securities. The

excess returns are the difference between raw reference portfolio returns and minimum

idiosyncratic risk orthogonal portfolio returns. Note that the χ2 statistics for the excess returns of

     Hence, there are no results for the first five year period.


                                                    25
the minimum idiosyncratic risk and Fama-MacBeth portfolios are identical as noted earlier.15

        The results strongly suggest the importance of using large cross-sections to construct

basis portfolios. The 750 security basis portfolios always outperformed their 250 security

counterparts which, in turn, always dominated 30 security portfolios. The typical χ2 statistics for

250 and 750 securities were roughly twice and three times as large, respectively, as those for 30

securities. These rankings hold across estimation and portfolio formation procedures, time

periods, and observation intervals for both raw return and excess return portfolios (not all of

which are reported here). These differences increase with the number of factors in sample in the

daily data, although this finding does not persist in the weekly data or out of sample. Note that

this need not have occurred — we have found randomly selected 250 security portfolios with

larger χ2 statistics than those of 750 securities.

        For example, the χ2 statistics for the minimum idiosyncratic risk basis portfolio mean

excess returns based on unrestricted maximum likelihood factor analysis were 35.20, 81.14, and

116.88 using 30, 250, and 750 securities, respectively. The mean returns of the 30 security raw

return basis portfolios were insignificant at the ten per cent level for two out of four subperiods

in daily data while the corresponding mean excess returns were insignificant in three out of four

periods. In contrast, the 250 and 750 security raw return portfolios were highly significant at

conventional levels in all subperiods while the excess return portfolios were highly significant in

daily data for all but the five factor model in the third period.

        The four estimation methods exhibited similarly striking contrasts. Restricted maximum


15
  Recall that the Fama-MacBeth and minimum idiosyncratic risk excess return portfolio weights
are proportional where the factor of proportionality is the inverse of the average factor loading in
the one factor model. Fama-MacBeth portfolio weights tend to be much larger since the average
loading is typically much smaller than one. However, the proportionality factor cancels out in the
construction of the χ2 statistic.


                                                     26
likelihood factor analysis systematically outperformed its unconstrained counterpart in daily and

weekly data but this dominance did not persist out of sample, where they achieved almost

identical performance. Both maximum likelihood procedures consistently outperformed the less

efficient instrumental variables and principal components methods. Consider, for example, ten

factor minimum idiosyncratic risk excess return portfolio results in daily data in sample: the χ2

statistics based on restricted and unrestricted maximum likelihood factor analysis, principal

components, and instrumental variables were 143.92, 116.88, 97.88, and 82.94, respectively.

Perusal of the tables indicates that the differences in χ2 statistics across estimation methods were

typically much larger for ten and fifteen factor models than for five factor models. The

superiority of the relatively efficient maximum likelihood procedures also persisted out of

sample and in weekly data. The four estimation methods generated χ2 statistics of 53.82, 53.50,

37.13 and 39.07 out of sample and 90.33, 73.83, 53.08, and 62.48 in weekly data, respectively.

       An examination of the subperiod results mostly supports this conclusion, albeit with

some interesting intertemporal variation in performance. Principal components performed well

in-sample only in the first five year period while achieving performance comparable to the 250

security basis portfolios in the subsequent three periods. Instrumental variables provided more

consistent performance than principal components in-sample but was consistently inferior to the

more efficient estimation procedures. The out-of-sample results were broadly consistent with

these findings with some idiosyncrasies in the individual subperiods. In five factor models, the

efficient methods proved superior in the second subperiod while all methods yielded similar

performance in the first and third subperiods. In ten factor models, all methods provided similar

performance in the first and second subperiods except for the superior performance of

instrumental variables in the first and its inferior performance in the second. The efficient



                                                27
methods outperformed the inefficient methods by a wide margin in the final out-of-sample

period. Similar inconsistencies emerged in the fifteen factor runs. The methods provided similar

performance in the first out-of-sample period except for the inferior results provided by principal

components. In the second subperiod, only instrumental variables provided inferior results to the

similar performance of the other three methods. Again, the efficient methods outperformed the

inefficient methods in the final subperiod.

       The final comparisons are among the four portfolio formation methods. Minimum

idiosyncratic risk portfolios provided almost identical performance to well-diversified quadratic

programming portfolios using 750 securities and provided consistently superior performance

with 250 securities. Other observations depend on the estimation method and choice of raw or

excess returns.16 For the efficient estimation methods and raw returns, minimum idiosyncratic

risk portfolios consistently dominated Fama-MacBeth portfolios in-sample in both daily and

weekly data which, in turn, typically outperformed the positive weight quadratic programming

portfolios. For instance, the daily in-sample χ2 statistics for five factor minimum idiosyncratic

risk and Fama-MacBeth raw return portfolios based on maximum likelihood factor analysis were

131.96 and 92.28, respectively. The corresponding numbers for ten factors were 201.21 and

144.94, respectively, and for fifteen factors were 227.77 and 168.24, respectively. However,

Fama-MacBeth portfolios slightly outperformed minimum idiosyncratic risk portfolios out-of-

sample while both continued to dominate the positive weight quadratic programming portfolios.

The picture regarding the relative merits of the minimum idiosyncratic risk, Fama-MacBeth, and

quadratic programming excess return basis portfolios was virtually identical for the efficient

16
   As noted above, the minimum idiosyncratic risk and Fama-MacBeth portfolio formation
procedures yield identical χ2 statistics for excess return basis portfolios. However, the χ2 statistics




                                                  28
estimation methods. The only difference is that the positive weight quadratic programming

portfolios provided superior performance for five factor models in-sample, an improvement

which did not persist out-of-sample.

       The final question considered here is whether less efficient estimation methods or smaller

cross-sections coupled with quadratic programming provides a good substitute for more

computationally costly alternatives. With two exceptions, no such combination outperformed

minimum idiosyncratic risk portfolios of 750 securities based on efficient estimates. Both

exceptions involve five factor excess return portfolios in-sample in daily data. First, positive

weight quadratic programming portfolios based on instrumental variables estimates yielded a χ2

statistic of 77.64 compared to 64.40 obtained from minimum idiosyncratic risk portfolios based

on unrestricted maximum likelihood estimates. Second, 250 security quadratic programming

portfolios based on efficient estimates outperformed 750 security minimum idiosyncratic risk

basis portfolios in-sample. Neither result obtained out-of-sample.

       6. Conclusion

       This paper has provided a comprehensive examination of the merits of different basis

portfolio formation strategies. The analysis involved the main factor model estimation and

portfolio formation methods proposed in the literature as well as some that have not been

considered previously. In addition, this study provided a detailed evaluation of the impact of

increases in the number of securities underlying the analysis. The result is a detailed set of data

measuring the performance of excess and raw return basis portfolios both in and out of sample

over a variety of time periods and observation frequencies.

       Three conclusions emerge from the examination of the more than 2300 statistics reported


of the raw return basis portfolios are relevant if excess returns are computed with respect to a


                                                29
on in this document. First, increasing the number of securities included in the analysis

dramatically improves basis portfolio performance with 750 security factor models proving

markedly superior to those involving 30 or 250 securities. Second, comparatively efficient

estimation procedures such as unrestricted and restricted maximum likelihood factor analysis

significantly outperform the less efficient instrumental variables and principal components

procedures. In particular, less efficient estimation methods typically performed as well as

maximum likelihood factor analysis with 250 securities. Third, the minimum idiosyncratic risk

portfolio formation procedure proposed in the second section outperformed both the Fama-

MacBeth and positive weight quadratic programming portfolios and proved equal to or better

than the more expensive well-diversified quadratic programming procedure. The Fama-MacBeth

procedure, the dominant method in the literature, yielded poorly diversified portfolios that

provided inferior performance in this context, albeit performance that can be improved upon with

more appropriate factor model normalizations. In sum, if an investigator had to choose one basis

portfolio formation strategy from the formidable list considered here, the clear winner is

minimum idiosyncratic risk portfolios coupled with maximum likelihood factor analysis of 750

securities.
