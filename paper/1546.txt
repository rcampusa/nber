                         Trade Restrictions as
                       Facilita ting Prac tices


                               ABSTRACT




       This paper deals with the effect of trade restrictions on compe-
  tition In Ol1gopolIstc markets. Quantitative
                                                  restrictions, such as
 VER's (Voluntary Export Restrictions) are shown to affect the extent
 to which foreign firms can
                            compete in the domestic market, and hence
 to raise the equilibrium prices and
                                       profits of both domestic and for—
 eign firms — when such    restrictions are not too severe. This increase
 in   prices and profits is shown to make it unlikely for VER's to raise
 National Welfare. In addition, I show
                                       that domestic output may fall
 due to the VER's. For these
                             reasons, VER's do not seem to be desir-
 able ways of restricting imports.
     Tariffs and Quotas are also shown to be non—equivalent in such
oligopoly models. A comparison of the effects of tariffs and quotas shows
that it would be in the interest of domestic manufacturers t lobby for
VER's instead of import equivalent tariffs. In addition, it is shown that
the foreign firm would prefer VER's to import equivalent tariffs, even if
tariff revenues were refunded to them Thus, the recent VER'S on Japanese
automobiles may well have been in the interests of both Japanese and Merican
firms, and at the expense of the nation as a whole.

 I.   Introduction

       The analysis of trade restrictions has focused on their effects in the

 polar cases of monopoly and competition, and hence, has neglected their

 possible effects on the nature of strategic interaction between firms.

 Interactions between firms are crucial in oligopolistic situations and when

 the nature of interaction between firms is affected, the consequences of

 "slight" restrictions are profound.

      Voluntary export restraints (VER's) have been
                                                      increasingly used to
 restrict imports recently. I show that when firms compete in prIces,
                                                                      such
 restraints alter the nature of interaction
                                              between firms in a Collusive
direction and thereby raise (the
                                   equilibrjn) prices and profits of all
fjrms. Hence, trade restrictions can impose on firms the collusion

they themselves were unable to achieve —   that   is, they can act as
facilitating practices. VER's affect the market, not because they are set

at restrictive levels, but because they impede the ability of firms to

compete effectively.

      The increase in foreign profits due to a VER is shown to make it

unlikely for a VER to raise domestic welfare. In addition, tariffs are

shown to be fundamentally non—equivalent to quotas as quotas affect the

nature of strategic interaction between firms, while tariffs do not. This

is the analogue in oligopolistjc markets of Bhagwati's2 famous result for

the case of domestic monopoly.

2. The Model
       The simplest model which permits me to show how a trade restriction
                                                                is used. There are assumed to be two

firms, one home and one foreign, who produce differentiated products which

are substitutes for each other, and compete in prices in the domestic

product market3. The equilibrium concept is that of Nash Equilibrium.
                                                                                  *
       Let   P be the price of the home products and P that of the foreign
                                    *              **                                 **
one.    Similarly let Q(P ,                 P),   Q (P , P)         and C(Q), C (Q ) be the demand

functions and cost functions facing the home and foreign firms

respectively. Thus,
                           *                        *                         *
                                   p) = PQ        (P ,      P) —   C (Q (P ,      P))

                                             ** *
                                   P) = PQ (P , P) —
                                                                    ***
                                                                   C (Q (P ,       P))

are their profit functions.
                          *                                                                    *
        For any given P (P ) denote the profit maximizing price P (P) that
                                          *        *
the    foreign (home) firm can charge by B (P) (B(P )). These constitute the

best response on the part of a firm to any price set by its competitor. By

definition, the Nash equilibrium is given by the pair (p,p*) which
                       *                *                   *
                                                                = P.
satisfies     both B (P) = P                 and B (P )

        I will assume that a unique stable Nash equilibrium exists4. In
                                                                              strictly concave in their
particular, I assume that profit functions are
                5
 own price alone , and that best response functions are upward sloping.
                                                                          *                          *
                                                            level of P such
        Diagram 1 illustrates the equilibrium. B (P) is the
                                                                    the foreign firm is reached, given
 that the highest iso—profit contour for
                                                                                  contours of the foreign
 the domestic firm charges P. Hence, iso—profit
                              *
 firm   are horizontal along B (P). Similarly, the domestic firm's iso—profit
                                                    *
 contours     are vertical along B(P ).                         Profits   are assumed to increase in the

 competitors' price, which defines the direction in which higher profit
                                                    3

  contours are reached. B*(P) is steeper that B(P*) to ensure stability.

  The equilibrjn is at the intersection of B(P*        *
                                                ) and B (P) denoted by the
  point (P
               *N PN) in
                   ,        Diagram 1.

         In order to specify how a VER affects the equilibri, it is
                                                                                       necessary
  to examine how it affects the best
                                                    responses of both firms. As these
  depend on how their profit functions
                                                        are affected, we must first
                                                                                      carefully
  examine how the latter are affected by a VER.

         First consider the foreign firm's
                                                         profit function when it is
 constrained to sell no more that "R". At
                                                              prices (p*, P), such that R
 Q*(p*       P),   the constraint is just binding. For a given P and R, let
  *
 P (P1 R) be such that this
                                 constraint is just binding. The set of such
 prices                                            *
             is depicted in Diagram 2 by the line P P when R is set at the
                                                                           free
 trade   level of imports. At all points above PP the constraint is
                                                                      *
                                                                                       strictly
                                     *
 binding.      At points below P P, the constraint is not binding.

        The foreign firms iso—profit
                                                 contours in the presence of a VER are
                                     *
 thus   vertical lines above P P because its
                                                              profits are independent of the
domestic firm's price in this region                               *
                                     as the VER is binding. Below P P,
they    are unaffected by the existence of a VER. They have a kink along P* P

as shown in Diagram 2.

        In                       *                        *
             the region where P P lies below B (P), this kink makes P*(P,R) the

best response function for the
                               foreign firm in the presence of a VER. In
the region where P*P lies above B *(P), its
                                            best response function is
unaltered. This is illustrated in Diagram 2, where the dark line,

B (P. R) is the best
                             response function of the foreign firm Lwiith the VER.
Hence, formally:

                        B   (P. R) = P (P, R)
                                             *                    *           *
                                                              if P (P. R) ) B (P)
                                         = B* (P)                *            *
                                                              if P (P. R) < B (P).

     Now we turn to how the domestic firm's profits are affected by a VER
                                                    *
                                          the line P P then the demand for
on the foreign firm. If prices lie above
                                            the level of the VER. Hence, at these
the foreign firm's product exceeds
                                                                     would
prices some consumers of the foreign product would be rationed. This

affect the demand for the domestic firms product.             A natural way of

specifying the relationship between rationing in one market and its

spillover effects in another is to introduce arbitrage. If the firms

charge prices such that the demand for the foreign good exceeds R, there is

room for arbitrage profits to be made. Assume that if demand exceeds R, it

is as if the entire stock of the foreign good is thrown on the market for

what it will bring. Consumers lucky enough to get the foreign good at the

price charged, make profits by selling the good at a price that clears the

market. As the income effects of such transactions are assumed away, the

effect on the domestic firms demand is exactly what it would have been, if

the foreign firm was actually charging the price that cleared the market.
                        *                          firm, and VER at level R, define
For any price, P charged by the foreign
      *                                               that makes demand for the
P(P       ,   R) as the price of the domestic product

 foreign good equal R.

              This is illustrated in Diagram 2. If the domestic firm
                                                               demand for
 charges the price P and the foreign one charges the price P ,
                                                       fortunate enough to get the foreign good
 the foreign product exceeds R. Consumers

 sell it for what the market will bear, P(P, R). Thus, if prices charged are

 P and P and Q (P P) > R, the price that enters the domestic firm's demand

 function is P (P, R) and not P . Also, if the foreign firm charges
                  *
 price,          P the domestic one can make the constraint bind on it by raising
                                                   *
 the       price of the domestic good above P(P ,R). Hence, the profit function

 for the domestic firm, r (p ,
                                 R*    p,   R), is now:
                                                                  J

                   R *                      *                                   *
                   (p ,   p.   R)      rr(p ,       p)                if p < P(P ,R),
                                                     *
                                       =   ir (P (P. R), P)                                          *
                                                                                        if p > P(P        R)


           The next question is how the best
                                        response of the domestic firm to any

foreign firm would no longer enter the domestic firm's demand function, as

all demand for the foreign product cannot be met due to the VER. The

firm can make the VER bind on the foreign firm, it chooses to do so only if

the foreign firm's price is low. If the foreign products price is high

enough, it will not be in the interest of the domestic firm to make the

 restriction bind. Hence, the best response of the domestic firm to any

price charged by its competitor is given by:

   Proof: Follows from Diagram 3. A
                                          more formal proof is relegated to the
   appendix.

          The non—existence of
                                 pure strategy equilibria can be
                                                                        understood by noting
   that a quantitatjy
                         restriction acts like a
                                                        capacity constraint on the
   foreign firm. The non—existence of a Bertrand_Nash
                                                               equilibrj in pure
   strategies in the presence of
                                     capacity constraints has been known since
  Edgeworth's classic criticism of Bertrand.9 Of
                                                   course, mixed strategy
  equilibria can be shown to
                              exist under very general conditions.10
  However, the mere existence
                               of mixed strategy equilibrj does not yield
  any information about the effects
                                     of a VER. The form of the
                                                                mixed strategy
  equi1jbj needs to be characterized in order to
                                                 get such information. We
  turn to this next.

         Before we begin, notice
                                   that although the domestic firm's profit
  function is non—concave in
                                 its own price, so that while it may be in its
 interest to randomize its
                           prices, the foreign firm's profit function
 remains concave in the price — even
                                     if the domestic firm chooses to use a
 mixed strategy — as
                     a convex combination of
                                             concave functions remains
 concave. Thus, it is never in the interest of the
                                                    foreign firm to use a
mixed strategy, and the foreign firm will
                                          always choose to charge Only one
price. If the foreign firm
                            charges only one price, the domestic firm will
                   *      *
only randomize if P = i' . In
                               this case, it would randomize over P , P       HL
— which
        give it equal profit. These
                                     strategies are a natural candidate for
the equilibr


     The unique mixed
                        strategy equilibr consists of the foreign firm
P , and the domestic one                                                             charging

         With Theorem 2 in hand, it
                                              is possible to analyze the effects of a
VER.

Theorem 3: The imposition of a VER                 at   or close to the free trade levels
raises both firms prices and

rise, domestic output may rise or fall.

Proof: Notice that a VER at the free trade level raises

       The expected profits of the foreign firm also rise.

         3.A Stecial Case

                                              It is useful to consider this
termed that of "no spillovers" in demand.

However, although unlikely, it seems possible

with each other locallIV. A possible argument is as follows.

     Market demand consists of aggregated individual demands. Some
                                           substitute good when rationed, while
individuals may choose to purchase the

others may not. If there is no resale, the effect of a ration in one

market, on the demand in the other, depends on which consumers get the

 rationed good. If consumers who substitute between products are assigned
                                             demand falls on a numeraire good

 because of any belief in its realism, but because it allows me to isolate

 one effect of a VER from the other.     Even with this assumption, a VER close

 to the free trade level can be shown to raise both firms profits.

 stable in the presence of a VER, a VER set slightly below the free trade

 level must raise both firms profits and prices.

                                  foreign firm. Thus, the VER only makes the
  foreign firm's best response function
                                        into B (P,R), as discussed earlier.
  Hence, a VER at the free trade
                                             levels will have no effect on the

 shaded area in Diagram 1, which
                                 is Precisely the region of greater profits
 for both firms. Both firms
                             are on higher iso—profit contours in the shaded
 region         than under free trade. Also, as B(P *)              is   upward sloping, prices
 must rise as well.


 4. The Effects of Tariffs and_Quotas

     The analysis of the previous section allows us to
                                                       compare the effects
of a VER or quota with those
                             of an import equivalent tariff.  It is shown
that:          (1) Prices under a tariff are lower than those under the VER
                                                                            set at
the post tariff import levels.
                                            (2) The profits of the domestic firm are
also higher under the VER; (3) If the VER is set close to the
                                                                free trade
level of output, it will be
                            preferred by the foreign firm to no
restrictions   In addition, the foreign firm
                                                                would prefer the Y to the
tariff, even if the tariff
                                      revenues were returned to it as a lump sum.
       A tariff (when costs
                                     are positive)12 moves the foreign firm's
reaction function to the right13
                                            as in Diagram 5. The analysis
comparing a VER to an equivalent tariff
                                                         is similar to that comparing a VER
at the Nash equilibrium level, to the equilibrium in the absence of any

restriction. To substantiate the first point1 compare the level of domestic

                               restriction set at the level of imports induced
prices under a quantitative

by a tariff, and the tariff.     The former are greater than the latter.
                                 *                              function of the
This is shown in Diagram 5. B (p,t) is the best response
foreign firm with the tariff, and RT is the level of imports with the
                          R *
tariff.   B (P, R1,) and B (P , RT) are the best responses of the foreign and

domestic firms respectively in the presence of a VER at the level of

imports prevailing under the tariff at rate t.        The notation used in

Diagram 5 corresponds to that previously introduced for examining the
                          L          H              T
effect of a VER. Both p and p            are above p , the price of the home

good with the tariff. Also, p is greater that p             the price of the

foreign good with the tariff. Thus, prices are greater under the VER than

under the import equivalent tariff.

     It is also easy to see that the domestic firm's profits are higher

under the VER as compared to their level under the tariff, as Vt          is


greater than
     The foreign firm's profits must rise due to a VER as long as the VER

 is not too severe. As shown, the profits of the foreign firm must rise if

 the restriction is set at the free trade level. As its profits are

 strictly greater with a VER at the free trade level, continuity arguments

 show that they should remain so when Rt is close to the free trade output

 level.

      In addition, even if revenues of the tariff were returned to the firm

 as a lump sum transfer, the foreign firm would prefer a VER to a tariff.

 This is due to the equilibrium profits of the foreign firm with the VER

 being greater that its profits if the domestic firm randomized between           p"
      L     as given, and it charged p          This is because it could have

  charged            but
             p   ,         chose not to.   If it had charged p     ,   it   would have
  earned p*tRt which is exactly the
                                                total price paid by consumers in the
 tariff regime, or what the foreign firm would get if tariff
                                                             revenues were
 returned to it in a lump sum.

      It is Obvious that had we assumed that there were
                                                                        "spillovers in
 demand" —   that    a tariff and a quota at the level
                                                             of imports generated by the
 tariff would lead to the same level of domestic prices. Tariffs
                                                                                 and quotas
 would be equivalent. However, this is
                                                       true in general.
      My results show that tariffs
                                           and quotas are fundamentally
 nonequivalent in the case of
                                     Oligopoljsjc markets, because of their
different impacts on the way firms compete in the market.

     The
                                                of tariffs and quotas is an old issue
in trade theory. Bhagwati (1969) pointed out that
                                                  tariffs and quotas are
not equivalent in the
                      presence of monopoly elements. This section extended
his results to Oligopolistic markets.

     Itoh and Ono (1982) consider
                                           the effect of a quota on the
                                                                              desirability
of being the Stackelberg leader
                                       in a duopoly, Itoh and Ono (1984) claim that
tariffs and quotas are
                              equivalent, but considers .Qy the case of no
spillovers in demand. This is
                               an extreme assumption and best viewed only
as a hypothetical case that allows
                                   us to abstract from the effect of a
quantitat restriction on interaction
                                        between firms. As such it is only
of interest when compared to the no spiliovers case,

 the first best policy. (See Brander and Spencer (1982) and

 a discussion of such profit shifting effects.)

         Notice, however, that as a VER causes both firms' profits to rise,

                                                to domestic firms. Thus, the

     more than compensated for by
                                              welfare would have to fall as well.

     welfare to fall due to a VER is that world welfare fall when both prices

        Although               the intuition for VER's to be

  formal argument is useful. This is provided next.

  Theorem 5:   If both firms' profits rise due to a VER,
                                                         and world welfare
  decreases when both prices
                             increase, national welfare must fall. Domestic
  output must rise due to the VER for it
                                                                                    to be possible that national welfare
 also rises.

Thus, expected national welfare with a VER                                            is   given by:

      Another argument made in favor of VER's is that they create employment

 analysis shows that employment may fall due to a VER.

      A third argument made in favor of VER's is a more sophisticated one.

 It adapts the old infant industry arguments to a mature economy. The

 argument is that a mature economy subjected

 oil—crisis) needs time to adapt its products (cars) and increase the

 competitiveness of its products relative to (Japanese) imports. VER's are

 a temporary measure to buy that time. However, VER's raise domestic

 profits, which is likely to make unions more aggressive in their demands,

 which would make it harder for domestic products to compete effectively in
                14

from an examination of history that

                               domestic producers so that the restrictions

                                                             are import
equivalent, because of the anti—competitive
                                            nature of the former. For this
reason, such proposals should be viewed

 Proof:             It                          H
                         is enough to show that P is greater than

 sets profits of the domestic firm                                at   the level V is convex in P. It
 reaches a minimum                  at   P .        Therefore,
                                                                        * H

 greater           than P .         This means that P(P , R) is less than P H.                                  *

stable in the presence of a VER,                                a VER set   slightly below the free

    This is negative, as the denominator is negative if the

    and the numerator is         Positive.     Thus, the domestic firm's profits rise
whenever R falls.

 restriction depends on how competitively firms         behave
                                                       and the form of
 the restriction. For example, a restriction on market shares when firms
 compete in quantities has a similar effect to a restriction on output
 (or market share) when firms compete on prices, as they all affect the
 nature of interaction between firms. The importance of the strategic
 variable for policy is also brought out in Eaton and Grossman (1983).

             See Bhagwati (1969).

        If goods are produced at constant marginal and average costs, and
 there is no possibility of profitable resale in between markets, firms
 may compete in other markets as well. I will also assume that a numeraire
 good exists and hence, that there are no income effects.

             For    conditions sufficient to ensure this see Friedman           (1981).

demand functions may lead to non—concave profit functions — as

          It is assumed, in other words, that 1T(p *(P,R), P) has a unique

       This is because the domestic firms profit function becomes non—

foreign good rises as well — profits rise even more. As this argument
can be repeated, no maximum to the above profit function can exist.

      10    If the strategy sets (the prices that can be charged) are assumed

to   be non—empty and• compact, existence is ensured by Glicksburg'S theorem
                                                                    and
as profit functions remain continuous despite the VER. See Dasgupta
Maskin (1982).

          An example of a linear model that satisfies these assumptions is
 that   of GabszewicZ and Thisse (1979), also used by Shaked and Sutton (1982).

     12 If costs were zero, the presence of a tariff would not affect the

 reaction function of firm 1, as the               profit
                                            function facing the foreign

 firm with a tariff would be a monotonic transformation of the profit
 function in the absence of one.


        13 If a tariff at rate t        is   imposed, the revenue of the foreign firm,

     it sets a market price of p , is (1—t)p Q (p* ,p) . Note that the

                  *                                  *     t) which is

                    **         ***
 equal to p (1—t)Q (p , p) c (Q (p , p)). Maximizing this with respect
             *                      —

        *
 to   p gives the first order condition

                      11   (p*, p, t)
                                             = 0

 Totally differentiating the first order conditions gives:

                                + 1112dp + 1113dt = 0.
                      1111dp

Therefore,        the change        in      p (or p) as t changes when p (or p *)             is
 fixed is given by:

the   reaction function of the foreign firm moves to the right as in

              example of a linear model that satisfies these assumptions is
