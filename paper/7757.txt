       At the turn of the 21st Century the US economy is the envy of the world. It is the

envy of the world because throughout the 1990s it has generated higher employment and

lower unemployment without inflation than most other advanced countries. In early 2000

the unemployment rate in the US fell below 4 percent -- lower than in Japan or Germany

and other EU countries, which have traditionally had lower unemployment than the US.

The employment population rate in the US was at an all-time peak. Full employment was

accompanied by a federal budget surplus, successful movement of welfare mothers to

work, a booming stock market, and reduction in crime. From 1996 to 2000, moreover,

real GDP rose by over 4.0% per year while throughout the 1990s recover, productivity in

manufacturing grew more rapidly than in most other advanced countries.

       Economists and policy makers did not anticipate the success of the US in these

areas. In the mid-1990s the Federal Reserve thought that an unemployment rate below 6

percent would set off rising inflation. The government (‚ÄúBill and Newt‚Äù) believed that

the only way to reduce the federal budget deficit was to adjust downard the consumer

price index to limit social security payments. Most experts feared that the welfare

reforms of 1996 would create disaster for unskilled single mothers and their children and

no one expected crime to fall. Longterm forecasts of US economic growth posited

modest increases in productivity, in line with post-oil shock patterns.

       The US economy surpassed expectations by enough to suggest that the US might

just have developed what afficionados of the new economy have claimed: the right mix

of institutions and policies to assure full employment and sizeable productivity gains for

the foreseeable future. If the US maintains these successes over the next 5 to 15 years


                                             1
and if persistent full employment reduces poverty and narrows the economic inequalities

that have marred US economic performance, even the sharpest critics of the US model

will have a hard time finding fault.

       But perhaps the US economic performance at the outset of the 21st century is

more a matter of luck than of the right economic institutions. Associated with the US

boom is an unprecedented rise in consumer debt and balance of payments deficit and an

extroardinary stock market bubble, none of which can continue ad finitum. The US

economy could just as readily come back to earth as the exemplar capitalist models of the

1970s and 1980s, Japan and Germany, and the 1960s-1970s third way ideal, Sweden, as

continue along its new full employment prosperity.

       The claim that the US (or any other economy) has found the best form of

capitalism for the modern world rests on the notion that there is a single peak capitalist

economic model. But does the economic world indeed have a single peak set of

institutions or does it allow for diversity? Section I develops criterion for judging

whether any economy is truly a peak and assesses which of these the US meets or does

not meet. Section II argues that the key features of the US job market that contributes to

economic success are not, as many believe, deregulation and high rising inequality but

rather expansion of opportunities for women and the growth of new ‚Äúshared capitalist‚Äù

institutions. Section III shows that US full employment is improving US performance in

the one area where the US economy has done poorest: distributing the gains of economic

growth to all persons.

1. Single Peaked vs Diverse Capitalism


                                             2
        Behind the claim or belief that the US or any other country has developed the

ideal form of capitalism for the 21st century is the notion that economic outcomes are

related to institutions and policies according to a single-peaked social maximand. When

institutions or policies produce a single peak in the space of social outcomes, one set of

arrangements is indeed the global optimum. This is shown in the first landscape in

exhibit 1. The horizontal axis measures institutions along some general dimension (such

as centralization of wage-setting or the role of unions or the state in economic decision-

making) while the vertical axis represents aggregate output (GDP per capita or some

variant thereof). In the first landscape the set of institutions N (for nirvana) produces the

highest output and every move in the direction of N raises well-being. It behooves all

economies to adopt the nirvana institutions as quickly as they can.

        But there is nothing in economic logic that rules out very different institution-

outcome landscapes. One alternative is a landscape with multiple peaks separated by

valleys. Some of the multiple peaks may have similar heights, so that different

institutional arrangements produce the same well-being, but most peaks are local optima,

separated from higher optima by valleys that make it costly to change. The peak

economy might have better outcomes than others, but it may not be worthwhile for

countries with slightly lower outcomes to invest in change by going down from their

peak.

        It is also possible that different institutions produce similar levels of output, with

little cost to changing them. This produces the flat peak in exhibit 1 This is a Coasian

world where institutions reflect different property arrangements and where side payments


                                               3
guarantee that whatever the arrangements, the economy reaches an efficient outcome.

This diagram predicts similar GDP per capita (other social maximands) within a wide

range of arrangements. Each country can do it ‚Äúits own way‚Äù without suffering any

economic penalty.

       Belief in a single peaked outcome function (whatever the outcome and its

arguments) is deeply ingrained in economics. Models of optimizing behavior assume

convex functions so that first derivatives yield the maximizing conditions and second

derivatives or matrices thereof have the appropriate sign. Even if individuals choose

blindly, a single peaked function will generate budget constraints so that those who pick

institutions around the peak do better and eventually increase their share of markets.

Marxian analysis also takes a single-peaked view of capitalism, predicting the growth of

monopolies and proletariat in all countries.

       In recent years globalization and the spread of information age technology have

led observers on both the right and left toward a single-peaked view of the world. When

the right argues for labor market flexibility or deregulation or privatization or contraction

of the welfare state, it often claims that these are the only ways to attain efficiency in the

modern world. When the left worries about social dumping, a race to the bottom, and

trade-induced impoverishment of low skilled workers, it does so from the same

perspective: that there is only one efficient way to operate a capitalist economy.

       But there is a case for diversified capitalism as well. Since the end of World War

II living standards in advanced capitalist economies with differing institutions have

converged. The coefficient of variation of GDP per capita, measured in purchasing power


                                               4
parity terms, among 18 major OECD countries has declined over time as Japan and EU

countries have closed much of the Post-World War II gap with the US. Comparative

advantage argues for diversity. If Germany can operate a tripartite social partners model

of capitalism better than the US while the US is more adept at a high

mobility/decentralized wage-setting model, Germany will do better with its system than

to mimic the US system and conversely. Game theory teaches us that interactive

decision-making creates many potential outcomes, with institutional rules or norms

determining equilibrium (Kreps). This is more consistent with multiple or flat peaks --

diversity -- rather than single peak optima.

       What factors might help us determine which landscape best describes the

economics world, and whether the US or some other economy represent the economic

peak? Exhibit 2 lists seven factors that differentiate peak landscapes from other

landscapes and that thus can guide any assessment of whether any economy has achieved

peak status.

       The first criterion for a single peak landscape is that the peak economy does better

than other economies in various dimensions of aggregate economic performance. Over

the long run, the natural measure of aggregate performance is GDP per capita or GDP per

hour worked. But in any given period, the link between observed outcomes and long

term GDP per capita or per hour is unclear. If there was general agreement how to weigh

the impact on long term production of outcomes like inflation, balance of payments,

unemployment, fiscal deficits, etc we could form a single weighted average, as some

analysts do with so-called misery indices of various forms. But there is no such general


                                               5
agreement. Some believe that inflation is the vampire‚Äôs kiss and thus place great weight

on inflation, while others weigh unemployment more heavily. Rather than argue over

particular weights on aggregate performanc, let us just stipulate that the peak economy

must do better on various dimensions of aggregate performance.

       The second criterion is distributional. The peak economy should produce higher

incomes throughout much of the income distribution than competing economies. If one

economy produces higher outcomes at all points in the income distribution, we would

judge it as having a higher peak. Beyond that, there is no universally accepted weighting

of distributions. Rawls values how the poorest fare; your local billionaire may value how

the richest fare; while political economy considerations suggests that the middle of the

distribution is important. My criterion for higher incomes throughout much of the

distribution is a way of saying that distributional factors must enter any assessment.

       The third criterion relates to the stability of the single peak over time. The

economy with peak institutions must dominate other economies for at least a decade or

so. Given that candidates for the peak, such as the US, are likely to have high income per

capita, and that other economies can take advantage of catch-up, I do not require that the

peak economy grow more rapidly than other economies, only that it maintain an edge on

outcomes over an extended period.

       The fourth and fifth criterion relates to the convexity of the landscape space. As

exhibit 1 shows, N* lies at the top of a mountain, so that movements toward N* raise

well-being. Neighbors with characteristics close to those of N* should also have good

social outcomes; and copying this or that feature of the single peak economy ought to


                                             6
raise social outcomes.

       The sixth criterion relates to large changes in institutions. Since there is only one

peak, large-scale changes in policies or institutions toward peak institutions ought to be

relatively costless. An economy that chooses radical reform ought to see economic

improvements, not retrogression relative to others.

       The seventh criterion refers to changes over time If the single peak hypothesis is

correct, and if countries seek to improve the economic well-being of their citizens with

sensible policies, the peak should be an attractor in institution-outcome space. They

should imitate the features of the peak economy. By contrast, economies that, for

whatever reason, move away from peak institutions should suffer losses of economic

well-being

US performance

       How well does the this decade‚Äôs candidate for peak economy, the US, fare by

these criterion?

       The US fulfills some of the criterion for peak economy but fails others. It has

produced sufficiently high employment-population rates and hours worked per employed

adult and low unemployment rates for enough years to be the peak economy on this front

(See columns 1-3 of Exhibit 3). The US has had lower unemployment than the EU for

roughly a decade or so, though it had higher unemployment than Japan until 1998. Using

employment to population rates, US success dates back to the 1980s or mid-1970s. In

1973 the US and OECD-Europe had the same employment-population rate. Since then

the US rate has risen while the European rate has fallen to produce a 16 point differential


                                             7
in 1998!.

       But not until the late 1990s did the US outperform other economies in growth of

GDP per capita or productivity and it trailed the others in growth of real compensation

over the same period. Output per hour worked in the US was roughly on a par with

output per hour worked in Germany, France, and some smaller EU countries in the 1990s

(Freeman, 1996; Conference Board; Mckinsey Institute) and has grown more slowly than

in most other advanced countries since the 1970s. The Economist has argued that ‚Äúif

Germany and Japan can grow as fast (faster in the actual data) as America even when

their incentives are blunted by an inflexible model, imagine what they might do were

their economies to be set free.‚Äù(April 10, p. 20). But it is the rapid growth of

productivity in the US in the late 1990s, not a tortured interpretation of the US‚Äôs slower

productivity, that strengthens the case for the US as peak economy.

       Whether this growth performance is sustainable is, to be sure, highly debatable.

The US has a low savings rate, but manages a reasonable investment to GDP ratio

because it attracts considerable foreign capital and runs a large trade deficit. The US has

an extremely productive research and development sector, and more venture capital than

other countries, which should increase longterm economic performance But it also has a

huge consumer debt. The US has a highly educated work force, but its lead has fallen

relative to other advanced countries; and US workers have lower scores on adult literacy

tests than workers in most advanced countries.

       Even if rapid productivity growth can be maintained, the US has one major

problem in meeting the criterion for peak economy status. This relates to the


                                             8
distributional criterion for judging a candidate peak economy. As Exhibit 4 shows, while

the US is # 1 in per capita income, it is # 13 in per capita income for those in the lower

decile of earnings. It is not until the 30th to 40th decile that the US surpasses most other

advanced countries in per capita income. In addition, the fact that Americans work so

much more than citizens of other countries implies that the US advantage in living

standards is less than indicated by GDP per capita. Greater hours worked per adult

means less leisure, so that any social value function that weighted leisure would bring EU

countries closer to the US in overall economic well-being. With hours per worker and

per adult rising in the US relative to other countries, moreover, the US advantage in

living standards actually eroded over the past twenty or so years.

       In short, US performance has been clearly superior for an extended period on one

outcome: full employment; and has been superior for a short period on one other

outcome, productivity; but falls short of peak status on distributional grounds.

Other economies‚Äô performance

       According to the peak economy view of the economic landscape, the peak

economy‚Äôs closest economic neighbors should also do well while economies that adopt

peak economy institutions should improve their relative economic position. The view of

the US as peak economy fails both of these criteria.

       Close neighbors refers to neighbors in institution space, not in geography, but in

fact the US‚Äôs closest geographic neighbor, Canada, is also its closest institutional

neighbor. The 1990s was a period of economic disaster for Canada. In 1990 Canada

stood third in the GDP per capita league tables, below Switzerland and the US, but


                                             9
sufficiently above most EU countries to support the notion that North American

institutions generated higher average living standards than those in other advanced

countries In 1997, following a decade of economic decline/stagnation Canada had fallen

in the league tables to 7th position. One interpretation of the disparate performances of

the US and Canada is that the small differences between the two countries matters a lot,

and that Canada has just not gone far enough toward the US model. Alternatively, some

argue that Canada suffered from eggregious macro-economic policy. But the broader

interpretation is that institutions-outcome landscape does not fit the single peak

paradigm. Countries with similar institutions can do quite differently in any given time

period.

          In the European Union, the UK is generally viewed as the economy most similar

to the US, and the reforms enacted by the Thatcher, Major, and Blair governments have

brought the UK even closer to the American model. Has this improved the position of

the UK in the league per capita income tables? No. In 1980 the UK was 16th out of in

the league tables; in 1997 it was 18th (US Bureau of the Census, table 1363). Perhaps the

UK was not radical enough. Mrs. Thatcher‚Äôs reforms never touched the National Health

Service, did not reduce the ratio of tax revenues to GDP to US levels, and left macro-

economic monetary policy in the hands of the government rather than the Bank of

England. Perhaps without the reforms the UK would have fallen further in the league

tables. But again, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the institutions-outcome space

does not fit the single peak model.




                                             10
       Outside Europe, the economy which has undertaken the most radical reforms is

New Zealand. New Zealand deregulated much of its labor market, freed its central bank

from political control, and introduced a variety of free trade measures. It out-Thatchered

Mrs T. With what result? In 1997 New Zealand ranked last in per capita income among

advanced OECD countries with an income per capita 14% below that of its natural pair,

Australia. In 1980 New Zealand was also last among the countries, with an income per

capita 19 percent below that of Australia. Extenuating circumstances may explain the

failure of radical reform to produce the expected outcomes. New Zealand had such

serious problems prior to its reforms that absent the reforms it might have fallen even

further. New Zealand may have screwed its monetary policy so badly that its labor and

product market reforms had no chance to bring about recovery. Perhaps, but once more a

simpler explanation is that the single peak landscape vision of capitalism is wrong.

       What about the seventh criterion -- the predicted movement of economies toward

the peak institutional form? As there are many factors that differentiate the US model

from others, it is difficult to determine whether economies are in fact becoming

Americanized. In one readily measurable dimension, the extent of unionization and

collective bargaining coverage, they are not becoming more like the US. Exhibit 5 shows

that union density and collective bargaining coverage rates diverged across OECD

countries between 1980 and 1997. If the countries which moved further from the US on

this dimension did especially poorly in GDP per capita, we might reconcile this pattern

with a single peaked world (they screwed up), but the data do not show such a pattern.

Sweden fell in per capita income but so too did New Zealand.


                                            11
       Finally, it is important to recognize that few analysts regarded the US as the peak

economy until the mid or late 1990s. For much of the 1970s and 1980s, the 900 pound

gorilla on the economic scene was Japan. American business was frightened by

Japanese economic performance -- recall Ezra Vogel‚Äôs Japan as Number One, or the best-

selling business book The Book of the Rings by the 14th century Samurai warrior

Musashi Musashi. The early Clinton Administration looked jealously at some German

institutions and sought to expand the US welfare state through mandated health

insurance. Major business school thinkers bemoaned Anglo-Saxon short termism in

capital markets and saw virtue in Japanese or German banking and ownership patterns

(Porter). Going back further, analysts in the 1970s thought that corporatist arrangements

were a better way to fight inflation than US style decentralized wage and price setting

(Bruno and Sachs).

       In short, the safest reading of the empirical evidence is that the institution-

outcome space does not fit a single peak landscape but rather that the set of institutions

that performs best varies with economic circumstance. The US may have found the right

institutional mix for long term economic success, but the case is far from proven, and the

history of capitalist economies post World War II should make even afficianados of

capitalism, US style, cautious in their reading of the late 1990s. In any case, whether the

US has found nirvana institutions on a single peak landscape or not, , it is important to

understand, as best we can at this time, what economic institutions have in fact

contributed to the 1990s success of the American Model.

                         II US Institutions and Employment Creation


                                             12
   Many observeres believe that the US employment success results from a non-

regulated labor market and high and rising wage inequality. The absence of regulations

allows firms to make more efficient use of its work force, be it through down-sizing or

out-sourcing or otherwise changing work or pay arrangements. From this perspective,

America has paid for its employment creation through falling real wages and conditions

of work.

   This view is erroneous. The US labor market is not an unregulated laissez-faire

paradise (or hell, depending on your view). The US has not paid for its job creation with

wage inequality. Rather, the US job market has contributed to the country‚Äôs economic

success by opening employment opportunities for female workers at an unprecedented

rate and by developing new ‚Äúshared capitalist‚Äù institutions that increase employee

decision-making and financial stake in firms.

The US job market is not unregulated

   The view that the U.S. job market is largely unregulated is fallacious. The US has a

considerable corpus of labor law covering everything from hours worked to occupational

health and safety to protection of minorities and women. It has enough administrative

and judicial rulings interpreting these laws to fill volumes and create employment for

thousands of lawyers. For the most part, however, US laws protect workers as

individuals rather than as members of a collective or group Consider the following brief

chronology of US job market regulations:

   1960s/1970s legislation regulating treatment of discriminated groups: The Equal

Pay Act of 1963, Civil Rights Act of 1964, amended in 1972; Age Discrimination Act of


                                            13
1967; Executive Order 11246 requiring affirmative action including numeric goals and

timetables in increasing utilization of women and minorities;

   1970s legislation regulating workplace health and safety and firm pension of

pensions. The Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1970 and Federal Mine Safety and

Health Act of 1977 regulating workplace conditions; the Employee Retirement Income

Security Act of 1974 governing private pension plans; tax advantages granted to

Employee Stock Ownership Plans .

   1980s/1990s legislation enhancing individual employee rights. The Americans with

Disabilities Act of 1990; Civil Rights Act of 1991; Family and Medical Leave Act of

1993; and Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988. In addition, the Worker

Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 and Immigration Reform and

Control Act of 1986 add further controls on employer behavior in times of planned plant

closures and employment of illegal immigrants. Most states adopted rules on wrongful

dismissals that allow employees to sue for wrongful dismissal in court.

   In the 1990s, moreover, Congress twice increased the minimum wage. It rejected

business efforts to modify the Fair Labor Standards Act that requires time and a half

overtime and failed to enact various Teamwork Bills to make it easier for employers to

empower employee involvement committees. Regulations of hours worked and on the

ability of business to establish works council type arrangements are more stringent in the

US than in the EU.

   Because the federal government has few regulators to monitor these laws because the

US has not developed a workplace-based system of monitoring and enforcement, the


                                            14
main mode of enforcement of labor laws has been through court suits or worker

complaints to agencies. Virtually every large firm in the US faces some court suit about

its employment practices every year. Firms have found the burden of employment law

sufficiently large to lead many to seek private dispute resolution alternatives in place of

expensive court suits. Hardly the sign of a laissez-faire labor market.

The US did not buy full employment with McJobs and wage cuts

   Observers critical of the US experience stress that much of US job growth consists of

low paid unskilled fast food type jobs, of which McDonald‚Äôs is the archetype. Looking

at US jobs growth through an industry lens, American job creation has been concentrated

in the service sector, particularly retail trade, which pays less than, say, manufacturing.

But looked at through an occupation lens, US job growth has been in professional and

managerial work. In 1999 30.3 percent of the US work force was in managerial and

professional specialties compared to 23 percent in 1983. While the growth of

employment was bifurcated with fast growth at both the top and bottom of the skill and

wage distributions, on net US employment was more skilled in 1999 than it was in 1990

or 1980.

   What about the claim that falling/stagnant real wages or poor productivity growth

underlies the US jobs boom?

   From the 1970s through the mid 1990s, there is some support for this proposition.

Productivity growth was slower in the US than in EU countries or Japan. The real wages

of American production workers fell while the real wages of workers in most OECD

countries rose. But in the late 1990s, productivity growth is up, and real wages have


                                             15
increased commensurately. Even during the earlier period, moreover, the trade-off claim

fails to explain the locus of employment growth. Given that the wages of low skilled

men fell sharply in the US, the trade-off argument suggests that their employment and

hours worked should have grown. In fact, until the late 1990s, the American jobs miracle

bypassed the low paid. From 1970 through 1990, annual hours worked for men in the

bottom deciles of the earnings distribution fell while hours worked by those in the upper

deciles were stable or rising (Juhn, Murphy, and Topel; Freeman, 1995). Inequality in

hours worked increased along with inequality in hourly pay, producing an even greater

increase in annual earnings inequality. Employment of women, whose wages rose

relative to that of men, increased most rapidly.

   US experience with minimum wages also gainsays any wage cut story of US jobs

creation (Card and Krueger). During the 1980s the Reagan Administration tried to create

jobs for low skilled Americans by maintaining the nominal value of the minimum wage

while prices and other wages rose, without success. The modest increases in the

minimum by the Bush and Clinton Administration‚Äôs and by various states in ensuing

years had little discernible effect on employment. Comparisons of patterns of

employment growth in Canada, France, and the US (Card, Lemieux, and Kramarz) or

between Germany and the US tell a similar story (Freeman and Schettkat). There is no

clear relation across countries in the growth of employment among groups and in the

pattern of wage changes.

US Jobs Growth is Growth of Jobs for Women

       Perhaps the most important fact about US employment growth is that growth has


                                             16
been most pronounced among women. This is shown in Exhibit 6, which records

employment-population rates for the total population 16-64 and for women and men,

separately. Had the employment to population ratio of US women increased from 1973

to 1998 by the same percentage points as did the employment-population ratio of EU

women, the aggregate US employment to population rate would have changed only

marginally. All else the same, the movement of women into (largely full-time) work

added over 9 percentage points to the total employment rate in 1998 and explained

2/3rds of the 14 percentage point difference between US and European employment

rates.1

    The biggest increase in female employment was among married women with young

children. Between 1960 and 1998 the proportion of married women with children less

than 6 who were in the work force increased from 18.6 percent to 63.7 percent. The

proportion of married women with children less than 6 in the work force in 1997

exceeded the proportion of married women with children of school age (6 to 17) working

in 1960 (39.0 percent), and was just 13 percentage below the proportion with children of

school age working in 1998 (76.8 percent).2 The contrast with Western European women

is striking. More American women with pre-school children participated in the labor

force in 1996 than did all European women, many of whom do not have children. This

occurred without national day-care facilities or with the state hiring a majority of women,

as in some Nordic countries, or with labor laws that give parents paid leave or other

benefits to ease the burden of child care.




                                             17
       In addition, the position of women in the occupational hierarchy improved. In

1983 women were less likely to be in the high wage executive and professional

occupations than men (22% of women versus 25% of men). In 1998 they were more

likely to be in those occupations (28% for women versus 25% for men) (US Statistical

Abstract 1999, table 675).

       In sum, cherchez la femme if you want the real lesson of US employment growth.

Shared Capitalist Institutions

       A major component of the US economic model is the growth of shared capitalism,

by which I mean a diverse set of mechanisms for worker participation in production

decisions and in the financial stake of their firm and of capitalism more broadly.

       On the decision-making side, America‚Äôs best firms have delegated more decisions

to workers through employee involvement programs and team decision-making than ever

before. In the mid 1990s over half of Americans reported that they worked in firms with

employee involvement committees; and one-third of workers said that they were

members of employee involvement committees of some form (Freeman and Rogers).

       On the financial sharing side, I have estimated that approximately 50 percent of

the US work force receives compensation related to company performance of (Dube and

Freeman, 2000). Exhibit 7 shows that approximately 25 percent of the work force had a

stake in their firm through some form of ownership. This includes working in a firm with

an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (around 8%), or receiving a stock option

through an employee stock option plan that covers the bulk of the work force, or through

purchase of stocks in a firm that offers discounts on purchases. A quarter of the work


                                            18
force was covered by profit or gain-sharing. And approximately 10% of the work force

had a substantial proportion of their retirement funds invested in company stocks.

Millions more had a stake in the performance of the economy through defined

contribution pension fund ownership of other firms. In addition in 1998 55 million

workers were covered by a defined contribution private pension plan (Profit-

sharing/401(k) Council of America, www.psca.dcstats.hgtml,), which invested sizable

sums in equities, giving them a stake in the performance of the economy outside their

own firm. Unions had nearly twice as many private sector members in collectively

bargained pension plans than they had members covered by collective bargaining

contracts.

       These forms of shared capitalist arrangements have grown rapidly. All employee

stock option plans barely existed in 1990 but become the leading edge of US

compensation policy by 2000. Electronics firms in particular could not attract the highly

skilled workers they needed without offering options. Firms like Starbucks give options

not only to executives but also to normal workers.

       The view that the US economic model is one of the growth of labor with weak

ties to the firm -- the virtual employee working for the virtual company as a contingent

worker or consultant -- misses the increased financial participation of employees in their

firm and their increased role in workplace decision-making.

                III. Can Full Employment Resolve Distributional Problems?

       Until unemployment rates fell to 4-5 percent in the late 1990s, employment

growth US style, seemed incapable of raising the earnings of the bulk of the work force,


                                            19
or of making much dent into poverty (Freeman, 1999). Real earnings of production

workers dropped by 14% in the private sector from 1973 to 1995. The pay of low skilled

workers in all sectors, particularly high school drop out men, fell by over 20%. Median

weekly earnings of all men fell while the median weekly earnings of women stagnated.

The historic relation between poverty and economic growth seemingly broke down in the

1980s (Blank and Card; Cutler and Katz), with more and more poor persons residing in

female-headed homes on welfare and with the decline of real wages for the bulk of the

male work force.

       But the experience of the late 1990s presents a different picture. The real hourly

earnings of production workers in the private sector rose from 1995 to 1999 by over 5

percent. The earnings of men with less than 9th grade education 7% from 1995 to 1998

The earnings of workers in the bottom decile of the earnings distribution increased by

8.7% from 1996 to 1998. And the wages of workers in the much maligned retail trade

sector rsoes by 7.0% (Freeman, 2000).

       Over the same period, spurred in part by the booming economy and in part by

changes in the welfare laws, the number of persons on welfare rolls plummeted

(Ellwood). Many persons who had been on welfare, which invariably gave them poverty

level incomes, moved into employment, where they received Earned Income Tax Credit

moneys that raised their incomes. The rate of poverty began dropping after years of

stagnation. While full employment did not reduce the level of inequality or make a huge

dent into poverty, the gains of economic growth finally ‚Äútrickled down‚Äù the income

distribution. Conditional on full employment the US economy began to reduce the


                                            20
principal flaw in economic performance and thus look more like a legitimate candidate

for peak economy.

       But can the US maintain full employment for long enough to lock in the gains in

real wages, poverty reduction, and productivity growth to allow the country to pass

criterion for peak economy in exhibit 2?

       Only a charlatan would claim to know the answer. Macro-economists are divided

over the potential for consistent rapid growth -- believers in the new economy

(Congressional Budget Office) versus doubters (Godley). Micro-economists do not

understand why the economy managed to carry off the low unemployment with no

inflation of the late 1990s (Katz and Krueger). My dismal science intuition is that some

of the 1990s changes in the US economy have made it easier to maintain full

employment, but that eventually a negative shock coupled with the huge trade deficit,

reliance on foreign capital, and substantial private debt and wealth dependent on the

vagaries of the stock market will eventually produce a significant recession, whose costs

will fall heavily on the lower half of the income distribution. In such a situation the US

Model will lose its lustre as candidate for single peak. But I could be as wrong as my

macro colleagues were in forseeing the late 1990s US economic boom. Maybe

technological progress has raised productivity at new rates and the Internet will improve

market efficiencies enough for the US to keep the late 1990s boom going and going and

going like the Energizer Rabbit.

        But if the US model falters in the next several years, who will replace itt? Cool

Brittania? A revived French economy? If Canada does well, some wierdoes may even


                                            21
start touting the Maple Leaf Model /Modele Feuille d‚Äô√ârable. Sounds unlikely, but a

decade ago no one would have predicted that Ireland or the Netherlands would the great

successes of the EU, or that the US would look like a winner and Japan a loser in the War

of the Models. There are a lot of alternative capitalist institutions out there, and every

decade some economy leads the pack. In any case, I expect that whichever model

emerges as the next candidate for peak will find a way to do what the US did so well in

the 1990s ‚Äì increase opportunities for women in the job market and expand shared

capitalist institutions.

* If workers were covered by only one form of variable pay, our estimate would be the sum of the
estimates for the bold categories in the table: 61%, of which 50 percentage points consists of
ownership and incentive pay. But there is considerable overlap in coverage. On the basis of
overlaps in the Worker Representation and Particiation Survey, Ie estimate that the proportion of
workers with any form of performance pay and ownership exceeds the sum of the proportions
covered by each form separately by 33% = (41.9+29.6)/53.8. Thus, I reduce the 50% to 38%. I do
not have data on the overlap with the estimated 11% of workers with 401k or other plans with
sizable amounts of company shares, but anticipate that this will be modest, giving the 45% in the
text.

1. By contrast, the employment to population rate for men fell over the period, though
much less sharply than in Europe. Part of the difference among men is due to large
increases in enrollments in school in Europe, where students are less likely to work than
in the U.S. Part is due to more rapid movement of older men to early retirement in
Europe. Among prime age men, those between say 25 and 54, employment-population
rates in the US and OECD-Europe are quite similar.
