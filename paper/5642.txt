                                                    ABSTRACT


         This paper uses computable           general equilibrium    simulations    to investigate   the effect of

private school vouchers.         Itimproves    onpastcomputational       approaches by(i)      endogenizing    the

funding of public schools through the modelling of an explicit political process at the school

district level; (ii) embedding the private/public       school choice in a Tiebout model in which agents

also choose between communities that provide different public school/property                 tax packages; and

(iii) allowing for a variety of different public school financing mechanisms               ranging from purely

local financing and control all the way to pure state funding.           While voucher programs are shown

to increase       school-based     stratification   of agents,     they tend    to decrease     residence-based

stratification.     This implies that untargeted        vouchers     may be equity-enhancing         under some

institutional settings even when there are no direct improvements              in public school efficiency from

increased competition,      Furthermore, the effects of targeting vouchers to low income districts may

not differ significantly    from the effects of untargeted voucher plans.

1, Introduction
      Increasingly       frustrated     with the perceived low quality of government-provided                               education,

many states and localities             are looking to the market for solutions.                   As a result, private school

voucher experiments            are under way in Minnesota and Wisconsin;                       school choice advocates hold

state superintendent          positions     in many states including              Arizona, Georgia and California;                   and

governors and state legislators are increasingly making vouchers a theme of their campaigns.1 At

the same time, however, uneme over the equity implications of introducing an increased degree of

private school competition persists and has contributed to defeats of voucher proposals in several

legislatures as well as in a recent California referendum. While both sides of the debate seem to

generally accept Friedman’s               (1955, 1962) argument that vouchers might result in more efficient

use of public resources             in schools,       they disagree        whether      this improvement               is likely to be

substantial       enough to offset expected equity losses resulting from the loss of highly motivated

students to priva~ schools, in particular for students who remain in low income public schools.

     Largely because voucher experiments have been small in scale and relatively recent, empirical

evidence in this debate is still quite scarce. While recent work by Hoxby (1994) suggests we

should expect substantial improvements in public school performance under increased competition,

Grosskopf,        Hayes, Taylor and Weber (1995) find only weak support for this proposition                                      when

performance is memured by the degree of inefficiency. Neither of these studies, however, is able

to use data involving          private school vouchers. Rather, they rely on current public and private

school data and either speculate                 or leave the reader to speculate                about possible effects from

increased     competition         through        vouchers.2        Thus, even if the empirical               literature     on school

competition        were to agree on the expected                  magnitude     of the efficiency-enhancing                  effects of

increased competition, it wotid, until data from such experiments becomes available, be difficult to

quantitatively predict the impact of large scale public policy experiments that have never been tried.

     In the meantime,          the complexity         of the issues involved and the ambiguity                        over the size of

    competition    on test scores, educational   attainment    and wages, while Grosskopf    et. al. (1995) use data on Texas public
    school districts   and an input distance     function model to ftnd strong evidence      of inefficiencies    in public schools but
    weak support for the preposition      that the degree of competition    is related to these inefficiencies.

opposing effects have made meaningful                            theoretical work on the                  topic    nearly impossible.3 This

has led several researchers                  in the direction of constructing                    plausible computational                    models of

education markets, calibrating them to available data, and simulating the effects of simple voucher

proposals. While these models obviously must abstract from many real world features, they can

give indications of the direction and magnitudes of voucher-induced                                         changes in public and private

education in a way that is impossible to do through either ordinary theoretical or empirical work.

Two recent examples                of this approach are represented                         by the important             models in Epple and

Romano ( 1996) and Manski ( 1992) on whose insights we seek to build,4



1.1. Simulation Models of Private Scbol                         Vouchers

      Epple and Romano assume there are no efficiency-enhancing                                       effects of competition on public

schools in order to focus on the equity and efficiency implications of a voucher system in the worst

case scenario that such beneficial competitive effects do not exist. Their assumption of a passive

open enrollment public school sector implies that educational                                      quality is the same in each public

school, which means that the public sector can be treated as a single school. Private schools, on the

other hand, maximize profits subject to providing students with their maximum utility obtainable

elsewhere. Furthermore,               private schools are able to observe the ability type of each student and

discriminate      between students by charging differential tuition. It is immediate in this framework

that all public schools               must be of lower quality                     than every private schools                       Furthermore,

stratification     occurs along two dimensions:                     all else equal, the public school system absorbs only

the relatively low income and the relatively low ability students. Private schools, M suggested by

Vandenberghe           (1996), “skim the cream” off the public schools and may even subsidize the tuition

of low income/high            ability students. 6 These theoretical insigh~ as well as additional simulation

3   For one of the few theoretical           treatments,    see Hoyt and be          (1996). In this paper, the authors demonstrate              that in
    certain   environments,       vouchers   can produce       Pareto     improvements       by causing     lower tax rates,      and that politically
    feasible voucher programs may have this property.
4    Another more macroeconomics             oriented approach can be found in Glomm and Ravikumar                       (1995), and Femandez       and
    Rogerson     (1995) provide an interesting        simulation     approach to analyzing        centralization      of school finance.
5   This is true because private schools charge tuition while public schools are free,
6
    This allows private schools to internalize             peer group externalities        through admissions        and pricing policies.     which is
    something    not possible     for public schools. A tentative efficiency              argument in favor of private schools follows in that
    the introduction     of free public      schools eliminates         the possibility    of a constrained        efficient   allocation   of students
    across private     schools.    The distribution    of students       across private     schools in the absence of free public schools is
                                                                                                                                                    3


results add fuel to some of the fears voiced by opponents of increased school choice. In the model,

those who gain from a school choice system in the absence of beneficial competitive                                                 effects on

public schools are those already in the private schools before the voucher program and some of

those who switch from public to private schools, while those remaining                                             in the public schools

experience         welfare losses. It should be emphasized,                        however,        that the addition of beneficial

competitive pressures on public schools may soften these adverse equity implications of the model

and could, if strong enough, lead to improvements                           in welfare for all agents.

      Contraty to Epple and Romano, Manski (1992) addresses the tradeoffs between benefits from

competition         and adverse peer effects on public schools more direcdy by comparing two extreme

types of public sectors: one that is perfectly efficient (meaning that it spends all i~ resources on

factors that directly benefit students),                     and another that seeks to maximize                      its own surplus (by

splitting expenditures            into spending on factors that benefits tuden~ and factors that do not benefit

students) subject to the threat of students leaving the system. In both cases, the public sector is

assumed (as in Epple and Romano) to act as one unitary body that receives some exogenous level

of funding         per pu-pil. Under the surplus maximizing                          specification,           increased      private school

competition         leads to an increase in the fraction of public school expenditures                                   devoted to inputs

benefiting         students in public schools. Thus, competition                            directly improves public schools, a

possibility not allowed for in the work by Epple and Romano in which public schools are passive.

In the case of the first specification                    (that assumes efficient public schools to begin with), this

effect, as expected, does not materialize.7

    efficient     if the number   of schools     is efficient   (which   is not guaranteed).     However,      if this number     happens    to be
    efficient,    then the possibility      of discrimination      in private   school    admissions   makes      possible   a Pareto     optimum
    without public schools but not with them. This, of course, ignores the possibility                 of other externalities    that arise from
    greater integration. Others have addressed the peer group externality issues raised by Epple and Romano as well. De
    Bartolome ( 1990) sets out a model of locaI governments with peer effects and demonstrates that voting/locational
    equilibria    with heterogeneous      community       compositions   can be inefficient    because families     fail to internalize   the peer
    group externality when choosing to migrate. It is suggested that one appropriate policy response might be to use
    tax/subsidy programs to deal with the externality. Schwab and Oates (1991) demonstrate that, just as private schools
    internalize    the peer group externality     in Epple and Romano, more active public schools could do the same by charging
    low peer quality students       higher taxes. While this is objectionable            on equity grounds,    Schwab and Oates proceed to
    analyze the same problem when locat governments are constrained to charge equal tax rates. They show that a system
    of equalizing grants that compensate communities for accepting low peer quality students may be constrained efficient.
7   For a recent critique of tbe Manski paper, see Moe and Shotts (1996), In addition to pointing out the timitations                       of the
    framework      used by Manski,       they calculate    utility levels for low income parents within the context of the model and
    find that, while utility does decrease when there are no efficiency              enhancing     benefits to competition,      these decreases
    are very smatl compared        to the large increases in utility for the same parents in the presence of those benefits.
                                                                                                        4



     The results from these papers are thus, in many ways, consistent with conventional wisdom:

to the extent that competition   improves the public sector, low income parents in the public school

system may benefit, but as these beneficial competitive      effects vanish, so do the benefits to low

income parents who are left with the same (efficient) public school but without the more motivated

students who have left for private schools. Since the assumption is that highly motivated students

improve the school, public schools become worse when competition has no efficiency enhancing

effect on the operation    of those schools.    The characterization    of the debate in the opening

paragraph of this paper is therefore confirmed in the simulation        literature: there seems to be a

tension between the positive efficiency enhancing effects of vouchers and their possible negative

equity implications. If this is correct, the desirability of vouchers then ultimately rests on the extent

to which positive impacts of competition such u those found by Hoxby (1994) actually exist.



1.2. Features of a New Model

     We will argue here that, while both of the simulation       models discussed     above make great

contributions   to our understanding   of private school choice, three important elements of public

schooling in US states have been left out. (For a brief illustration of the differences between our

approach and previous models, see Figure 1.) First, both Manski and Epple & Romano model the

public sector as being exogenously       funded on a per pupil basis when, in fact, public school

spending is determined    through the political interaction of voters and legislators at the state and

local levels. Second, while Man ski considers separately the cases of poor, middle income and

wealthy communities,      he does not allow for the endogenous         development    of public school

populations within communities     through the Tiebout ( 1956) sorting that is familim from the local

public finance literature and that seems particularly relevant in the case of education. Similarly,

while Epple and Romano allow, in principle, for different public schools in different communities,

they assume an open enrollment system which resul~ in all these public schools being identical. In

both models, the empirically relevant fact that individuals sort themselves into communities based

in large measure on income, and thus consume different levels of public education to begin with, is

left out. Finally, neither model attempts to address the differences in expected effects of vouchers
                                                                                                                 5


in different     political   settings     Specifically,   public education    is financed   through a variety of

different      mixes of state and local financing           schemes   ranging from purely local funding to

foundation grants and district power equalization all the way to pure state funding. It could well be

the cwe that the effect of vouchers differs under different pre-existing state policies. We therefore

propose to reconsider         vouchers in a model in which we relax (i) the assumed erogeneity                  of

funding for public schools, (ii) both the assumed absence of Tiebout migration effects and the

assumed existence of a homogeneous                public sector, and (iii) the assumed lack of state and local

interaction.

     We begin by fully defining a local public goods model with multiple local governments

providing different levels of local public school quality (where parental perceptions                    of school

outputs are a function of local per pupil spending on schools and the average “peer quality” of

studen~ in that school.) Unlike Epple and Romano, however, an agent who sends his child to a

particular school must reside in that school’s district (i.e. no open enrollment), and, unlike Manski,

we assume that agents are mobile between districts. Furthermore, we endogenize local funding for

public education by assuming that local school boards are subject to political pressures in that their

budget (funded through a property tax) is set by the median voter. Thus agents choose not only

whether to attend public or private schools, but also, given market clearing house prices, which

community       to reside in and what level of funding for public education within that community to

support at the ballot box.

     After analyzing vouchers in the context of this purely local system of public school finance,

we add a higher level government              that is also actively engaged in the funding of education. In

particular, we consider the effect of vouchers under three types of institutional schemes other than

a purely locally funded system: (i) a system of exogenously                  set state foundation   (block) grants

financed through a state income tax; (ii) district power equalization (which is equivalent to a system

of exogenously      set state matching grants); and (iii) pure state funding of education in which the

state median voter sets the level of spending (funded through an income tax). The first two of

these preserve local control but change local policy incentives, while the third essentially removes

all local control and puts the state in charge of educational funding. We will demonstrate that the

effects of voucher programs             depend critically on the type of current institutional       setting used
                                                                                                                                       6

because these institutions          alter the set of expected users of the vouchers as well as the political

implications for public school funding.

     Of course, adding these additiond                  complexities       to previous models naturally forces us to

sacrifice some of these previous models’ richness in other dimensions. In particular, we will allow

for neither the rent seeking behavior suggested in Mansk.i nor the complex private school pricing

mechanism derived in Epple and Romano. More precisely, since it is clear from Manski’s work

that modelling        public schools as inefficient          in the absence of competition                 improves the equity

properties of vouchers, we will resume efficiency (at least as observed by parents) of both public

and private schools and thus look at worst case equity implications.                            Furthermore          we will assume

that the private school market consists of competitive,                        profit maximizing         schools who charge a

single admissions          price for all students        and can “cream skim” explicitly                    in their admissions

policies. 8 Finally, peer quality, is modelled more crudely than in Epple and Romano and Manski

in that we assume that it is perfectly correlated with parental socio-economic status. While these are

simplifications       of previous models that should be kept in mind throughout                               our analysis, they

permit us to focus on an entirely new set of issues not previously analyzed in the literature without

“rediscovering”       the important insights already obtained in Manski (the trade-off between adverse

effects from cream skimming and positive effects from competition)                               and Epple and Romano (the

efficiency and equity implications of price discriminating behavior by private schools.)

     Section 2 proceeds to outline the model, and Section 3 comments on computational                                          issues.

Section 4 then investigates the general equilibrium effects of vouchers in a variety of institutional

settings, and Section 5 ends with comments on the limitations of the model, possible extensions to

the analysis and some concluding remwks.

     The computable          general equilibrium model developed here is calibrated to New Jersey datag

8   For reasons elaborated    below, the more complicated    pricing mechanism      of Epple and Romano loses its intuitive appeal
    under our setting.
9   While we have thus made an attempt to calibrate the model to be consistent with the data, we do not take the view that
    the simulation   results offered should be interpreted   very literally.   In pwticular,   since any computational      model must
    m&e a number of simplifying       assumptions,   we view our approach as an extension of theory that, tike pure theory, can
    aid in developing basic intuitions concerning    the nature and magnitude of vtious        general equilibrium    effects. Our focus
    witl therefore   be on general lessons learned from the analysis rather than a literal interpretation        of any single set of
                                                                                                                                                    7


and is based on the theoretical model in Nechyba (1996a) where the existence of an equilibrium

without private schools is proved.10 The model takes as given community boundaries that divide

a large set of different houses into local political entities which produce public schooling funded

through a property tax. An additional political unit called the state (or nation) encompasses                                                   all

communities and may finance additional education programs through a state income tax. There are

no a priori restrictions on the mix of house types across communities;                                       i.e. some communities            may

have a fairly homogeneous                         housing stock while others have both “good” and “bad” houses.

Similarly, some communities                       may be inherently more preferred because of particular community

qualities. The model is therefore attempting to explain neither the evolution of the housing stock

nor the formation                of communities.           Rather, it takes these as having evolved exogenously                                and

resulting          from some given history. 11 Its potentially                           heterogeneous         intracommunity           housing

structure allows for the empirically important possibility of the coexistence of rich and poor sectors

within a particular community,                      a feature not possible in models that view housing as a perfectly

divisible,         homogeneous            good (Epple, Filimon                and Romer (1993), Rose-Ackerman                           (1979)).

Consumers in the model own both houses and some amount of the private good, both of which are

tradeable at market prices, and choose their optimal place of residence given their preferences and

budgets. The existence of a land market rather than housing exogenously                                                supplied by absentee

landlords (as is common in the literature (see, for example, Epple, Filimon and Romer (1993)))

enables the model to seriously investigate capitalization                                  and its impact on communities.               Finally,

each agent also votes on the level of local property taxation (or state income taxation in the case of a

state financed public school system).



     simulation      numbers.
10   The sufficient      conditions    for the existence    of an equilibrium        in this model are fairly weak compared        to others in the
     literature.     They include      standard     assumptions     on preferences      and technologies    without    the usual single crossing
     conditions      (Westhoff    (1977), Epple, Fitimon and Romer ( 1993)) and without Dunz’s (1985) independence                     assumption.
     It is trivial to extend        the existence    theorem      to the case of private     schools   as noted below, Also, in this paper we
     deviate from Nechyba (1996b) in that we do not explicitly model a separate state public good because it would add little
     to the analysis.
11   Since construction      of new houses is not possible in the context of the model (and is technically                 extremely   difficult to
     model (see Nechyba           (1996a)),   the model is most appropriate          to the analysis of a relatively   developed   urban/suburban
     economy. We do not view this as a particular                  weakness of the approach because it is in such economies            that private
     school competition          is likely to have an effect. (Demand for private schools in remote and undeveloped                  rural areas is
     likely to be less of a factor due to tie limited market size.)

2.1 Endowments and Preferences

     The main elements of both the general model as well as its CGE derivative are summarized

formally in Table 1. The set N represents both the set of agents and the set of houses in the model,

where n= N is defined               as that agent         who is initially          endowed with          house     n. 12 A fixed

community structure C is imposed on this set of houses and partitions it into a set of house types

H=(l,...,h      ,...,~}    spread over a set of communities                 M=( 1,..., m,iii}iii}. C~~, then, is both the

set of houses of type h in community                   m and the set of agenk                initially     endowed with such

houses.      The CGE         version presented here defines N=[O, 1], H=( 1,2,3) and M={ 1,2,3}, which

implies the existence of nine different house endowment types (three house types in each of three

communities). Each of these is assumed to be represented in the economy in equal numbers; i.e.

                                                              # (C~h) = 1/9.                                                     (1)

     In addition to his house endowment,                  each agent n is also endowed with a strictly                     positive

amount of private good z(n) called income. The set of income levels is assumed to be finite which

gives rise to a set of income classes I = {1,,. .,i,.. .,:1). This implies that the house and income

endowments jointly define a set of endowment types

                                                   E = (Etii I (m,h,i)~ MxHxI}                                                   (2)

where eti       ●   Etii is an agent that falls into the income class i and is endowed with a house of type

h in community m. Our CGE model contains five of these income classes (with incomes of 2,3.5,

5,6.5 and 8 roughly corresponding                 to New Jersey household income levels scaled by $10,000).

These,     combined       with the three house types in each of three communities,                                 generates       45

endowment types each of which is represented qually                        in the economy; i.e.

                                             ~(Etii)    = ~1       V (m,h,i)~ MxHxI.13                                           (3)

     Finally, agents are endowed with a utility function u“:MxHxR                              ~+ R+ which takes as its

argumen~ the community and house type the agent lives in, private good consumption                                      zc R+, and

12   More precisely,   the set of houses and consumers is defined m part of a measure space (N,~p)            where p is taken to be
     the Lebesgue measure. AU subsets referred to are henceforth assumed to be measurable.
13   Some have suggested     that this uniform distribution    of income is not endrely realistic.   While this is true, we refer the
     reader to footnote   9 which notes that we do not view the calibration          of the model as an important     feature of the
     analysis. The effect of a skewed distribution of income on local versus state voting outcomes has been treated
     effectively in Sonstelie and Silva (1995). Furthermore, we note that, despite the frequent use of the term “high income
     agents” later in the paper,   this is very much a model of middle income communities        (given top incomes of $80,000),
                                                                                                                                                           9

a perceived         school quality level SE R+. In the CGE version, all agents have the same utility

function which is defined as follows: 14

                                                        un(m,h,s,c) = ktis PY
                                                                            c                     V n~N.15                                               (4)

where (m,h) is the community and house type of residence, s is their school’s quality and c is their

private good consumption.



2.2. Parental Perceptions of School Quality

     The inclusion of school quality rather than student achievement in the utility function deserves

some attention. As suggested                        by the household           production         function literature (Becker (1991)),

school quality is only one of the inputs in the production                                        of student achievement.                  The other,

parental commitment               of time and resources, plays a major role as well (Hanushek ( 1986)). While

parents therefore care directly                      about student achievement                    (where achievement               as defined by

parents may entail substantially                     more than good test scores), they care about school quality only

indirectly w one of the inputs required in the production process of this achievement.                                                       Thus, the

utility function in (4) is somewhat                       “reduced form” in nature because school quality rather than

student achievement              enters directly as an argument. 16 This is done for simplicity and, while it is

14   As demonstrated      in Nechyba ( 1996a), there is no technical problem in including                     spillovers   or population     externalities
     in the model. We mmment            on the effect of such externalities       on our resulk in Section 5.
15   This utility function       satisfies     all conditions   necessary     for the existence    of an equilibrium        (Nechyba       (1996a)).     The
     pmameters      are set to be consistent        with New Jersey micro tax data in Nechyba ( 1996c). Preferences                are assumed to be
     identical not only for computational convenience but also because skatification results in Nechyba (1996a) imply that
     under these conditions, the equilibrium assignment of agents into house types is unique, Finally, we should note that
     the CGE model described in Nechyba ( 1996b,c) contains an additional state public good financed by a state income tax.
     This feature has been “turned off’ for the present exercise because it is not relevant to the issues discussed in this paper.
16   We can think, for example, of the following simple motivating example for this reduced form: Suppose each agent has
     a utility function of the form u(~a,c) = Pa~c~ where [is parental leisure, a is the child’s achievement                         and c is parental
     consumption.     In order to avoid a direct laborfleisure            choice (which is not part of our model), suppose that income z is
     exogenous      (perhaps   the result of a 40-hour workweek),              and that parents are endowed           with 1 unit of leisure (which
     cannot be used for working;              i.e. there is no overtime. ) Further,    let us abstract for this illustration        from the Tiebout
     model in the text and assume that any level of school quality s can be purchased on the market at price p per unit and
     that the child’s achievement            level a is determined     by a=ssx(l-s) where x is the amount of leisure parents spend on their
     child’s education    at home. Parents then solve the following maximization                   problem:
                                                         rnax                                      C=z-ps
                                                          X,5 u (Lac) , = ~a~c~ subiect to
                                                                                                   a = ssx(l-h~
                                                                                                   [= l-y..

usually not acknowledged explicitly, is standard in the entire literature cited in the introduction. It is

important, however, to recognize that the school quality argument in the utility function represents

school quali~          as defined and perceived             by parents. While the education                      production        function

literature    reviewed        by Hanushek           (1986) is still unclear as to what school inputs matter in

determining       test scores, school quality (and student achievement)                              more broadly defined may

include other aspects of schools (music classes, athletic activities, etc. ) that have little relation to

test scores themselves but that may nevertheless be important to parents. 17

     This parentally defined school quality is provided by local governments (and in a later version

by the state government) as well as private institutions, and we assume that both private and public

school quality is judged by parents as if itresulted from a production process that uses as inputs

both per pupil spending and the peer quality in the school (as measured by per capita income of

parents). If per pupil spending in the school is Z, and average peer quality is P,, we define the

perceived school quality as

                                                    s =f~ (z~, p~) =         z s ([-P) ~~P,18
                                                                                                                                             (5)

where    pE   R+ is a parameter indicating the strength of the peer effect paren~ perceive. Thus, if

p=O, only spending matters to parents, while if p= 1, only peer effects matter. Furthermore,                                                 we
define Ps=I~15 (where 1, is the average income of parents who send theii- children to the school in

question) to make peer values roughly equal in order of magnitude to per pupil spending, which

then allows us to more easily interpret different values of p. (For example, p=O.5 can then be

interpreted to mean that parents place roughly equal value on pwr effects and spending.)

     when k=—,            While   this still circumvents    issues related    to endogenous      labor/leisure   choices,   it illustrates   the
             (y+pb)
     general motivation   for viewing school quality as a reduced form argument that enters directty into utility functions,
17   It could, for example,   be that spending      really does not matter very much in determining              test scores because lower
     spending is replaced by increased parental inpuw; i.e. parents purchase private music lessons when schools no longer
     fund them, or parents are more vigilant in monitoring homework progress as studentiteacher ratios rise. In that case,
     parents may care about spending      despite    the empirical   observation    that spending     is not correlated     with test scores.
     Empirical evidence to the effect that parents provide less effort as schools improve can be found in Houtenville                  (1996).
18   Note that we assume that parenk      act a.r if there was this underlying      production    process.   An alternative    interpretation
     is to think of parents simply caring about peer quality and spending without actually having an underlying                    production
     process in mind; i.e. all else equal, parents simply desire to have high income peers for their children. (We have also
     attempted to use other CES production     functions. Since results do not change qualitatively          they go unreported here. )
                                                                                                                                                     11


     Again, we take no position in this paper on either the “proper” definition of school quality or

the “true” level of p. We do, however, argue that the empirical evidence suggests strongly a

definition of school quality by parents that makes the perceived level of p significantly less than 1;

that is, the fact that parents in different school districts choose to spend dramatically                                                   different

amounts on education, and the fact that educational spending is such a strong focus in court battles

implies that parents must believe spending to be an important input to the production process of

school quality as they define it. If they did not, all communities would spend the minimum amount

necessary to run a public school. We therefore do not consider cases where p= 1 in this paper, but

we do allow for the possibility that parental perceptions are wrong, and that the true p is actually

equal to 1 (i.e., spending does not matter.) For this reason, we report not only the parentally

perceived quality level in our simulation                              results, but also the level of per pupil spending on

education and the peer quality level for each community. The only factor that matters for parental

choices, however, is the perceived p and the resulting perceived definition of quality.

     Finally, we note in passing that our specification                              of peer effects is consistent with the general

empirical findings in Henderson, Mieszkowski and Sauvageau (1978) in that they are modelled as

equally important for high income and low income students. 19




19   We chose this fairly primitive          specification   of peer effects after    attempting to learn the me nature of peer effects from
     the empirical literature. First highlighted in the Coleman Report (1966), peer effects have long been thought to play a
     vital role in education, Summers and Wolfe (1977), using pupil specific evidence from Philadelphia, find evidence to
     confirm the Coleman           finding that less able students benefit from more able peers while high ability students are little
     affected by peers (which contrasts with our specification                h which peer effects are equal for all students).         Henderson,
     Mies&owski        and Sauvageau         (1978),    however,    while documenting       strong evidence      for peer effects    among French
     speaking      Canadian     students,   find that these peer effects are equally present for both high and low ability students,
     consistent     with our specification.          In an important    recent paper, Evans, Oates and Schwab (1992) cast doubt on all
     these results by demonstrating           that, in the case of teenage pregnancy        and school dropout behavior, strong peer effects
     are found with standard           regressions     but vanish when endogeneity         problems      are addressed.     This suggests     that past
     results on peer effects may be very much overstated. Link and Mulligan (199 I ) paint a very complex picture of peer
     effects along both ability and racial lines and find that some groups (in particular blacks) benefit from having others in
     that group in the class room. As is well known, the education production function literature is similarly littered with
     contradictory evidence (Hanushek ( 1986)), but recent cross country examinations have provided further evidence that
     peer effects of tie kind we model may be quite important                     (Toma (1996)).      As a result of these ambiguous          findings.
     theoretical    models      typically   pick a somewhat        simple specification   of peer effects that is consistent        with some past
     empirical     measurements        (Brueckner      and Lee (1989),      Arnott   and Rowse     (1 987)). For a good summary             of general
     theoretical    existence     and welfare    theorems     in models with arbitrary      population     externalities,   see Scotchmer      (1994),
     and for an excelfent demonstration           of the empirical difficulties      involved in measuring     peer effects, see Manski ( 1993).

2.3. The heal          Public Sector

     Local public schools are funded through proportional                                      property taxes set in accordance with

majority rule voting by local residents, and we assume that only residents within a community can

attend that community’s public school. Voters are assumed to be myopic in the sense that they tie

community compositions,                     property values and their choice of private or public schooling as given

when they go to the polls. (Voter myopia is a relatively standard assumption in the literature (see

Epple, Filimon and Romer (1993), Dunz ( 1986), Rose-Ackerman                                               (1979)) and is inconsistent only

out of equilibrium .)20 Since local budgets have to balance, the relationship between t~, the local

tax rate, and Sm, the perceived public school quality in community m, is one to one and given by

                                                                       t~
                                                                       (cm)                (1-P) &     p
                                                      Sm=
                                                               (N (students~          )()        15
                                                                                                                                                   (6)

where     P(Cm)       = ~        (L (Cmh)     F (Cmh))        is the       local property        tax base. This base varies with the
                         h~ H

endogenously   determined house price function ~: MxH+R+         that gives rise to a house price
             —
vector p= R~h; i.e. the function ~ assigns a unique price to each house type in each jurisdiction.

(The first term is simply per pupil spending in the public school in community m.) This, combined

with myopic voting and standard assumptions                                  on preferences,           is shown in Nechyba (1996a) to

yield single peaked preferences                     over local school spending levels (or, equivalently,                                  over local

property tax rates) which in turn implies the existence of local voting equilibria.21

     Agents are also assumed to be myopic in their location decisions in that they take prices, other

public good levels and other agents’ locations m given. They do not, however, take their choice of

public versus private school as given when they make their migration                                                 choices;          that is, when

determining their maximal utility in each potential place of residence, they consider both the case of

attending private and the cme of attending public schools.

20   This is because all expectations         implicitly    held by myopic voters are fulfitled irs equilibrium             when voters vote holding
     levels of public goods, community            compositions         and property values fixed at the actual equilibrium             vulues. Thus, in
     equilibrium,     voters    correctly    take current     levels    of these variables      into account.      Myopic     voting    of this kind is
     essential   for the theoretical        work underlying        these    simulations;     without    it, we would    not be able to make the
     statements regarding existence and “uniqueness”               of equilibria below that seem to us as important underpinnings               for our
     methodological      approach.
21   Note that we avoid the Stiglitz           (1974) non-single         peakedness    problem       by assuming    that individuals     vote on local
     public schools holding fixed their choice over public versus private schools. Thus, if the voter has chosen a private
     school, his ideal point is a local tax rate of zero and his preferences                 are single peaked. If, on the other hand, the voter
     has chosen the public system, his preferences             are single peaked u demonstrated            in Nechyba (1996a).

2.4. Other Institutional Settings

     Thus far we have defined the local public sector under a system of pure local public finance via

the property       tax. We will also consider                  other financing        mechanisms        of public schools.        In

particular, we will discuss the effect of private school vouchers under a state foundation                                   grant

system, a district power equalization                 system and a pure state financed system.22 We will discuss

these in more detail in Section 4. For now, we simply note that foundation                                 grants are per pupil

block grants to local governments               who are obligated to spend them on public education and have

the discretion to raise additional funds for local public schools through a local property tax (set in

accordance with majority rule). The block grants are funded by the state government                                   through a

proportional       state income tax. District power equalization,                      on the other hand, is a system of

matching granh with a negative match rate for high tax base districts and positive matching rates

for low tax base districts. The intent of the program is to insure that equal tax rates imply equal

spending levels across communities,                   and we will resume that the program is revenue neutral; i.e.

the revenues raisd         from the negative match rates on high base communities is exactly sufficient to

cover the positive matching grants to poor communities.                           Therefore no additional state income tax

revenues me necessary, and local property tax rates continue to be set by the median voter. Finally,

a pure state funded system involves no local propefiy taxes and only a proportional                                state income

tax whose rate is set by the median voter in the state.



2.5. Private Schools

     Finally, with no cle~ guidance from the empirical literature as to the appropriate                                objective

functions of private schools, we assume that private schools are small, competitive                                  and profit-

maximizing institutions that each set a single tuition level (equal, due to the zero profit condition, to

per pupil spending in that school) as well as a minimum peer quality standard below which they

will not admit any students. Since we allow private schools to be relatively small, we are implicitly

assuming that all scale effects are exhausted relatively early .23 Furthermore, we implicitly assume

22   For technical definitions   of these programs,      see Nechyba ( 1996 b).
23   There is little empirical   evidence   to support     large economies   of scale for schools   beyond a few hundred   students,
     Dewey, Husted and Kenny (1995), for example, find no support for this.
                                                                                                                                                                14

away the type of price discriminating behavior derived in Epple and Romano where private schools

subsidize high peer quality children. While we think such behavior on the part of private schools is

reasonable           under the assumptions                     in Epple and Romano,                      it strikes us as unreasonable                     in the

context of our model. More specifically, since we have made the simplifying assumption that peer

quality is perfectly correlated with income, the price discriminating                                               behavior in Epple and Romano

would imply regressive                      tuition structures .24 We consider this an empirically                                     unlikely outcome,

especially         in the presence of voucher systems that are likely to be implemented                                                           in a political

environment that would explicitly prohibit such price discrimination. Our model therefore results in

a private sector in which each private school is completely                                               homogeneous;              that is, each private

school, if it has positive enrollment, has studen~ of only the minimum peer quality (because higher

quality peers have their own private schools) and charges tuition equal to the most preferred level

of tuition for that peer group (because if a different level of tuition were charged, a new entrant

could make positive profits and attract all students to his school with a different tuition level).as



2.6. Definition, fiistence                  and “Uniqueness” of Equilibria

     An equilibrium                   under some arbitr~               state program x (where x codd be a system of foundation

gran~, district power equalization, or vouchers) is defined as follows:



24   We should further note that implementing                     Epple and Romano’s           differential     pricing scheme in a model with multiple
     communities        (such as ours) would be technically               extremely challenging.
25 This logic is similar                to Hamilton’s      (1975)     familiar   zoning    argument       in which      communities        (rather    than private
     schools)      fix a local         taxlspending     package     (analogous      to tuition      levels)     and set a minimum          zoning     requirement
     (analogous       to our minimum          peer quality).      In the course of our analysis,              we have also investigated          two other private
     school market         assumptions:
     1.    A single       non-profit       private    school    that seeks to maximize              enrollment.     (This     is similar   to one of Manski’s
           specifications.        )
     2.    A single non-profit, cream stiing        private school that seeks to maximize                             enrollment      subject to not accepting
           students below a certain “peer quality”.
     We have foregone reporting               results under these assumptions          for several reasons: (i) additional            technical problems arise
     that complicate         the analysis;       (ii) results     are qualitatively       similar     but more difficult         to interpret;     and (iii) most
     importantly,       we do not view either of the above assumptions                     as plausible        in equdibria     in which private schools can
     differentiate     on the basis of peer qualities.            More precisely,     under both these assumptions,              another private school could
     arise and make positive profits by catering to certain peer groups. This competitive                               process then leads to the outcome
     we assume         in the body of the paper                that many private       schools       who cater      to each type will arise. In such an
     environment,        each school charges            the optimal    tuition for the members           of the type they are serving.             Unless schools
     can find a way of mixing individuals                  of different    types within one school, there is no way to break this equilibria.
     The only such tool would                 involve     price discrimination        which,     we argue in the text, is unlikely                to arise and is
     politically     infeasible       in a model such as ours.

Deftition:      An equilibrium          (J,p, t,x,.s,.s~)under $tate program x is a list of population assignments

                sc R ~, and private school quality levels sP= R fs (there are 45 types) such that:2G

                    (i) prices clear the market; i.e. there is no excess demand or supply for any house;

                    (ii) all local government budgets balance;

                (iii) consumers cannot gain utility by moving and/or changing schools;

                (iv) local property tax rates are determined through majority rule;

                    (v) if positive, private school spending in each school is equal to the most preferred

                        spending level by its homogeneous customers;

                (iv) any net costs the state government                        incurs under state program x must be fully

                        financed through a proportional state income tax.27



     As noted already, Nechyba (1996a) proved the existence of equilibria in the presence of peer

effects (spillovers) when there are no private schools. Extending the mere existence result to the

case of private schools is trivial: simply assume that there are no public schools. In that case,

everyone attends a private school and votes for zero spending on public schools (given that they

have chosen private schools). Existence of this new but trivial equilibrium                                    can be shown by the

same methods as employed in Nechyba (1996a). Similar somewhat less trivial equilibria in which a

subset of the local communities                 provide no public education              can be shown to exist. However, the

interesting type of equilibrium                in this model is one that generates, under certain policies, a mix of

public and private education in each community.                           The stratification        results in Nechyba (1996a)

suggest that, when preferences                   are identical and communities               are sufficiently       different in their

inherent desirability (i.e. when utility functions are identical and the kti’s                              in those utility functions

are sufficiently different as in this model), the ptiition                       of agents into communities in the presence

26   Note that J = {Jti    c N I p(Jmh)=v(Cmh)           v (m,h)~ MxH ) and C are both partitions       of N. The difference,    however,
     is that C assigns houses (and the irritiat distribution        of agents)    to house types and communities,       while J gives the
     equilibrium     assignment   of agents to houses and communities.         For a more formal definition of both an economy and an
     equilibrium,    see Nechyba (1996a).
27   We also use an analogous equilibrium          concept for the last case considered    in this paper in which local governments    no
     longer fund public education          but rather   the state government     takes over this funding.    In that case, condition   (ii)
     changes   to read “the s[ate    budget must balance”,       and condition     (iv) reads “the state income    tax rate is determined
     through majority     rule voting. ”
                                                                                                                                        16

of public schools in all communities                 is unique up to a transformation             of prices .28 The computable

model in this paper attempts to find this equilibrium                        and only when it cannot, resorts to the least

trivial equilibrium         (i.e. the equilibrium        under which the fewest possible number of communities

have no public school.) As we will see, however, under some policies, no equilibria with public

schools in every community exist.


2.7. Calibration of the Model

     The utility function in the model is parametrized                      to be consistent with data from several school

districts in Camden County, New Jersey. Other parameters, such as endowments                                        and community

sizes were arbitrarily fixed. The calibration described here is therefore “partial” in the sense that,

while parameter values are picked to be consistent with data, the benchmark equilibria reported in

Table 2 are computed                 (and then observed             to be consistent          with the data). Due to space

considerations,         the specifics of this parameterization              are not reported here (see Nechyba ( 1996c)).

We do note, however, that the model must be re-parameterized for different assumed values of p in

the perceived education             production       process; i.e. in order to keep public school spending levels

consistent         with the data, ~*p must be constant, which means that ~ must be adjusted as our

assumptions          about p change. Finally, we refer the reader to footnote 9 which cautions against

overinterpreting any specific set of simulation numbers.



3. Computation              of and Characteristics               of Equilibria

     Each simdation          begins with the number of private schools set to zero and calculates the “public

school benchmark equilibnum’’without                     private schools. (This process is illustrated in Figure 2).

The CGE program to calculate these benchmark equilibria begins with the information contained in

Table 1 as well as a vector of initial house prices. It iterates to an equilibrium by first fmdin.g local

election outcomes, then determining equilibrium prices given those outcomes, before using those

prices (and the new community compositions)                       to update election results, and so fofi.2g

28   Due to the discreteness     of the house types, however, prices themselves        may vary within small intervals,       as may local
     public good levels.     The computer   program picks the frrst equilibrium      price vector within those intervals that it finds.
     Simulation     tests have shown these intervals to be quite narrow. Furthermore,       simulation   tests indicate that the inherent
     differences    across communities   (the ~’s)    are sufficiently   different to yield uniqueness   of the equilibrium    partition of
     agents.
29   me program is written in GAMS (Generat Algebraic Manipulation               System).
                                                                                                       17



    More precisely,     the program uses the initial data in Table 1 to identify each community’s

median voter who takes prices and everyone’s          location as given. That voter’s optimal choice

determines the community’s       school spending level (and local property tax rate) which, combined

with the endogenously      determined peer level, determines the perceived public school output level.

Given these election results, the program iterates to find equilibrium property values. In particular,

during every iteration, each agent’s optimal location at the current prices is determined, and these

prices are adjusted upward (by a small fixed amount) if the house type in question WM in excess

demand during this and the past iteration and downward (by the same amount) if it was in excess

supply during these iterations. If a particular house type alternated between being in excess demand

and excess supply, the previous two prices Me averaged. This process, while not guaranteed to

converge, typically does converge within twenty iterations. Once equilibrium             prices have been

found, i.e. once excess demands for all houses are zero, the program starts over with a new major

iteration by identifying   median voters in the new community populations.      The process continues

until the perceived     school output levels, the local tax rates and the prices have converged,

Throughout     the process, the value of each agent’s initial house endowment     is used to determine

that agent’s budget. Values typically converge within several major iterations and are only slightly

sensitive to initial prices (subject to scaling).

    The public school benchmark equilibrium         without governmental   interaction    is presented in

Table 2 with     p=O.O (i.e. for the case when parents care only about school spending).          School

spending levels (equal to perceived school output levels in this case) can be interpreted as per pupil

spending by local govemmenu.          The school spending figures fall within the actual range of per

pupil spending on education (roughly between $2500 and $5000) for Camden County in 1987 (for

which the model was calibrated). Agents separate into low, middle, and high income communities,

but there is some overlap due to overlapping        values of the k~~’s (see Table 1). Higher income

communities tend to have higher school spending levels and lower property tax rates, and property

values (the value of yearly housing services) tend to increase in community wealth. The fact that

property values are inversely related to property taxes in Table 2 is simply due to the fact that

property in community      3 is inherently (i.e. all else being equal) more desirable than property in
                                                                                                                           18

community       2 which again is inherently more desirable than property in community                            1. (This is

reflected in the different values of ~            as reported in Table 1.)30

     Note that the only feature of Table 2 that is exogenous is the sum of the entries in the “Income”

column.      Each entry in that column              represents     the average      household       income      within   that

community. Since the average income endowment (see Table 1) is 5, the average of the entries in

the income column will always be equal to 5. Everything else in the table is endogenous. “Wealth”

is defined as the community           average of individual incomes from both private good endowments

and property endowments; “Property” is the average house value in the community; “Prop. Tax” is

the tax rate on the yearly housing services in the community; “School” is the parentally perceived

level of school quality (as defined in equation (5)); “LPSpend” is per pupil spending in local public

schools; “LPeer” is the peer quality level in the local public school; and “%Private” is the fraction

of parents sending their children to private schools. (In later simulation                       tables, “PrPeer” is the

average peer quality level of children attending private schools. ) All dollar values are scaled by

$10,000.

     So f~, the benchmark equilibrium              does not include private schools. Once the public school

equilibrium (of the kind presented thus far) is determined through the algorithm described in Figure

2, we proceed to calculate the actual equilibrium                  with private schools from this public school

benchmark. This process is illustrated in Figure 3. More precisely, we determine each type’s most

preferred     private    school    tuition   level under our assumption              that private     schools     perfectly

discriminate between different peer quality types, taking as given the present location of all agents

as well w all prices, taxes and public school levels. By comparing each agent’s utility under local

public school consumption             to his utility under the new private school option, we determine

whether he is a private or public school consumer.                    We then recalculate         voting outcomes (by

assuming that private school attendees have single peaked preferences over public school levels

30   It has been suggested that, were entrepreneurs     to enter the model, they would choose to build houses solely in
     community 3 because of the higher property values. This is not necessarily the case, Property values here can be
     thought of as the value of both the land the houses are built on arrd the houses themselves, They are higher in
     community 3 than elsewhere because (i) land may be inherently more desirable in community 3 (scenery, lakes, trees,
     etc. ) md (ii) a house of type i in community 3 may be bigger and better than a house of type i in other communities.
     (The fact that houses in atl tiee communities are labeled 1, 2 and 3 should not necessarily be interpreted to mean that a
     house of type i in community m is identical to a house of type i in community m’. These differences could be due to
     exogenous phenomena such as zoning. ) Thus, entrepreneurs would not automatically choose to build in community 3:
     while property values are higher, so are land costs and house construction. The fact that houses are extraordinarily
     expensive in Beverly Hills, for example, does not imply that entrepreneurs will build new houses only in Beverly
     Hills.
                                                                                                                           19


with peak at zero spending). Given these outcomes as well as prices, consumers then choose their

most preferred location and public/private               school simultaneously,         and prices adjust until supply

equals demand. Then a new iteration begins with a new voting stage, a new price adjustment

phase, etc. until the process converges (usually within a few iterations). In many cases, such as in

the benchmwk case reported in Table 2, the addition of the private school option does not change

the initial benchmark equilibrium,            and no private schools arise. In this case, only one iteration in

Figure 3 occurs and simply gives confirmation that the public school benchmark equilibrium is in

fact also an actual equilibrium with the potential for private schools, The reason no private school

arises for the benchmark public school equilibrium                  when p=O (Table 2) is that, in the absence of

peer effec~, disagreements          within communities concerning the level of public school spending are

not sufficiently     large to induce anyone to choose to opt out and pay his most preferred private

school tuition.ql

     Under higher peer effects, we might expect a larger propensity                         of high income/high          peer

quality types to opt out of the public school system. This is, in fact, precisely what happens. Table

3 shows both the Public School Benchmark Equilibrium (i.e. the output from the process in Figure

1) as well as the Actual Equilibrium             (with private schools). Note that the former is considerably

more stratified than the equilibrium             in Table 2 where p was set to O rather than 0,5. This is an

observation      that will, ceteris paribus, hold throughout             the simulation      results we present in this

paper: In the absence of private schools, increased perceived peer effects lead to larger residential

stratification    of agents based on income and wealth, wre                   stratified property values as well as

more stratified public outcomes. When we allow for the existence of private schools, however, as

peer effects get large, private schools appear in low income communities                               (see Table 3(b)).

Furthermore,      these private schools decrease the level of residential stratification                  as high income

residents find it advantageous         to settle in low income neighborhoods             (to avoid house payments in

31   The reader may express some initial skepticism at this point because the model so far predicts no private schools while
     we do observe private schools in the real world. We have three conunents in this regard: (i) If peer effects were larger,
     as we will see shortly, we would see very high income individuals form private schools. (ii) If some individuals have
     strong preferences for private (perhaps religious) education, our framework would predict the private schools to arise
     even in the absence of peer effects (see Long and Toma ( 1988)). (iii) The current model looks at moderate to middle
     income households earning between $20,000 and $80,00C. The absence of substantially wealthier individuals is in
     part responsible for the lack of interest in any private school in the absence of peer effects (see Schmidt (1992)). Our
     suspicion is that private school enrollments in the presence of Tiebout stratification are primarily due to inherent
     preferences for some particular form of private (especially religious) education as well as the presence of very high
     income families. These types of individuals are not the focus of the present analysis.
                                                                                                                           20


high income neighborhoods             that capitalize good public schools) and attend private schools. Thus,

while community 1‘s average income is substantially higher due to these different location patterns

caused by the private school, the increase in peer group effects in that community’s                         public school

is small in comparison            (and uncharacteristic         of the rest of the simulation            results reported

below. 32) The peer level in the private school, however,                       is 0.5333 which indicates           that the

average parental income of students attending that school is 8 (0.5333 times 15) which is the

highest income of any agent in the model. Thus, private schools are occupied by high income

agents who reside in low income communities in order to take advantage of private schools, The

perceived public school quality, however, rises not because of the small increase in the peer quality

in community        1‘s public school, but more because of increased per pupil spending on public

education. This increase occurs as more local funds per pupil are available due to lower public

school enrollment in community             1 and as those attending private schools pay a disproportionately

lmge share of local taxes (because they reside in the best houses) while not consuming any of the

locally provided public education.            (The fact that the private school attendees now vote for zero

public school spending does not change the median voter result sufficiently                          to offset the former

positive impact on per pupil spending.)

     In moving from the equilibrium             without private schools (Table 3(a)) to the equilibrium                 with

private schools (Table 3(b)), the migration of high income residents comes from the middle income

community. Thus, while we see an increase in all variables in the poorest community as a result of

the migration,      the middle income community                suffers from lower property             values as well as

decreased spending and peer effects in its public school. Community 3, on the other hand, remains

largely unaffected       as its high income residents are still sufficiently                satisfied with their public

schools. As we show in the next table, however, ~ peer effects rise further, private schools show

an increasing presence in all three communities.

     In Table 4, we report average community variables for levels of p ranging from O to 0.7. (As

32   As demonstrated below, the introduction of private schools more commonly leads to a decline in peer quality in low
     income public schools. The small increase in peer quality here is due to capitalization effects that increased the total
     income of a small low income segment of the population (that is endowed with community                   l/type 2 houses)
     sufficiently for them to reside in community 2 rather than community 1. They are replaced by some residents of
     community 1 who used to reside in higher quality houses in that community, thus opening the higher quality houses for
     some higher income residents who choose the public schools. These effects are usually minor (see the relatively small
     change in individual house values) compared to otiers and therefore play virtually no role irr the rest of tie paper.
                                                                                                                          21


indicated previously,        it makes little sense to push p much closer to 1 because of the substantial

empirical evidence that suggests parents in fact do care about public school spending. Furthermore,

even at p=O.7, public schools have already almost disappeared as peer effects are large enough for

enough agen~ to forego the public sector, consume individualized                       private education instead and

vote public schools out of existence. ) Although these results are not surprising, they are illustrative

of the potential importance of peer effects m well as the potentially misguided emphasis by state

supreme courts on per pupil spending. When p=o and local communities                             use property taxation,

communities        are stratified    along income and wealth lines not because there is any inherent

advantage from having high income neighbors but rather because the demand for public education

and housing       is monotonic       in income. Thus, stratification           occurs due to differences           in final

demands for public outputs and houses. As p rises, however, there is an inherent advantage high

income individuals gain by segregating themselves (assuming, as is done here, that peer quality is

perfectly correlated       with family income). As a result, Table 3 shows an increasing                        degree of

stratification along income and wealth lines with increasing values of p until peer effects become

large enough to cause the appearance of private schools. As soon as private schools appear, we

observe less residential stratification: 33 once private schools for high income individuals become

an option, desirable houses in low income communities                       become sought after by high income

individuals    who migrate to take advantage of lower prices without having to endure bad public

schools. Again, the appearmce           of private schools catering to high income residents in community

1 does not improve local public schools directly; but indirectly, the fact that more money is now

available per pupil more than offsets, in the eyes of parenh, the lower peer quality levels in the

public schools. Peer effects thus have the potential of driving the local public goods economy

towards substantially       larger inequities, but cream skimming private schools can stop and reverse

that trend. It is worth emphasizing          again that those choosing priva~ schools in poor communities

are not the original (pre-private schools) residents of those communities                      but rather high income

migrants who are fleeing communities              in which they would be paying a premium for their house

due to relatively      good public schools. Furthermore,              we see the fraction of students in private

33   This is mnsistent with stylized trends and anecdotal evidence from many US cities in which Catholic Schools open (at
     subsidized tuitions) and cause an in-migration of middle income families who send their children to those schools. It is
     also consisknt with empirical econometric evidence (Dowries and Greenstein (1996)).
                                                                                                      22

schools leveling off at 0.3333 in community     1 because only one third of the houses in community

 1 are sufficiently desirable for high income residents to live there. Thus, once all the residents of

those houses are attending private schools, new private schools begin to open in community 2.

    The voucher simulations in the following section begin with the actual equilibrium (with private

schools) and find the new equilibrium      as different levels of vouchers are introduced.    The new

equilibria are calculated   in much the same way as the initial equilibrium      except that the CGE

program now begins with the initial equilibrium. Each agent’s wealth, however, is now affected by

price changes of his equilibrium    house, not his initial house endowment      (which he sold on his

way to the initial equilibrium.) When different magnitudes of a voucher program are simulated, the

simulation always begins with the initial equilibrium; i.e. the following tables should not be read u

if a program was slowly being phased in.



4. Private    School   Vouchers

    Throughout     this paper, we will simulate a very simple voucher program, under which each

resident of each community     is entitled to a voucher of the amount specified by the program. The

state government commits to re-imburse private schools for the face value of the voucher, which

thus allows residents to use their voucher as part of their tuition. If the face value of the voucher is

larger than the tuition of a school, then the school gets paid the tuition and the state keeps the

difference. Thus, in equilibrium,   tuition is never set below voucher levels. The state pays for the

voucher program through an income tax which residenN/voters         know at the time they make their

moving and voting decisions.


4.1. Private School Vouchers in hcally     Financed School Systems

    Table 5 presents equilibrium    community    averages for all three communities    under different

levels of state vouchers when all financing for the public school system occurs at the local level.

We report here results      for both p=O and p=O.5. In the case of p =0, the results          are very

straightforward.   Since peer effects do not matter and since agents have already chosen school

distric~ in part based on per pupil spending, no one chooses to use vouchers until the level of the

voucher comes close to the level of current local public spending in one of the communities.       (It is

conceivable   that some agents could want significantly     more spending     than is provided in any
                                                                                                                               23


community        and thus chooses to make use of vouchers early on. However,                              agents are already

sufficiently segregated, and there are no extremely high income agents whose demand for spending

would be sufficiently high in the model. This means that vouchers are not used until they are close

to current spending levels.) Once vouchers are sufficiently high for some agenm to use them, all

agents in that community will use them which implia                     the local public school collapses from lack of

public support, and property taxes fall to zero .34 Thus, it is extremely difficult to get a mixture

between public and private schools within communities                       when p=O. For this reason, while we will

continue to report results for p=O when they offer insights into different institutional                                funding

mechanisms, we will forego reporting voucher simulations for the uninteresting case of p=O.35

     When p=O.5, individual responses become more subtle. From the column “PrPeer” in Table

5(b) it is apparent that the first to make use of vouchers are high income (high peer quality)

studen~. Furthermore,          private schools arise first in poor communities                  as private school attendees

migrate from high income weas. As “good houses” in community                             1 are “used up,” private schools

appear in community 2; and as they are used up there m well, private schools finally appear in the

wealthy community.            All along, migration          of income is from relatively              high income areas to

relatively    low income areas which causes communities                         to become less stratified           in income,

property values and wealth levels. This decrease in residential stratification,                           however, does not

benefit public schools in poor communities                    whose peer quality levels are falling as high peer

quality students leave for either private schools or, more often, other communities                                 with better

public schools.       These are the residents            that originally      occupied       the best houses in the poor

communities       which they sell to high income immigrants who come for the private school. Thus,

public school peer quality levels fall in poor communities                          with the introduction          of vouchers

because high peer quality resident-s are leaving for other cotnmunities and are not replaced in the

public schools by high peer quality immigrants                     who choose private schools. At the same time,

however, as the pool of local public school students shrinks while public support for local public

schools remains above 50%, the median voter public spending outcome produces more funding

34   In some earfier simulations we assumed that public schools would always be available at $2500 per pupil, regardless of
     whether the voting outcome suggests less spending is desired. In those simulations, the transition from the public to
     the private school system in the presence of peer effects is somewhat smoother.
35   Qua~itative results are the same for different reasonable values of p, In particular,   we tried values of p ranging from 0.3
     to 0,6.
                                                                                                                          24


per pupil as voucher levels increase.sb Thus, per pupil spending on public education in poor

communities rises at the same time as peer quality levels fall. Under the specification of p=O.5 (as

well as most other reasonable             specifications      we tried), however,        the former of these effects

outweighs      the latter to produce a higher perceived               level of public school quality in the poor

communi~       as vouchers grow. This occurs up to the point when voter support for public schools

falls below 50~0 at which time the local public school collapses and everyone in community                            1 uses

the private school vouchers.

     The common notion that private school vouchers will cause lower school quality in local public

schools therefore does not necessarily hold in a local public finance economy unless we think that

spending matters sufficiently little as compared to peer effects. In fact, the perceived public school

quality suffers only in community              3, the wealthiest      community,       which is losing high income

residents to private schools in other communities                  and thus is losing both peer quality and the

constituency for high per pupil spending. Therefore, all three indicators of quality (spending, peer

effects and parental perceptions) fall, while at lewt two of these rise or stay constant in the other

communities.       This implies that, contra~         to commn       perceptions,     it is public schools in wealthy

communities       that suffer unambiguously         from voucher systems while those in poor communities

might benefit. Far from increwing            inequities in public education, simulations             in Table 5 actually

demonstrate that vouchers, while not benefiting                low income residents directly unless they are of

high enough face value, can help equalize local public school quality.


4.2. Private School Vouchers in State Funded Public School System

     We now turn to comparing             the results from Table 5 to those in Table 6 in which all public

education is assumed to be funded by the state government                       through a proportional         income tax

whose rate is set in accordance with majority nde voting by all voters in the state. Furthermore, the

state government is assumed to spend equal amoun~ per pupil on students in all schools regardless

of community        income.37 (This is essentially           the California     post-Semano,       post-Proposition       13

36   Since those attending private schools have single peaked preferences for local school spending with pe& at zero, an
     increase in the fraction of local residents who send their children to private schools thus causes the median voter, all
     else being equal, to shift toward less spending. However, this is more than offset by the fact that the private school
     attendees live in the best houses and therefore pay a dispro~rtionately      large share of local property taxes without
     tting   advantage of local public schools. Thus, per pupil spending in public schools increases.
37   We do not address here the issue of whether average per pupil spending rises or falls as a result of a state takeover of
                                                                                                                      25

system. ) Having seen the intuitive results from the p-+ case in the previous table, we do not repeat

this exercise for the rest of the policy environments.

    First, we can note that equality of spending certainly does not guarantee equality of outcomes.

Unless we think that spending           is the only input into education            that matters, the substantial

stratification of income across communities before the introduction of vouchers yields substantially

unequal outcomes when peer effects matter. While this is a simple point, it is often overlooked by

policy makers and courts who tend to focus solely on variances in per pupil spending levels as a

memu.re of interjurisdictional     inequity in the provision of education.

    Second, the pattern of school voucher use is substantially                the same as in the previous table.

Private schools develop first in the poor community              but are catering to high income immigrants

while middle to high income residents of the poor community emigrate to other communities. Peer

levels in the low income public school therefore fall while per pupil spending levels rise so long as

there is above 50% public support for public education within the community,                          Again, the two

effects are offsetting    and parental impressions          of public school quality in the community                rise

modestly (while this time they fall in the middle community). Furthermore, property values rise in

the poor community. As the most desirable houses become occupied with private school attendees

in the poor community,       private schools again begin to develop in the middle income community

and then finally, at extremely high voucher levels, in community 3.

    While the patterns of private school use and development                 under the state funded system are

therefore similar to those under local funding,             the speed of the privatization           of education      as

voucher levels rise is surprisingly         slower under state funding than under local funding. One

would, perhaps, expect that high income residents will respond to vouchers sooner under state

funding because they are farther from their ideal level of spending than they would be under local

funding. However, one of the reasons high income residents are so eager to use private schools

under local public funding is that, once they migrate to the poor community, they no longer have to

pay as high a property tax bill. Under state funding, this advantage of migrating and attending

private schools vanishes as high income residen~               must pay income taxes to support the public

system regardless of where they live.

   education finance. Sinm our model does not contain the skewedness of income distributions   which is important in such
   analysis (see Sons telie and Silva (1995)), it would be ill-suited for this purpose.
                                                                                                           26


    Furthermore, we note that, compared to a locally funded system, a state financed system does

not yield ne~ly as many fiscal benefits for public schools in poor distric~. Under a local system,

an exit of some community          residents   into the private system translates      into larger per pupil

spending in the public school in that community.            Under a state system, on the other hand, this

same exit leads to an increase in per pupil spending              spread across the entire state and not

concentrated      in one community.    This translates into a much smaller improvement           in per pupil

spending (and no darease       in the interjurisdictional   variance) under the state controlled system than

under local funding and control. At the same time, however, public schools, at least in the eyes of

parents, are still improving despite the outmigration          of high income#zigh peer students from the

public school system in poor communities.            Finally, in contrast to the previous case, the public

school in the wealthy community no longer suffers but rather benefits because now, it too receives

additional per pupil funding as individuals shift into private schools.


4.3. Private School Vouchers Under bcal          Financing Combined with State Foundation Grants

    Table 7 presents community         averages under different levels of per pupil foundation         grants

funded through a state income tax. (Note that all entries in this table assume the absence of any

vouchers program. ) Each community is constrained to spend at least the amount of the foundation

grant on public schools and is free to add additional per pupil spending funded by local, voter-

determined property taxes. These foundation grants are similar to the “redistributive          block granm”

analyzed in Nechyba ( 1996 b). Since the grants have only small income effects and no price (or

substitution)     effecw, they Me extremely ineffective at raising per pupil spending in any district

unless the foundation grant is greater than what the community             would have spent to begin with.

For example,       in Table 7(a) where p=O, public spending            essentially   remains   unchanged    in

community 1 until the foundation grant rises to 0.30 per pupil and thus is binding. The major effect

of the grants (which are redistributive in the sense that low income communities receive grants that

are larger than the income taxes paid by its residents to fund the grants) is to make low income

communities slightly more desirable and high income communities               slightly less desirable. This is

reflected in the slight convergence        of property values, income levels and wealth levels. The

interesting     difference in Table 7(b) where p=O. 50 lies in the response of private schools to the
                                                                                                       27

increase in foundation grants. So long as these grants are not binding on any community,          private

schools continue    to exist. In fact, when the foundation      grant reaches 0.20, we see a further

migration of high income residents from communities 2 and 3 into community          1 to take advantage

of lower property valu~ and private schools. This is due to the fact that the redistributive nature of

the grants makes these high income communities somewhat less desirable and thus persuades some

of its residents   to opt out of the public school system.      Once the foundation     grant binds in

community 1, however, private schools collapse and their high income/high peer quality clients no

longer choose the low income district. They are replaced by lower and middle income residents

from the other communities     who now find it worthwhile      to return to community   1 as the public

schools have improved; i.e. they now outbid the potential high income immigrants             for the best

houses in community     1.

    Table 8 proceeds to simulate the general equilibrium         effects of different levels of simple

vouchers in the presence of a foundation      grant system of 0.40. While the evolution       of private

schools with increases in vouchers is the same as before for exactly the same reasons, the effects

on public schools from the same type of private school vouchers are now substantially          different:

By all measures of school quality (pure spending, pure peer effects and parental perceptions),

public schools in all communities    deteriorate as higher levels of vouchers are introduced. In the

poor community,    for example, the fact that the foundation grants are given in per pupil amounts,

and the fact that the grant is sufficiently large to be binding, implies that local per pupil spending

remains the same as relatively high peer quality students are leaving the local public system for

other school districts without being replaced by the high income immigrants          who are choosing

private schools. Thus, the peer quality falls in the community’s        public school while per pupil

spending does not rise as it did under local financing and, to a lesser extent, understate    financing.

There is, therefore, no opposing effect to the deterioration   of public schools brought about by the

decline in peer quality, which means parental assessments of the local public schools fall (which in

turn pushes further high peer quality students into private schools and out of the community).

While vouchers still have the eflect of decreasing the stratification   of income, wealth and property

values across communities,     they can no longer improve education for both public and private

students under a binding foun~tion    grant system.jg
                                                                                                                        28


4,4. Private School Vouchers under A System of heal                  Financing and District Power Equalization

     Finally, we examine the effect of private school vouchers under district power equalization

(DPE). DPE is a state program that sets a guaranteed per pupil tax base Pi for each community i

and guarantees the community a per pupil spending of <Pi. If the actual per pupil tax base is below

the guaranteed base, the state government makes up the difference; if the actual level is above the

guaranteed base, the state government collec~ the balance and uses it to fund the paymenw to low

base communities.        As demonstrated       in Nechyba (1996b), this system is equivalent to as ystem of

positive and negative matching grants that contains both income and price (substitution)                          effects.

We will assume here that the state program is revenue neutral; that is, the bases are set in such a

way as to insure that the sum of the negative payments to high income communities                         is equal to the

sum of positive payments to low income communities.                   Furthermore, we will say that a program is

“xYobase equalizing” if it sets bases such that the high income community’s base is XYOhigher than

the middle income community’s               base which in turn is XYOhigher than the poor community’s.

When x–+, we will call the program “FuH Revenue Neutral District Power Equalization.”

     Table 9 summhzes          the general equilibrium effects of different degrees of revenue neutral DPE

assuming both p=O and p=O.5. (These resul~ are in the absence of any voucher programs.) For

the same reasons m in the last section, increasing equalization leads to decreases in stratification in

income, wealth and property values. (Due to the additional price effects of the implicit matching

grants, these effects are somewhat larger.) Also for similar reasons, private schools collapse with

increasing    degrees of district power equalization              as public schools improve in poor districts

causing middle income residents              to return to the better houses in community                  1. Unlike the

foundation     grants, DPE is, however, effective at reducing                 public school spending disparities

between school districts even at low levels of the program. This is a direct result of the fact that,

unlike foundation grants, DPE lowers the price of public schools substantially in poor communities

and raises it substantially in high income communities.               As can be seen from Table 9(a), it is easily

possible for a full DPE program to even reverse the order of communities                         in terms of their per

pupil spending levels.sg

38   This is, in spiri~ similar to the Epple and Romano ( 1996) and Manski (1992) result in that the level of public school
     spending in the poor community is exogenous to the local political process. Therefore, the positive fiscal benefits
     from having high income residenk who do not use local public schools do not wise.
                                                                                                                        29


     Next we demonstrate the general equilibrium effects of private school vouchers in the presence

of district power equalization         in Table 10. The striking feature in this table is the very different

pattern of private school development              compared to all three previous institutional              settings. In

particular, while under local financing, state financing, and foundation                    gran~ it was always the

case that private schools appeared slowly and in poorer communities                        first, we see here a rapid

switch to private schools in the wealthiest community. While high income residents do migrate into

the poor community and a modest amount of private school activity takes place there as the level of

vouchers increases, the bulk of private school attendance occurs in community 3 for most levels of

the voucher program. Once the most desirable houses in community                       1 are filled with high income

private school attendees, the remaining homes are held by residen~ who value the DPE-improved

local public school. Similarly, only a limited number of houses are available to high income private

school attendees in community             2 which still leaves a large number of high income agents in

community 3 who are dissatisfied with the DPE-induced                    reduction in educational quality in their

public schools. Furthermore,          unlike in the case of state funding or foundation gran~, residents of

high income communities can eliminate the adverse price effec~ from DPE by switching to private

schools. (This is because redistribution           to low income communities          occurs only to the extent that

the high income community has positive tax rates. If everyone in community 3 switches to private

schools, local tax rates can fall to zero and thus stop redistribution.)               Thus, a sufficient number of

community 3 residents choose to abandon the public school system to remove public support from

the system and drive property tax rates in community                  3 to zero. We thus see the collapse of the

public school system first in the wealthiest             community      under DPE because that community                 is

under extreme adverse pressuresfiom              the DPE program, pressures that can be eliminated (unlike

foundation grants) by aban~ning            the public school system.

     While per pupil spending rises in community               1 as a result of the exit from the public system,

this increase is not nearly m big as it would have been had the public schools in community                              3

survived. The collapse of those schools severely undermines                     district power equalization        which

relies on revenues from the high income districts to finance price subsidies to low income districts,

39   For a more complete treatment of the relative differences between district power equalization and foundation grants on
     both local and state government behavior within the context of this model, see Nechyba ( 1996 b).
                                                                                                       30

As a result, while per pupil spending does rise and help offset the decline in peer quality in the low

income public schools (from the exit to the private system), it is now no longer sufficient to cause

an improvement in parental perceptions of educational quality in that community. Thus, unlike the

case of pure local funding as well as state finding,      parental perceptions   of public school quality

falls in all three communities.      This decrease is not, however, as large as the decrease observed

underfoundation      grants. The latter is true because, while per pupil spending remains constant as

high peer quality students        leave for other schools under binding foundation     grants, per pupil

spending can (and does) nevertheless rise under DPE. Thus, even if the effect is not large enough,

there is a positive effect on local public spending (that does not have a parallel under foundation

grants) as vouchers are introduced under.


5. Summary,        Limitations,      Empirical    Questions    and Conclusion

    This paper has extended the literature on computational        models of private school choice by

endogenizing     local public outcomes and local populations,     and by considering   how competition

affects local public schools under a variety of institutional        settings. While we have reported

simulation results mainly for the case in which parents perceive peer effects to be as important as

per pupil spending,     the results also hold for other reasonable    levels of perceived peer quality

effects. We can thus come to some broad genertizations        and point to open empirical questions:

1. In the absence of private schools, the presence of peer effects causes substantial increases in

    interjutisdictio nal stratification   and inequities in the provision of public schools. While even

    under zero peer effec~ we expect disparities         to arise due to different demands for public

    spending by different income groups in different communities, the presence of peer effects that

   are correlated with socioeconomic        status provides additional incentives for high income types

    to separate into their own communities.      As perceived peer effects become unrealistically high,

   individuals    abandon the public schools to attend more tailor-made private schools. Although

   we have argued strongly that the available evidence points to the presence of such perceived

   peer effec~, to what extent peer effects play a large role in improving actual school quality

   remains an unsettled empirical question. The normative interpretation          of our positive results

   clearly depends critically on a more objective definition and understanding of school quality.
                                                                                                                 31

2. Throughout    the analysis, whenever private schools arise either because of high peer quality

   effects or because of private school vouchers, stratification           of income, wealth and property

   values across communities      becomes weaker. More precisely, high income/high                     peer quality

   types migrate to low income communities            with the intention of paying lower house prices and

   taxes and sending their children to private school. Thus, private schools appear first in poor

   communities, but they cater not to the original residents but rather to high income immigrants.

3. Although     the emergence    of private schools thus causes greater interjurisdictional                 mixing

   between income types, public schools in poor communities                 lose high peer quality students.

   This occurs because      those leaving       to make room for the high income,               private-school-

   consuming immigranw are the former residents of the best houses in the poor community who

   are also the highest income residen~. These parents and students leave the local public system

   in the poor community     not with the intention of attending private schools but rather to attend

   public schools elsewhere.      They leave because the higher income immigrants                      who wish to

   attend private schools are willing to pay more for the houses the emigrants originally occupied.

4. The previous two poinu can be summarized             as follows: The presence of private schools (and

   the introduction    of vouchers)       increases    school-based       stratification   while it decreases

   residence-based     stratification.      This decrease   in residence-based        stratification     (which is

   consistent with some evidence cited in the text) creates fiscal benefits for public school students

   in poor ~eas when public schools are funded, at least in part, locally. More precisely, those

   moving into the community        do not use local public schools but still pay a disproportionately

   large share of local taxes. Therefore, even though they may vote for less spending, per pupil

   spending rises (unless more than 50% of voters send their children to private schools, )

5. To the extent that peer quality matters not only in schools but also in communities in general (m

   suggested    by Durlauf (1996), Wilson (1987), Jencks and Mayer (1990), Crane (1991) and

   others), the decrease in residential stratification       is a positive effect of vouchers that has not

   previously been emphasized.       We do not, however, explore these neighborhood                effec~ in the

   current paper. If neighborhood        externalities are primarily positive and run from higher income

   agents to lower income         agents,     the descriptive   results    of the analysis      do not change
                                                                                                            32


   substantially.    (High income individuals still move to good houses in low and middle income

   neighborhoods       when sending      their children   to private   schools.)    At the same time, the

   interpretation    of the results would change because the decrease in residential           stratification

   would then not only be potentially          equity-enhancing    (because of fiscal benefits to those

   attending public schools in low income communities)            but also efficiency enhancing in that

   greater residential mixing of agenu is Pareto improving. However, if negative neighborhood

   externalities    also run from low income agents to high income agents, the migration effects

   might be muted, and no clear efficiency interpretation         could be given. Unfortunately,        while

   there is widespread     speculation    that non-school related neighborhood        effects are important,

   there is little agreement exactly what form these externalities take. Furthermore,           there is little

   empirical evidence regarding the extent to which perceived neighborhood              peer effects (which

   motivate migration choices) differ from actual neighborhood effects.

6. The extent to which the loss in public school peer quality in low income communities (resulting

   from an increase in vouchers) affects public school quality depends on the degree to which

   parental perceptions     of the relative importance      of peer quality are correct as well as the

   institutional    setting used to finance public education.      Under both local funding and state

   funding, per pupil spending rises in the poor community and more than offsets the loss in peer

   quality if parental perceptions       are accurate (or if they overestimate      the importance    of peer

   effects). Under foundation      grants and district power equalization,         on the other hand, local

   public schools worsen in the poor community             because per pupil spending        either remains

   constant or does not rise sufficiently much to offset the losses in peer quality (unless parents

   are overestim sting the importance        of peer effects. ) Our simulations      suggest that if we are

   primarily concerned about parental perceptions about public school quality in poor communities

   (or, for that matter, about per pupil spending         in poor public schools),      vouchers     are most

   desirable under a locally funded school system and become progressively less desirable under

   state funding, district power equalization and foundation aid. Again, better empirical evidence

   on which of our “quality” measures (parenti        perceptions, spending, or peer quality) accurately

   reflect actual school quality is needed for a full normative analysis of our positive results.
                                                                                                        33


7. Finally, the results also have implications regarding the targeting of vouchers. It is often ~gued

    that the equity implications     of private voucher proposals become significantly    more favorable

    when the vouchers         are targeted at low income residents    or at low income communities.

    However,       the distinction   between   these two ways of targeting    is quite important.    If the

    vouchers Me targeted at low income parents, our simulation resdh          indicate that they will have

    to be of fairly high face value in order to convince low income parents to opt out of the public

    system. If however,        they are targeted to low income communities         (as recently done in

    California),    then our resul~ remain intact as long as immigrmts       into those communities    can

    make use of vouchers as well. Again, high income residents will migrate to take advantage of

    the vouchers which is something they are already doing in the model even when vouchers are

    not targeted. Thus, our analysis suggesw that targeting either makes the program less effective

    or is no different than an untargeted program depending on how the targeting is accomplished.

    We would like to conclude by emphasizing          that, while we think these results are new in the

literature and quite relevant for thinking more deeply about vouchers, several limitations shodd be

kept in mind. First, many of our interpretations may have to be modtiled as new empirical evidence

regarding the issues raised in the points above emerges. Second, we have assumed that all agents

in this model are perfectly informed. Often, a criticism of vouchers has been that low income

parents may not be informed           enough   to make use of vouchers,      and thus previous      models

overpredic t the effectiveness       of vouchers in getting low income parents to exert competitive

pressures on their public schools. While we think that this is a valid criticism, it is not as relevant

for our restits as it was in the previous literature. In particular, low income agents are not the ones

choosing to use the vouchers, at least not at relatively low voucher levels. Rather, high income

residenfi that migrate into low income communities        are using the vouchers and, we think, can be

expected to be more informed. Those residents in poor districw that are leaving the the low income

public schools are not doing so because they are choosing to use vouchers but rather because

market pressures drive them to move to a different community and a different public school.

   Third, one of the major political hurdles to implementing         vouchers is that currently a large

number of children already attend private schools. A broad voucher program will thus be costly
                                                                                                                       34

even if it does not achieve any change in behavior. In our model, however, few children attend

private schools without a voucher program. We commented before that we think this is due to the

fact that we have assumed identical preferences for all agents while, in the real world, some agents

have preferences for particular forms of private education quite apart from anything having to do

with spending levels or straight peer effects. Our model does not capture those types of private

school consumers.        Also we have not explicitly considered             agents with very high incomes who

would choose private schools even under the current assumption if identical preferences.

     Fourth, in the absence of construction           and renovation, migration only occurs to the extent to

which acceptable         housing    can be found in low income communities .40 We think that most

communities       are in fact not perfectly homogeneous              in housing quality and that at least some

relatively    more attractive      housing opportunities       exist even in most low income jurisdictions.

Furthermore, although more empirical studies are needed, available anecdotal evidence regarding

subsidized Catholic schools suggests that middle income agents often do, in fact, migrate to low

income communities to take advantage of private schools there. Keeping in mind that all agents in

our model are “middle income” (given a top household income of $80,000), this is consistent with

our results. The inclusion         of very high income agents, however, would result in those agents

choosing private schools without migrating from the best houses located in the best communities.

     Finally, we should emphasize once again that we have made a series of assumptions                          that we

thought, a priori, very much “stacked the deck” against vouchers. By assuming away all beneficial

effects from increased        competition     because all schools, public and private, are efficient even

without      vouchers,   we have eliminated          the main economic            argument   in favor of vouchers,

Furthermore, we assumed private schools are extreme “cream skimmers” that discriminate against

low income/low peer quality students. Thus, we have not only eliminated the common efficiency

argument for vouchers but also assumed a private sector that seems less than equity oriented. Still,

we demonstrate       that the equity argument against vouchers holds only under certain institutional

settings or when school peer effecfi are larger than recognized                    by parents. Furthermore,        since

vouchers are demonstrated           to reduce residential       stratification,    they may bring about positive

neighborhood effects in low income communities that have not been part of the previous analysis.

40   The model could also be extended to include construction and renovation which would strengthen our migration results
     as well as give rise to them even if housing was uniformly bad in low inmme communities to begin with,

a The actual specification   of the utility function in the CGE programs    contains an additional      arguments     (a state public good)
  with Cobb Douglas coefficient CC=O.13. While in past papers (Nechyba (1996b,c)) the level of state public good spending has
  been determined endogenously, it is exogenous in this model (set consistent with New Jersey data) and financed through an
  exogenously set state income tax. Thus, it becomes a constant and irrelevant for tie choices analyzed in the current paper.

    Property tax rates may appear high because they are tax rates on annual payments,                not on the full value
    of the property.
d   “School”   represents   parentally   perceived      school quality (which is the same as school spending         in this
    simulation because of the absence of peer effects).
e   “LPSpend” is per pupil spending on education in the local public school.
f   “LPeer” is tie peer quality level in the local public school.
