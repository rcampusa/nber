                                         ABSTRACT


       The intertemporal approach views the current-account balance as the outcome of forward-

looking dynamic saving and investment decisions. This paper, a chapter in the forthcoming third

volume of the Handbook of International Economics, surveys the theory and empirical work on

the intertemporal approach as it has developed since the early 1980s. After reviewing the basic

one-good, representative-consumer model, the paper considers a series of extended models

incorporating relative prices, complex demographic structures, consumer durables, asset-market

incompleteness, and asymmetric information. We also present a variety of empirical evidence

illustrating the usefulness of the intertemporal approach, and argue that intertemporal models

provide a consistent and coherent foundation for open-economy policy analysis. As such, the

intertemporal approach should supplant the expanded versions of the Mundell-Fleming IS-LM

model that currently furnish the dominant paradigm used by central banks, finance minisuies, and

international economic agencies.

1 Introduction
The intertemporal approach views the current-account balance as the out-
come of forward-looking dynamic saving and investment decisions. Intertem-
poral analyses of the current account became conunon in the early 1980s as
a result of papers by Buiter (1981), Obstfeld (1982), Sachs (1981), Svensson
and Razin (1983), and many others, although the approach had explicit pre-
cursors in work on trade and growth by Bardhan (1967), Bruno (1970), and
Hamada (1969).1 As usual, this new focus in open-economy macroeconomics
resulted both from theoretical advances in other parts of economics and from
economic events that existing open-economy models seemed ill equipped to
examine.
    Lucas's (1976) influential critique of econometric policy evaluation was
one important theoretical motivation for an intertemporal approach. Lucas's
insistence on grounding policy analysis in the actual forward-looking decision
rules of economic agents suggested that open-economy models might yield
more reliable policy conclusions if demand and supply functions were derived
from the optimization problems of households and firms rather than specified
to match reduced-form estimates based on ad hoc econometric specifications.
    Further impetus to develop an intertemporal approach came from events
in the world capital market, especially the substantial current-account im-
balances that followed the sharp world oil-price increases of 1973-74 and
1979-80. The divergent patterns of current-account adjustment by industri-
alized and developing countries raised the inherently intertemporal problem
of characterizing the optimal dynamic response to external shocks. Neither
the classical monetary models nor the Keynesian models in vogue at the time
offered reliable guidance on this question. Similarly, the explosion in recycled
bank lending to developing countries after the first oil shock sparked fears
that borrowers' external debt levels might become unsustainable. The need
to evaluate developing-country debt levels again led naturally to the notion
of an intertemporally optimal current-account deficit.
    This chapter surveys the theory and empirical work on the intertem-
poral approach to the current account as it has developed since the early
   'A number of studies published in the early 1980s based exchange-rate or balance-
of-payments models on intertemporal foundations. These contributions axe surveyed in
the chapter by Maurice Obstfeld and Alan C. Stockman in volume 2 of this Handbook
(Obstfeld and Stockman 1985).


                                        2
19805.2 Recently, some researchers have studied dynamic stochastic inter-
national models with complete Arrow-Debreu forward markets for uncertain
consumption. This particular offshoot of the intertemporal approach is the
'complete-markets' model. Because complete-markets models fit more natu-
rally into Marianne Baxter's chapter in this Handbook, they are summarized
only briefly here. We reserve the term 'intertemporal approach'—as well
as the bulk of our discussion—for models with international borrowing and
lending but not necessarily with complete international markets in state-
contingent claims.
     The chapter begins with an introductory section, Section 2, that explores
the concept of the current account, its behavior in recent history, and the
conceptual adequacy of measures of the current account as reported by gov-
ernment agencies.
     Section 3 lays out basic intertemporal models of the current account,
 starting with the deterministic case and then exploring stochastic models.
 Section 4 shows how stochastic models can be used to devise tests of the
 intertemporal approach, and goes on to evaluate the resulting evidence.
     Much of the discussion through section 4 of this chapter focuses on pos-
 itive predictions of the intertemporal approach. A major advantage of the
 approach, however, is its relevance to normative questions. Section 5 there-
 fore takes up the reasons why an intertermporal approach to the current
 account is essential for sound policy formulation.
     Finally, we note that, given the extensive recent literature this chapter
 aspires to encompass, there are several instances where space permits us
 only to sketch algebraic derivations. We try to alert the reader whenever
 intermediate algebra has been pruned especially severely, so that he or she
 will not become bogged down during a first reading.


2 The current account: Basic concepts and
      historical overview
A country's current-account balance over any time period is the increase in
residents' claims on foreign incomes or outputs, less the increase in similar
foreign-owned claims on home income or output. Thus, in theory, the current
   2For a complementary survey, see Razin (1995).

account includes not only exports less imports (broadly defined to include
all the income on and payouts on cross-border assets: dividends, interest
payments, insurance premia and payments, etc.), but also net capital gains
on existing foreign assets. From the close of World War I until relatively
recently, most countries' holdings of foreign assets had been limited both in
quantity and scope, so the latter consideration was secondary. A focus on
the current account as the net export balance led some economic thinkers to
view relative international prices as its central determinant. Thus was born
the elasticities approach to the current account, under which the determi-
nants of international expenditure levels and incomes are held fixed in the
background while static price elasticities of demand and supply determine
the net international flow of capital.
    As intermediate macroeconomics texts demonstrate, however, the current
account also is national saving less domestic investment. If saving falls short
of desired investment, for example, foreigners must take up the balance, ac-
quiring as a result claims on domestic income or output. This alternative
viewpoint, which led to the absorption approach, stresses how macroeco-
nomic factors must ultimately determine international borrowing or lending
patterns (Alexander 1952).
    The intertemporal approach to current-account analysis extends the ab-
sorption approach through its recognition that private saving and investment
decisions, and sometimes even government decisions, result from forward-
looking calculations based on expectations of future productivity growth,
government spending demands, real interest rates, and so on. The intertem-
poral approach achieves a synthesis of the absorption and elasticities view,
however, by accounting for the macroeconomic determinants of relative prices
and by analyzing the impact of current and future prices on saving and in-
vestment.
    International capital flows, in the form of trade credits. and commercial
traffic in such assets as jewels and precious metals, were akeady common
by biblical times. By the early fourteenth century, Italian banks spanning
Western Europe and the Levant had become large-scale lenders to sovereigns
such as King Edward III of England, whose invasion of France in 1340, aided
by foreign finance, initiated the Hundred Years War. The two most pow-
erful Florentine banking houses, those of the Bardi and the Peruzzi, were
bankrupted along with many lesser banks in 1343 when Edward proved
unable to meet his obligations. But as Europe recovered from this early

                                      4
banking crisis and from the subsequent Black Death (1348), international
financial linkages grew strong once again. The Catholic church, through its
usury doctrine, unwittingly promoted the internationalization of banking in
this period. While domestic loans for interest were prohibited, there was no
definitive ban on exchanges of bills payable in different countries and curren-
cies, even when the terms negotiated included implicit interest charges (de
Roover 1966). Theological constraints thus led the largest banks to maintain
extensive systems of foreign branches.
   The expulsion of the Jews from the Iberian peninsula at the end of the fif-
teenth century, followed by widespread and continuing persecutions of Protes-
tants after the Reformation, created networks of refugee communities with
both the motivation and connections to move capital between countries. Dur-
ing European wars of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, international
capital markets developed further as some governments turned to large-scale
debt sales to foreigners. (See Neal 1990.) By the early nineteenth century
at the latest, the outlines of modern international capital markets are visible
in investors' search for profit opportunities on distant shores. British savers,
for example, helped finance the ill-fated American canal boom in the first
half of the nineteenth century.
     The era of the classical international gold standard, spanning the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, often is held up as a benchmark
case of unfettered capital mobility between nations. Figure 1 shows data
on saving, investment, and their difference, the current account, for a dozen
countries over 1885-1913. (All data are nominal flows divided by a nomi-
 nal income or output measure.)3 The graphs indeed show several examples
of large and protracted current-account imbalances, indicators of extensive
 trade across time. Canada rin persistent deficits which, by the early twenti-
 eth century, approached 20 percent of gross national product (GNP). These
 large flows were undoubtedly promoted by Canada's close political and cul-
 tural links with the United Kingdom, the largest lender. But even countries
 without such close ties to potential lenders were able to draw extensively on
 international capital markets. Japan ran an external deficit of 10 percent of
 national expenditure in financing its 1905 war with Russia. Standing on the
   3These data, as well as those shown in figure 2 below, are from Jones and Obstfeld
(1995). Finland was actually a possession of Russia during the 1885-1913 period, but it
was afforded a fair amount of administrative autonomy.

sidelines during World War I, the country ran a comparable surplus to help
finance the belligerents.4
    Data from the interwar period, shown in figure 2, reveal a partial resur-
gence of net international borrowing and lending as postwar reconstruction
progresses, but this process comes to a sudden halt as restrictions on inter-
national payments proliferate after the onset of the Great Depression.5 Post-
1945 data disclose a reverse evolution. Initially, current-account imbalances
were slight due to official restrictions on international capital movements,
with most industrial-country currencies being inconvertible through 1959.
After the early 1970s (see figure 3), net international capital flows expanded
as a result of petrodollar recycling, the removal of many industrial-country
restrictions on international payments following the adoption of floating ex-
change rates, and technological evolution in the financial industry. By the
1 980s, the largest industrial countries, Germany, Japan, and the United
States, were running substantial external imbalances. At the same time
many developing countries, caught in a debt crisis brought on in part by
vigorous borrowing in the 1970s, found themselves denied access to resource
inflows. Only in the early l990s did this stark borrowing constraint begin to
ease.
    Unfortunately, the saving and investment flows reported in national in-
come and product accounts (NIPA) and shown in figures 1 through 3 don't
always conform closely to theoretically correct concepts of saving and in-
vestment, particularly when international capital mobility is extensive. One
especially serious defect is the failure of NIPA national income measures fully
to reflect capital gains and losses on net foreign assets. During 1991, for ex-
ample, the NIPA measure of saving less investment for the United States,
the current account, was reported by the U.S. Department of Commerce as
—$3.7 billion. The Department of Commerce also calculated, however, that
on a market-value basis, U.S. assets held abroad rose in dollar value by $67.8
billion (more than the entire 1991 increase in holdings of foreign assets by
U.S. residents, $62.2 billion). At the same time, the dollar value of foreign
claims on the U.S. rose by $172.8 billion (more than two-and-a-half times as
large as the 1991 increase in foreign holdings of U.S. assets, $67.0 billion).6

In economic terms, the true dollar U.S. current-account deficit for 1991 is
probably much closer to —$3.7 billion + $67.8 billion — $172.8 = —$108.7
billion than to its simple NIPA measure. And even this figure reflects only
partial coverage of international asset holdings.
    The numbers in figures 1 through 3 are misleading for another reason. As
section 3 shows, it is changes in real, not nominal, asset holdings that matter
for a country's welfare. Thus, NIPA measures of the current account,even
if corrected to include nominal capital gains and losses, must be adjusted as
well to correct for the inflationary erosion of foreign assets' real values.
    These problems plague all of the empiricalliterature discussed in section
4, although it would be possible to remedy them somewhat for a few indus-
trial countries. In empirically evaluating theories it is obviously crucial to
achieve the best possible match between the conceptual framework and the
data brought to bear in testing it.

3 Intertemp oral approaches to the current
       account
A realistic economic model incorporating all elements relevant to the typical
country's current account would be hopelessly complex. Instead of attempt-
ing to construct such a comprehensive model, we turn in this section to a
succession of models that illustrate what we believe to be the key elements in-
fluencing saving-investment balances in the world economy. In following this
strategy, we largely parallel the development of theoretical thinking on the
current account over the past fifteen years An important set of insights can
be derived even from deterministic models; this is our first order of business.
We then introduce uncertainty about the economic environment and deduce
a number of essential modifications of the preceding nonstochastic frame-
work. The introduction of uncertainty is, of course, a prerequisite for the
empirical analysis of the intertemporal approach that we discuss in section
4.
$4.8 billion, differs from the recorded current-account deficit by a statistical discrepancy
of —$1.1 billion.




                                             7
3.1 Deterministic models of the current account
The first broad class of models to be described assumes that individual de-
cision makers have perfect foresight and complete information about their
economic environment. While these models lack realism along some dimen-
sions, they serve at least two very useful purposes. First, they elucidate a
number of questions for which uncertainty is of secondary importance, and
second, they provide a benchmark against which to measure the predictions
of richer stochastic models. As we shall see later, stochastic models in which
real bonds are the only assets countries trade imply responses to shocks sim-
ilar to the impulse responses of deterministic models.

3.1.1 A one-good model with representative national residents
Consider a small open economy that produces and consumes a single com-
posite good and trades freely with the rest of the world. Free trade includes
the international exchange of assets. We assume that the only traded asset is
a consumption-indexed bond with fixed face value that pays net interest at
the rate Tt between periods t — 1 and t. Importantly, labor is internationally
immobile. In per capita terms, let A+i denote the economy's stock of net
foreign claims at the end of period t, P net domestic product or output in
period t, C private consumption, C government consumption, and i net
investment.7 Then the identity linking net foreign asset accumulation — that
is, the current account, CAR— to the saving-investment balance is:

                                                                            (11)

Define the market discount factor for date s consumption by
                                                 1
                                                                            (2)
                                          H (l+r,,)
                                        ti=t+1
(where      =   1).   Forward iteration of eq. (1) leads to

            (1 + rt)A = E R,,(C, + C, + I, — Y,) + lim R,,A,

  7We will assume for simplicity that capital does not depreciate in use.


                                           8
Because foreign lenders will not allow the economy to roll over a debt indefi-
nitely through unlimited borrowing, the condition lim,..          0 applies
above. The resulting intertemporal budget constraint for the economy is thus:

                    R3(C, + C3 + I,) (1 + r)Ag +                                 (3)

In the models we survey no resources are willingly forgone, so (3) always
holds with equality. In that case, (3) states that the present value of the
economy's expenditures must equal its initial net foreign wealth plus the
present value of domestic production.
    The intertemporal budget constraint delimits the feasible choices of the
economy. To describe the circumstances in which current-account imbalances
will arise, however, one must specify how the components of expenditure
and output are determined. We assume that the representative consumer
maximizes the time-separable function

                                Ut=L/3'2u(C3)                                    (4)

where /3 e (0,1), ti(C) > 0, u"(C) c 0.
    The intertemporal separability of preferences assumed in (4) will form
the backbone of our formal analysis. Before going further, it is worthwhile
to offer some justification for this decision.

   1. One might wish to start with a very general intertemporally nonsepa-
      rable utility function of the form U = U(C, C.1, ...).But this would
      yield few concrete and testable behavioral predictions. Instead we pre-
      fer to begin with a tractable basic setup like eq. (4) with strong impli-
      cations. Preferences then can be generalized if the basic setup seems
      to be leading us astray.8
   2. Aggregation, across both goods and individuals, may cause intertem-
      poral dependencies approximately to cancel out at the level of total per
      capita consumption.
  8Plausible non-time-separable alternatives to (4) can be analyzed; see, for example,
Devereux and Shi (1991), Obstfeld (1982), Shi and Epstein (1993), and Svensson and
Ra.zin (1983).

                                          9
   3. At the levels of time aggregation common in macroeconomic models,
      the assumption of intertemporal separability is not implausible. In any
      event, while empirical research on data at these frequencies has raised
      interesting questions about the time-separable preference model, it does
      not clearly point to a superior nonseparable alternative.

    Having defended our choice of time-separable preferences, we now begin
to pursue their implications. Let 14 be the real value of domestic firms at the
end of period t —1 (after period i—i dividends have been paid), B the stock
of interest-earning claims owned by the domestic private sector at the end
of t — 1, w1 the real wage in period t, L the per capita supply of labor, and
7' lump-sum taxes levied by the home government. Then the intertemporal
budget constraint of the representative consumer is9

                  R1,3C. = (1 + rg)(V1 + B2) + E Rt,.(w,L3         —
                                                                       T,)           (5)

   When (4) is maximized subject to (5), consumption necessarily follows
the intertemporal Euler equation
                           u'(Ct) = /3(1 +      rjj)u'(Cti)                          (6)

This optimality condition, stressed long ago by Irving Fisher (1930), equates
the marginal rate of substitution. of present for future consumption, which is
just f3u'(C2+j)/u'(C), to the price of future consumption in terms of present
consumption, 1/(1+rt+i). An implication is that, leaving aside discrepancies
between j3 and 1/(1 + rc+i), optimized consumption will follow a smooth,
constant path (recall that u(C) is strictly concave). A convenient closed-
form description of the current account is obtained by specializing further to
the case in which u(C) takes the isoelastic form

                                           C'— 1
                                  u(C) =

   9Strictly speaking, the way the next constraint is expressed assumes perfect foresight
between dates t — 1 and t, so that a rate of return of rt actually is earned on shares cx
?03L
      This assumption is made only to avoid cluttering the notation, and is not imposed
in what follows. A more general formulation simply would replace (1 + rt)Vt by the cx
post value (inclusive of dividends) of shares bought on date i.

                                           10
with a > 0 the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. In this case (6)
implies that optimal consumption growth obeys
                                 C.1 = flC(1 + rt+i)Cj                                (7)

The consumption path described above must satisfy the intertemporal con-
straint; using (7) to eliminate C (s > t) from (3) shows that the economy's
date t consumption will be:
                            (1 +rt)Ag+EtRt,s(Y. —                        — 1,)
                      I —
                                                                                       8
                                       E1 Rg,5(flhh/Pq,,)0
   Eq. (8) leads to an illuminating general characterization of the current
account. Define the 'permanent' level of variable X on date t, Xi, by

                                      I =>?4,1r,
                                          oo I?       ALI,s


and define ($/R)e as the following weighted average ratio of the (s —t)-period
subjective and market discount factors:
                                             r'
                                             tes=tP
                                                       (pa—tIp \c
                                                  4't,skP     / 1(4,3)
                            ($/R)e                E .=t

 Then, after many steps, eqs. (1) and (8) show the current account surplus

   1. If the economy is a net foreign claimant and the world interest rate
      is above its permanent average, then the current account will be in
       greater surplus as people smooth consumption in the face of temporar-
       ily high foreign interest income. If the economy is a net foreign debtor,
       temporarily high interest rates will have an opposite current-account
       effect.

   2. Output above its permanent level will contribute to a higher current-
      account surplus, again due to consumption smoothing. Similarly, the
      private sector will use foreign borrowing to cushion its consumption
      from abnormally high government consumption and investment needs.
   3. The last term in (9) reflects consumption tilting due to divergences
      in the current and future periods between world real interest rates
      and the domestic rate of time preference, (1 — fl)/9. When the home
      country is on average more impatient than the rest of the world, $
      is lower than future world interest rates will tend to be, resulting in
      (j3/R) c 1. There will then be a secular tendency toward current-
      account deficits, and thus toward secularly increasing foreign debt and
      declining consumption. When it is foreigners on the other hand who are
      (on average) more impatient, so that ($/R)° > 1, consumption's time
      path will have an upward tilt. The tilting effect is proportional to the
      economy's 'permanent' resources. Also, the tilting effect is stronger
      the higher is the ease of intertemporal substitutionS in consumption,
      measured by a.

   Before exploring the short-run implications of eq. (9), it is useful to
consider some of the model's predictions for steady-state current-account
behavior in a growing economy. As we shall see, a growing economy can run
a current-account deficit indefinitely.
   Incorporating growth forces one to model explicitly the linkage between
capital accumulation and production. Assume that the production function
where we have made use of the fact that

                                      >           =1
                                     5=1+1
The test is straightforward; for details, see Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995), ch. 2.


                                             12
for a small economy is Cobb-Douglas:
                                   Y=       9KL'
(a c   1),   where K2 is the end of period t —             1   capital stock (available for
production in period i), L is the constant labor force (which we will normalize
to 1 for convenience), and the productivity coefficient 8 grows so that
                                        =   (1   + g)'°Ot
with g > 0. Assume also that the capital stock can adjust in a period, with-
out installation costs. In the absence of unanticipated shocks, the marginal
product of capital, aOgKr', thus must equal r, the constant world interest
rate; r > g by assumption." Then, in a steady-state equilibrium, investment
is easily shown to be

                        = "2+1 — i(                            =
                                                                   ()z
Output and investment therefore both grow at rate g. If government spending
is zero, then one can use (9) to show that the optimal current account is given
by

CA =           — A1    = —[1 —(1 + r)flU]Ag — 1 + —(1 + r)0/3C                (i — 09)

     Division by Z yields a difference equation in A/I',

             A21   —   ((1 + r)th/30\   A—       1   +g —(1 + r)"/3°    (i_allr

  11For the world economy as a whole, the assumption that the growth rate does not
exceed the interest rate can be justified using any standard general equilibrium growth
model.

                                                 13
Notice that, because ag/r = I/Y, the long-run ratio of foreign debt to output
equals the ratio to current output of the entire present value of future output
net of investment.
    What size debt-output ratio does eq. (10) imply? Suppose the world real
interest rate r is 8 percent per year, 9 is 4 percent per year, and a = 0.4.
Then A/Y = —20,_and the economy's trade balance surplus each period
must be —(r — g)A/Y = 80 percent of GDP!
    Such large debt levels and debt burdens are never observed in practice:
economies that must borrow at market interest rates rarely have debts as
great as a single year's GDP. The anomalous prediction points to some
shortcomings of the model. With finite lifetimes, individuals currently alive
wouldn't be able to borrow against the entire present value of the economy's
output. There is no allowance in the model for sovereign risk. Finally, we
note that the world interest rate r is determined by the rest of the world's
growth rate. In this example, however, the world growth rate must equal
(1 + r)130r (see Obstfeld and Rogoff 1995, ch. 2), which is less than 1 + g by
assumption. But if a small economy were to grow faster than the world for a
sufficiently long period, it would cease being small and the fixed interest rate
assumption would be violated. If, on the other hand, the country's growth
rate eventually converges to the world growth rate, the country's ability and
desire to borrow from world capital markets are reduced.

3.1.2 The role of comparative advantage
The theory of international trade offers a useful perspective on these results.
The reason is that foreign borrowing and lending can be viewed as intertem-
poral trade, that is, as the exchange of consumption available on different
dates. The principle of comparative advantage thus applies.
   Imagine that the home country faces a constant world interest rate equal
to 1 + r = 1//i and that Y > Y, for s > t. Eq. (9) predicts that (absent
other current—permanent differences) the country will have a current-account
surplus. The principle of comparative advantage makes the same predic-
tion. In the absence of trade, the country's autarky interest rates, equal to
u'(1Y)/f3u'(Y4, lie below the corresponding world interest rates, (1 + r)3_t.
It therefore pays for the representative resident to export present consump-
tion by lending abroad, since present consumption is comparatively cheap
at home, and to import future consumption by receiving repayment for the

                                      14
loans at a later date.
    Similarly, temporarily high investment needs can raise a country's au-
tarky interest rate above the world level, making it an importer of present
consumption, that is, an external borrower.
   This perspective makes clear that it is only the country-specific or idiosyn-
cratic components of shocks that result in current-account imbalances. The
global components of shocks, in contrast, affect all countries similarly and
thus open up no new opportunities for gains through intertemporal trade.
Countries cannot all smooth consumption perfectly in the face of a shock
that temporarily depresses world output, for example. Instead, the world
real interest rate is bid up and all countries tilt their consumption paths
upward.

3.1,3 Modeling output fluctuations and investment
Our earlier investment example assumed that a nation's capital stock can be
adjusted without cost to equate capital's marginal product to the world in-
terest rate. Empirical observation makes this assumption difficult to swallow:
even at the industry level, we simply do not observe large discrete changes
in stocks of capital. If there are costs to installing capital, however, capi-
tal stocks will move more sluggishly and protracted deviations of capital's
marginal product from r are possible. A simple model illustrates how costly
investment affects current-account dynamics.'2
    Assume that final output is produced according to the standard homo-
geneous and concave production function OF(K, Li), where, as before, O
captures shifts in total factor productivity, and where K is given by past in-
vestment decisions. A firm making decisions on date i maximizes the present
discounted value of its profits (which equal the dividends shareholders re-
ceive):
                                          —   w8L,    —
                                                          I. —              (11)

(we have excluded bubbles in the price of capital). Eq. (15) states that q,
the cx dividend shadow price of a unit of capital at the end of period t, equals
the present value of its future marginal products plus the present value of its
future contributions to lowering the costs of investment.'3
    Multiply eq. (14) by        and use eq. (12) to express it as

            —
            —   O+jFx(K+,, L+,)IC+, + (J4/K÷i) + qt÷i(Kt+2 — I÷i)
                                                 1+r+i
Because the production function is homogeneous of degree one and qt+i =
1 + a(It+,/Kt+1) (recall eq. (13)), the foregoing relationship, iterated forward
successively to eliminate terms of form q3K3,, implies that

                =           R,3 [O.F(K. L3) — w3L, — 4 —              %..,        (16)

  '3Eq. (15) defines the cx dividend shadow price on date t because it does not include
the profit earned on that date and paid out to shareholders as dividends.


                                               16
Thus, the optimizing firm's cx dividend market value at the end of period t,
V, is the same as the shadow value of its installed capital: in Hayashi's
(1982) terminology, average q equals marginal q.'4
   To see some of the model's predictions for current account and investment
dynamics, let us simplify by assuming that r, 0, and L are constant and
consider a situation in which the capital stock K is initially below its steady
state level. Thus the marginal product of capital, OFK(Kg, L) exceeds r,
q > 1, and both K and Y are expected to rise over time. As the capital
stock rises toward its steady-state level, K, where 0F,(k, L) = r, q falls to
one.15 According to (9) the current account (abstracting from government-
spending changes, and assuming the economy consists of a representative
firm owned by a representative agent) is given by

 CA =
          { [oF(Ic
                      L) —            —
                                          1   -   r         ( - r)' [oF(Ic. L) — i]   }

   Since K is rising over time, final output is rising over time as well. Since
investment also is falling,'6 date t installation costs exceed their permanent
level. Thus, ' = OF(K1, L) — EQ/Kg) falls short of its permanent level,
contributing a negative component to the current account. The fact that
investment also is above its permanent level contributes a second negative
component to the current account.
   14AS Hayashi shows, this equality is due to the homogeneity of degree one of the pro-
duction and installation-cost functions.
   15For discussions of these dynamics, see Abel (1982) and Summers (1981).
   16lnvestment equals (q—1)K/a, but with q faUing while K is rising, it may not be obvious
that I falls over time. The assertion in the text is always true in the neighborhood of the
steady state. To see why, observe that

                                                  17
    Suppose K initially lies below its long-run steady-state value because the
economy has just experienced an unanticipated permanent increase in factor
productivity, 0. We can see from the preceding analysis that the economy runs
a current-account deficit. A classical example of this dynamic is Norway in
the 1970s (figure 3), which borrowed extensively to build up its North Sea
oil production following the first oil-price shock.
    Note that an unanticipated permanent rise in 0 not only leads to a cur-
rent account deficit but causes an immediate rise in output as well. There-
fore, with productivity shocks the model can in principle explain the well-
documented countercyclical behavior of the current account.'7 Of course,
this result rests on the assumption that the rise in 0 is permanent. Imagine,
in contrast, an unexpected rise in O lasting only a single period. This change
will not affect investment plans for future dates, and so the only effect is a
level of output temporarily above the permanent level. Eq. (9) shows that a
current account surplus will arise on date t. Productivity shocks with greater
persistence cause some investment and hence smaller initial current-account
surpluses, and, if persistent enough, they can produce an initial deficit, as in
the permanent case.
    The reader should note that in the present one-good small-economy model,
changes in investment can affect consumption, but investment itself is deter-
mined by elements that are independent of consumption preferences. Invest-
ment decisions are made to maximize the present discounted value of the
country's output, evaluated at the world interest rate. The country's saving
behavior is irrelevant. This independence of investment from consumption
preferences need not hold if the economy uses capital to produce nontraded
goods and services as well as tradables; it can also break down if there is a
nontraded input in production, such as labor. Introducing nontraded goods
and services leads to a number of other modifications of our basic one-good
model's results, as we shall see in the next section.

3.1.4 Nontradables, consumption, and investment
An economy that consumes and produces nontradables as well as tradables
may behave quite differently from the one examined so far. We begin by
seeing how nontradables can affect consumption decisions.
  17See the article by Morris Goldstein and Mohsin S. IChan in volume 2 of this Handbook
(Goldstein and Khan 1985).

                                          18
    In this section, it will be convenient to reinterpret C as a composite index
of the representative individual's consumption of tradables and nontradables,
CT and CN, but retain the assumption that the period utility function u(C)
is isoelastic with intertemporal substitution elasticity o-. Assume, moreover,
that composite consumption C has the CES form:
                                                     2z1T
                      C=                 + (1 — a)PCN'                     (17)
                           [aPCTP                        ]
Here, p is the (intratemporal) substitution elasticity between tradables and
nontradables. Take tradables as the numeraire commodity and let p be the
price of noñtradables in terms of tradables. Then, as one can easily show,
the exact consumer-price index (CPI) in tradables, defined as the minimal
cost in tradables of a unit of subutility C, is given by

                           P= [a+(l—a)p'"]                                 (18)

For the special case p =    (the case of Cobb-Douglas preferences), P =
                              1
  —a/aa (1— a)'. These same calculations reveal that, given C, the optimal
consumption levels for tradables and nontradables are:

                CT = a (1)_P C,            Cpq = (1—   a) (L) C            (19)

   Given the intratemporal allocation rules in (19), the consumer's intertem-
poral decision problem can be analyzed entirely in terms of composite con-
sumption C and the price index P. The consumer maximizes (4) subject to
the budget constraint corresponding to (5) but written in terms of expendi-
ture on C:

                          =   (1   + rg)(Vt+ B1) + Et,a(wzs — T,)

 (Above, asset stocks, wages, and taxes still are expressed in units of trad-
 ables). The intertemporal Euler equation for the consumption index C is
 now                                             /
                              —     Cl          Cl'Pt
                                                   ___
                        Gt÷i_p(s+rt+i) \ r11

                                           19
This relationship is analogous to Euler eq. (7), except that overall consump-
tion growth depends on the utility-based real interest factor (1 + rt÷i) (),
and not simply on the relative intertemporal price of tradables 1 + r11.
(Dornbusch 1983 stresses this point.) Combining eqs. (19) and (20) shows
that the Euler equation for tradables expenditure, CT , is

                       CTt+1 = /(1 + rt+j)° (                  Crt                    (21)
                                                .Pt+1 )
     Eqs. (20) and (21) show, in particular, that consumption need no longer
be intertemporally smoothed when the time-preference rate and world trad-
able goods interest rate coincide. For example, if the CPI, P, is rising over
time, the real interest rate will be below the own interest rate on tradables, r.
So total consumption expenditure measured in tradable; PC, will fall over
time if a > 1 and rise over time if a < 1. Similarly, while a rising path of P
tilts that of C downward with an elasticity a, the price changes cause CT to
rise relative to C with elasticity p (see eq. (19)). If p > a and /3(1 + r) = 1,
for example, consumption of tradables will rise over time if P is rising 18
     Some general-equilibrium implications of these points can be illustrated
by a simple model in which the economy's output of nontradables, liv, is
exogenous. If we assume (for simplicity) that neither the government nor
the domestic investment process uses up nontradables, then the condition of
equilibrium in the nontradable sector is simply C, = YN, and by (19) the
equilibrium relative price of nontradables is

                                   —    (1—a)CT
                                           aYN
in the Cobb-Douglas case p = 1, and it is simple to write down the equilib-
rium growth process for tradables consumption by combining the preceding
expression with eq. (21):

                   = /3e_o&_1(1 + rg+j)e_c%o_i) (YNt÷1)              °                (22)

  '8For a panel of 13 developing countries, Ostry and Reinhaxt       (1992) present Euler-
equation estimates of a = 1.27 or 1.22 and p = 0.38 or 0.50 (depending on the instrumental
variables used in estimation). These results indicate that the case a ). p may be relevant.

                                           20
    Notice that even when nontradables output is constant, the growth of
tradables consumption usually reflects the presence of nontradables in the
consumption basket. The reason: growth in CT affects p and thus the do-
mestic real interest rate.
    A fundamental implication of these results is that empirical studies of
the intertemporal approach should distinguish carefully between fluctuations
in traded and nontraded outputs. As an example, suppose that the path of
traded output is fiat, that (1 +r) = 1, and that YNt > YNtI.1. According to
eq. (22), consumption of tradables will be rising if o> 1 and falling if a c 1.
Because the current account surplus is the difference between the economy's
endowment of tradables and its absorption of tradables, even the sign of the
current account balance may not be related in a simple way to the time path
of the economy's total real output.
    One can add a labor-leisure tradeoff to the intertemporal model by view-
ing leisure as a nontradable (assuming there is no international migration).
In this context the real wage plays the role that the relative price of nontrad-
ables p played above.'9
    Also, as we suggested at the end of the preceding section, the presence of
a sector producing nontradables permits domestic consumption preferences
to affect the economy's investment behavior. A shift in preferences toward
nontradables, for instance, will reduce investment if the nontradables sector
is the relativelylabor-intensive one.20
    Allowing for nontradables is an important step towards having a more
realistic model of current account behavior. In the next section we consider
 another important modification.

3.1.5 Consumer durables and the current account
Eighteen percent of 1993 United States consumption spending was devoted to
durables (including clothing and shoes). But the theory we have developed
thus far does not capture the possibility that consumer purchases in one
period may yield utility over several periods. We now illustrate how the
presence of durables can alter current account responses.
  '9For an early analysis of the effects of introducing nontraded labor on current account
dynamics, see Bean (1986).
  "See, for example, Murphy (1986) and Engel and Kletzer (1989).

    In this subsection, let C stand for the individual's consumption of non-
durables and let D be the stock of durables he or she owns; all goods can be
traded. A stock D of durables yields a proportional service flow each period,
including the period in which it is acquired. The consumer in a small country
maximizes

and a solvency condition. Here, D1 is the stock of durables (including newly
purchased durables) held over period t, Pt is their price in terms of non-
durables, S is their depreciation rate, and r, the world interest rate, is con-
stant. Note that A, Y, C, G, and K are measured in nondurables.
   In addition to the usual intertemporal Euler equation for nondurables
consumption, the individual's first-order conditions include

                      (1—a)C = Pt — 1—S Pt+i
                         crD2              1+r
which equates the marginal rate of substitution of nondurables for the ser-
vices of durables to the user cost or rental price of dura.bles.
   Assuming /3 = 11(1 + r), consumption of nondurables is

  Ct =                                                           — — G3)]
         l+r [(1 + r)A + (1— S)pjD g_i + C + r)3_t (
while consumption of durables' services is

    =           [(1 + r)A. + (1— S)ptDti +           (    r) (1', - I. - G4].
   Let's suppose for simplicity that, Pt and, hence, the user cost, t, are
constant. The last equations then imply that the consumer smooths, not the
path of expenditures p[D1 —(1— S)D_iI on durables, but the service flow from
durables, which is proportional to D. With durables, the current account is
the same as implied by (9) (assuming, as we have here, that r = (1 — /3)/fl),

                                      22
but with an additional term that depends on new durables purchases (we
omit the derivation):

          CA = {(i'     —    — (at — O) — (I —     i)} + (t — p)EsD       (23)

   Noting that the price of purchasing a durable outright, p, must be greater
than the one-period user cost t,    we   see that the introduction of durables
necessarily increases the volatility of current-account responses to unexpected
income changes.

3.1.6 The terms of trade and the transfer problem
One of the earliest problems motivating the intertemporal approach was
the need to understand how changes in the terms of trade—the price of
a country's exports in terms of its imports—affect saving and the current
account. Early applications of Keynesian models by Harberger (1950) and
Laursen and Metzler (1950) had modeled adverse terms-of-trade shocks as
real income-reductions that reduce saving and the external surplus in pro-
portion to Keynes's marginal propensity to save. Instead, the intertempo-
ral approach emphasized the response of forward-looking individuals to the
changes in lifetime consumption possibilities that terms-of-trade movements
cause.
    The simplest case is of a specialized economy with an exogenous endow-
ment Y of its export good, but which also consumes imports. As in the model
with nontradables, we again assume an isoelastic period utility function de-
fined over a CES index C; here it depends on the indjvidual's consumptions
CM of imports and Cx of exports:
                              I   p—II '
                        C=[CPCJ +(1_a)CJ}
Let p now denote the price of exports in terms of imports, which is determined
exogenously in the world market. The consumption-based price level in terms
of imports is again given by formula (18).
   The natural benchmark case, assumed by Svensson and Razin (1983),
supposes that intertemporal trade is done through bonds indexed to the
consumption index, C. In this case r is the own rate of interest on the


                                         23
consumption index, and the budget constraint corresponding to (3) in the
present setup (abstracting from government) is
                      00                             00       7V
                                                              I Ps £ 3
                      ERt,sCs = (1 + rt)At + >Rt,s I\              5
                      s=t                            s=t

The Euler equation for the consumption index is again (7), implying the
consumption function corresponding to (8), which has I = C = 0 and pY/P
in place of Y. To focus on the terms of trade, it is helpful to assume that
r = (1 — 13)//3 and Y are constant, in which case the consumption function
reduces to:
                      C=rA+
    A fall in the terms of trade lowers p (the relative price of exports in terms
of imports) relative to P (the overall CPI in terms of imports). Thus, fluc-
tuations in the terms of trade affect the consumption index and the current
account (which here is measured in consumption-index units) exactly like
fluctuations in GDP at constant terms of trade. In particular, a temporary
terms-of-trade setback causes a current-account deficit, a permanent setback
an immediate shift to the new, lower consumption level consistent with ex-
ternal balance. Obstfeld (1982) and Svensson and Razin (1983) illustrate
how this latter result depends on the intertemporal separability of utility.2'
    This subsection has, thus far, focused on the response of the current
account to exogenous terms-of-trade changes. When countries have some
monopoly power in trade, however, shifts in their current accounts may in-
fluence terms of trade by redistributing wealth internationally.
    The impact of international wealth transfers on the terms of trade is a
classic problem of international finance. In the 1920s, Keynes and Ohlin
disagreed on the price effects of German reparations; in the 1990s, observers
  21Ostry (1988) and Edwards (1989) 8tudy interactions between the terms of trade and
the relative price of nontradables. Gavin (1990) considers the terms of trade in a richer
dynamic setting. For developing countries, it may be natural to assume that bonds are
indexed to imports (e.g., 'dollars'). In that case the intertempora.l budget constraint differs
from the one we have analyzed, so that the Euler equation for Cis formally the same as (20)
Expected terms of trade movements therefore have consumption-tilting effects through the
consumption-based real interest rate.



                                             24
of the protracted United States external deficits have debated the need for a
fall in the relative price of American exports.
   For a cross-section of 15 OECD countries, figure 4 plots the percent
change in the trade-weighted WPI real exchange rate (a terms-of-trade proxy)
against the change in the ratio of net foreign assets to output. The net for-
eign asset series attempt to account not only for measured current account
flows, but for capital gains and losses.23 The changes are calculated as the
1986-1990 average less the 1981-1985 average.
    the figure shows a distinct positive relationship—an increase in a coun-
try's net foreign assets appears to be associated with an improvement in its
terms of trade. The least-squares regression line is
      Alog(p5) =        0.039    + 1.042 (A/Y)5 + u;                     = 0.31
                       (0.027)        (0.433)
implying a statistically significant relationship. According to the regression,
an increase of 1 percent in the ratio of net foreign assets to output is associ-
ated with a 1 percent improvement in the terms of trade.
    Obviously, this regression provides only a nonstructural corielation. To
assess accurately the consequences of an exogenous wealth transfer would
require a full econometric structural model. Given the perennial importance
of the transfer effect in policy discussions, the development of empirical in-
tertemporal models that can explain its magnitude is a research priority.
    Theoretically, the transfer effect can operate through several channels in a
general-equilibrium setting. Two potential mechanisms are home preference
for domestic exports and the presence of a nontradables sector that competes
for resources with the exportable sector. A special case of the latter mecha-
nism is due to the effect of a wealth change on labor supply and, hence, on
the supply of exportables.
  "See, for example, the papers in Bergsten (1991).
  23Real exchange rate data come from International Monetary Fund, International Fin an-
cia! Statistics. Net foreign asset positions come from OECD Economic Outlook 55 (June
1994), p. A54. The country sample is Australia (for which the CPI was used), Belgium-
Luxembourg, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands,
Norway, Spain, Sweden, the United States, and the United Kingdom. We are skeptical
that the real appreciation of 33 percent that the IMF reports for Norway is accurate.
(The IMF reports a similar number based on CPIs.) OECD data place Norway's real
appreciation over 1981-1990 closer to 15 percent. However, the observation on Norway is
not driving the regression results reported below.

    A simple two-country model exhibits the labor-supply channel for the
transfer effect. Assume that the home country specializes in producing good
X and the foreign country good M. Moreover, assume that in both coun-
tries p, the elasticity of substitution in demand between the two produced
goods, equals 1. Let the period utility function, common to the home and
foreign countries, be an isoelastic function of an index that depends on both
consumption and leisure,

                  C (H —          = (cz.cl-t (H —
where   0 .c   c 1, H is an individual's endowment of time, and L his or
her labor supply. Let home output be produced according to the production
function Y = wL and foreign output according to Y = wL. Let P once
again denote the price of the index C in terms of home imports, and assume
bonds are indexed to C. The home country's net external assets are A, and
the foreign country's, therefore, are —A. Using the steady-state consumption
functions to solve for demand and supply in either of the goods markets, one
can show (after many steps) that the equilibrium terms of trade satisfy the
condition

                     P_           P               Ui
   From this implicit terms-of-trade equation one can easily see the effect
of an exogenous shift in net external assets from the foreign to the home
country (that is, of a rise in A). An absolute rise in p, the relative price of
home exports, raises p relative to P, and P itself rises absolutely. If A rises, a
rise in p therefore maintains equilibrium. The intuition why a wealth transfer
to the home country improves its terms of trade is simple. If home residents
receive a financial windfall, they spend some of it on leisure. Output of the
home good thus falls and its relative price must rise.

3.1.7 Demographic structure, fiscal policy, and the current ac-
         count
The single representative agent paradigm followed so far in this chapter may
furnish misleading predictions about the current account when the economy
consists instead of heterogeneous families born on different dates and un-
connected by altruistic links. A model based on the overlapping-generations

                                       26
structure in Weil (1989) illustrates some possible implications of allowing for
demographic complexity.24
    We will identify the economy's total population with its labor supply, L,
which grows at rate n:       = (I +n)Lg, with L0 normalized to 1. This labor
force, however, consists of immortal unconnected individuals (or dynasties)
born on successive dates. A representative from the generation born on date
  (the generation's 'vintage') maximizes U = E fltu(C,,) subject to

              L                  = (1 + rg)(V,t +         + Rt.(w3 — T,)

(each individual supplies one unit of labor per period.) Notice that consump-
tion and wealth are vintage-specific, whereas all people face the same wage,
interest rates, and (by assumption) lump-sum taxes. A key assumption is
that V,,,, =      = 0: vintages are born with no financial wealth, only with
a lifetime endowment equal to the present value of after-tax labor income.
(One can think of the model as one in which primogeniture governs the be-
quest of family wealth.) Investment can be modeled exactly as before. The
only difference is that a growing labor force requires positive steady-state
investment.
   To make the main points it suffices to work with the special case in
which the interest rate is constant at r and the period utility function is
u(C) = log(C).25 In this case,

          =   (1
                   —
                       /3)   [(1 + r)(l'ç,t +        +f   (       (v   —
                                                                           T.)]
                                                                                  (24)

is the consumption function.
    In investigating the economy's aggregate behavior, it is helpful to work
with per capita aggregate measures of macro-variables such as consumption
and wealth. Let X, be the vintage-specific value of variable X on date
t. Observe that the size of generation v = 0 is 1, that of generation I is
(I + ii) — 1 = ii, that of generation 2 is (1 + it)2 — (1 + ii) = n(l + n), and
so on up through vintage t, which is of size n(1 + n)t_. Thus the per capita

Elanchard (1985), Persson (1985), Frenkel and R.azin (1987), and Eaton (1988).
  "This case corresponds to isoelastic preferences with q = 1.


                                                27
average value of X on date i is:

               —   X0, + nXi,t + n(1 + n)X2,t + ... + n(I       + n)t'X,           (25)
                                          (1+n)t
    To compute aggregate per capita consumption, observe, that 14, defined
as in the last equation, is the average per capita value of claims to domestic
firms at the end of period i—I and is still given by (11) if the quantities in
that equation are interpreted as per capita aggregates. Eqs. (11), (24), and
(25) thus imply

           C = (1 — ) [(1 + r)Bt + t (1 r)3t (1', —                  - 1.)]        (26)

Consumption still depends on the time path of taxes. To understand this
dependence, however, we must for the first time in this chapter explicitly
consider exactly how the domestic government coordinates the time paths of
expenditures and taxes.
   Let D denote the government's per capita debt at the end of date t — 1.
Then if G denotes per capita government consumption, the intertemporal
public-sector budget constraint on date t is

 (1 + r)(1 + n)2D1 +        C             (1 + n)'G, =        C            (1 + n)3T.

This constraint equates the present value of tax revenues to the present value
of spending plus initial debt. If r it neither the government's revenue nor
its spending has a finite present value, so we assume r > it. Division of the
preceding constraint by (1 + it)t renders it in per capita terms as:

               (1 + r)D + Q                       =t
  26To  derive this equation, we assume perfect foresight between dates i — 1 and t, so
that (1 + r)Vi = — — I + V14. The next equation holds, however, even without
the perfect foresight assumption, as can be seen by modifying consumers' intertemporal
budget constraints as explained in the footnote preceding eq. (5) above. In deriving (26),
we have made use of the fact that the production function is homogenous of degree one.



                                           28
   To see what this constraint implies for private consumption, lead it one
period and observe that
                              —
                              —   (1+r)Dg+Gt—Tt                            (27)

                                                                 C    r)3_t C,

    Expression (28) shows that in the overlapping-generations economy, higher
future government deficits lower the present value of taxes for those currently
alive, holding the path of government consumption constant. Why is this so?
Eq. (27) shows that if D were a unit higher the government would have to
raise taxes in all future periods by only r — it to keep the per capita public
debt constant. Thus, an extra unit of government bonds in the hands of
someone alive at the start of date I raises his or her discounted stream of tax
liabilities by only



How do current and future government deficits alter the tax bill of current
generations? Let the government cut per capita taxes by 1+ it units in period
I and finance this tax cut by issuing enough additional debt to make
one unit higher (see eq. (27)). If the government is to maintain this new
higher per capita debt level, it must raise taxes by r —it per capita from date
I + I on. Thus, for someone alive on date I, the net effect of a deficit-financed
tax cut is to lower the present value of their taxes by

                I+n— f ( +r

                                       29
Deficit-financed tax cuts in periods after I have a corresponding discounted
effect on the tax liabilities of those alive on date I.
    The mechanism underlying these results is well known: the more debt the
government issues, the more taxes can be shifted onto future generations yet
unborn. Severing altruistic links between those alive today and some of those
who will be alive tomorrow creates a situation in which current generations do
not fully internalize the future tax liabilities arising from government debt
issue. If, in contrast, it = 0, there are no future entrants to the economy
to be taxed and, as (28) shows, the time profile of government debt no
longer matters to economic agents. In this case, government debt is not net
wealth and the Ricardian equivalence of deficit- and tax-financed government
expenditure holds. In the representative-agent economy considered earlier,
government borrowing has no influence on the current account.
   This is not the case here. Because the economy's overall net foreign assets
are A = — D, substitution of (28) into consumption function (26) shows
that



                                         1
                 +(l+r)At+E(
                          s=t +r )t(yIG)}
In per capita terms, the date-i current account is (1 + n)Ai+i — = rA +
   —C—       — G, so, other things equal, a higher current level of government
debt or a higher trajectory for future government deficits will raise current
consumption and the economy's foreign borrowing.
    Despite some notable episodes, it has proven difficult to verify a strong
statistical correlation between budget and current-account deficits. Below
we present cross-section regressions for industrialized countries over five-
year subsamples of l976199O.27 Each subsample cross-section observation
is formed by averaging a country's annual current-account surplus ratio to

bourg and Turkey. The data for current-account deficits and central government budget
deficits relative to GDP come from International Monetary Fund, Inlernaiionai Financial
St&istics. Due to lack of data, Switzerland is omitted from the 1981-1985 regression and
Canada, New Zealand, and Switzerland are omitted form the 1986-90 regression.

     Over the first two subsamples there is a strong negative correlation be-
 tween budget deficits and the current-account surplus, as the overlapping-
 generations model would suggest.28 During the most recent subsample, how-
 ever, the correlation evaporates. The last result suggests that factors other
 than government budgets dominated several countries' current accounts over
 1986-1990. If one runs the same regression on a sample that includes non-
 industrialized countries, the results are weaker. Beware: these simple cor-
 relations are merely suggestive and have no structural interpretation. In
 particular, they cannot tell us the effect of an exogenous increase in a gov-
 ernment's budget deficit on the current account. Another serious issue is to
 choose the appropriate measure of the intergenerational incidence of budget
 policies. For example, even if the social security account of the budget is
 balanced, it represents a huge transfer from young to old. Clearly, a better
understanding of the 'twin deficits' will require structural models and careful
 attention to intergenerational distribution.
     Models incorporating more complex demographics have important impli-
cations aside from their predictions about government financial imbalances.
Consider, for example, the implications of expected productivity growth. In
a representative-agent framework, higher productivity growth will tend to
weaken the current account as people borrow today against higher future
income. (Investment effects would strengthen this result.) In a life-cycle
   281n a sample including four industrialized countries and Mexico, Bernheim (1988) finds
a similar correlation between budget deficits and current-account deficits over 1976-1985.


                                           311
setting the implications of higher productivity growth are less clear. If each
individual benefits identically from the change regardless of his or her age,
the results are much the same as in a representative-agent model. But sup-
pose that productivity growth raises the labor incomes of young workers but
does not affect the labor incomes of older workers. Because young savers will
count more heavily in aggregate saving than old dissavers, saving will tend
to rise and the current account to improve. Deaton (1992) discusses how
life-cycle theories might explain the observed tendency for national saving
 and growth rates to be positively correlated in cross sections.
     An important property of overlapping-generations models is that they
 permit a steady-state with positive consumption for a small open economy,
 even if individuals have fixed time-preference rates different from the world
 interest rate. In the Weil (1989) model just sketched, for example, the small
 economy can reach a steady state even if individual cohorts' consumption
 levels are rising or falling over time; what is needed is that the birth rate of
 new individuals be large enough to offset the discrepancy between $(1 + r)
 and 1. If j3(i + r) .c 1, ii > 0 guarantees this outcome; if /3(1 + r) > 1, the
 inequality /3(1 + r) < 1 + it is necessary.

3.2 Stochastic models of the current account
A theory of current-account determination that makes no allowance for the
uncertainty about the future underlying consumption and investment deci-
sions cannot be fully satisfactory. Unfortunately, however, the introduction
of stochastic elements can raise the technical difficulty of writing down solu-
tions to individuals' maximization problems by an order of magnitude. Below
we review the predictions of some leading stochastic models. A key theme
emerging from the discussion is that the current-account response to various
shocks depends on whether markets exist for insuring against the shocks'
effects. This theme leads us, at the section's end, to consider a model in
which the extent to which shocks are insurable is endogenous.

3.2.1 Complete markets
The most tractable case of uncertainty is that in which insurance markets
exist for all future contingencies, with outcomes fully verifiable and contracts
fully enforceable. In the classic Arrow-Debreu world of complete markets,

                                        32
equilibrium resource allocations are efficient and, from a formal point of
view, the economy can be analyzed as if perfect certainty applied. There
are simply many more commodities, commodities now being indexed by the
state of nature in which they are demanded and supplied.29
    Except for certain special cases, market completeness requires that people
be able to trade as many independent assets as there are prospective states
of nature. Equivalently, they must be able to trade a complete set of Arrow-
Debreu securities, each of which pays off only in one state. The result of
this trade is that individuals everywhere in the world equalize their marginal
rates of substitution of present for future state-contingent consumption to
the same Arrow-Debreu prices, so that for all countries i and j,

                                _______ —
                                        — _______                                 29
                                 u'(C)         u'(CI)
given shared rates of time preference (that is, the 0's cancel). Condition
(29) precludes further mutual gains, on any date or in any state, from intra-
consumer borrowing and lending. Investment decisions are made to maximize
the present value of profits evaluated at state-contingent output prices.
    When all people throughout the world trade prospective risks in insur-
ance markets, some local economic shocks effectively become global shocks
and their current account effects are diminished or even eliminated. Con-
sider, for instance, a pure exchange economy that experiences a temporary
idiosyncratic positive output shock. Absent insurance markets, the country
would run a current-account surplus, accumulating some foreign assets so
as to smooth the benefits of the shock over all future periods. Under com-
plete markets, however, the home economy has already traded much of its
output risk to foreigners and purchased, in turn, claims on their risky out-
put processes. Thus, the home economy's positive output shock will cause
a small synchronized increase in every country's consumption under com-
plete markets. But it will also cause a shift in every country's income as
'dividend' payments flow from the home country to its foreign shareholders.
   "International models with complete markets are analyzed by Lucas (1982), Stockman
(1988a), Stutz (1988), Cole and Obstfeld (1991), Stockman and Tesar (1991), Backus,
Kehoe, and Kydland (1992), and Baxter and Crucini (1993a), among many others. Lucas's
(1982) model does not actually assume complete markets, and in fact can contain far more
states of nature than assets. However, other special assumptions made by Lucas result in
an allocation the same as the one complete markets would produce.

                                          33
With isoelastic preferences, no current-account imbalances result. Indeed, in
the isoelastic case, there are never unanticipated current account movements.
(Regardless of the utility function, differences in time preference can generate
nonzero current accounts under complete markets. The same is true when
there are perfectly predictable trend differences in country output profiles.)
    If perio4 utility is not isoelastic, world output shocks can generate gains
from intertemporal trade warranting current-account imbalances. Even in
this case, shocks that affect the distribution of output across countries, but
leave world output unchanged, have no current-account implications.
    Returning to the case of isoelastic utility, a positive shock to the produc-
tivity of domestic investment causes a current-account deficit, as in our earlier
perfect-foresight models. But that deficit will reflect only an influx of savings
from abroad to share in ownership of the incremental investment. (Indeed,
the existing capital of firms will already have a globally dispersed ownership.)
The deficit does not reflect consumption-smoothing effects, because all coun-
tries' income profiles are rising in proportion. Despite the deficit—indeed,
because of it—the international wealth distribution is constant.
    Under literally complete markets, risks due to changes in government
consumption also would be perfectly pooled among nations. An exogenous
unexpected rise in United States spending on highway repairs due, say, to
bad weather, would be financed mostly by contingent-contract payments from
foreigners to the United States. The obvious adverse incentives introduced by
such contracts illustrate why, in practice, asset markets are hardly complete.
If a country's residents have sold most of domestic firms' future earnings on
forward markets, its government has every incentive to raise corporate taxes
sharply after the fact. More generally, under asymmetric information, moral
hazards affecting private as well as government behavior impede complete
risk sharing. Informal observation and statistical evidence both confirm that
even in a domestic context, risks are far from being pooled as the complete-
 markets paradigm would predict. In the international context, sovereign risk
 and distance, together with cultural and legal differences, greatly magnify
the difficulties.30
  30See Obstfeld (1995) for a survey of evidence. The limited amount of international risk
sharing has prompted Shiller (1993) to propose creating international markets in GD?
futures.




                                           34
3.2.2 Bonds as the only asset
Let's look instead at the opposite extreme, that in which the only asset
nations trade is a one-period bond indexed to tradable consumption goods
and offering a certain one-period return. This restriction on the menu of
assets is too severe to furnish a completely realistic model, but it does serve
to produce a model quite comparable to the deterministic one studied e4rlier.
Later on we discuss hybrid models in which there are markets for some, but
not all, risks.
    For simplicity, we again choose as our framework a representative-agent
economy in which all goods are traded. Now the individual maximizes the
conditional expectation

                             = Et                                         (30)
                                    {f$:_t(c3)}
subject to a budget constraint like (5) equating the present value of con-
sumption to initial financial wealth plus the present value of after-tax labor
income. The consumption levels in (30) are contingency plans for consump-
tion that depend on the individual's history through the date the plan is
implemented. The budget constraint depends on stochastic future earnings,
taxes, and interest rates. The sequence of contingent consumption plans
the consumer chooses on date t must satisfy the budget constraint for every
prospective history of the economy.
    The intertemporal Euler equation derived in the certainty case now holds
in expectation (cf. eq. (6)):
                            = /3(1 + rt+i) Et {u'(Cj÷i)}                  (31)

To obtain closed-form consumer decision rules, we approximate u(C) by the
quadratic function
                              u(C)=C— c2
With this approximation (31) becomes

                         _____                         1
                                          h       /3(1+rgj)
Here we see that the relation between fi and the gross world interest rate
induces a tilt in expected consumption growth as was also true in subsection
3.l'.
    To simplify further, assume temporarily that the interest rate is constant
at r, with fl(1 + r) = 1; the result is the 'random walk' prediction for con-
sumption derived by Hall (1978):
                                                                                      (32)
    In equilibrium, the economy's intertemporal budget constraint, eq. (3),
must hold for every possible sequence of outcomes when its elements are
random. Applying the date-i expectations operator to both sides of (3) and
using (32), we have the certainty-equivalence consumption function:

              =       rEt {(i + r)A1 +                       (Y.   —
                                                                         — I.)}       (33)
                  1                              G   -

   Eq. (33) yields predictions for current accounts qualitatively similar to
those of the deterministic consumption function (8) developed earlier. As a
result, this equation and its relatives provide the leading vehicles for empirical
studies of current-account determination. The linear-quadratic formulation
has, however, at least three conceptual drawbacks:
   1. Under quadratic utility u'"(C) = O,so there is no precautionary saving.
      When, instead, u"(C) > 0, marginal utility u'(C) is a convex function.
      This convexity implies that an increase in uncertainty over future con-
      sumption raises its expected marginal utility and, thus, saving. We
      return to current-account models incorporating a precautionary sav-
        ings motive in our discussion of empirical work in section 4•32
   2.   In both estimating and simulating intertemporal models, it is frequently
        convenient to be able to linearize or log-linearize first-order Euler con-
        ditions. Assuming quadratic period utility is really just another way of
  31J the preceding equation the ratio of the gross interest rate to 1/fl enters both in the
slope and in the intercept, with opposite effects on expected date-(i+1) consumption. The
quadratic utility specification makes sense, however, only so long as C .c 1/h, ensuring
that the marginal utility of consumption is positive. Under this assumption, it is clear
that the intercept effect dominates: lowering fi, for examples lowers expected date-(t + 1)
consumption in the last equation.
  320n precautionary saving behavior, see Leland (1968).

                                            36
      linearizing. The basic problem with this approach is that a linearized
      model will be very inaccurate far away from the point of approximation.
      Yet if the linearization implies, as in (32), that consumption follows a
      random walk, consumption wiU eventually drift arbitrarily far from
      any initial level. As Obstfeld (1982) and Svensson and Razin (1983)
      showed, one way to avoid a unit root in consumption is to assume an
      endogenous, rather than fixed, rate of time preference. If the rate of
      impatience rises with the level of consumption, a stationary consump-
      tion distribution is possible. Another solution is to assume overlapping
      cohorts of finite-lived agents who leave no bequests. Unfortunately, nei-
      ther alternative can match the linear-quadratic infinite-lifetime frame-
      work for easy empirical implementation. Ultimately the justification
      for using the latter setup must rest on the presumption that it yields
      a reasonable approximation to behavior away from boundaries. More
      research proving or disproving this presumption would be useful.
   3. The consumption function (33) does not necessarily constrain consump-
      tion to be non-negative in all states of the world. If negative levels of
      consumption are ruled out, consumption cannot literally follow a ran-
      dom walk as in (32)?'

    We turn next to investigating how, when bonds are the only internation-
ally traded asset, the separation between domestic investment and consump-
tion implied by complete markets can break down.
    It is natural to assume again that the domestic firm makes its investment
decision on date t to maximize the present discounted value of profits. But
with uncertainty, it is no longer obvious what discount rate should be used
to value the risky stream of dividends the firm issues to shareholders. With
population normalized to 1, the firm's ex dividend value,      is the price of
a share in the firm in date 2 asset trading. Using dynamic programming (the
  33Clarida (1990) develops an exact general-equilibrium model of international borrowing
and lending under endowment uncertainty, heterogenous fixed discount rates, and lower
limits on individual assets. He finds that when there is no aggregate output uncertainty,
there is a stationary distribution of wealth and consumption levels in which some house-
holds are borrowing-constrained.
  34The problem of nonnegativity constraints afflicts the commonly used consumption
functions derived in continuous-time models by stochastic dynamic programming. See
Cox and Huang (1989).

Given that the firm is owned entirely by domestic residents, the present value
of a claim to its future dividends in any particular state of nature depends
on domestic consumer's marginal utility in that state of nature relative to
current marginal utility.

Define Hf3 to be the market discount factor between periods 2 and a, that
is, the price of sure (that is, noncontingent) date s consumption in terms of
date I consumption. Of course, Rf14 is simply the inverse of the gross short
rate, I + r1.36 The (a — 2)-period analog of eq. (31) is
                            u'(C2) = (ps_s/p4i3) j {t'(C4}

  35The result below uses the fact that if X and X' are two random variables, E(XX') =
E(X) E(X') + Cov(X, X').
  361n a deterministic model, Rf, =        as defined in eq. (2). The equality breaks down
here because future short rates are stochastic, whereas Rf, is known on date t.

   Eq. (35) shows that the firm's value is the conventional present value
of dividends plus a risk premiurn the firm is valued more highly if it pays
out unexpectedly high dividends when the marginal utility of owners' con-
sumption is unexpectedly high. The presence of a risk premium iatroçluces
an additional channel through which shifts in consumption preferences can
influence investment behavior. We discuss later the interpretation of (35)
when shares in domestic firms are traded internationally.
    The firm's investment behavior can be characterized by maximizing the
sum of current profits and (34) subject to (12). As in the deterministic case
current investment is governed by (13), where qt = Vt+1/K+i and l4 is
given by (34). The result is a richer q model of investment with current-
account predictions similar to those of subsection

3.2.3 Partially complete markets
In reality countries trade not only bonds but a rich menu of assets, including
equity shares, currency-denominated instruments, and other securities with
state-contingent payoffs. This trade ensures that some, if not all, consump-
tion risks can be pooled and that the current-account effects arising in the
last set of models will be muted.
    Eq. (31) implies that whenever there is free trade in noncontingent bonds
between two countries i and j, the expected growth rates of their residents'
marginal utilities from consumption are equal, assuming a common rate of
time preference. Thus,

                              ______         —    fu'(Cf+1)                      (36
                         Et1 u'(CD j -Et1 u'(Ch
Under complete markets (see eq. (29)), this equation holds cx post, not just
in expectation. When only (36) holds, however, differences in marginal rates
of intertemporal substitution can occur after the fact.
    When some, but not all, risks can be traded between countries, consump-
tion behavior will be intermediate between the predictions of (29) and (36).
  37See, for example, Baxter and Crucini (1993b) and Glick and R.ogoff (1993).


                                             39
Specifically, (29) predicts that marginal rate of intertemporal substitution
differences do not arise, while (36) predicts these differences can arise unex-
pectedly. In the intermediate case, the ex post difference

                                 ¼'-'t+l)\
                               UF(fli             Uifjfli

                                u'(Cj)             u'(C)
will be conditionally uncorrelated with any date-(t + 1) random variable on
which contingent contractual payments can be conditioned. Thus, if X1 is
a random variable on which contracts can be written prior to date I + 1,

                     Cove {u'(CI+i) — u'(Cj'1)              x÷i} = o       (37)

For example, if people in different countries can effectively pool the idiosyn-
cratic consumption risks due to nominal exchange-rate fluctuations through
foreign exchange market deals, then realized exchange rate fluctuations will
be statistically unrelated to international differences in the growth of u'(C).
Because it is only partial, however, such insurance clearly leaves scope for un-
expected differences in autarky interest rates and, thus, for current-account
movements.
    Svensson (1988) develops a two-period model in which period 1 asset
trading serves to pool consumption risks for period 2. Period 1 consump-
tion risks have not been pooled, however, so unbalanced current accounts
will, as a general rule, arise then. Svensson shows that the usual logic of
trade theory can be extended to analyze not only the current account under
uncertainty, but also the asset composition of gross capital flows between
countries. He develops a two-period pure exchange model of international
trade in a possibly incomplete set of risky assets. In that model, a multi-
commodity comparative advantage principle applies (see Dixit and Norman
1980, p. 95): the inner product of a country's net asset import vector with
the vector of home minus foreign autarky asset prices is positive.
    When countries trade equity shares as well as noncontingent bonds, the
separation between domestic investment and consumption may still obtain
even though asset markets are incomplete. As (37) shows, domestic and
foreign residents must attach the same values to the state-contingent profits
  For a formal derivation, see Obstfeld (1994).

                                             40
of a firm that they trade. A sufficient condition for the separation property
to hold is that investment decisions themselves do not change these common
valuations (see Ekern and Wilson 1974).

3.2.4 Endogenous market incompleteness
We have seen that some of the model's predictions concerning current account
behavior depend critically on the structure of asset markets and in particu-
lar the degree to which complete markets prevail. We have argued that the
complete markets model is inadequate empirically, but if so it would be help-
ful to have a deeper understanding of the frictions that impinge on market
completeness, rather than just assuming market limitations exogenously.
    In this section we present an example, drawn from Certler and R.ogoff
(1990), of how international capital flows behave in the presence of moral
hazard deriving from asymmetric information at the microeconomic level. A
key insight from the model, which carries over to other settings, is that inter-
national asset markets can bring the global allocation of resources part of the
way, but only part of the way, toward the full-information optimum. Thus,
the intertemporal approach, as sketched above, may well get the directions
of net international capital flows right while overstating magnitudes.
    We now adopt a two-period, single good setup in which each of the nu-
merous atomistic residents of a small country maximizes
                                u(Ci,C2)=C2                                (38)
given exogenous endowments P21 of the consumption good in period 1 and P22
in period 2. The utility function (38) is obviously very special (clearly C1 = 0
is optimal) but it allows to greatly simplify the analysis while still making
our main points. The focus, instead, is on investment. Each resident has two
ways to transform E1 into future consumption. He or she may lend in the
world capital market and earn a riskless net rate of return r. Alternatively,
current resources can be invested in a risky domestic project. If a resident
invests K in period 1, then the project's stochastic payoff in period 2 is Y,
where
                         >0        with probability ir(K)
                         0          with probability 1 — ir(K)
Above, ir(K) is increasing, strictly concave, and twice continuously differen-
tiable, with ir(0) = 0, ,r() = 1, and 1+r c Ø'(O) c oc. These assumptions

                                      41
ensure that higher investment increases the likelihood of a successful outcome
(but at a diminishing rate) and that the prospect of success would justify
nonzero investment under symmetric information. Every individual has one
potential investment project and different individuals' investment outcomes
are statistically independent.
     In this model, the optimal full-information investment level is K, defined
by
                               w'(K)c6 = 1 + r                            (39)
At this point, the marginal return to investing equals the return that can be
earned through lending abroad. Let us assume that

                                     1+r
This inequality implies that each resident needs to borrow a positive amount
from foreigners to be able to invest optimally. Furthermore, the condition
is equivalent to the inequality P22 < (1 + r)(JC — E1), which states that it
is infeasible for lenders to finance the investment level K through a risk-
free loan. If an investment project fails, even the borrower's entire period
2 endowment is insufficient to repay lenders (1 + r)(K — E1). Thus, loan
contracts take the following, state-contingent, form: in return for a loan of
size L in period 1, the borrower promises to repay Z9 in period 2 in the event
his or her investment is successful and Z6 c Z in the event it fails. Lenders
are competitive and do not offer a loan contract unless its expected gross
return equals 1 + r

                      ir(K)Z' + [1 — 7r(K)JZL =   (1 +   r)L              (40)
The provisions of loan contracts are assumed to be fully enforceable.
    The moral hazard problem underlying the model arises from its informa-
tion structure. Lenders observe a borrower's endowments and the output of
the investment project (that is, whether the project is successful or not); of
course, they also know the size of the loan. They cannot, however, verify
the level of investment, K. Thus, borrowers cannot commit themselves to
any specific level of investment by writing promises about K into the loan
contract. For example, there is no way lenders can prevent borrowers from
investing nothing at all and instead secretly placing all of their resources,
borrowed as well as nonborrowed, in foreign assets (an action reminiscent of

                                       42
'capital flight'). But if borrowers do so, there is no chance their projects will
succeed. The informational asymmetry allowing this kind of behavior leads
to inefficient investment and borrowing levels, as we now show.39
    Given the available loan contract, a typical borrower maximizes expected
second period consumption
  E{C2} = ir(K)(çb — Z°)       —
                                   [1   ,r(K)]Zb + (I + r)(Ej + L — K) + E2 (41)
subject to the constraint
                                        Ej+LK                                          (42)
Constraint (42) does not bind when the borrower is secretly investing re-
sources abroad rather than at home. The necessary Kuhn-Tucker conditions
for a maximum are:
                                    —
                                        (Z°   —
                                                  Zb)]   = 1 +r+A                      (43)

                            AO, A(Ei+L—K)=O                                            (44)
Conditions (43) and (44) imply that even a borrower with access to a loan L
large enough to permit the desired investment level (so that A = 0) picks a
K that satisfies
                            ir'(K)[cb — (Z° — Z1')} = 1 + r                            (45)
and, thus, is strictly below the full-information optimum level described by
eq. (39). The reason is that the change in payoff to the borrower when a
project succeeds is

                       _Z9_(_Zb)=4_(Z9_Z) <q5
    Although lenders can't observe K directly, they have rational expecta-
tions and thus can figure out the level of K borrowers will choose for a given
  391f borrowers could commit to invest K, lenders would break even by lending them L =
   — E1  and setting Z' = E2, Z = (1+r) [K — E1 —(1— r(K))E2] /ir(K). (Because
ir(K) is strictly concave and r(O) 0, ZI c + E2.) In this model, there is an implicit
assumption that foreign direct investment cannot substitute perfectly for lending; that is,
foreigners cannot circumvent the agency problem by purchasing investment opportunities
in the borrowing country and exploiting them optimally themselves. This assumption
could be justified by a threat of nationalization, or simply by a comparative informational
advantage of local residents in finding suppliers, monitoring workers, greasing the collective
palm of local officialdom, etc.

                                              43
loan contract. They therefore offer a loan contract such that the K the
borrower chooses, given L, Z', and Zb, satisfies the required rate of return
condition (40). Competition among lenders ensures that this contract is op-
timal for the borrower, subject to the constraints mentioned. Formally, the
optimal incentive-compatible contract (L,Z', Z6) maximizes E{C2) subject
to (40), (42), (45), and the inequality Z6 E2.
    The optimal contract satisfies Z6 = E2 (so as to minimize the gap 2
Z Z' and, thus, the gap between K and K).4° Furthermore, the contract
   —

satisfies (42) with equality: increasing L above K — E1 would force a rise
in Z and, with it, a worsening in investment incentives. Combining these
facts with the incentive-compatibility constraint (45) and the lenders' zero-
profit condition (40), we see that the optimal contract is the solution to the
three-equation system
                                     — 2) = 1 + r


                      2= (1+ r) (K -     — itr) /7(K)
                                    L=K-E1.
   This solution has a number of important implications:

   1. The incentive-compatible investment level is below the full-information
      optimum of (39). Accordingly, period 1 capital inflows are below the
      level a full-information model would predict.
   2. An increase in the productivity parameter 4i increases the period 1
      capital inflow and investment level, but it also widens the spread Z
      between the good- and bad-outcome loan payments. Thus, (under mild
      restrictions on ir(K)) the resulting capital inflow is less than in the full-
      information case.
   3. The expected marginal product of capital, ir'(K)b, exceeds the world
      (and domestic) riskiess interest rate, 1 + r.
   4. An increase in either endowment, E1 or E2, raises investment by lower-
      ing 2. In the first case this effect is due to a lesser reliance on external
      funds, in the second to the possibility of a larger loan payment in

                                          44
      the bad-outcome state. The invariance of investment with respect to
      intertemporal preferences that characterized the single-sector models
      described earlier need not hold when investment is subject to moral
      hazard.41
    In a two-country general equilibrium version of the model, one can show
that endogenous differences in capital market imperfections can dramatically
reduce the flow of capital from rich to poor countries, and even reverse it (see
Gertler and Rogoff 1990).
    The preceding model has abstracted both from the consumption smooth-
ing motive behind the current account and from the borrowers' desire to
engage in asset trades that reduce the uncertainty of second-period consump-
tion. It is straightforward to add second-period risk aversion to the model
by assuming that (38) is replaced by

                               u(Ci,C2) = C2 —
In order to focus on the new issues that arise, it is convenient to suppose that
E1 1s2'. In this case, domestic residents' endowment is large enough so that
they have not need to borrow to finance investment, and their only motive for
tapping the international capital market is to insure period 2 consumption.
Here again we have a moral hazard problem because nonverifiable investment
decisions affect the probability distribution of second-period output. It can
be shown that under the optimal incentive-compatible contract, consumption
insurance will be partial and K will be below K.42
    The general conclusion is that asymmetric information need not cause
financial markets to break down entirely. Instead, financial markets may do
only partially the job they could do in a world of full information. Note also
that in thinking about the incompleteness of markets, it may be misleading
to think of risks as being either insurable or noninsurable. In many cases,
through what is basically a coinsurance mechanism, some gains from trade
across states of nature will be realized even under moral hazard.43 The same
point applies to trade across time.
  It is again easy to see that Z' < + P.72.
  42See Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995), ch. 6.
  43The implications of adverse selection problems can be quite different, although we do
not consider them here. Atkeson and Lucas (1992) study a different moral hazard problem,
one in which people (or countries) wish to insure against preference shocks. They find that

                                            45
   We have focused on capital-market imperfections arising from asyrnmet-
nc information at the micro level. Another very important cause of inter-
national capital-market imperfection is sovereign default risk at the macro
level. Sovereign risk need not be related to asymmetric information, but
can have qualitatively similar implications.44 Jonathan Eaton and Raquel
Fernandez present a detailed analysis of the effects of sovereign risk in their
chapter in this Handbook A common theme in sovereign-risk models is that
the consumption-smoothing and risk-sharing roles of international capital
markets still operate, but are tempered by default risk.

4 Empirical evidence on the intertemporal
      approach
The intertemporal approach to the current account has been subjected to
extensive formal testing; much of the methodology used grows out of Hall's
(1978) seminal work on the implications of the rational-expectations as-
sumption for forward looking consumption theories. A less formal empir-
ical methodology, pioneered by Feldstein and Horioka (1980), has been used
to argue that the close relationship between national saving and investment
rates in post-World War II data furnishes a prima fade case against the prac-
tical relevance of the intertemporal approach. These two research avenues
are closely intertwined, as any attempt to reconcile the Feldstein-Horioka
findings with the intertemporal approach rests on the validity of models such
as those surveyed in section 345
under optimal incentive-compatible arrangements, the degree of consumption inequality
in the world increases continually.
   44Atkeson (1991) presents an interesting analysis incorporating both asymmetric infor-
mation and sovereign risk.
   45We do not survey the methodology of calibrating open-economy models with incom-
plete markets so as to match moments of actual aggregate data. Interesting recent work
along this line, exemplified by Baxter and Crucini (1993b) and Kollmann (1992), is dis-
cussed in Marianne Baxter's chapter in this Handbook. We also refrain from more than
 a brief and highly selective account of the copious literature on measuring international
 capital mobility. See Frankel (1993) and Obstfeld (1995) for recent surveys.




                                           46
4.1 The relationship between national saving and do-
     mestic investment rates
In a closed economy, national saving equals domestic investment and the
current account is always zero. Furthermore, any observed increase in na-
tional saving will automatically be accompanied by an equal rise in domestic
investment. A basic premise of the intertemporal approach is that capital
is to some degree internationally mobile, so that current account imbalances
are a possibility. Given this premise, the intertemporal approach predicts
a number of situations in which divergences between saving and investment
wifl arise. An empirical finding that national saving rates affect domestic
investment rates with unit coefficients would therefore appear to be strong
evidence against the applicability of the intertemporal approach.
    Feldstein and Horioka (1980), in the first of a series of related papers by
Feldstein and coauthor; argued that capital mobility is sufficiently limited,
at least over long horizons, that changes in national saving rates ultimately
feed through fully to domestic investment rates. As evidence, they reported
cross-sectional regressions of gross domestic investment rate averages (I/Y)
on gross national saving rate averages (S/Y). These ratios of nominal flows,
of course, suffer from all the conceptual deficiencies discussed at the end of
section 2. For a sample of 16 OECD countries over 1960-74, Feldstein and
Horioka found that:
        (I/Y) =      0.035     + 0.887 (SlY)5 + U5;        $2 = 0.91
                     (0.018)      (0.074)
Feldstein and Bacchetta (1991) report similar results for a 1974-86 sample
of 23 OECD members. Figure 5 shows the cross-sectional saving-investment
association in the OECD sample over the decade 1982-91, with Luxembourg,
which is an outlier, omitted. The estimation result for this sample, leaving
out developing Turkey, is:
        (I/Y)5 =     0.088     + 0.622 (SlY)5 + U5;         fl2   =   0.69
                     (0.020)      (0.094)
This equation shows a weakening, but still very significant, positive associa-
tion.
    Feldstein and his collaborators argue that if capital indeed were highly
mobile among countries, coefficients like the one above should be much

smaller than 1, as a country's savings would then be free to seek out the most
productive investment opportunities worldwide. Although the intertempo-
ral approach is consistent with a world in which changes in saving behavior
impinge on domestic investment, it certainly does not support the policy con-
clusion, preferred by Feldstein, that government measures to raise a country's
saving rate will automatically cause a long-run pan passu increase in its in-
vestment rate.
   If capital is truly immobile and the intertemporal approach irrelevant,
however, then the time-series relationship between individual countries' sav-
ing and investment rates, like the cross-sectional relationship among long sav-
ing and investment averages, also should be close. We can think of the time-
series relationship among contemporaneous detrended saving and invest-
ment rates as capturing the coherence of high-frequency changes, while the
Feldstein-Horioka regression captures the association between low-frequency
or 'sustained' changes. Indeed, it is hard to see how capital could be truly
immobile in the long run but not in the short run, since the long run is
just a succession of short runs. And even if international trade in long-term
instruments or long-lived assets were highly limited—a hypothesis that the
data do not support—short-term instruments can be rolled over.
     The time-series and cross-section aspects of the saving-investment rela-
 tionship are quite distinct: the time-series relationship could be close and
 the cross-section relationship not, or vice versa.. An example is provided by
 the United Kingdom during the pre-World War I gold standard (figure 1). It
 is apparent that the short-run saving-investment correlation is very close.46
 Nonetheless, the U.K. ran current-account surpluses approaching 10 percent
 of GDP in this same period.
   It is a 'stylized fact,' somewhat sensitive to the detrending method adopted,
that the time-series saving-investment correlation is fairly strong in recent
data. (See figure 3 for some industrial-country data, but note the exceptions,
the most glaring of which is Norway with its highly negatively correlated sav-
ing and investment rates.) For the OECD countries including Luxembourg
but excluding Turkey, the average correlation between saving and investment
rates is 0.495 over 1974-90 after linear time detrending. The correlation is
0.512 when the data are first-differenced to remove trend.
    Even in a world of complete capital mobility though, such correlations
  46See Obstfeld (1986) for a more detailed statistical analysis of the U.K. data.


                                           48
are not necessarily surprising and can easily explained on the basis of the
intertemporal approach. For example, the discussion of gradual capital-stock
adjustment in section 3 implies that a shock to total factor productivity, if
short-lived but not completely transitory, raises saving as well as investment.
Baxter and Crucini (1993a,b) and Mendoza (1991) (the latter in a small-
country setting, the former in a global-economy setting) have shown that
intertemporal mobile-capital models based on investment-adjustment costs
can easily produce time-series saving-investment correlations at least as large
as those in the data. Part of the mechanism underlying the Baxter-Crucini
findings is allowance for global economic shocks, which obviously will induce
positive saving-investment correlations.
   We have been focusing on time-series evidence, but Feldstein and Ho-
rioka's cross-sectional findings can also be rationalized by the presence of
common factors that might simultaneously influence countries' saving and
investment rates.
    It seems likely that of the many potential explanations of the Feldstein-
Horioka results, no single one fully explains the behavior of all countries.
Taken together, however, and combined with other evidence indicating sub-
stantial international mobility of capital, the arguments suggest that the
Feldstein-Horioka finding provides no basis at all for dismissing the basic
premises of the intertemporal approach:
   1. Even post-1973, governments have sometimes adjusted fiscal or mone-
      tary policies to avoid large and protracted current-account imbalances.
      The evidence on this current-account targeting hypothesis is mostly
      anecdotal, however, and their are of course prominent instances (like
      the United States in the 1980s) in which macroeconomic policies have
      instigated major external imbalances.47
   2. OECD countries may be sufficiently well endowed with capital to have
      reached stochastic steady states for their external debt or asset levels.
      In this situation the intertemporal budget constraint of the economy
      would imply that long averages of saving-investment differences are
      small. Developing countries, which presumably could realize greater
  47The fragility of the econometric evidence is illustrated by Feldstein and Batchetta's
(1991) reinterpretation of the regressions Sununers (1988) offers as evidence of current-
account targeting.

                                           49
   gains from intertemporal trade through borrowing for investment pur-
   poses, are likely to be more distant from a stationary distribution of
   foreign debt. This interpretation seems borne out by the cross-sectional
   results for developing countries prior to the onset of their debt crisis in
   1982. For this sample, the cross-sectional saving-investment association
   is much looser than for the OECD sample.48
3. The Gertler-Rogoff investment model discussed in section 3 shows why
   investment may respond positively to higher retained earnings, that
   is, to higher corporate saving. Thus, it seems plausible that in coun-
   tries with higher saving rates, the cost of capital will be lower and
   investment higher. A main prediction of the moral-hazard model is
   that risk-free interest rates are equalized among countries—as indeed
   they mostly are in the industrialized world (Obstfeld 1995)—whereas
   the marginal product of capital is high in countries with low corporate
    wealth. Although there is some evidence in favor of this hypothesis, an
    account of how corporate saving and investment are related need not
    have strong implications for the relationship between total saving and
    investment. For example, private domestic owners of firms may pierce
    the corporate veil and offset corporate saving decisions through their
    own consumption. To the extent that the investing firms are owned
    by foreigners, their decision to retain earnings increases foreign rather
    than domestic saving, other things equal.
4. In the life-cycle theory of consumption, sustained demographic changes
    that increase a country's long-term investment rate also may increase
    its saving rate. Section 3.1.7's discussion of overlapping-generations
    models provides a leading example: higher productivity growth that
    affects most strongly the incomes of young workers will cause saving as
    well as investment to rise. Feldstein and Bacchetta(1991) and Summers
    (1988) have dismissed this line of explanation, notwithstanding some
    supportive evidence offered by Tesar (1991). In a more recent contri-
    bution, however, Taylor (1993) revisits the Feldstein-Horioka equation,
    controlling for (a) measures of domestic relative prices, (b) the age-
    structure of the population, and (c) the interaction of the age structure
    with the growth rate of domestic output. He finds that for a number of
48See Fieleke (1982), Dooley, Frankel, and Mathieson (1987), and Summers (1988).

       country samples the cross-sectional saving-investment association dis-
       appears.
    Far from showing the irrelevance of the intertemporal approach, the large
literature spawned by Feldstein and Horioka's (1980) nonstructural explo-
ration suggests to us that models like those reviewed in section 3 capture
key elements behind the cross-sectional and time-series regularities govern-
ing saving and investment rates. The further empirical challenge for the
intertemporal approach is to show that structural forward-looking models of
the current account are not grossly incompatible with actual experience. We
turn next to tests of such models.

4.2 Tests of intertemporal current-account models
Most structural time-series studies of the intertemporal approach to the cur-
rent account essentially test versions of eq. (9), according to which the
current account depends on deviations of interest rates, output, government
spending, and investment from 'permanent' levels. Indeed, most (but not,
as we shill see, all) of these studies focus on the special case of (9) where
constant real interest rate r = (1 — /3)/fl
                                                                                  (46)
  Though less general than eq. (9), eq. (46) embodies many central el-
ements of the intertemporal approach. It therefore is reasonable to ask
whether there is any evidence in favor of (46) before turning to more com-
plex models. For example, do temporary rises in government spending cause
current-account deficits? Questions like this one seem simple enough, but a
number of empirical subtleties arise in answering them.

4.2.1 Measuring permanent values: A digression
Even before turning to the econometric studies, it is useful to address what
is perhaps the most problematic issue of all, the construction of the expected
permanent values Y, 0, and I.
    A first difficulty is that it is not obvious what real interest rate to use to
discount expected future output flows.49 Most of the studies surveyed below
  49Sometimes this issue can be finessed; see the discussion of Glick and Rogoff (1993)
below.


                                          51
use fairly low discount rates, in the range of 2 to 4 percent per year. These
numbers correspond roughly to average a post real returns on U.S. Treasury
bills post-World War II. But is a (nominally) riskless rate the appropriate one
for discounting very risky future output flows? For the United States, the
mean rate of return on risky assets has historically been much higher than
that on bonds (Mehra and Prescott 1985), at least since the late nineteenth
century. To the extent data are available, a similar result seems to hold for
a number of other countries. Bernanke (1985) argues that an annual real
interest rate as high as 14 percent is needed to rationalize U.S. consumption-
income relationships in a related closed-economy setting.                    -
 -  A  second   difficulty concerns the sensitivity of empirical measures of Y,
C, and I to apparently benign differences in the time series process gener-
ating the underlying values of Y, I, and C. This problem interacts with
the previous one, because the sensitivity to the data-generating process is
especially acute under a low interest rate.5° Consider the following example,
in which output (expressed as a deviation from mean output) is generated
by the process
                                Y = pY_i + Vt                       (47)
with 0 p 1, Vt a white-noise error, and time measured in years. If a low
real interest rate is used to construct permanent output

                                                                          (48)

distant future incomes will have relatively large weights. When r = 0.Q3,
Et Y20, for example, though discounted, still has a weight more than half
that of current output, P. This means that when r is low, estimates of
may be very sensitive to the serial-correlation parameter p, especially in the
neighborhood of p = 1. Noting that under eq. (47) E Z+k =           one sees
that eq. (48) implies:
                                    1+—p'
When p =     1,p = 1 and so = Y, regardless of the value of r. But when
r=   0.03   and p = 0.97 (a value differing from 1 by an amount generally
too small to detect empirically), p drops to only 0.5: permanent output is
  50This discussion draws on Glick and Rogoff (1993).


                                          52
half of current output. As p becomes small this hypersensitivity abates. In
practice, unfortunately, p tends to be quite close to 1, so that the presence
of a unit root is difficult to reject. It should be clear that estimates of 2 can
be similarly sensitive to estimates of time trends.51
   The present-value calculations are less sensitive to p when the real interest
rate is higher. How high must real interest rates be? With r = 0.14 (the
value mentioned by Bernanke) and p = 0.97 in eq. (49), p = 0.824. With
r = 0.5, p = 0.943. Real interest rates high enough to make j insensitive to
p in the vicinity of a unit root appear implausible.
    With these cautions in mind we proceed to look at the literature.

4.2.2 Early tests
Early econometric tests of the intertemporal approach as represented by eq.
(46) include Ahmed (1986, 1987), Hercowitz (1986), and Johnson (1986).
Hercowitz, who looks at Israeli data over 1950-1981, presents some sup-
port for an intertemporal model but also finds that the model exaggerates
the current account's response to output fluctuations. Johnson focuses on
Canada over 1952-1976. He rejects Ricardian equivalence, but concludes
that Canada's private sector can plausibly be modeled in line with a ver-
sion of the intertemporal approach that allows for some liquidity-constrained
consumers.52
   Ahmed's papers are distinctive in their use of long historical data series
on government expenditures from the United Kingdom. In the 1986 paper,
Ahmed looks at annual 1908-80 data to gauge the impact of U.K. government
spending on the current account (actually, the trade balance, TB). The
1987 paper analyzes a pre-World War I sample on public military spending
and trade balances running from 1732 to 1913. Ahmed argues that the
expenditures accompanying Britain's wars were largely exogenous and were
almost certainly viewed as temporary by the public. Thus, on the basis of
  51The same problems arise in the macroeconomic literature on estimating consumption
functions. Deaton (1987), for example, argues that if income is stationary in growth rates
(a hypothesis that is difficult statistically to reject given the limited post-WWII time
series), then consumption should move more than one-for-one with income innovations.
There is, on the other hand, no 'Deaton's paradox' if income is highly serially correlated
but still stationary.
  52Roubini (1988) combines the intertemporal approach with the tax-smoothing theory
of government deficits, finding mixed results for a sample of OECD countries.

                                           53
the intertemporal approach, one might expect Britain to have been running
external deficits during wars.53 In the twentieth century, swings in British
government spending have been dominated by the two world wars, both of
which were accompanied by large current-account deficits. Figure 6 uses
data from Ahmed's papers to graph military spending against the current
account over 170l-1938. This 238-year sample provides a more demanding
testing ground than the twentieth century alone, as the period is punctuated
by many wars.55
    A negative correlation between surges in government spending and the
current account is fully consistent with theories other than the intertem-
poral approach, for example, a Keynesian multiplier model. To reduce the
set of alternative theories consistent with the data, Ahmed explores formal
econometric tests. A representative result from Ahmed (1986) is
 TB =        —0.21 (C1 —    a1) — 0.44 £7 + e1; B2 — 0.28, D.W. = 2.32
              (0.05)                   (0.85)
which is estimated over 190880.56 This regression shows that the temporary
component of government spending has a significant negative influence on
the current account, whereas the permanent component itself does not, con-
sistent with (46). Unfortunately, the regression's specification leaves open
the possibility that G is the only significant determinant of the current ac-
count and that C1 plays no role at all—as an atemporal Keynesian model
would predict.
  53The result that temporary war-time increases in public spending should lead to an ex-
ternal deficit does not necessarily hold if the whole world is at war. In an all-encompassing
global war, higher government spending everywhere would push up world intercst rates
with current account implications that would depend mostly on countries' net external
asset holdings. This point illustrates the distinction between global and country-specific
shocks emphasized in section 3 above.
   "Both series have had a 2 percent annual growth trend removed, as in Abmed (1987).
The current account has been constructed from Ahmed's trade balance data using a 3
percent per annum sterling rate of return on foreign assets starting from an assumed zero
net foreign asset position in 1701. We thank Shaghil Ahmed for providing us with the
data from his papers.
   55The possible gain or loss of colonial territories and privileges, which was the motive
for much warfare before World War I, naturally could be expected to exert an addi-
tional wealth effect on the current account. Ideally, this effect should be controlled for in
estimation.
   56See table 1, regression I (with p = 0.02) on p. 211.

   Using our estimated current account in place of the trade baiance, we
have run a similar regression on the 1701-1938 data, but while keeping G —
G in the regression we replace G by G so as to encompass transparently
the intertemporal and Keynesian alternatives within a single test.57 The
resulting regression, run using a Cochrane-Orcutt correction for first-order
serial correlation is
       CA =        —0.016     (C — O2) — 0.028        G + e; p = 0.907
                    (0.013)                   (0.093)                   (0.027)

    In this specification, neither current or permanent government spending
coefficient is individually significant. As usual, it is unclear whether the
intertemporal approach is simply false, or whether the many extraneous sim-
plifications and maintained hypotheses imposed by the econometrician are
to blame. It is therefore useful to turn to a newer empirical approach based
on a less restrictive framework.

4.2.3 Present-value models of the current account
Ghosh (1995), Otto (1992), and Sheifrin and Woo (1990) apply an alternative
methodology that makes use of the information embodied in past current
accounts to make more accurate predictions of Y, G, and I. These studies
build on the methodology developed by Campbell (1987) and by Campbell
and Shiller (1987).
    Define
                                    Q_=Y-G-I
The starting point for the present-value methodology is again eq. (46), ex-
pressed in the form
                                    CA = Qt —                                       (50)

   57To form O we used an autoregressive forecasting model of detrended government
 spending.
   55Similar results are obtained when we use the trade balance in place of the current
 account, as Ahmed (1987) does.
   59Campbell's (1987) study of private U.S. saving is especially relevant to the current-
 account studies we are about to discuss. Comparison with Campbell's results is difficult,
 however, because he examines a different question, the accumulation of private wealth of
 all kinds in response to fluctuations in after-tax labor income.


                                            55
The new variable Q can be thought of as the net private noninterest cash
flow. Although the main innovation of the Campbell-Shiller approach does
not really require it, Ghosh, Sheffrin-Woo, and Otto all follow Campbell and
Shiller in rewriting eq.(50) as
                                                   1
                                                           '—'      1
                      CA=—E                   C.       )                            (51)
                                     Ls=t+1                         )
where O.Q = — Qt...i is the difference of the cash flow variable. Eq. (51)
says that the current account balance tends to be negative when net cash
flow is expected to rise, and positive when net cash flow is expected to fall.
    What advantage is there to estimating eq. (51), where Q enters in dif-
ferenced form, rather than eq. (50), where its level enters? The differenced
version is appropriate if one is concerned that there is a unit root in Qt, so
that removal of a time trend is not sufficient for stationarity.6° If Q is indeed
1(1) (has a unit root), then, as Campbell and Shiller have emphasized, eq.
(51) allows one to use the stationary variable bQt as a regressor without
having to difference both CA and Q, which is inefficient in the likely event
that CA is stationary.61
    The fundamental difference between the Ghosh-Sheffrin-Woo-Otto ap-
proach and earlier studies concerns how one proxies for private agents' ex-
pectations of future values of Q. The basic insight of the Campbell-Shiller
methodology is that as long the information set used by the econometri-
cian does not contain all the information available to private agents, then
past values of CA contain information useful in constructing estimates of
agents' expectations of future values of Q. Obviously, incorporating this in-
sight doesn't actually require using first differences, as in eq. (51), rather
than levels, as in eq. (50).
    Suppose, for example, that one forms expectations of future values of
Qt by first estimating a first-order VAR (the generalization to higher-order
VARs is straightforward):
                                   *1 *2
                              —
                              —                                  + e'1 1            (52)
                     CA            t b4            CA...1           e2g J

  60Ghosh (1995) cannot reject the hypothesis oft unit root in Q for his sample. Sheffrin
and Woo (1990) and Otto (1992) report similar results.
  61Trehan and Walsh (1991) discuss conditions under which stationarity of CA is neces-
sary for intertemporal budget balance.

                                           56
and then make use of its implication that

                                        —
                      E CA+             —

to form an estimated current account, aA.62 If I is the identity matrix and
'P the matrix of the d's, then eqs. (51) and (53) imply that

          CA = -      [i   01   [(1   + r)' [I—(i + r)"Pf' [zqt]

                                                                                         (54)
                                            CA][ct]
If the version of the intertemporal approach embodied in (51) is true, then
the theoretically predicted value of [ 4AQ ''cA ] in (54) is simply [ 0 1 ]!
The reason this restriction emerges is obvious when the VAR captures all
information people use to forecast future cash flow. The same restriction
also holds true, however, when the VAR captures only a subset of that in-
formation. The reason is that —CAr captures the representative consumer's
best estimate of the present value of future cash-flow changes, regardless of
what other information he or she has.
    Applying the above approach, Sheifrin and Woo find that the restriction
CA = CA is rejected for Canada, Denmark, and the U.Kb in their 1955-85
sample, although it is not rejected for Belgium. Ghosh, whose sample period
is 1960-88, finds that the restriction is not rejected for the U.S., but that it
fails for Canada, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom.
    Eq. (54) leads to a stringent test of the model, but a number of more
general tests less sensitive to maintained hypothesis could be applied. One
basic implication of the model is that CA should Granger-cause AQt. Chosh
finds that in his full sample, even this weaker test still is passed only by
the United States data. Sheifrin and Woo arrive at more positive results.
 Another approach is adopted by Otto (1992), who tests the restriction that

                      Eg—i {CA —            — (1   + r)CAt_i} = 0
  62Once again, this requires a choice of the constant real risk-free interest rate r.



                                            57
which follows straightforwardly from eq. (51). Otto rejects the present-value
model for Canada and the U.S. after finding that lagged variables help in
predicting CA — LXQg — (1 + r)CAt_i.
   While the formal evidence therefore is very mixed, Ghosh, Sheifrin and
Woo, and Otto all stress that the informal evidence obtained by simply lining
up actual current accounts with the model's predictions can be quite impres-
sive. This perspective is useful, because no empirical model is likely to be
literally true. (Of course, one should not make too much of such pictures,
either, since the lagged current account, used in constructing the VAR esti-
mates, is likely to be a good predictor of today's current account regardless
of the validity of the present-value model). In figure 7, we graph two illustra-
tive cases, Sweden and the United Kingdom, using data for 1955-1992; both
figures are based on a first-order VAR with LSQ and CA as discussed above.
The model performs very well for Sweden, but poorly for the United King-
dom. One problem might be that the model does not explicitly incorporate
the effects of oil prices changes, which have been important for Britain in
recent years.
   Indeed, if one extends the data on Great Britain over a longer historical
period, the model's performance looks much better. For annual British data
over the period 1870-1991, a first-order VAR for áQ and CA yields64

                                —
                                —

                        CA            —0.11        0.84
Figure 8 is constructed using the above estimates and assuming a real inter-
est rate of 4 percent per annum. Extending the data set yields a dramatically
better fit than when one estimates the model over post-World War II data
alone. Though the visual evidence is fairly striking, the model still fails a
  63Ghosh and Ostry (1993) apply the present-value approach to developing countries
and argue that, if anything, it performs better than for industrialized countries. They find
that across a large sample of developing countries, the level and volatility of net capital
movements predicted by their consumption-smoothing model closely parallels those in
the data. This finding is puzzling—developing countries' capital markets tend to be less
open than those of the industrialized countries—but one possible explanation relies on
the distinction between global and country-specific shocks that we make below. Plausibly,
developing countries are relatively more susceptible to country-specific as opposed to global
shocks, so that the present-value model, which assumes a given and constant real interest
rate, does somewhat better.

estimates, one obtains [     q  tat ] = [ —0.26 0.54 ], which differs sig-
nificantly from the null hypothesis value of [ 0 1
    A common theme in the graphical evidence presented by Ghosh, Sheifrin-
Woo, and Otto is that the actual current account is often far more volatile
than the predicted current account. This seems to contradict the Feldstein-
Horioka conclusion that current account movements are relatively small com-
pared to what one would expect in theory. Chosh (1994) formally compares
the variances of the predicted and actual current account series and finds
that, except in the U.S. case (where he cannot reject equality of the vari-
ances), the variance of the actual series is higher. Otto similarly finds that
Canada's current account is six times as volatile the that of the predicted
series.65 Chosh interprets his finding as evidence of 'too much' capital mo-
bility, in contrast to the Feldstein-Horioka claim of too little. One possible
explanation of the Ghosh-Otto findings is to view them as related to Deaton's
paradox of excessive consumption smoothness. The Deaton paradox can be
resolved by stipulating that income, though highly serially correlated, does
not literally contain a unit root. (When income is stationary in growth rates
rather than in levels, a small change in current income can imply a very
large change in permanent income and, hence, in predicted consumption.)
Just as the assumption of a unit root in income can lead to the conclusion
that consumptiàn is too smooth, it can also produce the result that saving
or the current account is too volatile. This may help explain the Ghosh-Otto
volatility results, though further investigation is required.

4.2.4 Global versus country-specific shocks and the current ac-
         count
One shortcoming of the studies considered so far is their implicit assumption
that all shocks to cash flow are purely idiosyncratic. In reality, even a small
country's output growth or investment may be highly correlated with that in
the rest of the world. Output shocks which identically impact all countries
should, however, express themselves primarily through the global interest
   65Sheffrin and Woo's data (which they generously supplied to us) yields similar results.
   66This criticism1 of course, applies with equal force to much of the macroeconometnc
literature on consumption.


                                           59
rate, and not in individual countries' current accounts. Click and Rogoff
(1995) argue that this issueis empirically important and try to confront it.
Their model also attempts to trace shocks to output and investment back to
changes in factor productivity, allowing for more structure than the empirical
studies just discussed.61 A simpler version of the Glick-Rogoff framework
suffices to illustrate their main points.
   Let's label the country-specific component of cash flow Qt and the global
component Qw, so that
                                      =
The global component is the part of Q that is perfectly correlated with
average world Q. Then, assuming that QC is 1(1), and that initial net foreign
asset positions are zero, one can (after many steps) show that eq. (51) is
replaced by the approximate current-account equation

                       CA = — Et
                                      {1t+1 (1
                                                   -   r)' SQ:}                      (55)


where the interest rate used is that prevailing along an initial steady-state
path. According to (55), only country-specific shocks affect current accounts.69
   To separate Q' from Q'", Click and Rogoff consider annual data for the
G-7 countries over 1960-90, treating these countries as the world (which, in
terms of economic size, isn't a bad approximation for most of their sample
period). They consider two alternative methods of separating shocks into
local and global components. The simplest is to form Qc as Q — Qw, where
Qw is taken to be a mean-CNP weighted average for the entire group. The
more sophisticated approach is to regress each country's zQ on an index of
the remaining countries' cash flows, defining Q' as the regression residual.
Click and Rogoff find that the two approaches yield similar results for their
   67Leiderman and Razin (1991) develop a model similar to Glick and Rogoff's, although
they do not distinguish between global and country-specific shocks.
   68The derivation of equation (55) requires that the variances of the underlying produc-
tivity shocks be constant. The global component of the shock, Q", affects world interest
rates but not the current account.
  69ff initial net foreign asset positions are not zero, the interest-rate effects of global
shocks can redistribute income from debtors to creditors in a way that alters current
accounts. (Recall eq. (9) above.) Glick and Rogoff show that this effect is empirically
small. Note that it would be more natural to specify the approximate model in logarithms;
working in levels is only an expository simplification.

ultimate current-account and investment equations. Overall, global shocks
appear to account for a very significant portion of total productivity shocks
in the 0-7 countries, roughly 50 percent.7° Click and Rogoff find that the
global versus country-specific distinction greatly improves the ability of the
intertemporal approach to explain actual current accounts: the coefficients
on the global shocks are invariably much smaller than those on the country-
specific shocks, and are usually insignificant.

4.2.5 Extensions
The empirical consumption-smoothing models discussed so far all ignore the
precautionary motive for saving, as was remarked earlier. Caballero (1990)
has shown, however, that under specified assumptions one can obtain closed-
form consumption functions based on the period utility function u(C) =
— exp(—vC), where z' is the coefficient of absolute risk aversion. Thus, there
is no need to rely exclusively on a linear-quadratic formulation for closed-
form solutions. Ghosh and Ostry (1992, 1994) apply Caballero's results to
add a precautionary saving effect to the present-value model of the current
account.7' The key new parameter appearing in their extended framework
is    = Var(), where
                                      =     — E'—i   Qt
is the date-i innovation to expected permanent private cash flow. Ghosh and
Ostry (1992) look at quarterly 1955-90 time-series data for Canada, Japan,
the United Kingdom, and the United States. Because they are looking at
time-series rather than cross-section data, they must negotiate the difficult
issue of time variation in o, which is a conditional variance in a dynamic
setting. Long enough intervals must be allowed for accurate measures of
cr, but intervals should not be so long as to preclude enough data points
for meaningful time-series regressions.72 Using two- to five-year intervals to
  70Costello (1993) and Stockman (1988) have found, for slightly different country sam-
ples and industry-level data, that global productivity or output shocks seem to be less
correlated between similar manufacturing industries in different countries than between
different industries in the same country. That evidence apparently points to a greater role
for country-specific shocks, and it remains to reconcile it with the results discussed in the
text.
   71An alternative theoretical treatment is Rodriguez (1993).
   72An alternative approach would be to adopt an explicit parameterization of Vart_1(i).


                                             61
measure o, Ghosh and Ostry find that their precautionary variable usually
enters significantly and with the correct sign in present-value current account
regressions. Chosh and Ostry (1994) find similarly positive results for de-
veloping countries. Their point estimates suggest that precautionary savings
are of the order of magnitude of 5 percent of imports for the African region,
4 percent for commodity exporters, and 14 percent for fuel exporters.
    None of the empirical studies discussed thus far distinguishes between
durables and nondurables or between tradables and nontradables. As we
emphasized in our theoretical discussion, both distinctions can be important
for the current account. Burda and Cerlach (1993) argue that, in theory,
durable-goods imports are much more sensitive to expected movements in
the real exchange rate than are nondurables (due to capital gains and losses).
Estimating their model poses a number of difficulties: in particular, the the-
ory calls for a measure of the stock of consumer durables, but this is difficult
to obtain in practice. Using a vector error-correction time-series specifica-
tion including quarterly data on the current account, expected permanent
net income, the relative price of durables in terms of nondurables, and a
variable capturing expected changes in that price, Burda and Gerlach find
that the expected price changes have a significant correlation with the U.S.
current account over 1970-88. This finding, they argue, provides support for
the empirical role of the durables versus nondurables distinction. It is dif-
ficult to compare these results with those of the empirical models discussed
earlier because the Burda-Cerlach setup, with its very general lag structure,
imposes much less theoretical structure. It would be interesting to pursue an
alternative approach based on eq. (23)!
    Rogoff (1992) incorporates nontraded goods into an empirical intertempo-
ral model, although his primary focus is on explaining the well-documented
near random-walk behavior of real exchange rates. His main result is that
intertemporal consumption smoothing in traded goods might account for the
persistence of innovations in real exchange rates. In the simplest case, assume
exogenous output of tradables and nontradables, a Cobb-Douglas period util-
ity function (p = 1 in eq. (17)), and an intertemporal substitution elasticity,
a, of 1. In this case, as we saw earlier, people smooth their consumption of
tradables independently of the evolution of their nontradables consumption.
 As above, the real exchange rate, the relative price of nontradables on date
  73For some preliminary empirical results, see Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995), ch. 2.


                                           62
t, depends on CT*, YNt, and consumers' expenditure shares. A permanent
shock to tradables output raises CT permanently and thereby permanently
raises the relative price of nontradables. But even a temporary rise in traded-
goods output raises CT permanently because of consumption smoothing. The
model thus can explain why the persistence in real exchange rate movements
might be much greater than that of the underlying exogenous shocks. A
country's ability to borrow and lend in international markets is the key to
this result: it would not obtain absent international capital mobility. Rogoff
(1992) applies his model to data for Japan and the United States, finding
some support, though further testing is required.

5 How useful is the theory?
Even in the its most rudimentary forms, the intertemporal approach to the
current account has proved valuable for analyzing a host of important prob-
lems. As noted in the introduction, it provides an extremely useful framework
for thinking about the current-account and world interest rate effects of oil
price shocks. Without an intertemporal approach, it would be hard to ana-
lyze or evaluate the current-account patterns that followed the two oil shocks
of the 1970s. The dynamic budget constraints emphasized throughout this
chapter are also essential in analyzing episodes of capital-market disruption,
such as the developing-country debt crisis of the 1980s. True, the standard
intertemporal models must be extended to take account of default risk but,
as we have seen, the main qualitative insights do not change. More generally,
models that fail to integrate investment, saving, and growth make it virtu-
ally impossible to understand why some countries have persistent current
account imbalances. Why, for example, are Canada's and Australia's current
accounts perennially in deficit, and Japan's in surplus, despite wide swings
in their currencies' real exchange rates? Overlapping-generations variants
of the intertemporal model are indispensable for thinking about how, say,
the aging of Japan's population could eventually lead to a fall in Japan's
persistent trade surpluses.
    As positive descriptions of the current account, the simple intertempo-
ral theories are not without their limitations. As we saw above, time-series
models based on consumption smoothing seem to work fairly well for some
countries (for example, Sweden) but, in other cases, clearly miss much of

                                      63
the action. Further research allowing for time-varying interest rates, multi-
pie goods, durable; nominal price rigidities, and some liquidity-constrained
consumers might lead to better descriptive power. If the simplest infinitely-
lived representative agent models are to be believed, then it is a puzzle that
ratios of foreign debt to output seldom exceed 1:1 when plausible parameter
estimates suggest that ratios of 5:1 or 10:1 could easily be sustainable and
                                                                            -
even optimal.
     Observed debt-GDP ratios are easier to rationalize in economies with
finite-lived dynasties, but such models, while capable of embracing a wider
set of empirical phenomena, also pose empirical puzzles. A fairly robust im-
plication is that government deficits lead to current-account deficits, but the
empirical evidence supporting this prediction, while suggestive, is hardly a
basis for strong conclusions. The striking industrial-country correlation ob-
served over 1976-1985 is not clearly evident later on. Promising directions for
future investigation include models with richer intergenerational structures
and a more comprehensive accounting of the intergenerational transfers im-
plied by fiscal and social insurance policies.
     The models we have discussed in this chapter provide only a starting
point. Obviously, the task of building and empirically applying richer and
more realistic intertemporal models will not be an easy one. But there is no
 avoiding this challenge, since the two leading alternatives to the intertempo-
 ral model are seriously flawed.
     One alternative that has been explored extensively in recent research is
 the complete markets model, in which country-specific shocks of all types—to
 human as well as financial wealth, to personal as well as corporate taxes—can
 be insured internationally. If this approach is correct, of course, then the cur-
 rent account is little more than an accounting convention without major sig-
 nificance even for a country's relative wealth position. (See the discussion in
section 3.2.1.) We have argued that real-world international capital markets
 are very far from the frictionless, full-information, complete-markets ideal.
 Factors inhibiting complete domestic capital markets include moral hazard
 problems in lending at the microeconomic level, finite lifetimes, and diffi-
 culties in insuring labor income. In international markets, these problems
 are compounded by sovereign default risk, difficulties in insuring national
 government spending shocks, and cultural and institutional differences. Of
 course, it would be vastly preferable to model explicitly these capital-market
 imperfections rather than simply to assume limited asset trade, especially

                                       64
for understanding the impact of government policy. We have discussed some
work along these lines and presented a simple example. Until these models
have been more fully developed, however, the intertemporal model seems to
provide a much closer description of reality than does the complete markets
model.
    Complete-market models represent an extreme alternative to the intertem-
poral approach. At the opposite pole are variants of the open-economy IS-
LM model due to Mundell (1968) and Fleming (1962). This approach, which
ignores intertemporal choice and even intertemporal budget constraints, re-
mains overwhelmingly dominant in policy circles. But as a framework for ad-
dressing fundamentally dynamic phenomena such as the current account and
government debt, the Mundell-Fleming paradigm, even when jerry-rigged
with dynamic add-ons, is fatally handicapped.
    The Mundell-Fleming approach offers no valid benchmark for evaluating
external balance. In practice, policymakers often strive to avoid a negative
current account. Just as efficient international trade generally requires un-
balanced trade within commodity groups, however, efficient trade across time
often calls for an unbalanced current account. The intertemporal approach
identifies circumstances, for example, a transitory fall in output or a rise in
domestic investment productivity, that justify a current account deficit. On
these issues, the Mundeil-Fleming approach has nothing to say.
    Evaluating the real exchange rate consistent with full employment and
external balance is another prime concern of policy: intervention or realign-
ment decisions may hinge on the determination that a currency's value is
'misaligned.' Since the Mundell-Fleming approach has nothing to say about
external balance, it is, a fortiori, unable to address the possibility of mis-
alignment.
    Because it lacks microfoundations or even the most basic intertemporal
budget constraints, the Mundell-Fleming approach provides no grounds for
normative judgments on current accounts or international macroeconomic
policies. No economist would take seriously an assessment of tax, trade, or
regulatory policy based on a model with these shortcomings. The intertem-
poral approach to the current account offers a viable framework for assessing
macroeconomic policy, one that must supplant the Mundell-Fleming frame-
work for normative questions.
   It is hard to portray Mundell-Fleming as a successful positive current-
account theory, either. Without denying the theory's empirical appeal in

                                      65
capturing short-run macroeconomic developments over some episodes, the
core model has no clear, much less testable, predictions about current-account
dynamics. Again, as intertemporal models become more tractable and enjoy
wider empirical testing, it seems to us that they must ultimately come to
supplant modified Mundell-Fleming models for positive as well as normative
questions.
