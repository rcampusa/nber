                                             ABSTRACT
        From 1960-1983, the standard deviation of annual growth rates in real GDP in the United States

was 2.7%. From 1984-2001, the corresponding standard deviation was 1.6%. This paper investigates
this large drop in the cyclical volatility OF real economic.activity. The paper has two objectives. The
first is to provide a comprehensive characterization of the decline in volatility using a large number of
U.S. economic time series and a variety of methods designed to describe time-varying time series
processes. In so doing, the paper reviews the literature on the moderation and attempts to resolve some
of its disagreements and discrepancies. The second objective is to provide new evidence on the
quantitative importance of various explanations for this "great moderation". Taken together, we estimate
that the moderation in volatility is attributable to a combination of improved policy (20-30%),
identifiable good luck in the form of productivity and commodity price shocks (20-30%), and other
unknown forms of good luck that manifest themselves as smaller reduced-form forecast errors (40-
60%).

                                     1. Introduction

       The U.S. economy has entered a period of moderated volatility or quiescence.

The long expansion of the 1990s, the mild 2001 recession, and the forecast of a moderate

recovery reflect a trend over the past two decades towards moderation of the business

cycle and, more generally, reduced volatility in the growth rate of GDP.

       This reduction in volatility is evident in the plot of the four-quarter growth rate of

real GDP in Figure 1. As is summarized in Table 1, during the 1960s the standard

deviation of GDP growth was approximately 2.0 percentage points. This standard

deviation rose to 2.7 percentage points in the 1970s and was 2.6 percentage points in the

1980s. But during the 1990s, the standard deviation of four-quarter GDP growth was

only 1.5 percentage points.

       The first published articles to identify this moderation in volatility are Kim and

Nelson (1999) and McConnell and Perez-Quiros (2000), who independently conclude

that there was a sharp decline, or break, in the volatility of U.S. GDP growth in the first

quarter of 1984. These papers have stimulated a substantial recent literature, much of it

unpublished, that characterizes this decline in volatility and searches for its cause1.

       This article has two objectives. The first is to provide a comprehensive

characterization of the decline in volatility using a large number of U.S. economic time

series and a variety of methods designed to describe time-varying time series processes.

In so doing, we review the literature on the moderation and attempt to resolve some of its

disagreements and discrepancies. This analysis is presented in Sections 2, 3 and 4. Our

empirical analysis and review of the literature leads us to five conclusions:

   1. The decline in volatility has occurred broadly across the economy: measures of

       employment growth, consumption growth, and sectoral output have typically

       exhibit reductions in standard deviations on the order of 60% to 70%, relative to

       the 1970s and early 1980s. Fluctuations in wage and price inflation have also

       moderated considerably.

   2. For variables that measure real economic activity, the moderation generally is

       associated with reductions in the conditional variance in time series models, not

       with changes in the conditional mean; in the language of autoregressions, the

       variance reduction is attributable to a smaller error variance, not to changes in the

       autoregressive coefficients. This conclusion is consistent with the findings of

       Ahmed, Levin, and Wilson (2002), Blanchard and Simon (2001), Pagan (2001),

       and Sensier and van Dijk (2001).

   3. An important unresolved question in the literature is whether the moderation was

       a sharp break in the mid-1980s, as initially suggested by Kim and Nelson (1999)

       and McConnell and Perez-Quiros (2000), or part of an ongoing trend, as

       suggested by Blanchard and Simon (2001). In our view the evidence better

       supports the “break” than “trend” characterization; this is particularly true for

       interest-sensitive sectors of the economy such as consumer durables and

       residential investment.




(2001), Sims and Zha (2002), and Warnock and Warnock (2001). These papers are
discussed below in the context of their particular contribution.

                                             2
   4. Both univariate and multivariate estimates of the break date center on 1984.

       When we analyze all 168 series for breaks in their conditional variance,

       approximately 40% have significant breaks in their conditional variance in 1983 –

       1985. Our 67% confidence interval for the break date in the conditional variance

       of four-quarter GDP growth (given past values of GDP growth) is 1982:4 to

       1985:3, consistent with Kim and Nelson’s (1999) and McConnell and Perez-

       Quiros’ (2000) estimate of 1984:I.

   5. This moderation could come from two nonexclusive sources: smaller

       unforecastable disturbances (“impulses”) or changes in how those disturbances

       propagate through the economy (“propagation”). Although the propagation

       mechanism (as captured by VAR lag coefficients) appears to have changed over

       the past four decades, these changes do not account for the magnitude of the

       observed reduction in volatility. Rather, the observed reduction is associated with

       a reduction in the magnitude of VAR forecast errors, a finding consistent with the

       multivariate analyses of Ahmed, Levin and Wilson (2002), Boivin and Giannoni

       (2002), Primiceri (2002), Simon (2001), and Sims and Zha (2002), although

       partially at odds with Cogley and Sargent (2002).

       The second objective of this article is to provide new evidence on the quantitative

importance of various explanations for this “great moderation”. These explanations fall

into three categories. The first category is changes in the structure of the economy.

Candidate structural changes include the shift in output from goods to services (Burns

(1960), Moore and Zarnowitz (1986)), information-technology led improvements in

inventory management (McConnell and Perez-Quiros (2000), Kahn, McConnell and




                                             3
Perez-Quiros (2001, 2002)); and innovations in financial markets that facilitate

intertemporal smoothing of consumption and investment (Blanchard and Simon (2001)).

The second category is improved policy, in particular improved monetary policy (e.g.

Taylor (1999b), Cogley and Sargent (2001)), and the third category is “good luck,” that

is, reductions in the variance of exogenous structural shocks.

       We address these explanations in Section 5. In brief, we conclude that the

structural shifts explanations fail to explain the timing and magnitude of the moderation

documented in Sections 2 – 4. Structural changes to other parts of the economy, such as

inventory management and residential investment, are intriguing possibilities but the

evidence is, in our view, either unconvincing or incomplete. Changes in U.S. monetary

policy seem to account for some of the moderation, but most of the moderation seems to

be attributable to reductions in the volatility of structural shocks. Taken together, we

estimate that the moderation in volatility is attributable to a combination of improved

policy (20-30%), identifiable good luck in the form of productivity and commodity price

shocks (20-30%), and other unknown forms of good luck that manifest themselves as

smaller reduced-form forecast errors (40-60%); as discussed in Section 5, these

percentages have many caveats.



                2. Reductions in Volatility Throughout the Economy

       This section documents the widespread reduction in volatility in the 1990s and

provides some nonparametric estimates of this reduction for 22 major economic time

series. We begin with a brief discussion of the data.




                                             4
2.1 Data and Transformations

       In all, we consider data on 168 quarterly macroeconomic U.S. time series from

1959:1 – 2001:3. The data represent a wide range of macroeconomic activity and are

usefully grouped into seven categories: (1) NIPA decompositions of real GDP, (2)

money, credit, interest rates and stock prices, (3) housing, (4) industrial production, (5)

inventories, orders and sales, (6) employment, and (7) industrial production for other

countries. Seasonally adjusted series were used when available.

       Most of our analysis uses these quarterly data, transformed to eliminate trends and

obvious nonstationarity. Specifically, most real variables were transformed to growth

rates (at an annual rate), prices and wages were transformed to changes in inflation rates

(at an annual rate), and interest rates were transformed to first differences. For some

applications (such as the data description in Section 2.2) we use annual growth rates or

differences of the quarterly data. For variable transformed to growth rates, say Xt, this

means that the summary statistics are reported for the series 100×ln(Xt/Xt-4). For prices

and wages, the corresponding transformation is 100×[ln(Xt/Xt-4) – ln(Xt-4/Xt-8)], and for

interest rates the transformation is Xt – Xt-4. Definitions and specific transformations used

for each series are listed in Appendix 2.




2.2 Historical Volatility of Major Economic Time Series

       Volatility by decade. Table 2 reports the sample standard deviation of 22 leading

macroeconomic time series by decade (2000 and 2001 are included in the 1990s). Each

decade’s standard deviation is presented relative to the full-sample standard deviation, so

a value less than one indicates a period of relatively low volatility. All series were less



                                              5
volatile in the 1990s than over the full sample, and all but one series (consumption of

nondurables) were less volatile in the 1990s than in the 1980s. On the demand side, the

1990 relative standard deviations ranged from 0.65 (government spending and residential

investment) to 0.89 (nonresidential investment). On the production side, the standard

deviation during the 1990s, relative to the full sample, range from 0.65 (durable goods

production) to 0.87 (services).

        This decline in volatility is reflected in other series as well. For example, the

relative standard deviation of annual growth of nonagricultural employment in the 1990s

was 0.73. The 1990s was also a period of quiescence for inflation: changes in annual

price inflation, measured by the GDP deflator, has a relative standard deviation of 0.50.

As noted by Kim, Nelson and Piger (2001), Watson (1999), and Basistha and Startz

(2001), the situation for interest rates is somewhat more complex. Although the variance

of interest rates decreased across the term structure, the decrease was more marked at the

short than the long end, that is, the relative volatility of long rates increased.

        Estimates of time-varying standard deviations. Figure 2 provides graphical

evidence on the decline in volatility for the 22 time series in Table 2. The light line in

Figure 2 is a “raw” estimate of the volatility of the series, the absolute value of the

deviation of each series (transformed as in Table 2) from its mean. To provide a guide to

the numerical importance of the change in the standard deviation, the NIPA series are

weighted by their average nominal share in GDP from 1960 – 2001 (the weights are

indicated in the figure captions)2. For example, for consumption, the light line is the

  Specifically, let ∆4ln(GDPt) = ln(GDPt/GDPt-4) be the four-quarter growth rate of GDP,
let Xjt denote the level of the jh of n components of GDP, where imports have a negative
sign and where Xnt is the quarterly change in inventory investment. Then ∆4ln(GDPt) ª


                                               6
absolute value of the demeaned four-quarter growth in consumption, weighted by the

average share of consumption, 0.64. The solid line is a two-sided estimate of the

instantaneous time-varying standard deviation of the series, based on a fourth-order

autoregression (AR(4)) with time varying parameters and stochastic volatility. This

model and associated nonGaussian smoother are conceptually similar (but different in

details) to the multivariate approach in Cogley and Sargent (2002) and are discussed

further in Appendix 1.

        The results in Figure 2 present a varied picture of the decline in volatility. For

some series – GDP, total goods production, durable goods consumption and production,

total investment, residential investment, construction output, and imports – volatility

declines sharply in the mid-1980s. A closer look at the components of investment shows

that the overall decline in its volatility is associated with a sharp decline in residential

investment in the mid-1980s. For some series, such as consumption of nondurables and

government consumption, volatility is essentially unchanged over the sample. The

volatility of employment growth seems to have declined in steps, first falling from the

1950s to the 1960s, then falling again in the early 1980s and the early 1990s. The

volatility of changes in short-term interest rates fell sharply in the mid-1980s, then

continued to fall, whereas long-term rates remain as volatile as they were in the 1970s.

        Results for other series. The decline in volatility seen for the 22 series in Table 2

is typical of other macroeconomic time series. Across the 168 series listed in Appendix 2


s1t∆4lnX1t + … + sn-1,t∆4lnXn-1,t + (∆4Xnt)/GDPt, where sjt is the GDP share of the jth
component at date t. The first n – 1 terms are the share-weighted growth rates of the
components, other than inventories, and the final term is the four-quarter difference of the
quarterly change in inventories, relative to GDP. If the terms in the expression for




                                               7
(including the 22 in Table 2), the median relative standard deviation in the 1990s is .73,

and 78% of the series had a relative standard deviation less than 0.85 in the 1990s. For

example, the relative standard deviation of the overall index of industrial production in

the 1990s was 0.63; this reduction is also found in the various industrial production

sectors, with sectoral relative standard deviations ranging from 0.59 (consumer goods) to

0.77 (utilities). Orders and inventories showed a similar decline in volatility; the average

relative standard deviation was 0.68 for these series in the 1990s. As discussed in more

detail by Warnock and Warnock (2001), the standard deviation of employment also fell

in most sectors (the exceptions being contract construction, FIRE, services, and

wholesale and retail trade, where the relative standard deviations are close to one.

Although broad measures of inflation show marked declines in volatility, some producer

prices showed little decrease or an increase in volatile and the overall index of producer

prices has a relative standard deviation close to one.

       Finally, as discussed in Blanchard and Simon (2001) and Simon (2001), the

decrease in volatility is not unique to the US. The relative standard deviation of

industrial production indexes for several other developed countries were low in the

1990s. However some countries (France, Japan, and Germany) also experienced low

variability in the 1980s and experienced somewhat more variability in the 1990s.

       Implications for recessions and expansions. Because recessions are defined as

periods of absolute decline in economic activity, reduced volatility with the same mean

growth rate implies fewer and shorter recessions. As discussed further by Kim and

Nelson (1999), Blanchard and Simon (2001), Chauvet and Potter (2001), and Pagan


∆4ln(GDPt) were uncorrelated (they are not), then the sum of their variances would equal



                                              8
(2001), this suggests that the decrease in the variance of GDP has played a major role in

the increased length of business cycle expansions over the past two decades.




2.3 Summary

        The moderation in volatility in the 1990s is widespread (but not universal) and

appears in both nominal and real series. When the NIPA series are weighted by their

shares in GDP, the decline in volatility is most pronounced for residential investment,

output of durable goods, and output of structures. The decline in volatility appears both

in measures of real economic activity and in broad measures of wage and price inflation.

For the series with the largest declines in volatility, volatility seems to have fallen

distinctly in the mid-1980s, but to draw this conclusion with confidence we need to apply

some statistical tests to distinguish distinct breaks from steady, trend declines in

volatility, a task taken up in the next section.



                          3. Dating the Great Moderation

        The evidence in Section 2 points towards a widespread decline in volatility

throughout the economy. In this section, we consider whether this decline is associated

with a single distinct break in the volatility of these series and, if so, when the break

occurred. We study the issue of a break in the variance first using univariate methods,

and then using multivariate methods. We begin by examining univariate evidence on

whether the change in the variance is associated with changes in the conditional mean of

the univariate time series process or changes in the conditional variance.

3.1. Changes in Mean v. Changes in Variance: Univariate Evidence

         The changes in the variance evident in Figure 2 could arise from changes in the

autoregressive coefficients (that is, changes in the conditional mean of the process, given

its past values), changes in the innovation variance (that is, changes in the conditional

variance), or both. Said differently, the change in the variance of a series can be

associated with changes in its spectral shape, changes in the level of its spectrum, or both.

Research on this issue has generally concluded that the changes in variance are associated

with changes in conditional variances. This conclusion was reached by Blanchard and

Simon (2001) for GDP and by Sensier and van Dijk (2001) using autoregressive models,

and by Ahmed, Levin and Wilson (2002) using spectral methods. Kim and Nelson

(1999) suggest that both the conditional mean and conditional variance of GDP changed,

although Pagan (2001) argues that the changes in the conditional mean function are

quantitatively minor. Cogley and Sargent (2002) focus on the inflation process and

conclude that although most of the reduction in volatility is associated with reductions in

the innovation variance, some seems to be associated with changes in the conditional

mean3.

         Tests for time-varying means and variances. We take a closer look at the issue

of conditional means vs. conditional variances using a battery of break tests, applied to




3
  Cogley and Sargent (2001, 2002) are especially interested in whether there has been a
change in the persistence of inflation. The evidence on this issue seems, however, to be
sensitive to the statistical method used: Pivetta and Reis (2001) estimate the largest root
in the inflation process to have stably remained near one from 1960 to 2000. Because our
focus is volatility, not persistence, we do not pursue this interesting issue further.

look for changes in the coefficients in the AR model,

where

                                                                         2

                   αt + φt(L) =                      and var(εt) =  2            ,
                                α 2 + φ2 ( L), t > κ                σ 2 , t > τ



where φ1(L) is a lag polynomial (etc.) and κ and τ are break dates in, respectively, the

conditional mean and the conditional variance. This formulation allows for the

conditional mean and the conditional variance each to break (or not) at potentially

different dates.

        We use the formulation (1) to test for changes in the AR parameters. First, the

heteroskedasticity-robust Quandt (1960) likelihood ratio (QLR) statistic (also referred to

as the sup-Wald statistic, see Andrews (1993)) is used to test for a break in the

conditional mean. Throughout, QLR statistics are computed for all potential break dates

in the central 70% of the sample. We test for a break in the variance at an unknown date

τ by computing the QLR statistic for a break in the mean of the absolute value of the

residuals from the estimated autoregression (1), where the autoregression allows for a

break in the AR parameters at the estimated break date κˆ (see Appendix 1). Although

the QLR statistic is developed for the single-break model, this test has power against



                                                      11
other forms of time variation such as drifting parameters (Stock and Watson (1998)):

rejection of the no-break null by the QLR statistic is evidence of time variation, which

may or may not be of the single-break form in (1).

        Estimated break dates and confidence intervals. In addition to testing for time-

varying AR parameters, in the event that the QLR statistic rejects at the 5% level we

report OLS estimates of the break dates κˆ (AR coefficients) and τˆ (innovation variance)

and 67% confidence intervals computed following Bai (1997).4

        Results. Results for the 22 series are summarized Table 3. For GDP, the QLR

statistic fails to reject the null hypothesis of no break in the coefficients of the conditional

mean. In contrast, the null hypothesis of no break in the variance is rejected at the 1%

significance level. The break date is estimated to be 1983:2, which is consistent with

estimated break dates reported by McConnell Perez-Quintos (2001) and Kim, Nelson and

Piger (2001). The 67% confidence interval for the break date is precise, 1982:4 – 1985:3,

although (for reasons discussed in footnote 4) the 95% confidence interval is quite wide.

        The results for the components of GDP indicate that although several series (such

as the components of consumption) reveal significant time variation in the conditional

mean coefficients, the estimated break dates and confidence intervals do not coincide

with the timing of the reductions in volatility evident in Figure 2. In contrast, for ten of

the seventeen NIPA components there are significant changes in the conditional variance,

and for eight of those ten series the break in the conditional variance is estimated to be in

the mid-1980s. Thus, like Kim, Nelson, and Piger (2001), who use Bayesian methods,



4
 The break estimator has a non-normal, heavy-tailed distribution, so 95% intervals
computed using Bai’s (1997) method are so wide as to be uninformative. We therefore
deviate from convention and report 67% confidence intervals.

output as suggested by McConnell and Perez-Quiros (2000). Durables consumption,

total fixed investment, residential investment, imports, goods production, and

employment all exhibit significant breaks in their conditional volatility with break dates

estimated in the mid-1980s.

       Estimates based on the stochastic volatility model. As another check on this

conclusion, we recalculated the estimates of the instantaneous variance based on the

stochastic volatility model (the smooth lines in Figure 2), with the restriction that the AR

coefficients remain constant at their full-sample OLS estimated values. The resulting

estimated instantaneous standard deviations (not reported here) were visually very close

to those reported in Figure 2. The most substantial differences in the estimated

instantaneous variance was for price inflation, in which changes in the conditional mean

coefficients in the 1960s contributed to changes in the estimated standard deviation.

These results are consistent with the conclusion drawn from Table 3 that the reduction in

the variance of these series is attributable to a reduction in the conditional variance.

       Results for other series. Results for additional time series are summarized in

Appendix Table A.1. There is evidence of widespread instability in both the conditional

mean and the conditional variance. Half of the 168 series show breaks in their

conditional mean parameters (consistent with the evidence in Stock and Watson (1996)).

Strikingly, the hypothesis of a constant variance is rejected in two-thirds of the series.

Sensier and van Dijk (2001) find a similar result in their analysis of 215 U.S.

macroeconomic time series. The breaks in the conditional means are mainly

concentrated in the 1970’s. In contrast, the breaks in the conditional variances are




                                              13
concentrated in the 1980s or, for some series, the early 1990s. Thus, the timing of the

reduction in the unconditional variance of these series in the 1980s and 1990s coincides

with the estimated breaks in the conditional variance, not with the estimated breaks in the

conditional means.



3.2 Is the Moderation a Trend or a Break?

        Kim and Nelson (1999) and McConnell and Perez-Quiros (2000) modeled the

volatility reduction using Markov switching models; as in the AR model (1) with

coefficient breaks, the Markov switching model treats the moderation as a discrete event,

which they independently dated as occurring in 1984:1. After examining evidence on

rolling standard deviations, however, Blanchard and Simon (2001) argued that the

volatility reduction was better viewed as part of a longer trend decline, in which the high

volatility of the late 1970s and early 1980s was a temporary aberration.

        To elucidate this “trend vs. break” debate, we conduct some additional tests using

a model that nests the two hypothesis. Specifically, the QLR test for a change in the

standard deviation in Section 3.1 was modified so that the model for the

heteroskedasticity includes a time trend as well as the break. That is, the QLR test is

based on the regression, | εˆt | = γ0 + γ1t + γ2dt(τ) + ηt, where dt(τ) is a binary variable that

equals 1 if t ≥ τ and equals zero otherwise and ηt is an error term; the modified QLR test

looks for breaks for values of τ in the central 70% of the sample.

        The results are reported in the final columns of Table 3. For GDP, the coefficient

on the time trend is not statistically significantly different from zero, while the hypothesis

of no break (maintaining the possibility of a time trend in the standard deviation) is



                                                14
rejected at the 1% significance level. The estimated break date in GDP volatility is

1983:2, the same whether a time trend is included in the specification or not. For GDP,

then, this evidence is consistent with the inference drawn from the estimated

instantaneous standard deviation plotted in Figure 2: the sharp decline in the volatility of

GDP growth in the mid-1980s is best described by a discrete reduction in the variance,

rather than as part of a continuing trend towards lower volatility.

       The results in Table 2 suggest that the break model is also appropriate for some,

but not all, of the components of GDP, specifically nondurables consumption, residential

fixed investment, imports, total goods production, production of durable goods, and

production of construction. For these series, the estimated break dates fall between

1983:2 and 1987:3. Consumption of durables and production of nondurables, however,

seem to be better described by the trend model. A few of the components of GDP, such

as exports, are not well described by either model.

       These conclusions based on Table 2 are consistent with those based on the

smoothed volatility plots in Figure 2: there was a sharp decline, or break, in the volatility

of GDP growth and some of its components, most strikingly residential investment,

durable goods output, and output of construction, while other components and time series

show more complicated patterns of time-varying volatility.



3.3 Multivariate Estimates of Break Dates

       In theory, a common break date can be estimated much more precisely when

multiple equation methods are used (see Hansen (2001) for a review). In this section, we

therefore use two multivariate methods in an attempt to refine the break date confidence



                                             15
intervals of Section 3.1, one based on low-dimensional VARs, the other based on

dynamic factor models.

       Common breaks in VARs. To estimate common breaks across multiple series,

we follow Bai, Lumsdaine, and Stock (1998) and extend the univariate autoregression in

(1) to a VAR. The procedure is the same as described in Section 3.1, except that to avoid

overfitting the VAR coefficients were kept constant. The hypothesis of no break is tested

against the alternative of a common break in the system of equations using the QLR

statistic computed using the absolute values of the VAR residuals. We also report the

OLS estimator of the break date in the mean absolute residual and the associated 67%

confidence interval, computed using the formulas in Bai, Lumsdaine and Stock (1998).

       The results for three different VARs are summarized in Table 4. The first VAR

decomposes GDP by its end-use components, the second decomposes GDP by its

production components, and the third focuses on the more durable components of

demand by individuals, consumption of nondurables and durables and residential fixed

investment. In each, the hypothesis of a constant variance is rejected at the 1%

significance level. The estimated break dates range from 1982:4 to 1984:1, with 67%

confidence intervals that are tight and similar to the 67% confidence interval based on the

univariate analysis of GDP growth.

       Evidence based on factor models. Dynamic factor models provide a

complementary way to use information on multiple variables to estimate the volatility

break date. Chauvet and Potter (2001) use Bayesian methods to analyze a dynamic factor

model of nine measures of economic activity (including GDP, industrial production,

consumption, sales, and employment). Their model allow for breaks in the




                                            16
autoregressive coefficients and variance of the single common dynamic factor. They find

strong evidence for a break in the variance of the common factor, and the posterior

distribution for the break date places almost all the mass in 1983 or 1984.

       This analysis can be extended to higher dimensional systems by using the first

principal components of the data to estimate the space spanned by the postulated

common dynamic factors (Stock and Watson (2001)). Previous empirical work (Stock

and Watson (1999, 2001) has shown that the first principal component computed using

the series such as those in Appendix 2 captures a large fraction of the variation in those

series, and that the first principal component can be thought of as a real activity factor.

Like GDP, this factor has a significant break in its conditional variance, with an estimated

break date of 1983:3 and a 67% confidence interval of 1983:2 to 1986:3.



3.4 Summary

       The results in this section point to instability both in conditional mean functions

and in conditional variances. The weight of the evidence, however, suggests that the

reductions in volatility evident in Table 1 and Figure 2 are associated with changes in

conditional variances (error variances), rather than changes in conditional means

(autoregressive coefficients). Analysis of the full set of 168 series listed in Appendix 2

provides evidence of a widespread reduction in volatility, with the reduction generally

dated in the mid-1980s. For most series, this conclusion is unchanged when one allows

for the possibility that the volatility reduction could be part of a longer trend.

Accordingly, we conclude that, for most series the preferred model is one of a distinct

reduction in volatility rather than a trend decline.



                                              17
       This view of a sharp moderation rather than a trend decline is particularly

appropriate for GDP and some of its more durable components. Following McConnell

and Perez-Quiros (2000), much of the literature focuses declines in volatility in the

production of durable goods; however like Kim, Nelson and Piger (2001) we find

significant reductions in volatility in other series. Our results particularly point to large

reductions in the variance of residential fixed investment and output of structures, both of

which are highly volatile. The finding of a break in volatility in the mid-1980s is robust,

and univariate and multivariate confidence intervals for the break date are tightly

centered around 1983 and 1984.



                             4. Impulse or Propagation?

       The univariate analysis of Section 3.1 suggests that most of the moderation in

volatility of GDP growth is associated with a reduction in its conditional variance, not

changes in its conditional mean. But does this conclusion hold when multiple sources of

information are used to compute the conditional mean of output growth? Several recent

studies (Ahmed, Levin and Wilson (2002), Boivin and Giannoni (2002a, 2002b),

Primiceri (2002), and Simon (2000)) have examined this question using vector

autoregressions (VARs), and we adopt this approach here. Specifically, in the context of

reduced form VARs, is the observed reduction in volatility associated with a change in

the magnitude of the VAR forecast errors (the “impulses”), in the lag dynamics modeled

by the VAR (“propagation”), or both?

       The counterfactual VAR method. Because the results of Sections 3.2 and 3.3

point to a distinct break in volatility in 1983 or 1984, in this section we impose the Kim



                                              18
and Nelson (1999)/McConnel and Perez-Quiros (2000) break date of 1984:1.

Accordingly, we use reduced-form VARs estimated over 1960 – 1983 and 1984 – 2001

to estimate how much of the reduction in the variance of GDP is due to changes in the

VAR coefficients and how much is due to changes in the innovation covariance matrix.

Each VAR has the form,


                        Xt = Φi(L)Xt-1 + ut¸ Var(u) = Σi,                                  (2)



where Xt is a vector time series and the subscript i = 1, 2 denotes the first and second

subsample (the intercept is omitted in (2) for notational convenience but is included in the

estimation). Let Bij be the matrix of coefficients of the jth lag in the matrix lag

polynomial Bi(L) = [I – Φi(L)L]-1. With this notation, the variance of the kth series in Xt

in the ith period is,



                         ∞              
             var(Xkt) =  ∑ Bij Σ i Bij'  = σk(Φi, Σi)2.                                  (3)
                         j =0            kk



        By evaluating the expression in (3) for different Φ and Σ, it is possible to compute

the counterfactual variance of Xkt that would have arisen had either Φ or Σ taken on

different values. For example σk(Φ1, Σ1) is the standard deviation of Xkt in period 1, and

σk(Φ2, Σ1) is the standard deviation of Xkt that would have occurred had the lag dynamics

been those of the second period and the error covariance matrix been that of the first

period. Although these expressions are based on the population parameters, the various




                                                19
counterfactuals can be estimated by replacing the population parameters with sample

estimators.

        Results. The results are summarized in Table 5 where, for comparability to the

previous tables, the quarterly variances have been temporally aggregated to pertain to

annual growth rates of quarterly variables. Table 5A presents results for a four-variable

VAR(4) benchmark model consisting of GPD growth, the first difference of inflation

(measured by the GDP deflator), the Federal Funds rate, and the growth rate of

commodity prices. The first two columns provide the sample standard deviations of the

various series, and the final four columns provide the VAR-based estimates of the

standard deviations for the four possible permutations of estimated lag coefficients and

covariance matrices. The columns labeled σ (Φˆ1 , Σˆ1 ) and σ (Φˆ 2 , Σˆ 2 ) respectively contain

the VAR-based estimate of the first- and second-period sample standard deviations,

which (as they should be) are quite close to the respective sample standard deviations.

The columns labeled σ (Φˆ1 , Σˆ 2 ) and σ (Φˆ 2 , Σˆ1 ) contain the counterfactual estimates.

        First consider the results for GDP. The counterfactual combination of second-

period dynamics and first-period shocks (that is, σ (Φˆ 2 , Σˆ1 ) ) produces an estimated

standard deviation of 2.63, essentially the same as the first period standard deviation. In

contrast, the first-period dynamics and second-period shocks produce an estimated

standard deviation of 1.48, essentially the same as the second period standard deviation.

According to these estimates, had the shocks of the 1970s occurred in the 1990s, the

1990s would have been almost as volatile as the 1970s. Similarly, had the shocks of the

1990s occurred in the 1970s, the 1970s would have been almost as quiescent as the

1990s. In short, the changes in the covariance matrix of the unforecastable components


                                                20
of the VARs – the impulses – account for virtually all of the reduction in the observed

volatility of output.

        Sensitivity analysis and comparison with the literature. The sensitivity of this

finding to changes in the model specification or assumptions is investigated in Table 5B.

The conclusion from the benchmark model – that it is impulses, not shocks, that are

associated with the variance reduction – is robust to most changes reported in that table.

For example, similar results obtain when the first period is changed to end in 1978; when

log GDP, inflation, and the interest rate are used rather than their first differences; when

monthly data are used; and when GDP is replaced with goods output or sales. Dropping

the commodity spot price index does not change the results, nor does using an alternative

index of sensitive materials prices (a smoothed version of which is used by Christiano,

Eichenbaum and Evans (1999)). Curiously, however, replacing the commodity price

index by the produce price index for crude materials does change the conclusions

somewhat, giving some role to propagation. The weight of this evidence, however,

suggests that changes in the propagation mechanism play at best a modest role in

explaining the moderation of economic activity.

        The substantive conclusions drawn from Table 5 are similar to Primiceri’s (2002),

Simon’s (2000), and (for the same sample periods) Boivin and Giannoni’s (2002a,

2002b). Ahmed, Levin, and Wilson (2002) conclude that most of the reduction in

variance stems from smaller shocks, but give some weight to changes in the propagation

mechanism. The main source of the difference between our results and theirs appears to

be that Ahmed, Levin, and Wilson (2002) use as commodity prices the producer price

index for crude materials.




                                             21
       Conclusions. The estimates in Table 5 suggest that most, if not all, of the

reductions in the variance of the four-quarter growth of GDP are attributable to changes

in the covariance matrix of the reduced-form VAR innovations, not to changes in the

VAR lag coefficients (the propagation mechanism). These changes in reduced-form

VAR innovations could arise either from reductions in the variance of certain structural

shocks or from changes in how those shocks impact the economy, notably through

changes in the structure of monetary policy. To sort out these possibilities, however, we

need to move beyond reduced-form data description and consider structural economic

models, a task taken up in the next section.



                    5. Explanations for the Great Moderation

       What accounts for the moderation in the volatility of GDP growth and, more

generally, for the empirical evidence documented in Sections 2 –4? In this section, we

consider five potential explanations. The first is that the reduction in volatility can be

traced to a change in the sectoral composition of output away from durable goods. The

second potential explanation, proposed by McConnell and Perez-Quiros (2000), is that

the reduction in volatility is due to new and better inventory management practices. The

third possibility emphasizes the volatility reduction in residential fixed investment. The

fourth candidate explanation is that the structural shocks to the economy are smaller than

they once were: we simply have had good luck. Finally, we consider the possibility that

the reduction in volatility is, at least in part, attributable to better macroeconomic policy,

in particular better policymaking by the Federal Reserve Board.




                                               22
5.1 Changes in the Sectoral Composition

       The services sector is less cyclically sensitive than the manufacturing sector so, as

suggested by Burns (1960) and Moore and Zarnowitz (1986), the shift in the U.S. from

manufacturing to services should lead to a reduction in the variability of GDP. Blanchard

and Simon (2001), McConnell and Perez-Quiros (2000), and Warnock and Warnock

(2001)) investigated this hypothesis and concluded that this sectoral shift hypothesis does

not explain the reduction in volatility. The essence of Blanchard and Simon’s (2001) and

McConnell and Perez-Quiros’ (2000) argument is summarized in Table 6A. The

standard deviation of annual GDP growth fell from 2.7% during 1960 – 1983 to 1.6%

during 1984 – 2001; when the output subaggregates of durables, nondurables, services

and structures are combined using constant 1965, this resulting standard deviations for

the two periods are 3.1% and 1.8%. Thus, autonomously fixing the output shares of the

different sectors yields essentially the same decline in the standard deviation of GDP

growth as using the actual, changing shares. Mechanically, the reason for this is that the

volatility of output in the different sectors has declined across the board. Moreover, the

sectors with the greatest volatility – durables and structures – also have output shares that

are essentially constant.

       The same result is evident if (like Warnock and Warnock (2001)) one looks

instead at employment growth: the standard deviation of employment growth falls by

approximately one-third whether one uses actual employment shares or constant

employment shares. Here, as discussed further by Warnock and Warnock (2001), it is

not just that employment is migrating from a more volatility sector to a less volatility

sector; rather, the volatility of employment within construction and manufacturing has



                                             23
itself declined.5 Finally, the structural shift hypothesis has a timing problem: the shift

away from manufacturing has taken place gradually over the past four decades, whereas

the analysis of Sections 2 – 4 suggests a sharp moderation in volatility in the mid-1980s.



5.2 Changes in Inventory Management

       McConnell and Perez-Quiros (2000) proposed that new inventory management

methods, such as just-in-time inventory management, are the source of the reduction in

volatility in GDP; this argument is elaborated upon by Kahn, McConnell and Perez-

Quiros (2001, 2002). The essence of their argument is that the volatility of production in

manufacturing fell sharply in the mid-1980s, but the volatility of sales did not; they found

a statistically significant break in output variability, especially in durables manufacturing,

but not in sales variability. They concluded that changes in inventory management must

account for this discrepancy. Moreover, they suggested that the decline in the variance of

goods production fully accounts for the statistical significance of the decline in GDP, so

that understanding changes in inventory behavior holds the key to understanding the

moderation in GDP volatility. Unlike the sectoral shift hypothesis, timing works in favor

of this inventory management hypothesis, for new inventory management methods

relying heavily on information technology gained popularity during the 1980s.

       This bold conjecture – that micro level changes in inventory management could

have major macroeconomic consequences – has received a great deal of attention. Our

5
 A caveat on these “accounting identity” calculations is that they ignore general
equilibrium effects of a switch to services production. If, for example, increased stability
of employment in services results in more stable incomes, then an increase in the share of
services could in equilibrium stabilize demand for all products, including goods and



                                             24
reading of this research suggests, however, that upon closer inspection the inventory

management hypothesis does not fare well. The first set of difficulties pertain to the facts

themselves. The stylized fact that production volatility has fallen but sales volatility has

not is not robust to the method of analysis used or the series considered. Ahmed, Levin,

and Wilson (2002) find statistically significant evidence of a break in final sales in

1983:3 using the Bai-Perron (1998) test; Herrera and Pesavento (2002) use the QLR test

and find a break in sales in the variance of the growth of output in nondurables

manufacturing (in 1983:3) and durables manufacturing (in 1984:1), as well as in many 2-

digit sectors; and Kim, Nelson and Piger (2001) find evidence of a decline in volatility of

aggregate final sales and in durable goods sales using Bayesian methods.

        Our break test results for sales (see Table A.1) are consistent with this more

recent literature: we find statistically significant breaks in the variance of total final sales

and final sales of durable goods. Like Kim, Nelson, and Piger (2001), we date the break

in the variance of durable goods sales in the early 1990s, whereas the break in the

variance of production is dated in the mid-1980s. Although the confidence intervals for

the break dates in durables production and sales are wide, the 67% confidence interval for

the durable sales break date does not include the mid-1980s. Figure 3 presents the

estimated instantaneous variances, computed using the nonGaussian smoother described

in Appendix 1, for the four-quarter growth in durables production and sales. Both series

have a complicated pattern of time-varying volatility, but the decline in volatility in the




construction. If so, the mechanical calculation in Table 6 could understate the
moderating effect of a shift to services.

                                              25
1980s and 1990s is evident for both series (as is the mismatch in the timing of this

decline).6

       An additional challenge for the inventories theory is that the finding that the

variance of production has fallen proportionately more than the variance of sales is

sensitive to the frequency of the data considered. As seen in the first columns of Table 7,

the standard deviation of the quarterly growth of production in durables manufacturing

fell sharply in the latter period, whereas the standard deviation of sales fell

proportionately less: the standard deviation of quarterly growth of durable goods sales in

the second period is 79% what it was in the first period, while the standard deviation of

quarterly growth of durable goods production in the second period was 47% of its first-

period value7. As the second set of columns show, however, this disproportionate

decline disappears when one considers longer frequency fluctuations: when one considers

four-quarter growth rather than one-quarter growth, the standard deviations of production

and sales fell by essentially the same amount.8 Indeed, the striking feature of the final

column of Table 7A is that the standard deviation of four-quarter growth in sales and

production fell by 30% to 40% across all production sectors: durables, nondurables,

services, and structures. This suggests that, to the extent that information technology has

facilitated using inventories to smooth production, this effect occurs as smoothing across

6
  The variance of final sales of nondurable goods has also experienced a statistically
significant decrease, although that decrease appears better characterized by a trend than a
distinct break.
7
  The entries in first columns of Table 7 closely match those in Table 4 of Kahn,
McConnell, and Perez-Quiros (2002), with the slight differences presumably attributable
to different sample periods and different vintages of data.
8
  This is true for other degrees of temporal aggregation. For one-quarter growth, the ratio
of the relative standard deviations of durables output to durables sales growth is .79/.47 =




                                              26
months or across adjacent quarters. At the longer horizons of interest in business cycle

analysis, such as the four-quarter growth rates considered in this paper, the declines in

volatility of production and sales have been effectively proportional, suggesting no role

for improved inventory management for volatility at this horizon.

        The inventories hypothesis confronts other difficulties as well. As emphasized by

Blinder and Maccini (1991) and Ramey and West (1999), most inventories in

manufacturing are raw materials or work-in-progress inventories, which do not play a

role in production smoothing (except avoiding raw materials stock-outs). One would

expect inventory-sales ratios to decline if information technology has an important

impact on aggregate inventories; however, inventory-sales ratios have declined primarily

for raw materials and work-in-progress inventories, and in fact have risen for finished

goods inventories and for retail and wholesale trade inventories. Information technology

may have improved the management of finished goods inventories, but this improvement

is not reflected in a lower inventory-sales ratio for finished goods.

        Ramey and Vine (2001) offer a different explanation of the relative decline in the

variance of production at high frequencies, relative to sales. They suggest that a modest

reduction in the variance of sales can be magnified into a large reduction in the variance

of production because of nonconvexities in plant-level cost functions. In their example, a

small reduction in the variance of auto sales means that sales fluctuations can be met

through overtime rather than by (for example) adding temporary shifts, thereby sharply

reducing the variance of output and employee-hours.




1.70; for two-quarter growth, it falls to 1.35; for 3-, 4-, 6-, and 8-quarter growth, it is
respectively 1.15, 1.04, 1.00, and 1.01.

                                               27
       None of this evidence is decisive. Still, in our view it suggests that the reduction

of volatility is too widespread across sectors and across production and sales (especially

at longer frequencies) to be consistent with the view that inventory management plays a

central role in explaining the economy-wide moderation in volatility.



5.3 Residential Housing

       Although residential fixed investment constitutes a small share of GDP,

historically it has been highly volatile and procyclical. The estimated instantaneous

variance of the four-quarter growth in residential investment is 14.2 percentage points in

1981, but this falls to 6.0 percentage points in 1985. As is evident in Figure 2, even after

weighting by its small share in GDP, the share-weighted standard deviation fell during

the mid-1980s by approximately the same amount as did the share-weighted standard

deviation of durable goods output.

       Figure 4 presents estimated instantaneous standard deviations of the four-quarter

growth of various series relating to the construction sector (these plots are comparable to

those in Figure 2, except that Figure 2 is share-weighted whereas Figure 4 is not). The

sharp decline in volatility in the mid-1980s is evident in the residential sector real activity

measures of building permits, housing starts, and real private residential construction put

in place. In contrast, nonresidential construction does not show any volatility reduction:

the variance of real industrial construction is approximately constant, while the variance

of real commercial construction is constant then increases slightly during the 1990s. As

noted by Warnock and Warnock (2001), employment in total contract construction

(which includes residential and nonresidential) also shows a decline in volatility,



                                              28
although it is not as sharp as for the output measures. Intriguingly, the decline in

volatility of purchases of residential structures is more distinct for single-unit than multi-

unit residences.

       There are a variety of potential explanations for this marked decline in volatility

in the residential sector. One explanation emphasizes structural changes in the market for

home loans. As discussed in detail by McCarthy and Peach (2002) (and alluded to by

Blanchard and Simon (2001)), the mortgage market underwent substantial regulatory and

institutional changes in the 1970s and 1980s. These changes included the introduction of

adjustable rate mortgages, the development of the secondary market for bundled

mortgages, and the decline of thrifts and growth of non-thrift lenders. To the extent that

these changes reduced or eliminated credit rationing from the mortgage market, so that

mortgages became generally available at the stated interest rate for qualified borrowers,

they could have worked to reduce the volatility of demand for new housing. According

to this explanation, this autonomous decline in the volatility of residential investment in

turn spills over into a reduction of volatility of aggregate demand. A difficulty with this

explanation, however, is that these institutional developments took time, and the drop in

volatility observed in Figure 4 is quite sharp. Moreover, McCarthy and Peach (2002)

present evidence that although the impulse response of residential investment to a

monetary shock changed in the mid-1980s, the ultimate effect of a monetary shock on

residential investment was essentially unchanged; their results are, however, based on a

Cholesky-factored VAR and without a structural identification scheme they are hard to

interpret. Additional work is needed to ascertain if there is a relation between the




                                              29
developments in the mortgage market and the stabilization of real activity in residential

construction.

        Other explanations suggest a more passive role for housing, that is, the reduction

in housing volatility could be a response to the reduction in general shocks to the

economy. For example, if the decision to purchase a home is based in part on expected

future income, and if expected future income is less volatile, then home investment

would be less volatile. A difficulty with this explanation is that, although the volatility of

four-quarter GDP growth has diminished, it is not clear that the volatility of changes in

permanent income has fallen. In fact, the variance of consumption of services has been

approximately constant (if there is a break in its variance, it is in the early 1970s; see

Table 3); to the extent that nondurables consumption is a scaled measure of permanent

income then the variance of permanent income did not change in the 1980s. This

argument is quantified by Kim, Nelson, and Piger (2001), who in fact conclude that the

reduction in the variance of GDP growth is associated with a decrease in the variance of

its cyclical, but not long-run, component.

        A related candidate explanation emphasizes the role of mortgage rates rather than

expected incomes: the reduction in volatility of housing investment reflects reduced

volatility of expected real long-term rates. This is consistent with the reduction in the

volatility of long and short interest rates in Figure 2, at least relative to the late 1970s and

early 1980s. It is also consistent with the reduction in the volatility of durables

consumption, durable goods sales, and durable goods production, which in part entail

debt financing by consumers. To investigate this hypothesis, however, one would need to

develop measures of the expected variance of the ex-ante real mortgage rate, to see how




                                               30
these measures changed during the 1980s, and to integrate this into a model of housing

investment, topics that are appropriate for future work.



5.4 Smaller Shocks

       The reduced form VAR analysis of Section 4 suggested that most, possibly all, of

the decline in the variance of real GDP growth is attributable to changes in the covariance

matrix of the VAR innovations. In this section, we attempt to pinpoint some specific

structural shocks that have moderated. We consider four types of shocks: money shocks,

fiscal shocks, productivity shocks and oil/commodity price shocks.

       Money shocks. Over the past fifteen years, there has been considerable research

devoted to identifying shocks to monetary policy and to measuring their effects on the

macroeconomy. Two well known approaches, both using structural VARs but different

identifying assumptions, are Bernanke and Mihov (1998) (BM) and Christiano,

Eichenbaum and Evans (1997) (CEE) (see Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (1999) for

a survey). Using structural VARs we have implemented the BM and CEE identification

strategies and computed the implied money shocks in the early (pre ’84) and late (post

’84) sample periods. Our specifications are the same as used by those authors, although

we extend their data sets.9 Bernanke and Mihov suggest that monetary policy shifted

over the sample period, so we include a specification that incorporates this shift.

       The standard deviation of the BM and CEE monetary shocks in the 1984-2001

sample period, relative to the standard deviation in the earlier period, are reported in the


9
 In our version of BM we use industrial production instead of their monthly interpolated
GDP because their series, and the related series in Bernanke, Gertler and Watson (1998),
ends in 1997.

                                             31
first block of Table 8. Since the money shocks were very volatile during 1979-83, results

are shown for early sample periods that include and that exclude 1979-83. The results

suggest a marked decrease in the variability of monetary shocks for both CEE and BM

identifications. The relative standard deviations over 1984-2001 are roughly 0.50 when

the early sample includes 1979-83 and 0.75 when this period is excluded.

       Fiscal shocks. Blanchard and Perotti (2001) identify shocks to taxes and

government spending using a VAR together with an analysis of the automatic responses

of these variables to changes in real income and inflation. The next two rows of Table 8

show results for their shocks.10 There has been some moderation in both shocks; the

standard deviation of tax shocks has fallen by approximately 20%.

       Productivity shocks. Standard measures of productivity shocks, such the Solow

residual, suffer from measurement problems from variations in capacity utilization,

imperfect competition and other sources. While there have been important improvements

in methods and models for measuring productivity (for example, see Basu, Fernald and

Kimball (1999)), there does not seem to be a widely accepted series on productivity

shocks suitable for our purposes. Instead we have relied on a method suggested by Gali

(1999) that, like the money and fiscal shocks, is based on a structural VAR. In particular,

Gali associates productivity shocks with those components of the VAR that lead to

permanent changes in labor productivity. Gali’s (1999) productivity shock shows a 25%

reduction in its standard deviation in the second sample period.

       Oil Price Shocks. The next three rows show results for oil price shocks. The first

two rows measure oil shocks by quarterly growth rates in nominal and real price oil




                                            32
prices. Since oil prices were much more variables in the post 1984 sample period, these

measures show a large relative standard deviation in the second sample period. Hamilton

(1996) argues that oil price effects are asymmetric, and he proposes a measure that is the

larger of zero and the percentage difference between the current price and the maximum

price during the past year. Using Hamilton’s measure, there has been essentially no

change in the variability of oil shocks across the two sample periods.

         Other commodity price shocks. The final four rows show results for commodity

price measures: an aggregate index of commodity prices (the same measure often

included in VAR models), an index for food, an index of industrial materials, and an

index of sensitive material prices. Results are shown for nominal growth rates

(commodity price inflation); the results for real growth rates are essentially identical.

These series show a marked reduction in volatility, with standard deviations falling

between 20% and 30% in the second sample period relative the first period.

         Importance of these reductions. Whether the reductions in the variances of the

structural shocks can explain the moderation in GDP depends on the importance of these

shocks in determining output growth. The final column of Table 8 reports the fraction of

the reduction in the variance of four-quarter GDP growth that is explained by the change

in the variance of the shock in that row. For example, the reduction in the variance of the

CEE monetary policy shock explains 10% of the reduction in the variance of GDP

growth when the first period ends in 1983 (but none of the reduction when the first period

ends in 1978). The BM shock explains more of the reduction, at least in some

specifications, although that percentage reduction is not directly comparable to the other

10
     We thank Roberto Perotti for supplying us with the data and computer programs used



                                             33
rows because it pertains to industrial production. Fiscal policy shocks make a negligible

contribution, and oil price shocks either make a negligible contribution (the Hamilton

shock) or go the wrong way, because oil price volatility increased in the second period.

Productivity and commodity price shocks seem to have made modest contributions, in the

neighborhood of 15%, to the reduction in the variance of four-quarter GDP growth.

       It is tempting to add up the entries in the final column to produce a composite

number, but the result would be misleading. If these are true structural shocks, they

should be uncorrelated with each other, but they are not; there is, in fact, considerable

disagreement about whether these series are plausible proxies for the structural shocks

they purport to estimate (e.g. Rudebusch (1998)). This said, although these shocks

appear to explain some of the observed reduction in the volatility, most – perhaps two-

thirds – of the reduction in volatility is not explained by the reduction in volatility of

these shocks.



5.5 Changes in Policy

       An important candidate for the moderation in GDP growth is improved monetary

policy11. Most importantly, the timing is right: empirical studies suggest that monetary

policy changed significantly in the Volcker-Greenspan era relative to earlier times. For

example, Taylor (1999b), Clarida, Gali and Gertler (2000) and Boivin (2002b) estimate

large increases in the inflation response in Taylor-type monetary policy rules for the short


to compute these shocks.
11
   As Taylor (2000) argues, fiscal policy is not a likely candidate. For example,
Auerbach and Feenberg (2000) show that fiscal automatic stabilizers in 1995 were
roughly at their same level as in the early 1960’s, and, if anything were higher in the late



                                              34
term interest rate. Moreover, developments in financial markets are consistent with a

shift in monetary policy. Although short rates are less variable than they were pre-1984,

they seem to be more persistent: Watson (1999) reports that the (median unbiased)

estimate of the largest AR root for monthly observations of the Federal Funds rate

increased from 0.96 in the 1965-1978 sample period to 1.00 in the 1985-1998 sample

period.12 This increase in persistence has a large effect on the variance of expected future

values of the Federal Funds rate, and hence on the expectations component of long-term

rates. Indeed, while the variance of short rates declined in the second sample period, the

variance of long rates, relative to the variance of short rates, increased. Taken together

with the evidence on changing Taylor rule coefficients, it appears that the Fed has

become more responsive to movements in inflation and output and that these responses

have led to increases in the variability of (medium- and long-term) interest rates.

       There now are a number of studies examining the extent to which this change in

monetary policy – more precisely, this change in the rule approximating monetary policy

– caused the reduction of the variance of output growth and/or inflation; see Boivin and

Giannoni (2002), Clarida, Gali and Gertler (2000), Cogley and Sargent (2001), Gali,

Lopez-Salido, Valles (2002), Primiceri (2002), and Sims and Zha (2002). This is a

challenging task: to evaluate the effect of a change in the monetary policy rule, it is

necessary to specify a model of the economy that is arguably invariant to the policy shift,

that is, to specify a plausible structural model for the economy. The general strategy in

this literature has been to combine some structural reasoning with VARs that permit the


1970’s and early 1980’s (because of high inflation and the lack of indexation of the tax
code).




                                             35
model to fit the dynamics in the data, but within this general framework the details of the

approach differ widely. In this section, we perform these counterfactual policy

evaluation calculations using a four-variable structural VAR with GDP growth (y), GDP

deflator inflation (π), the one-year Treasury bill rate (R); and commodity prices

(PSCCOM, z).

        Model specification and identification. The structural VAR identification

scheme is based on a structural model with an IS equation, a forward-looking New

Keynesian Phillips curve, a forward looking Taylor-type monetary policy rule, and an

exogenous process for commodity prices:



                 yt = θ rt + lags + εy,t                                                               (4)

                 πt = γ Y(δ)t + lags + επ,t                                                            (5)

                  rt = βπ π t + h / t +βy ytgap
                                            +h / t
                                                   + lags + εr,t                                       (6)

                 Zt = lags + αy εy,t + απ επ,t + αr εr,t + εz,t                                        (7)



where rt = Rt − π t + k / t is the real interest rate, π t + k / t is the expected average inflation rate

                                                                                           ∞
over the next k periods, where k is the term of the interest rate R; Y(δ)t =           ∑   i =0
                                                                                                  δ i ytgap
                                                                                                        +1/ t is



the discounted expected future output gap, and ytgap
                                                 + h / t is the expected future average



output gap over the next h periods. We have used generic notation “lags” to denote

unrestricted lags of variables in each of these equations.



12
  Similar results, but using different methods, are reported Kim, Nelson and Piger
(2001) and Basistha and Startz (2002).

                                                         36
          Equation (4) is an IS relation. Equation (5) is a hybrid New Keynesian Phillips

curve. If δ, the discount factor used to construct Y(δ)t, is equal to 0, then this is a

traditional formulation of the relation. More recent formulations based on price

stickiness (discussed, for example in Gali and Gertler (1999), Goodfriend and King

(1997), Rotemberg and Woodford (1997)) express πt as a function of the output gap (as a

proxy for marginal cost) and expected future inflation. Solving this equation forward

yields (5) with δ = 1. Allowing forward looking and backward looking price setting

yields (5) with δ interpreted as the weight on forward inflation (Gali and Gertler (1999)).

Equation (6) is a forward-looking Taylor rule, written in terms of the real interest rate.

The parameter h indexes the horizon. For simplicity we use the same interest rate in (4)

and (6), although in principle one would like to use long rates in (4) and short rates in (6)
13
     . We use the 1-year interest rate as a compromise between a long and short rate.

Similarly, in our benchmark specification we use a 1-year horizon in (6), so that h = 4,

but investigate the robustness of this as well. The commodity price equation (7) plays no

structural role in the analysis but, as is conventional, commodity prices are included to

help forecast future values of inflation and the output gap. As usual, the ε’s are taken to

be mutually uncorrelated structural shocks.

          Estimation. Our estimation strategy relies on a-priori knowledge of the three key

parameters θ (the slope of the IS function), γ (the slope of the Phillips relation), and δ

(the parameter governing the forward-looking nature of the Phillips relation). Given

these parameters, estimation proceeds as follows. First, projecting all variables on lags

produces a version of (4) – (7) in which the variables are replaced by reduced form VAR

13
     Both long and short rates could be included by adding a term structure equation as in


                                               37
residuals. (The forecasts of the output gap and inflation are computed by the VAR, so

that innovations in these variables are also functions of the reduced form VAR

innovations.) We suppose that the forecast errors associated with trend output are

negligible, so we replace innovations in the expected future gap with innovations in

expected future output. Then, with θ, δ, and γ given, the errors εy and επ follow from (4)

and (5). These errors are in turn used as instruments to estimate the parameters in the

Taylor rule, yielding εr. The unknown coefficients in (7) can then be determined by

OLS. We assume that the parameters θ, δ, and γ remain constant over the entire sample

period, but we allow the parameter of the Taylor rule to change. We also allow the

coefficients in the Z equations to changes.

       There is considerable disagreement about the values of the parameters θ, γ, and δ

in the literature (see Rudebusch (2002) for a review). In our benchmark model, we set θ

= –0.2, γ = 0.3 and δ = 0.5. When simulating small quantitative models, a larger value

for θ is sometimes used (e.g. θ = –1), but large values of θ are difficult to reconcile with

IS slope estimates computed by traditional methods (which often find values of θ = –.1 or

smaller). The value γ = 0.3 was used by Clarida, Gali, Gerter (2000) in their simulations

of the effects of changes in monetary policy on output and inflation variability.

Traditional estimates of the Phillips curve (for example, Staiger, Stock and Watson

(2001)), suggest values of γ around 0.1. The value of δ has also been the subject of

controversy. Backward looking models (such as Rudebusch and Svensson (1999)) set δ

= 0, Gali and Gertler (2001) estimate δ to be approximately 0.6, and many models are

simulated with δ = 1.0.


Bernanke, Gertler and Watson (1998).

                                              38
       Table 9 summarizes the results for these benchmark parameter values. Results

are presented for the 1960-1978 and 1984-2001 sample periods. The estimated Taylor

rule coefficients (Table 9(A)) are consistent with what others have found. The inflation

response in the first period is negative (remember that we specify the Taylor rule using

the real interest rate) and the output coefficient is small. In the second period both the

inflation and output coefficients are significantly higher.

       Armed with these estimated parameters, we can use the structural VAR to

compute the implied variability of output growth, changes in inflation, and interest rates.

The calculations are analogous to those carried in Section 4, except now the VAR is

characterized by three sets of parameters: Φ, the VAR distributed lag coefficients (just as

in Section 4); Ω, the covariance matrix of the structural shocks (εy, επ, εr, εz); and A, the

structural coefficients (θ, γ, δ, βπ, βy, αy, απ, αr) that link the structural and reduced form

errors. We present results for the triples σ(Φi, Ωj, Αk), for i, j, k = 1, 2 corresponding to

the two sample periods.

       The results are shown in Table 9(B). Using (Φ1, Ω1, A1), the standard deviation of

the four-quarter growth rate of GDP is 2.54%. Using (Φ2, Ω2, A2) the corresponding

value 1.41%. These are close the estimates of the standard deviation of output growth

computed directly from the sample moments of GDP. How much of the change in the

variability of output can be attributed to shocks (Ω), and how much to policy (A)? The

standard deviation of output using (Φ1, Ω2, A1) is 1.59; using (Φ1, Ω1, A2), it is 2.41.

These results suggest that 14% of the decrease in variance in output growth is associated




                                              39
with changes in the monetary policy coefficients.14 Said differently, most of the

reduction in variability in output stems from smaller shocks, not to changes in the

monetary policy coefficients.

          The results for other sets of parameter values are shown in Table 9(C). To save

space, this table only reports the estimated Taylor rule coefficients for each sub-sample

and the implied variability of output growth for the four counter-factual simulations.

Looking across these results, the estimated effect of the change in monetary policy is

larger when the IS curve is more elastic (θ is more negative); when the output gap

receives more weight in the Phillips curve (γ is larger); and when the New Keynesian

Phillips curve is more forward looking (δ is larger).

          One notable special case is when θ = 0, so that monetary policy has no effect on

output growth within the period; this corresponds to a common VAR identifying

restriction (see the discussion in Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (1999)). This

assumption implies that the change in monetary policy had little to do with the decline in

output growth volatility (the estimated contribution to the decline for θ = 0, γ = 0.3, and δ

= 0.5 is approximately 7%). For most of the parameter combinations examined in Table

9(C), however, the estimated contribution of the change in monetary policy to the

reduction in the variance of four-quarter GDP growth falls in the range of 20% to 30%.

Estimates with very large contributions are associated with implausibly large coefficients

on inflation in the estimated second-period Taylor rule (inflation responses of 4 or more).




14
     The total decrease in the variability of output suggested by the VAR is 2.542 − 1.412 .
The decrease associated with the change in A is 2.542−2.412. The ratio is .14.


                                              40
       Other sensitivity checks. We performed a number of other sensitivity checks.

These included reducing the horizon in the Taylor rule to one quarter; dropping the

commodity price index from the VAR; replacing the commodity price index with the

estimated first factor constructed from the series listed in Appendix 2 (as suggested by

Bernanke and Boivin’s (2000) factor-augmented VARs); and carrying out the

counterfactuals holding the parameters α fixed at their period 1 values. The results from

these models are similar to results from the specifications reported in Table 9 and, to save

space, are not reported.

       Summary. Even within the stylized model of equations (4) – (7), there is

considerable uncertainty about whether the widely-perceived shift in monetary policy in

the 1980s produced the moderation of output volatility. For the benchmark parameter

values, and for other values that produce estimates of monetary reaction functions

consistent with those discussed elsewhere in the literature, our calculations attribute

perhaps 20% to 30% of the reduction in the variance of four-quarter GDP growth to

improved monetary policy.



                    6. Conclusions and Remaining Questions

       There is strong evidence of a decline in the volatility of economic activity, both as

measured by broad aggregates and by a wide variety of other series that track specific

facets of economic activity. For real GDP growth, the decline is, we think, best

characterized as a sharp drop in the mid-1980s. This sharp decline, or break, in the

volatility in real GDP growth is mirrored by declines in the variance of the four-quarter

growth rates of consumption and production of durable goods, in residential fixed



                                             41
investment, and in the production of structures. Not all series, however, have exhibited

this sharp drop in volatility, and for some series the decline in their variance is better

characterized as a trend or, possibly, an episodic return to the relative quiescence of the

1960s.

         Our search for the causes of this great moderation has not been completely

successful, nor does one find a compelling case in the literature for a single cause of this

moderation. On the positive side, we find some role for improved monetary policy; our

estimates suggest that the Fed’s more aggressive response to inflation since the mid-

1980s has contributed perhaps 20% to 30% of the decline in output volatility. In

addition, we find some role for identifiable shocks, such as less volatile productivity

shocks and commodity price shocks, in reducing the variance of output growth. But this

leaves much – perhaps half – of the decline in volatility unaccounted for. The shift away

from manufacturing and towards services does not seem to explain the moderation; nor

do improvements in inventory management arising from information technology seem to

us to be a source of the reductions in volatility of four-quarter GDP growth, although

improved inventory management could help to smooth production within the month or

quarter. Our reduced-form evidence suggests that this reduction in volatility is associated

with an increase in the precision of forecasts of output growth (and of other

macroeconomic variables), but to a considerable extent we have not identified the

specific source of the reduced forecast errors.

         These results provide some clues for future work. Among the components of

GDP, the clearest concomitant declines appear in durable goods (both consumption and

production), in output of structures, and in residential investment. The declines in




                                              42
volatility appear in a variety of measures of residential (but not nonresidential)

construction, and further investigation of the role of the housing sector in the moderation

is warranted.

         To the extent that improved policy gets some of the credit, then one can expect at

least some of the moderation to continue as long as the policy regime is maintained. But

because most of the reduction seems to be due to good luck in the form of smaller

economic disturbances, we are left with the unsettling conclusion that the quiescence of

the past fifteen years could well be a hiatus before a return to more turbulent economic

times.

were estimated using a stochastic volatility model with time-varying autoregressive

coefficients. Specifically, let yt follow the time-varying AR process,



                               p
                       yt =   ∑α
                              j =1
                                     jt   yt − j + σtεt,


                       αjt = αjt-1 + cjηjt

                       ln σ t2 = ln σ t2−1 + ζt,




where εt, η1t,…, ηpt are i.i.d. N(0,1) and independently distributed, and where ζt is

distributed independently of the other shocks. To allow for large jumps in the

instantaneous innovation variance σ t2 (and thereby capture a possible break in the

variance), we use a mixture of normals model for ζt, specifically, ζt is distributed N(0,

τ12 ) with probability q and N(0, τ 22 ) with probability 1 – q. The series yt is standardized

before the computations, and we set ct = 7/T, a value consistent with previous estimates

of parameter drift in autoregressions. For these calculations, we set τ1 = .04, τ2 = .2, q =

.95, and p = 4.

       The nonGaussian smoother for the time-varying parameters is computed using

Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Let Y denote y1,…, yT, let A denote {αjt, j

= 1,…, p, t = 1,…, T), and let S denote σ1,…, σT. The MCMC algorithm iterates between


                                                       44
the three conditional distributions of Y|A, S; of A|Y, S; and of S|A, Y. The first two of

these conditional distributions are normal, given the stated assumptions. The third

distribution, however, is nonnormal, and as suggested by Shephard (1994) is computed

by approximating the distribution of ln ε t2 (which is the distribution of the logarithm of a

chi-squared random variable with one degree of freedom) by a mixture of normals

distribution; the means and variances of the mixture (and the mixture weights) were

chosen to match the first four moments of the log χ12 distribution. Initial conditions were

set using a flat prior, and a diffuse conjugate prior was used for the parameter values.

       Given the smoothed parameter values, the estimated instantaneous

autocovariances of yt are computed using σ t2|T and ajt|T, the conditional means of σ t2 and

αjt given y1,…, yT. The smoothed instantaneous variance of four-quarter growth rates

were computed by temporal aggregation of the instantaneous autocovariance function.

       Variance break tests. To test for a break in the unconditional variance (the first

column of Table A.1), the absolute value of the demeaned series (e.g., the absolute value

of demeaned four-quarter growth in GDP) was regressed against a constant and a binary

variable 1(t ≥ τ) for the break date. The QLR statistic is the squared heteroskedasticity-

and autocorrelation-robust t-statistic on the break indicator, maximized over τ in the

central 70% of the sample.

       The tests for a break in the conditional variance were computed as follows. Let

εt(κ) denote the errors in the autoregression in (1), where the AR coefficients break at

date κ, and let εˆt (κ ) denote the OLS residuals estimated with a break in the AR

coefficients at date κ. Under the null hypothesis that there is no break in the variance,




                                              45
E|εt(κ)| is constant; under the alternative hypothesis that there is a break at date τ, E|εt(κ)|

= σ1 + λ1(t ≥ τ), where σ1 is the first-period standard deviation and λ is the difference

between the standard deviations before and after the break. We therefore test for a break

by computing the QLR statistic in the regression of | εˆt (κˆ ) | against a constant and the

binary variable 1(t ≥ τ), using homoskedastic standard errors (which are valid under the

null), where κ̂ is the least squares estimator of the break date in the AR coefficients.

Table 3 also reports results for a trend-augmented version of this regression, in which

| εˆt (κˆ ) | was regressed against a constant, 1(t ≥ τ), and the time trend t, as well as the p-

value for the test that the coefficient on t is zero in the regression in which τ = τˆ .

Critical values for the QLR statistic (the squared t-statistic on 1(t ≥ τ), maximized over τ)

in this trend-augmented regression were computed by Monte Carlo simulation. In all

cases, the search over τ was conducted in the central 70% of the sample.

        Confidence intervals for the conditional variance break date were computed using

the least squares estimator from the regression of | εˆt (κˆ ) | against a constant and 1(t ≥ τ).

If there is a break, the variance of the error term in this regression differs before and after

the break, requiring a modification to Bai’s (1997) limiting distribution for the least

squares break date estimator. This modification entails scaling the distribution differently

on either side of the break, by the appropriate estimated variance. The confidence

interval for the break date is then obtained by inverting the test of the break date, based

on this distribution. This results in asymmetric confidence intervals that express greater

uncertainty about the break date in the low than the high volatility period. The same

method applies to the unconditional variance break date, except the dependent variable is




                                                46
the absolute value of the demeaned series and HAC standard errors are used as discussed

in Bai (1997).

Notes: The test results are based on the QLR test for changes in the coefficients of an AR(4). The first column shows the p-value for
the QLR test break test statistic. The second column shows the least squares estimate of the break date (when the QLR statistic is
significant at the 5% level), and the final column shows the 67% confidence interval for the break date. The results in the
“Conditional Mean Coefficients” columns correspond to the parameters α and φ in Equation (1). The results in the “Conditional
Variance” columns refer to the variance of εt in Equation (1), either with or without a time trend in the QLR regression. The tests are
described in more detail in Appendix 1 .

Notes: s1960-1983 denotes the standard deviation computed using the 1960 to 1983 data, etc.
One-quarter growth rates are computed as 400¥ln(Xt / Xt-1), where Xt is sales (etc.),
except for ∆I/Sales, which is computed as 400 times its quarterly first difference
(100¥∆Xt). Four-quarter growth rates are computed as 100¥ ln(Xt / Xt-1), except for
∆I/Sales, which is computed as 100 times its fourth difference (100¥(Xt – Xt-4)).

Notes: Standard deviations were computed for each of the shocks listed in the first
column over the sample periods listed in the 2nd and 3rd columns. The relative standard
deviation shown in the third column is the period 2 standard deviation divide by the
period 1 standard deviation. The final column shows the fraction of the reduction in
output variance associated with the change in shock variance. For the quarterly series the
output series is the annual growth rate of annual GDP. For the monthly series (*) the
output series is the annual growth rate of the index of industrial production. Bernanke-
Mihov-1 corresponds to shocks estimated in the Bernanke-Mihov model with constant
coefficients over the full sample period. Bernanke-Mihov-2 shocks allow the coefficients
to differ in the two sample periods. See the text for description of the shocks.

Notes: The identifying restrictions for the structural VAR are summarized in equations
(4) – (7) in the text. The two sample periods are 1960-1978 and 1984-2001.
Fract Var1 is the ratio, [σ 2 (Φ1 , Ω1 , A1 ) − σ 2 (Φ1 , Ω1 , A2 )] /[σ 12 − σ 22 ] and Fract Var2 =
[σ 2 (Φ 2 , Ω 2 , A1 ) − σ 2 (Φ 2 , Ω 2 , A2 )] /[σ 12 − σ 22 ] .
