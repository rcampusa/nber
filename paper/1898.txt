                     The Budget Deficit and the Dollar




                                  ABSTRACT




     This study examines the reasons for changes in the real exchange rate
between the dollar and the German mark from the beginning of the floating rate
regime in 1973 through 1984. The econometric analysis focuses on the effects
of anticipated structural budget deficits and monetary policy in the United
States and Germany and the changes in U.S. profitability induced by changes -in
tax rules. The possible impact of a number of other variables is also
examined.

     The evidence indicates that the rise in the expected future defic-its in
the budget of the U.S. government has had a powerful effect on the exchange
rate between the dollar and the German mark. Each
                                                   one percentage point
increase in the ratio of future budget deficits to GNP increased the exchange
rate by about 30 percentage points. Changes in the growth of the money supply
also affect the exchange rate. Changes in the tax rules and in the inflation-
tax interaction that altered the corporate demand for funds did not have any
discernible effect on the exchange rate.

     A separate analysis confirms that there is an equilibrium structural
relation between the dollar-DM rates in the United States and Germany. An
increase of one percentage point in the real interest rate differential has
been associated with a rise in the OM-dollar ratio of about five percent.

                              Martin Feldstein*



     The dramatic surge in the dollar's value relative to major European

currencies was probably the most important economic event of the period

between 1980 and 1984. The dollar's value rose from 1.8 German marks in

mid-1980 to a peak of more than 3.3 marks in February 1985. More generally,

the multilateral trade-weighted real value of the dollar rose by 70 percent

between 1980 and the first quarter of 1985.

     The rise of the dollar produced an unprecedented merchandise trade

deficit that increased to three percent of GNP by 1985, hurting a wide range

of American industries and creating a political receptivity to protectionism

that still threatens to reverse the progress of the past half century -in

liberalizing world trade. The trade deficit and the associated current

account deficit transformed the United States from a net capital exporter in

1980 to a country that by 1984 had a large enough capital inflow to finance

55 percent of the nation's total net fixed investment. In addition, the sharp

rise in the dollar not only increased Americans' real incomes but also

contributed significantly to the decline of inflation.'

     In Europe and Japan, exports rose sharply and the current account moved

into substantial surplus; for the European Economic Community as a whole, the

trade balance with the rest of the world improved by more than $50 billion

between 1980 and 1984. But at the same time, the rise -in the dollar induced

foreign central banks to increase their interest rates in order to prevent

their currencies from falling even further.2 On balance, despite the increase
                                         —2-


-in exports, the induced rise in interest rates may have depressed aggregate

demand in Europe by enough to make the dollar's rise a net contributor to the

stubbornly high level of unemployment.

     The present study focuses on the real exchange rate between the dollar

and the German mark from the beginning of the floating exchange rate regime in

1973 through 1984. The mark is not only very important in its own right but

is representative of the exchange rate between the dollar and the other

European countries since the mark is the dominant currency in the European

Monetary System.



1.   Alternative Explanations of the Dollar's Rise


     The basic cause of the dollar's sharp increase still remains a very

contentious subject.   I have argued since 1982 that the dollar's rise could be

traced primarily to the increase in current and expected structural deficits

in the federal budget and to the shift to an anti-inflationary monetary

policy.3 This view was also elaborated in the Economic Reports of the

President for 1983 and 1984.

     Increases in the federal budget deficit raise real long—term interest

rates and these higher rates attract funds to the United States. The dollar's

rise is necessary to create the trade deficit and associated current account

deficit that permits the desired net inflow of foreign capital. Moreover, to

achieve portfolio equilibrium, the dollar must rise by enough so that its

expected future fall just offsets the nominal yield differential between

dollar securities and foreign assets. This is discussed in Branson (1985) and
                                        —3—


  Frenkel and Razin (1984). The budget deficit may also raise the dollar more

 directly by changing the relative demand for U.S. and foreign goods (Dornbusch,

 1983 and Obstfeldt, 1985).

      The effect on the dollar of the rising level of structural budget

 deficits was reinforced by the change in monetary policy that began in October

 1979. The contractionary shift of Federal Reserve policy caused a short—term

 spike in real interest rates that temporarily increased the attractiveness of

 dollar securities. More fundamentally, the new Federal Reserve policy also

 caused a more sustained increase in the confidence of investors world—wide

 that the value of the dollar would not soon be eroded by a return to rising

 inflation in the United States. This reduction in the risk of dollar

 investments reinforced the attractiveness caused by the deficit-induced rise

 in the expected real interest rate.

     Other economists and policy officials have offered quite different

explanations of the rise in the dollar. The Economic Report of the president

for 1985 concludes that the most important reason for the rise in the dollar

between 1980 and 1982 was the rise in the after-tax return on new business

investment caused by the combination of the Economic Recovery and Tax Act of

1981 and the reduced rate of inflation. The tight money policy is also seen as

a cause of the dollar's rise in this period. But the authors conclude that

although expanding budget deficits in this period "may also have raised the

level of U.S. real interest rates and helped to strengthen the dollar ....   the
extent of upward pressure on real interest rates and on the dollar through

this channel is uncertain, and numerous studies have failed to uncover

significant effects" (page 105).
                                                      -4-



     The IpQ±s authors also note that after 1982 the differential between

U.S. 3-month real interest rates and a trade-weighted average of 3-month real

interest rates in six other industrial countries (calculated using OECD

inflation forecasts) narrows to zero and is occasionally negative. They

conclude from this that "other factors have continued to push up the demand

for dollar assets" and suggest that the dollar's strength since 1982 has been

due to "the combination of increased after-tax profitability of U.S.

corporations, demonstrated strength of the U.S. recovery, reversal of

international lending outflow from U.S. banks, and generally more favorable

longer run prospects for the U.S. economy... ." (pages 105-06).

     Another commonly expressed opinion is that the rise in the dollar since

the summer of 1980 reflected growing confidence in the United States as a

"safe haven" for investments by foreigners who believed that the election of

Ronald Reagan would make their assets safer in the United States than elsewhere

in the world. There is also the view, identified most strongly with Ronald

McKinnon (e.g., 1984), that the strong dollar does not reflect any "real"

but is solely an indication that monetary policy in the United States is too

tight.

     At a more fundamental level, any role for the budget deficit in

explaining the rise of the dollar must be rejected by those economists who

believe that deficits do not raise real interest rates because they induce an

equal offsetting rise in private saving (e.g., Barro, 1974). Evans (1985)

extended the procedure of Plosser (1982) to study the relation between

unexpected changes in budget deficits and the dollar and concluded the dollar
                                         —5,-



 exchange rate is not affected by changes in the budget deficit.    I return
 below to the deficiencies of this type of analysis.

      Although there may be some element of truth -in each of the alternative

 explanations of the dollar's rise, my own judgment is that they are not as

 important as the increase in expected structural
                                                    budget deficits and the shift
 to a less inflationary monetary
                                   strategy. This is supported by the

 econometric evidence presented in sections 4 through 6 below. The estimated

 effects of the expected deficits and of the rate of growth of the money supply

 are economically important and statistically significant. In contrast, the

 increase in profitability induced by the tax changes in the first half of the

 1980s did not have a significant effect on the exchange rate in the equations

presented below. The strong statistical evidence of a link between the

expected structural budget deficits and the value of the dollar is direct

evidence against the Barro hypothesis that budget deficits have no real

impact. The implied impact of the expected budget deficits also contradicts

the McKinnon hypothesis that the rise of the dollar was due only to a tight

monetary policy.

     Before turning to that econometric evidence, it is useful to consider

some further reasons for rejecting the arguments of those who claim that

neither increased real interest rates nor budget deficits was responsible for

the dollar's rise.

     The evidence presented in The 1985 Economic Report of the President (and

elsewhere) that there is no longer a difference between the 3-month real

-interest rate in the United States and in other industrial countries is

essentially irrelevant since the theory implies that the equilibrium relation
                                      -6--




between the exchange rate and the difference in long-term real rates is much

larger than the relation with the difference in short-term real rates.   It is

easy to see why this is true. Consider the situation in which the U.S. 3-month

real rate is four percentage points above the 3-month rate on foreign

securities but there is no interest differential for intervals beginning after

three months. Thus the six-month interest rates differ by only two percentage

points, the one-year rates differ by 1 percentage point, etc. The value of

the dollar can be 1 percentage point above its equilibrium value since the

interest rate differential is enough to compensate for a one percent decline

-in the dollar, regardless of whether this happens in 3 months, 6 months, a

year or longer. But with the differential in real rates concentrated only in

the 3-month maturity, any greater overvaluation of the dollar would imply an

expected future decline not compensated by the difference in interest rates.

     In contrast, consider the situation in which the real interest rate on

the U.s. io year bond is 4 percentage points above the real yield on foreign

10 year bonds with no interest differential for intervals after 10 years. Then

the real value of the dollar can fall by 4 percent a year for 10 years and

still leave an investor indifferent between having purchased dollar bonds and

foreign bonds. This implies that a 4 percent real interest differential on 10

year bonds can support a 48 percent initial overvaluation of the dollar.

     It is noteworthy therefore that although the 3-month real yield

differential reached zero by the end of 1982 and hovered around that level

thereafter, the long—term real interest differential at the end of 1983 was in

the range of two to four percentage points, depending on the method of

forecasting future inflation.4 The observed real interest differential was
                                       —7—



 therefore quite consistent with the observed rise in the dollar's real value.

 I will return below to the more formal evidence on the link between the dollar

 and the real interest differential.

      While the change in U.S. monetary policy after October 1979 may have

 reduced the inflation risk in U.S. fixed income securities, the notion that

the dollar rose -in the 1980s because the United States capital market -is a

political safe haven for foreign funds seems doubtful. Although the U.S. does

offer a politically safe environment, it is hard to see a rise in U.S.

political stability vis—a-vis Switzerland or other major countries between the

late 1970s and the early 1980s. Moreover, if there had been a shift in the

worldwide portfolio demand -in favor of U.S. assets, U.S. interest rates would

have declined. The sharp rise in real rates suggests that any "safe haven"

increase -in the demand for dollar assets was overwhelmed by the increased

supply of those assets. It is also doubtful that the declines of 25 percent

or more between February 1985 and February 1986 in the value of the dollar

relative to the German mark, the Swiss franc, and the Japanese yen reflects

any deterioration -in the relative political stability and security of the

United States.

     Those who point to the reduced lending of U.S. banks to the Latin

American debtor nations after the fall of 1982 as an example of the safe

haven effect misconstrue the portfolio effect of that lending. That change in

lending did not represent a change in U.S. demand for assets denominated in

foreign currencies since those loans were all denominated in dollars.

Moreover, the loan proceeds were used by the borrowers either to purchase

imports or, through capital flight, to make deposits or purchase assets in the
                                      —8-


United States.

     There are two problems with the argument that the dollar rose because

the strength of the recovery attracted investments seeking to share in U.S.

profitability. First, the real value of the dollar rose through the recessions

of 1980 and 1981 and was 36 percent higher at the trough of the second

recession (in the final quarter of 1982) than it had been in 1980. Real

interest rates and projected budget deficits were rising during this period

even though the econmy was sagging. Second, most of the capital inflow to the

United States was in the form of bank deposits or purchases of short-term

fixed income securities and only about one—third was in the form of portfolio

equity purchases or direct investment. In 1982 and 1983 combined, there was a

$192 billion increase in foreign private assets in the United States but

direct investments were only $27 billion and stock purchases were only $33

billion.

     In short, there are good reasons to reject the arguments of those who say

that the dollar's rise cannot be due to higher real rates because the interest

differential disappeared long ago and who attribute the dollar's rise to the

attractiveness of U.S. financial markets as a safe haven for foreign investors

and as a place in which equity investments can participate in the profitable

recovery. Although the improved tax climate for investment should in

principle have raised the value of the dollar, the evidence presented below

indicates that this effect is too weak to discern statistically.

     The study by Evans (1985) is unpersuasive for a quite different reason.

Evans' basic procedure is to relate quarterly movements -in the exchange rate

to the quarterly "surprises" in the deficit, in government spending, in
                                           —9—


 monetary policy, etc. These "surprises" are calculated as the residuals from

 vector autoregression predictions of the deficit and other variables. The

 fundamental problem with this procedure is that it assumes that the deficit

 variable that might influence the exchange rate is the concurrent deficit when

 theory implies that it is the sequence of expected future deficits that

 influences the long-term real interest rate and the exchange rate.5 There is

no reason for the surprises in actual current quarterly deficits to be related

to the expected future deficits6

     Finally, the evidence presented below supports the importance of the

increased budget deficits as the primary cause of the rise in the dollar and

thereby refutes both the Ricardian-equivalence proposition that
                                                                  budget
deficits have no real effects and the position of McKinnon and others who

attribute all of the dollar's rise to tight monetary policy in the United

States.



2.   Studies of the Dollar and   the   Interest Differential


     With the exception of the study by Evans (1985) referred to above, the

empirical research on the determination of exchange rates has focused on the

relation between the exchange rate and the real interest differential.7

Although the equilibrium relation between the exchange rate and the interest

differential is a fundamental characteristic of portfolio balance in foreign

exchange markets (Dornbuscn, 1976; Frankel, 1979), there are four serious

problems in estimating an equation relating the exchange rate to the real

interest differential in order to understand the causes of variations in the
                                      —10-


real exchange rate and, more specifically, to assess the role of the budget

deficit as a cause of changes in the exchange rate.

     First, the critical interest rate variable is very difficult to measure

with any accuracy. The difference in real long—term interest rates is equal

to the difference in nominal long-term interest rates minus the difference in

expected long—term inflation rates. It is clearly very difficult to measure

with any accuracy the difference between the long-term expected inflation

rates in the two countries. These expectations depend not only on the history

of inflation in the two countries but also on the credibility of government

and central bank policies. The critical real interest differential is

therefore subject to substantial measurement error that will tend to bias the

coefficient toward zero and to reduce the statistical significance of its

effect.8

     Second, changes -in the level of the real interest rate in each country

reflect changes in the risk premium required to get investors to hold the debt

denominated in that currency. These changes reflect variations in the

perceived risk of fluctuations in the interest rate and the exchange rate as

well as variations in the relative quantities of the assets denominated in

that currency. An increase in the level of the real interest rate due to a

change in the risk premium can occur with no change in the exchange rate.

     Third, the real interest rates in the two countries are endogenous

variables, responding to changes in the exchange rate in a way that causes the

direct structural effect of the interest rates on the exchange rate to be

underestimated. Thus, a strong dollar implies a reduction in net exports

which depresses aggregate demand in the United States and therefore tends to
                                       —11--



 lower the U.S. real interest rate. In addition, the strong dollar reduces U.S.

 net exports, thereby increasing the net capital inflow to the United States;

 the increase in the current and projected net capital inflow also tends to

 lower U.S. real interest rates. The stronger dollar may at times induce a

 more lax monetary policy than would otherwise prevail, temporarily reducing

 the real interest rate. These inverse effects of the dollar on the level of

 interest rates attentuates the measured direct effect of the interest rate on

the level of the dollar.

     An increase in the dollar—DM ratio also tends to raise the real interest

rate in Germany through the same three channels that cause it to lower the

U.S. real interest rate. The weaker mark increases economic activity in

Germany and this raises the real interest rate. The current and projected

outflow of capital from Germany that accompanies the trade surplus raises the

equilibrium real interest rate. And recent experience indicates that a fear

of the inflationary consequences of a declining mark caused the Bundesbank to

tighten monetary policy as the mark fell relative to the dollar.9

     In the econometric estimates of the relation between the exchange rate

and the interest rate presented in section 6 below, I use an instrumental

variables procedure that treats the interest differential as endogenous. The

instrumental variables are the budget deficits of the two countries, the past

growth of the monetary base and the past rates of inflation. The use of the

instrumental variable procedure may also reduce the bias that results from the

difficulty of measuring expected inflation. However, despite its desirable

large sample properties, the instrumental variable procedure is of only

limited comfort with the small sample available in the present study.
                                      —12--



     In addition to the statistical problems of estimating the direct effect

of exogenous shifts in the real interest differential on the exchange rate,

there is the more fundamental issue that evidence on the dollar's response to

changes in the real interest rate does not resolve the issue of the relative

importance of changes in the budget deficit, in tax policy and in monetary

policy. Although that could in principle be obtained by estimating a separate

equation relating the real interest rate to the budget deficit, tax and

monetary variables,10 that two—equation specification implicitly assumes that

these variables affect the exchange rate only through the real interest

differential. At a minimum, changes in monetary, tax and budget policies may

affect the expected rate of inflation and the uncertainty about future real

interest rates in ways that are not captured by the measured values of the

real interest rates. In addition, as Oornbusch (1983) has noted, the budget

deficit can have a direct effect through the relative demand for domestic and

foreign goods.

     The present paper therefore focuses on estimating a reduced form

specification that relates the dollar-DM exchange rate to four key variables:

expected future budget deficits; tax-induced changes -in the profitability of

investment in plant and equipment; past inflation; and changes in monetary

policy. The specification is also extended to include other variables such as

the net U.S. stocks of international investment and the rate of growth of real

GNP. A dummy variable is also used to evaluate whether the dollar's exchange

value was higher in the period 1980-84 for some other unmeasured reason like

an increased attractiveness of the United States as a "safe haven" for foreign

funds or international investors' greater faith in the Reagan administration.
                                        —13--



  In addition to these reduced form equations, the paper also reports estimates

 of equations relating the dollar-DM exchange rate to a measure of the real

 interest rate differential, using an instrumental variable procedure to reduce

 the statistical bias that might otherwise result from the endogeneity of the

 interest rates and the errors of measurement.

      The next section describes these key variables and their construction in

 more detail. The estimated equations are then discussed and presented in

 sections 4 and 5.



 3.   The Key Variables of a Reduced Form Specif     ion


      The dependent variable of the equations presented below is the real

exchange rate between the dollar and the German mark calculated as the nominal

exchange rate multiplied by the ratio of the GNP deflators. The exchange rate

is stated as the number of German marks per U.S. dollar; a rise of the

dependent variable is thus a rise in the real value of the dollar.

      The key variables of the reduced form specification described above

cannot be observed directly but must be constructed. The current section

describes the rationale for these variables and the way that they have been

constructed for the current study. The regression equations reported in the

next sections are estimated with annual observations for the period 1973

through 1984. The analysis uses annual observations because quarterly or

monthly observations on variables like the expected future budget deficits and

the tax—induced changes in profitability would probably contain much more

measurment error with little or no increase -in actual information.

     3.1 Expected U.S. Budget Deficits

     It -is the path of expected future budget deficits rather than simply the

current year's deficit that influences the level of real interest rates and

the exchange rate. In 1983 testimony (Feldstein, 1983) I emphasized this link

of the exchange rate to expected future budget deficits as follows:


    That is the essential explanation of the strong dollar: the
    high real long-term interest rate in the United States, combined
    with the sense that dollar investments are relatively safe and that
    American inflation will remain low, induces investors world wide to
    shift in favor of dollar securities. Moreover, the unusually high
    real long-term interest rate here relative to the real rates abroad
    is now due primarily to the low projected national savings rate
    caused by the large projected budget deficits [emphasis added].


     To clarify the importance of the long—term projected deficits rather than

just the current year's deficit, I noted:


     Net national saving fell from its customary 7 percent of GNP to only
     1.5 percent of GNP -in 1982 and L5 percent of GNP in the first three
     quarters of 1983. Moreover, and of particular importance in this
     context, the large budget deficits that are projected for the next
     five years and beyond -if no legislative action is taken means that
     our net national saving rate will continue to remain far below the
     previous level.


     If government borrowing is high for only a single year, the additional

government debt can be absorbed by temporarily displacing private investment

with little effect on long-term interest rates. In contrast, the expected

persistence of budget deficits in the future implies a larger increase in the

stock of debt that must be sold to the private sector and a persistent

displacement of private investment that must be achieved to accommodate the

government's borrowing. Future budget deficits also mean future increases in
                                       —15--



 potential aggregate demand that will lead to higher future short-term

 interest rates and therefore to higher current long—term rates. All of these

 considerations imply that the dpilar exchange rate should be more sensitive to

 expected future deficits rather than to the current year's budget deficit.

      Blanchard (1985) emphasized the importance of expected future deficits in

the determination of current long-term interest rates and Frenkel and Razin

 (1984, 1986) and Branson (1985) emphasized the importance of expected future

deficits in exchange rate determination.

     The expected persistence of structural budget deficits also increases the

risk that political pressures will lead to an inflationary monetary policy.

To this extent, expected high future deficits may raise nominal interest rates

but reduce the exchange value of the dollar by making dollar—denominated fixed

income securities more risky.

     Neither of the studies that explicitly look at budget deficits considers

the expected sequence of future budget deficits.   I have already commented on

the fact that Evans' (1985) procedure is based on the difference between the

budget deficit in the current quarter and the deficit predicted by a VAR

equation for the current quarter. There is no attention to expected future

deficits. Hooper's (1985) analysis is also in terms of the current quarter's

budget deficit with no attention to expected future deficits. As a result, I

am not inclined to give any weight to Evan's negative conclusion or to

Hooper's conclusion that budget deficits had only a small effect on the dollar

exchange rate.

     The variable used in this study to represent the anticipated future

budget deficit (DEFEX) is an estimate of the average ratio of the budget
                                      -16-


deficit to GNP for five future years. Since the five-year deficit forecast is

used as a proxy for the long—term expected deficit, it is appropriate to

eliminate the cyclical component of the deficit and focus on the structural

component of the deficit relative to an estimate of potential or

full-employment GNP. The structural deficit is calculated from the observed

or projected deficit and an estimate of the difference between the actual GNP

and potential GNP. The details of this calculations and of the derivation of

potential GNP are described in Feldstein (1986b).

       Although five year forecasts of the deficit and of GF'IP have been made

in recent years, they are not available for the entire sample period. The

analysis therefore assumes that, for the years for which it is observable, the

actual deficit and the actual GNP are the best estimates of the values that

financial market participants previously anticipated. For the years 1985 and

beyond, the expected deficit and expected GNP is measured by the projections

published in July 1985 by Data Resources, Inc. The Data Resources deficit

projections reflect anticipated policy developments as well as existing tax and

spending rules; they are therefore taken as an indication of the view of

sophisticated financial market participants. The actual and projected

deficits are then adjusted to obtain structural deficits and full-employment

GNP. Mote that this implies that for recent years the expected deficit

variable is a combination of actual deficits and projected deficits; e.g., the

1983 expected future deficit variable includes the observed deficit and GNP

variables for 1983 and 1984 but the ORI projections for 1985 through 1987.

     The anticipated deficit variable has been constructed in a way that, as

far as possible, avoids discretionary decisions in order to eliminate any
 suspicion that the deficit variable has been modified to obtain a variable

 that can explain the variations in the exchange rate. Avoiding discretion can,

 however, lead to implausible assumptions and several people commenting on an

earlier draft of this paper indicated that they were concerned about the

 implication that the financial markets anticipated the unprecedented growth of

budget deficits in the 1980s even before the 1980 election of Ronald Reagan and

the presentation of his 1981 budget.

     I have therefore constructed an alternative expected deficit variable

that differs from the standard expected deficit variable for the years 1977

through 1980. For those years, the alternative expected five-year average

deficit ratio is calculated by assuming that the 1980 ratio of structural

deficit to GNP persists. For example, the five—year average for 1978 consists

an average of the deficit-GNP ratios for 1978, 1979 and 1980 with 1980

getting 60 percent of the weight. This variable will be denoted DEFALT for

"alternativet' deficit variable. The empiricaT analysis shows that

substituting this for my standard expected deficit variable improves the

explanatory power of the equation but does not alter the estimated

coefficient.


     3.2 Expected German Budget Deficits

     Although the exchange rate between the dollar and the German mark might

at first seem to depend symmetrically on the budget deficits of the United

States and Germany, this is only true if the two countries are symmetric in

all other relevant ways. There are, however, two major differences between

the U.S. and Germany that imply that changes -in German deficits have smaller
                                       -18-


effects on the exchange rate than changes in U.S. deficits.

     First, the German economy is less than one-third the size of the U.S.

economy. An increase in the German deficit by one-percent of GNP is therefore

only one-third as large as a one-percent of GNP deficit increase in the United

States.

     More important, the close links among the European economies, now

formalized by the European Monetary System, means that European investors will

frequently act as if exchange rates among the major European countries are

fixed. To the extent that this is true, what matters is not the change in the

German budget deficit as a percentage of German GNP but the change in the

combined European (or EMS) budget deficits as a percentage of the combined

GNPs of those countries. Although this idea will be the subject of further

attention in a future study, the current paper uses only the ratio of the

German budget deficit to German GNP.

     The German expected deficit-GNP ratio variable (OEFEXG) is constructed to

be as close as possible in concept to the U.S. expected deficit variable

although differences inevitably remain. The basic source of the data is an

OECD study of structural budget deficits (Price and Muller, 1984) that

provides estimates of the ratio of the structural budget deficit to potential

GNP for each year from 1973 through 1984. Forecasts for 1985 and 1986 are

obtained from the OECD Economic Outlook for December 1985. For the years

through 1982, these data can be used to construct a five-year average by

assuming that financial markets expected the deficit-GNP ratios that were

subsequently observed (or, for 1985 and 1986, that were subsequently forecast

by the OECD). For 1983 and 1984, we lack the necessary forecasts of the
                                       —19—


 deficit—GNP ratio in the more distant future; we therefore assume that

 investors project the deficit-GNP ratio at the 1984 level.

      It should be noted that there is a serious problem in defining the

 structural deficit f or Germany since the German unemployment rate (defined to

 approximate U.S. standards) rose from less than 1 percent in 1973 to nearly 8

percent in 1984. There is substantial controversy about how much of this

 increase is cyclical and how much is structural.   Although the present

analysis adopts the deficit implicit in the OECD measure of the structural

deficit, it is clear that there is substantial possible error in this

variable.


     3.3 Tax-induced Changes in Profitability

     The after-tax profitability of new corporate investments in plant and

equipment determines the corporate demand for funds. If the domestic supply of

funds to the corporate sector is relatively inelastic, an increase in the

corporate demand for funds will put upward pressure on real interest rates and

attract an inflow of capital from abroad. In contrast, if the corporate

sector is a relatively small part of the domestic capital market, an increase

in the corporate demand for funds can probably be satisfied without a

significant rise in the real rate of return and therefore with little effect

on international capital flows and the dollar.

     The difference between pretax and after-tax profitability depends on the

corporate tax rate, the depreciation rules, the investment tax credit, and the

rate of inflation. All of this can be summarized by the "maximum potential

real net return" (MPRNR) that the firm can afford to pay to the suppliers of
                                        -20--




capital on a standard project.11 In an economy without taxes, the MPRNR on a

project would be the traditional real internal rate of return. With taxes and

complex tax depreciation rules, the MPRNR is the maximum real return that the

firm can afford to pay on the outstanding "loan" (of debt or equity or a

combination of the two) used to finance the project and have fully repaid the

"loan" when the project is exhausted.

     The standard project for which this calculation is done is a "sandwich"

of equipment and structures in a ratio that matches the actual

equipment-structures mix of the non—residential capital stock. Because the tax

law specifies depreciation rules and interest deductibility in nominal terms,

the expected real net return depends on the expected rate of inflation; a

maximum potential nominal return is obtained using an expected inflation

series generated by a "rolling" ARIMA forecast (described below) and then the

real MPRNR is calculated by subtracting the average expected inflation rate

from this maximum potential nominal return. Full details of the calculation

are provided in Feldstein and Jun (1986) in which it is also shown that

variations in the MPRNR have had a substantial effect on corporate investment

in the part quarter century.

     The MPRNR represents a potential net return that the firm can provide in

the sense that it takes into account the deductibility of interest payments.

From the portfolio investor's point of view, what matters is not the MPRNR but

the maximum market rate of return that the corporation can provide.   This

differs from the MPRNR essentially in the fact that the portfolio investor

 receives gross interest while the MPRNR reflects interest net of the corporate

deduction for that interest cost. The maximum real return depends on the mix
                                       —21—


 of debt and equity that the firm uses to raise marginal increments to its

 capital stock. If we assume an average ratio of two—thirds equity and

 one-third debt and incorporate the average historical standard difference in

 the net returns of equity and debt, we can calculate "the maximum potential

 real interest return" (MPRIR).12

      The MPRNR measure of real net profitability remained at approximately 6.0

percent during the years 1973 through 1984 and then rose to approximately 7.3

percent in the early 1980s. The behavior of the maximum potential real

interest rate was quite different. Since nominal interest rates are deductible

in calculating the taxable profits of the corporation, a one percentage point

decline in expected inflation reduces the maximum potential nominal interest

rate by more than one percentage point and therefore reduces the maximum

potential real interest rate. The MPRIR measure of the maximum real net

interest rate rose significantly between 1973 and 1981 (because of the rising

expected rate of inflation) and then came down significantly in the 1980s.

Both variables are studied in the empirical section.

     3.4 Expected Inflation

     The expected inflation rate has no direct role in a simple model of

exchange rate determination since the exchange rate depends only on the

difference in real rates. However, as Frankel (1979) has emphasized, a rise

in expected inflation may temporarily depress real interest rates (because

nominal rates do not adjust rapidly enough) and therefore the exchange rate.

In addition, financial investors may regard a higher inflation rate as

inherently more uncertain; a government that has allowed its inflation rate to

get to (say) 10 percent may be less able to control it in the future than a
                                      —22-S



government that has kept its inflation rate under 5 percent.   The uncertainty of

future inflation makes the future value of the currency more uncertain and

therefore depresses the demand for the currency.

     The expected rate of inflation is not only unobservable but depends on a

large number of variables: past rates of inflation; past increases in monetary

aggregates; projected structural budget deficits; changes in energy prices;

the current level of capacity utilization; etc. Although it is not possible

to combine all of these factors to obtain a single operational measure of

expected inflation, the exchange rate equations presented below include many

of these variables. The proper interpretation of the projected structural

budget deficit variable, for example, is therefore a combination of the direct

effect of the deficit on real interest rates and any effect that operates

through expected inflation and inflation uncertainty. It is not possible to

identify these separate effects but only to quantify the net impact of

expected deficits on the exchange rate.

     Although this approach is satisfactory as a general way of dealing with

the effect of expected inflation on the dollar's value, it cannot be used for

quantifying the effect of the tax-inflation interaction on the maximum

potential real interest rate. For that purpose, we require an explicit

year-by--year forecast of inflation over the future life of the standard

investment project. To do that, we estimate a series of first-order ARIMA

models using quarterly data on the GNP deflator with observations through each

year and use these models to forecast future inflation rates for the 30 year

life of the standard investment project. The algorithm calculates nominal

values of MPNR and MPIR using the entire set of 30 years of inflation rates.
These nominal returns are then converted into real returns by subtracting a

weighted average of the projected future inflation rates.

     This "projected inflation variable" (INFEX) is also used as a separate

explanatory variable in the exchange rate regressions to summarize the past

rates of inflation. As an alternative, equations are also presented with a

polynomial distributed lag on past rates of change of the GNP deflator.


     3.5 Other Variables

     The other variables that are included in some or all of the estimated

exchange rate equations can be easily described.

     The basis measure of U.S. monetary policy -in this study is the rate of

change of the monetary base (MBGRO). As an alternative, equations are also

estimated with the rate of change of Ml (M1GRO). Variables like the ratio of

money to GNP or the interest rate would clearly be endogenous in a way that

would be inappropra-ite for the current specification.

     For Germany, equations are presented with the rate of change of the

Central Bank money stock (MBGROG). There is however a problem of interpreting

this variable if, as I believe, the Bundesbank altered the growth of its

monetary base in response to variations in the dollar-DM ratio. A strong

dollar and declining mark created potential inflationary pressures that caused

the Bundesbank to reduce the growth of the monetary base, thereby introducing

an offsetting negative correlation between the growth of the German monetary

base and the strength of the dollar.

     Much of the financial market discussion of short—term changes in exchange

rates focuses on changes in the pace of economic activity, presumably as an
                                      —24—


indicator of future changes in real interest rates. Dornbusch (1983) and

Obstfeldt (1985) also show how changes in domestic demand can alter the

exchange rate by changing the relative demand for domestic and foreign goods.

The current analysis uses the change in real ONP (GNPGRO) as a measure of

economic activity.

     Some of the equations also include a dummy variable for the period

beginning in 1980 (DUM8O+) to see whether the effects attributed to the rising

budget deficit are simply due to some other unidentified or unmeasured

character of the period since 1980 such as the altered nature of monetary

policy or the strengthened political "save haven" quality of the dollar.

     Finally, some of the equations include the net international investment

position (NIIP) of the United States, i.e., the excess of U.S. investments

abroad over foreign investments in the United States. If U.S. securities are

not a perfect substitute for foreign securities, an exogenous increase in the

net international investment position of the United States should strengthen

the dollar by reducing the demand for additional foreign securities by U.S.

investors Similarly, an exogenous rise in the foreign holding of U.S.

securities (a decrease in the U.S. net international investment position)

should reduce the value of the dollar by reducing the demand for dollar

securities.

     Since the NIIP of the United States reflects past current account

deficits, the level of the NIIP will not be exogenous if the residual in the

current account equation or in the equation for the exchange rate is serially

correlated. For example, an increased taste for investing in dollar securities

will strengthen both the dollar and, after a lag, reduce the U.S. net
                                         —25--



international investment position. Since the taste shift is unobservable, the

coefficient of the NIIP of the U.S. will be biased upwards toward zero.

Although it would be desirable to develop a more complete analysis of this

issue with which to model the process of portfolio satiation, the current

research settles for only a very simple extension of the basic specification to

include the NIIP variable.



4.      A Summary of the Reduced Form Estimates


        It is useful to begin with a summary of the estimated reduced form

equations and a commentary on the magnitude of the estimated coefficients.

The individual estimated equations are then presented and discussed in

section 5. The equations relating the exchange rate to the real expected

interest rates in the United States and Germany are discussed in the

section 6.

        The dependent variable of all of the estimated equations is the real

dollar-OM exchange rate, defined as the number of German marks per dollar,

adjusted for the level of the GNP deflator of the two countries and normalized

to 1.0 in 1980. This variable declined erratically from 1.21 in 1973 to 0.97

-in   1979 and then climbed to 1.72 in 1984. Individual annual values are shown

in Appendix Table A-i, together with the annual values of all other variables

used in this study.

       The basic equation relates the real dollar-DM exchange rate to the

expected structural deficits as a percentage of GNP (DEFEX), the maximum

potential real interest rate that can be supported by a standard investment
                                       —26—


project given the concurrent tax rules and expected inflation (MPRIR), the

rate of growth of the monetary base (MBGRO), and the average future GNP

inflation projected by a rolling ARIMA model (INFEX). To test the sensitivity

of the estimated effect of the expected deficit variable to the specification

of the exchange rate equation, a large number of variants of this basic

specification have been estimated. These variations included omitting some of

the basic variables, replacing the basic variables with other closely related

variables (e.g., replacing INFEX by a polynomial distributed lag on past

changes in the GNP deflator), and adding additional variables.

     Several results are very robust with respect to alternative

specifications. The coefficient of the expected future budget deficits is

always positive, substantial and almost always statistically significant. The

point estimate generally varies between 0.25 and 0.40. To appreciate the

magnitude of this coefficient, it is useful to recognize that DEFEX rose from

1.58 (percent of GNP) in 1978 and 1.79 in 1979 to 3.38 in 1983 and 3.33 in

19 4. Comparing the average of the first two years with the average of the

last two years implies an increase of 1.67 percent of GNP. A coefficient of

0.25 implies an increase of the dollar-DM exchange rate index of 0.42 while a

coefficient of 0.40 implies an increase of the dollar-OM index of 0.67. Since

the dollar-DM index rose from 0.99 in 1978-79 to 1.61 in 1983-84, the rise in

the expected budget deficit can account for between two-thirds of the dollar's

rise (0.42/0.62 =   0.677) and slightly more than 100 percent of the dollar's
rise (0.67/0.62 =   1.08).
     The coefficient of monetary base growth is always negative and generally

statistically significant. A negative coefficient implies that a faster
                                        —27—


 growth of the monetary base depresses the value of the dollar. This may be

 because an increase in the monetary base temporarily increases the
                                                                        liquidity
 of the banking system and therefore reduces interest rates or, more generally,

 because it causes nominal interest rates to decline.   Alternatively, more rapid
 growth of the monetary base may raise expected inflation or inflation

 uncertainty, thereby making dollar securities more risky.

       The value of the coefficient of the annual growth rate of the monetary

 base is approximately -0.06. Although the implied effect of monetary policy

can explain relatively little of the dollar's rise from 1980 to 1984, it does

 indicate an important effect during the early part of the period. The annual

rate of growth of the monetary base fell from 8.8 percent in 1978 and 1979 to

a low of 6.4 percent in 1981. The coefficient of 0.06 implies a rise in the

OM-dollar exchange rate index of 0.144 between these years. Since the actual

exchange rate index rose from 0.99 to 1.31, the tighter money can account for

nearly one—half of the observed rise (0.144/0.32 =   0.45)   from 1978-79 to 1981.

However, since the epxected budget deficit increased during these same years

from 1.68 percent of GNP to 2.82 percent of GNP, the implied rise in the

DM—dollar index was about twice as large as the rise implied by the change in

monetary policy and the two together account for more than the entire rise,

implying that other factors depressed the dollar's value during this period.

     By 1984, the annual rate of increase of the monetary base was back up to

8.1 percent, implying that the change from 1978—79 could only explain about

0.05 points of the 0.73 point rise -in the real dollar—OM ratio.

     The coefficient of the MPRIR tax variable was frequently insignificant

and generally had the wrong sign (implying that increases in the maximum
                                      -28—



potential real interest rate that resulted from changes in ex ante effective

tax rates depressed the value of the dollar).    The coefficient of the MPRNR

variable also generally had the wrong sign but was almost always

insignificant. While a negative coefficient cannot be reconciled with the
                                              coefficients are consistent with
theoretical expectations, the insignificant
                                              1978) that shifts in the MPIR had
an earlier finding (Feldsteifl and Summers,

only a small effect on market interest rates, a result that was obtained more

recently (Feldstein, 1986b) in an even stronger form. The small and

insignificant effect of the MPRIR and MPRNR on the financial variables stands

in sharp contrast to their powerful effects on real investment reported -in

Feldstein (1982) and Feldstein and Jun (1986).

     The insensitivity of the real interest rate and the real exchange rate to

the rate that corporate borrowers can afford to pay on a standard investment

project may simply reflect the fact that corporate borrowers represent only a

small part of the funds raised in credit markets.     Between 1980 and 1984,

corporate borrowing was only 20.5 percent of the total funds raised -in the

 credit markets by all of the public and private nonfinancial borrowers

 combined. Even a substantial shift in the demand curve represented by this 20

 percent need not cause an appreciable rise in the interest rate if the

 additional funds are easily attracted from the other borrowers, from potential

 savers, or from the rest of the world.

      Negative coefficients of the MPRIR and MPRNR variables cannot be given a
                                                      correlation of this
 structural interpretation. They may represent the

 variable with other omitted variables that depress the value of the dollar.

 While this leaves some residual doubt about the actual impact of the tax
 changes, it   is   important to note that including, excluding or changing the

specification of the tax variable does not alter the conclusions about the

expected budget deficit variable.

       The inflation variables had a negative coefficient, implying that a

higher rate of predicted inflation (or past inflation) depressed the relative

value of the dollar. This may reflect a failure of the nominal interest rate

to adjust quickly enough to changes in the expected rate of inflation.

Alternatively, if there is a positive correlation between the inflation level

and inflation uncertainty, the higher level of predicted inflation may make

the dollar a riskier asset for investors and therefore an asset of lower

va 1 ue.


       Although the inflation coefficient was always negative, the magnitude of

the coefficient varied substantially from specification to specification and

was not always statistically significant. In interpreting the coefficient, it

should be borne in mind that INFEX rose from 6.7 percent in 1978-79 to 8.1

percent in 1981 and fell to 5.5 percent in 1984. A coefficient of -0.04 on

this variable would imply a decline of 0.06 points on the doiiar-0M index

between 1978—79 and 1981 followed by a rise of 0.10 points between 1981 and

1984. This increase represents about one-fourth of the rise in the dollar-DM

index during those years.

      The estimated coefficients of the expected German budget deficits are

always insignificant. This may reflect the difficulty in measuring the German

structural deficit accurately or it may reflect the fact that the close links

among the European economies mean that the dollar-DM ratio is not sensitive to

German deficits p se. Only future work will clarify this. It is important
                                      —30-


to note however that the inclusion or exclusion of this variable has

essentially no effect on the coefficient of the U.S. budget deficit variable.



5.   The Estimated Reduced Form Equations


     Table 1 presents the basic reduced form equation and a number of

variations on this specification. In equation 1.1 the coefficient of the

expected deficit variable (tJEFEX) is 0.375 with a standard error of 0.071,

implying that each percentage point increase in the ratio of expected

structural deficit to GNP raises the real dollar-OM index by 0.375 points. As

noted above, the real dollar-UM index rose from 0.99 in 1978-79 to 1.72 in

1984 while the expected deficit rose from 1.68 percent of GNP to 3.35 percent

of GNP. The coefficient of 0.375 implies that the rise in DEFEX accounts for

63 points of the 73 point rise in the index.

     The coefficient of the tax variable, the maximum potential real interest

rate (MPRIR) supportable by a standard project, has the wrong sign.    I return

to this and to its sensitivity to specification in the equations that follow.

     The coefficient of the ARIMA inflation projection (INFEX) is negative but

is only -0.010 and much smaller than its standard error of 0.029. It is

useful to reiterate a point made earlier that this ARIMA variable should not

be regarded as equivalent to inflation expectations since inflation

expectations at any time will also reflect the growth of the monetary base,

the size of projected budget deficits and many other political and economic

factors.

     Finally, the rate of growth of the monetary base has a coefficient of

—0.06 (with a standard error of 0.042), implying that a faster rate of
 monetary growth depresses the value of the dollar.

      The adjusted R2 of 0.78 implies that the equation explains the variations

 in the dollar-OM ratio quite well and the Ourbin-Watson statistic of 1.68

 indicates that there is little serial correlation of the residuals.

     Equation (1.2) replaces the basic DEFEX variable with the alternative

DEFALT variable (described in 3.1) that was constructed to avoid the

assumption that financial market participants anticipated the large budget

deficits before 1981. The coefficient of DEFALT is 0.385 and therefore almost

identical to the 0.375 coefficient of 0EFEX reported in equation (1.1). The

standard error of DEFALT is however only 0.031 or less than half of the

standard error of the coefficient of DEFEX, reflecting the fact that the

alternative variable has far less "noise in it. This is also seen in the

sharp rise of the corrected 2 from 0.78 in equation (1.1). to 0.95

in equation (1.2). The other coefficients are not changed in any substantial

way. Although the DEFALT seems clearly to be a better variable than the DEFEX

variable, the latter does have the virtue that its construction involved less

discretion and I will continue to present results for that variable.

     Because the coefficient of the inflation variable is much smaller than

its standard error, it is desirable to conserve the very scarce degrees of

freedom by reestimating the equation with the INFEX variable omitted. This is

done in equation (1.3). None of the remaining coefficients or standard errors

changes appreciably.

     Instead of omitting the rolling ARIMA forecast variable, equation (1.4)

replaces it with a polynomial distributed lag on the annual changes of the GNP

deflator. The distributed lag coefficients are constrained to satisfy a
third—order polynomial on six lagged values of the annual rate of change of

the GNP deflator with no restriction on the final weight. The sum of the

implied coefficients is —0.098 with a standard error of 0.082. The monetary

base variable remains essentially unchanged with this respecification. The

coefficient of MPRIR drops to -0.016 and is completely insignificant (standard

error 0.077); this is reassuring since an insignificant coefficient is quite

plausible while a significantly negative one cannot be justified. Finally, the

coefficient of DEFEX drops to 0.254 but remains both statistically significant

and economically very powerful. The corrected 2 statistic of 0.84 shows that

the polynomial distributed lag specification has slightly greater explanatory

power than the more constrained INFEX specification.

     Since the MPRIR variable is either insignificant or significant with the

wrong sign, it is useful to see the implications of omitting it from the

specification. This is done in equation (1.5). The coefficient of the DEFEX

variable is 0.234, indicating that the decline in the coefficient value

observed in 1.4 was due to the small size of the MPRIR coefficient rather than

to the change in the inflation variable p se. This specification is clearly

inferior to the previous ones, with a much lower corrected   and a very much

lower Ourbin—Watson statistic.

    To deal with the low Durbin-Watson statistic, equation (1.5) was reestimated

with a first-order transformation. Since this still had a low Durbin—Watson

statistic, a second-order autocorrelation correction was used. This is shown

in equation (1.6). The DEFEX coefficient has remained essentially unchanged at

0.236 and the M8GRO coefficient has returned to —0.060. The inflation

coefficient is now the same size as its standard error. This variable is
                                        —33--



dropped in equation (1.7) where the other coefficients remain essentially

unchanged.

     The specification of the MPRJR variable requires assuming a particular

marginal debt-equity ratio and a particular yield difference between equity

and debt. An alternative measure of the effect of changes in tax rules and in

the tax-inflation interaction is to use the less restricted variable MPRNR,

the maximum potential real net return. This alternative is used in equations

(1.8) through (1.10).

     Equation (1.8) parallels (1.1) except for the substitution of MPRNR for

MPRIR. The OEFEX variable is essentially unchanged (0.343 with a standard

error of 0.123) while the MPRNR is statistically insignificant, MBGRO is

similar to its earlier value (-0.054 ) and the INFEX variable is now nearly

twice its standard error (—0.070 with a standard error of 0.,039). A first—

order autocorrelation correction actually lowers the Durbin—Watson statistic.

     A far better specification is obtained by substituting the polynomial

distributed lag for the INFEX variable (equation 1.10). This combination of

variables has the highest corrected 2 statistic (0.86) and a Durbin—Watson

statistic of 2.48. The coefficient of the DEFEX variable is 0.283 with a

standard error of only 0.075. MBGRO and PDLINF are both negative and nearly

twice their standard errors while the coefficient of MPRNR is satisfactorily

less than its standard error.

     Equation (1.11) is similar to (1.1) but constrains the monetary

base growth not to appear- in the equation. Although the resulting

specification is not very satisfactory, the coefficient of DEFEX remains

almost unchanged from equation (1.1).
                                         —34-


     Finally, equation (1.12) substitutes the rate of growth of Ml for the rate

of growth of the monetary base. The coefficients are generally similar to

those of equation 1.1 but the overall goodness of fit is slightly worse.

     A variety of additional sensitivity tests are presented in Table 2.

These tests involve adding several new variables as well as considering some

of the variations discussed in Table 1. All of the results again support the

conclusion that the coefficient of the expected deficit is statistically

significant and economically powerful.

        Equation (2.1) starts with the basic specification of equation (1.1) and

adds a dummy variable equal to one for the years 1980 through 1984 and zero

for the previous years. The purpose of the dummy variable is to test whether

the dollar was strong in the 1980s for any of a variety of otherwise

unspecified reasons (the new monetary policy regime that began in October

1979; the Reagan presidency; the increased importance of the United States as

a political safe haven for foreign capital; etc.). If some combination of

omitted variables did indeed raise the dollar in the 1980s above what it would

large   expected deficits or to some other variable that distinguished the 1980s

from previous years. Including a specific dummy variable should eliminate

this source of bias.

     Rather surprisingly, the coefficient of the dummy variable for the 1980s

(OUM8O+) is negative, about twice its standard error and quite large in

absolute size (about -0.25 ).    This   implies that the unspecified factors at

work in the 1980s had the effect of lowering the dollar relative to the German

mark in comparison to the earlier years. Faced with the negative coefficient,
                                       -35--



 it is of course possible to identify possible explanations. For example, the

decline -in OPEC financial assets during most of the 1980s reduced the demand

 for dollar securities relative to DM securities. The conservative political

victories in Germany and Britain, and the switch in French economic policy,

may have revived the demand for portfolio investment in Europe.

     The important point to note about these arguments is that they imply that

the actual rise of the dollar in the 1980s is even more surprising and that

the combined role of those factors that systematically raised the dollar was

even stronger. The other coefficients of equation (2.1) show that the primary

effect of including DUM8O+ is to raise the coefficient of DEFEX from 0.375 to

0.525.

     The DUM8O+ variable appears in most of the specifications of Table 2. Its

coefficient is almost always about twice its standard error and it has the

effect of raising the coefficient of DEFEX to 0.5 or above. Although it is of

course possible that the DUM8O÷ variable is spurious, it is not necessary to

decide this question in order to say whether the rise in the expected budget

deficit was an important cause of the increase in the dollar. That is clearly

an implication of the specifications of Table 1 without the OUM8O+ variable as

well as of the equations in Table 2 with the OUM8O+ variable.

     Equation (2.2) drops the INFEX variable and equation (2.3) replaces it

with the polynomial distributed lag. Equation (2.4) omits the tax variable

while equation (2.5) switches to the relatively unconstrained MPRNR

specification. Equation (2.6), with no tax variable and with the distributed

lag specification of the inflation variable is one of the -few specfications

in which the coefficient of the DUM8O+ variable is only slightly greater than
                                     —36—


its standard error. In this specification, the coefficient of the DEFEX

variable is reduced to the level of 0.343, approximately its value in the

equations without the DUM8O+ variable.

     Equations (2.7) through (2.11) include the annual growth of real GNP

(GNPGRO) as an additional explanatory variable. When the OUM8O+ variable is

not present (equations 2.7 and 2.8), the GNPGRO variable is only slightly

greater than its standard error. The OEFEX coefficients are raised by a small

amount and the inflation variables are insignificant. When the DUM8O+ variable

is present, the GNPGRO coefficients are quite significant and the DEFEX

coefficients are increased to more than 0.5.

     Finally, equation (2.11) adds the net international investment position of

the United States as a percent of GNP (NIIP). Its coefficient is very much

less than its standard error and the remaining coefficients are very similar

to the coefficients of equation (1.7) (which has the same specification except

for the NIIP variable). The statistical insignificance of this coefficient

should not be overinterpreted. As I noted above, the net stock of accumulated

assets may not be truly exogenous since the decline in NIIP in the 1980s has

been the cumulative result of the high value of the dollar and the resulting

current account deficits.13

     Table 3 extends the analysis of tables 1 and 2 to include the German

deficit and monetary base variables. For reference, the basic specification of

equation (1.1) is repeated in equation (3.1). Adding the variable that measures

the ratio of expected German deficits to GNP (OEFEXG) and the growth of the

German monetary base (MBGROG) does not alter the other coefficients

substantially but does cause the standard errors to become quite large
                                      —37--



(equation (3.2)). The additional variables also leave the corrected

   unchanged.

     The increased standard errors is perhaps not surprising since equation

(3.2) has six coefficients and a constant term to estimate with only twelve

observations. Dropping the German monetary base variable (equation (3.3)) leaves

the coefficients of the four U.S. variables very similar to the basic

specification of equation (3.1) but with very large standard errors. The

coefficient of the German deficit variable is small and only about one-tenth

of its standard error.

     In an attempt to reduce the problem of the large standard errors, these

equations are repeated with the standard U.S. DEFEX variable replaced by the

alternative DEFALT variable in which the observations for 1977 through 1980

are modified to assume that the 1980 deficit-GNP ratio was projected forward

until after the 1980 election. Equation (1.2) indicated that this substitution

leaves the coefficient of the deficit and other variables essentially

unchanged while reducing their standard errors. The effect is similar -in

equation (3.4). The coefficient of DEFALT is 0.414 with a standard error of

0.103. The coefficients of MPRIR and MBGRO are very similar to their values

in equation (3.1) but with smaller standard errors. The coefficient of INFEX

remains very much smaller than its standard error. The coefficients of the two

German variables are again much smaller than their standard errors.

    Dropping the insignificant MBGROG and INFEX variables and the MPRIR

variable which has an inadmissible sign leads to equation (3.5) in which the

three remaining variables are statistically significant and have the correct

sign. In this equation, which is estimated after a second—order
autocorrelation transformation, the coefficient of DEFALT is 0.202 (with a

standard error of 0.058) and in which the coefficient of the German deficit

variable is —0.173 w-ith a standard error of 0.087.

     This coefficient structure is however quite fragile. Adding the INFEX

variable produces a coefficient of -0.016 with a standard error of 0.013 while

the coefficient of the German deficit variable drops to -0.067 and less than

half of its standard error.

     In short, -it seems from table 3 that the German deficit variable does not

have a significant or stable relation to the dollar-GM ratio and that the

decision of whether or not to include it does not alter the point estimate of

the U.S. deficit variable. Future work will be needed to assess whether some

combination of German and other European deficits is significant and whether

its presence alters the coefficient of the U.S. budget deficit variable.

     It is, of course, unfortunate that the history of the floating rate

period gives us only 12 years of experience to analyze. Although more data

points could be created by using quarterly observations, I believe very little

Instead,   there would be more measurement error in the "expectations" variables

(DEFEX, INFEX, MPRIR) relative to the actual variation. Looking back before

1973 is inappropriate because the quasi-fixed rate system that existed then

would imply very different exchange rate dynamics and might be expected to

have very different monetary policy responses as countries tried to maintain

their currencies at the fixed parities. Expectations would also be formed

differently in a regime -in which governments were committed to maintaining

fixed exchange rates and in which the United States appeared willing to
                                        -39-


 accumulate overseas investments or run down its assets in order to maintain

 that fixed rate system.



 6.    Effects of the Interest Differential


      I have already commented in section 2 on the difficulty of assessing the

 structural relation between the exchange rate and the difference in expected

 real interest rates. The expected inflation, which is a very critical

component of the calculation, is difficult to measure and the real interest

rates themselves are endogenous variables.

      Despite these difficulties, it is worth devoting some attention to the

estimation of a structural equation linking the exchange rate to the real

interest differential because it is the operational link between budget

deficits and the exchange rate in several analytic models. The problems of

measurement and of endogeneity can be mitigated by using an instrumental

variable procedure with the DEFEX, MBGRO and INFEX variables as the

instruments. The results indicate that the use of an instrumental variable

procedure is important and that, when it is used, the evidence shows a

substantial effect of the real interest differential on the exchange rate.

      Equation (4.1) of Table 4 presents an ordinary least squares regression

of the the exchange rate index on the difference between the real long-term

interest rate in the United States and a corresponding real long-term interest

rate for Germany. The nominal U.S. rate is the yield on Treasury bonds with

five years to maturity. The real rate is calculated by subtracting the ARIMA

projection (INFEX) from this nominal rate. The nominal German rate in a rate
                                      —40-


on long-term German government bonds.14 The real rate -is   calculated by
subtracting an ARIMA estimate of future German inflation calculated by the

same process used for the U.S. ARIMA forecast of inflation. Annual values of

these variables are shown in Appendix Table A-2.

     The coefficient of the real interest rate differential is 0.042 with a

standard error of 0.025. The Durbin-Watson statistic is very low arid the

equation is therefore reestimated with an autocorrelation transformation. A

first-order transformation (equation (4.2)) is inadequate so the final result

(presented in equation (4.3)) has a second-order autocorrelaton correction. In

this form, the coefficient of the interest differential is 0.034 with a

standard error of 0.022.

     When the equation is estimated by an instrumental variable procedure

(equation (4.4)), the coefficient of the interest rate differential becomes much

larger (0.082) and more than twice its standard error. The Durbin-Watson

statistic is however very small (0.56). When Fair's method is used to obtain

an instrumental variable estimate with a first order autocorrelation

correction, the coefficient falls to 0.054 with a standard error of 0.023. In

short, the instrumental variable procedure results in a slightly larger

coefficient that the OLS procedure. It might also be noted that these coef-

ficient estimates are similar to the estimates of approximately 0.06 obtained by

Sachs (1985) and Hooper (1985).

     Before looking at any further equation estimates, it is helpful to

consider the implications of a coefficient of approximately 0.04 to 0.06 on

the interest rate differential. In 1978-79, the estimated real long—term U.S.

rate exceeded the corresponding German rate by 0.7 percent; by 1983 the
                                       —41--



 differential was 1.4 percent and by 1984 it was 2.8 percent. Even a

 coefficient of 0.06 implies a rise in the dollar-DM real exchange rate of

 0.042 between 1980 and 1983 and of 0.126 between 1980 and 1984. Since the

 actual exchange rate rose by 0.72 points over this period, the equation can

 account for at most one-fifth of the actual rise.

     The estimated coefficient is far less than theory suggests. As I noted

above, an increase of one percentage point in the difference between U.S. and

German 10—year real interest rates should increase the dollar-OM exchange rate

by about 12 percentage points, not the 4 to 6 percentage points estimated here

and in previous studies. This implies that the coefficient may be grossly

underestimated because of the measurement and simultaneity problems referred

to above.

     When the interest differential is split into two separate interest rates

and the equation estimated by ordinary least squares, only the coefficient of

the U.S. rate is statistically significant. This remains true when the

equation is reestimated with a second order autocorrelation correction

(equation (4.7)) and by an instrumental variable procedure (equation (4.8)).

     However, the combination of instrumental variable estimation and a first-

order autocorrelation correction (Fair's method) does result (equation (4.9)) in

coefficients for the U.S. and German interest variables that are both

absolutely about 0.04 but with the appropriate opposite signs. More

specifically, the coefficient of the real U.S. rate is 0.046 (with a standard

error of 0.024) while the coefficient of real German rate is -0.037 (with a

standard error of 0.024).

    As an alternative to the rolling ARIMA procedure, I have also used a
                                         -42--



simpler method that may correspond more closely to the way that market

participants used past inflation experience to form judgments about the

future. In place of the ARIMA estimate of inflation, I use a weighted average

of inflation, giving a weight of 0.5 to the most recent year's inflation, of

0.33 to the inflation of the previous year's inflation and of 0.17 to the

inflation of the year before that. On that basis, the expected inflation came

down gradually in Germany from 4.5 percent in 1980 to 4.3 percent in 1981 and

1982 ,   3.8   percent in 1983 and 2.8 percent in 1984 and real German long—term

rates in the 1980-84 period stayed between 4.0 and 5.0 percent except for a

6.1 percent rate in 1981.

     Table 5 presents the results based on this simpler specification of

inflation. The OLS estimates (equations (5.1) and (5.2)) are similar to the

estimates with the ARIMA inflation forecast: a coefficient of 0.055 with a

standard error of 0.035. The instrumental variable estimates (equations (5.3)

and (5.4)) show a more substantial coefficient and smaller standard error of

regression measures than the ARIMA forecast. With the ARI correction (i.e.,

using Fair's method), the coefficient of the interest differential is OO81

with a standard error of 0.031. This is approximately twice the typical

estimate based on the ARIMA inflation forecast. Dividing the interest

differential into a real U.S. rate and a real German rate (equation (5.5))

results in a coefficient of 0.072 (with a standard error of 0.025) for the

U.S. real rate but a very small and statistically insignificant coefficient of

0.003 (with a standard error of 0.032) for the German real rate, possibly

because there was very little variation in the measured real rate for Germany.

     In short, the different specifications of the real interest differentials
                                      —43-


and the different estimation methods indicate that each percentage point

difference in real interest rates raises the real exchange rate by between

0.04 and 0.08 points, an impact that accounts for only a small part of the

rise in the exchange rate that actually occurred in the 1980s and also only a

small part of the rise in the exchange rate that is predicted by the changes

in the expected budget deficits and -in monetary policy. It is difficult to

tell whether this is because the real interest differential is measured very

badly (causing a substantial underestimate of the true coefficient) or because

the budget deficit and monetary policy have direct effects on the exchange

rate that are not chanelled through the real interest differential.



7.   Concluding Comments


     The findings of the current research can be summarized briefly. The

estimated reduced form equations for the dollar-OM real exchange rate imply

that the rise in the expected future deficits in the budget of the U.S.

government had a powerful effect on the exchange rate between the dollar and

the German mark. Each one percentage point increase in the ratio of future

budget deficits to GNP increases the exchange rate by about 30 percentage

points.

     Changes -in the growth of the monetary base also affect the exchange rate,

but the estimated effect of the deficit does not depend on whether this is

taken into account in the estimation procedure.

     The analysis also indicates that the changes in tax rules and in the

inflation—tax interaction that altered the corporate demand for funds did not

have any discernible effect on the exchange rate. The presence or absence of
alternative tax variables did not alter the estimated effect of the budget

deficit.

     The estimated effect of the budget deficit is also relatively insensitive

to the other variables that were included in the regression equation.

     As I have emphasized elsewhere in a different context (Feldstein, 1982),

all models are "false" in the sense that they involve substantial

simplifications that can lead to incorrect inferences. It is impossible to

relax all of the specification constraints or include all of the plausible

variables in any single model. We learn about reality only by examining a

variety of alternative false models to see which implications of these models

are robust. In the present study, I was eager to focus on the question of

whether changes in the expected budget deficit could account for shifts in the

real exchange rate and, if so, whether this was a spurious relation that was

really reflecting a more fundamental relationship between the exchange rate

and tax rules, monetary policy, inflation, German budget deficits or

unobservable characteristics of the 1980s that strengthened the dollar.

Although any econometric study leaves room for doubt and uncertainty, I

believe that the current evidence shifts the burden of proof to those who

would claim that deficits do not matter or that tax, monetary or "confidence"

variables were the real reasons for the dollar's strength since 1980.

     There are of course a number of things that have been omitted from the

analysis that deserve attention in future studies. It would be good to model

the changing behavior of expected European budget deficits or, even

more generally, of the changing balance between the supply and demand for

funds in Europe. There are a number of difficulties in doing so, including
                                      —45-


the problem of establishing the "full employment" level at which to estimate

structural deficits in the face of Europe's rapidly rising unemployment and

the much larger and more ambiguous role of public investment in Europe.

     U.S. budget deficits have been defined without correct-ion for the

inflation erosion of the public debt on the implicit assumption that, at the

observed rates of inflation, individuals did not adjust their saving but

treated the inflation component of the interest on the public debt as income.

     Shifts in the price of oil were ignored in the present study although

they presumably affected the equilibrium exchange rate between the OM and the

dollar. It should be possible to extend the analysis to include the price of

oil and other raw materials.

     Finally, in future work I plan to extend the analysis to include 1985 and

the decline of the dollar. The sharp rise in the dollar—DM ratio that

climaxed in the early spring of 1985 may have had some unsustainable

speculative element (as Krugman's 1985 analysis implies) but the decline of

more than 20 percent in the dollar-DM ratio between mid-1984 and the present

time is, I believe, quite in line with what would have been expected on the

basis of the fall in expected future budget deficits.

     As participants in financial markets studied the action of Congress in

the spring and early summer of 1985, there was growing confidence that some

significant action would be taken to reduce future budget deficits. The

Congressional Budget Office summarized this in August when it contrasted the

current services deficits of 5.1 percent of GNP each year from 1986 to 1990

with the results of the Congressional Budget Resolution that brought the

projected deficits onto a path that declined to 3.0 percent of GNP in 1988 and
                                      —46—


2.1. percent in 1990. The Gramm—Rudman amendment gave the markets even greater

confidence that budget deficits would continue to decline in the future.

     The estimated ratio of the expected 5-year structural deficit to

potential GNP has declined from 3.3 percent in 1984 (the last observation in

the sample) to about 2.6 percent at the present time. An estimated

coefficient of 0.25 to 0.40 would imply a decline -in the dollar from this

source alone of between 18 points and 28 points. In fact, as of the middle of

February 1986, the dollar-DM ratio was down 23 points in comparison to its

1984 average value and 32 points from its high in early 1985.

     There is substantial room for additional research on the determinants of

the exchange rate. But the massive fiscal experiment of the past six years

should have convinced us that sustained shifts in the Federal government's

deficit have powerful effects on the value of the dollar.

 *Professor of Economics at Harvard University and President of the National

 Bureau of Economic Research. This paper was prepared for the NBER

 Conference on Macroeconomics, March 7 and 8, 1986, and will appear in NBER

 Macroeconomics Annual 1986.   I am grateful to Andrew Berg for help with this

 work and to Rudiger Dornbusch, Jeffrey Frankel, Stanley Fischer, Paul Krugman

 and Jeffrey Sachs for discussions about this subject.

 1.   On the impact of the dollar's rise on U.S. inflation, see Sachs (1985)

and Sinai (1985).

2.    This idea of an induced monetary policy response is discussed -in

Feldstejn (1985, 1986a). This provides an alternative to the Blanchard and

Summers (1985) explanation of the high level of world interest rates.

3.    See, e.g., Feldsteir, (1983).

4.    This is shown on page 52 of The Economic Report of the Pres-ident for 1984.

5.    The importance of expected future deficits was emphasized in Feldstein

(1983) and analyzed more formally in Frenkel and Razin (1984), Blanchard

(1985), and Branson (1985).

6.    The same criticism also applies to Plosser's (1982) claims that budget

deficit's do not influence the level of interest rates.

7.    Although measures of the money stock, inflation and real activity have

sometimes been included among the regressors, neither the budget deficit nor

the effect of changes -in tax rules has been included. See Frankel (1979) for

a relatively early study of this form and Hooper (1985), Meese and Rogoff

(1985) and Sachs (1985) for more recent examples; Obstfeldt (1985) provides a
                                     —48-


very useful survey of recent research on this subject. Hooper allows budget

deficits and tax rules to affect the exchange rate as part of a large

econometric model but the estimated effect is only through their impact on the

real interest differential. Moreover, since Hooper uses only the current

budget deficit (rather than expected future deficits) it is not surprising

that he estimates only a relatively small effect of the deficit on the

exchange rate.

     After this paper was written, I received a copy of Hutchison and Throop

(1985); the authors provide a very careful analysis that shows the

trade-weighted real value of the dollar can be explained by a an equation that

combines the real interest differential between the U.S. and the major seven

industrial countries and a corresponding one-year expected structural budget

deficit differential. Both the interest rate and the deficit differential are

significant in this formulation. No evidence about monetary policy or tax

policy is presented.

8.   A review of the papers that use a "real interest differential" to explain

exchange rate variations shows the potential seriousness of this problem. For

example, Frankel's seminal 1979 paper used the short-term German-U.S. interest

differential instead of the long-term differential and measured the difference

in expected long—term inflation rates (a separate variable in his formulation)

by the difference in long-term bond rates. Meese and Rogoff (1985), in an

otherwise very sophisticated paper, also generally use the 3-month interest

rates and when they do use long-term bonds they take the inflation during the

most recent twelve months as a proxy for long-term expected inflation.

Hooper's analysis is perhaps most satisfactory but uses only a three-year

moving average of inflation rates.

9.    On the induced change in Bundesbank policy, see Feldstein (1986a) and

Feldstein and Bacchette (1986).

10. This is done in Feldstein (1986b).

11. This MPRNR measure is very closely related to the MPNR and MPIR values

calculated in Feldstein and Summers (1978) and updated with some improvements in

Feldstein and Jun (1986).

12. See Feldstein (1986b) for an explanation of how the related nominal MPIR is

calculated. The MPRIR is obtained from the MPIR by subtracting the same average

projected inflation rate used to generate the MPNR and MPIR values.

13.   When equation 2.12 was estimated with the stock of foreign private assets

in the United States as a percentage of GNP instead of NIIP, its coefficient

had the wrong sign (positive) and was statistically significant. This again

no doubt reflects the fact that foreign private investment in the United States

grew in the 1980s because of the high dollar.

14. The German interest rate was provided by Data Resources, Inc. and is

identified by Data Resources as RMGBL@GY.
