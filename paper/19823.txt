We examine the evolution of real per capita GDP around 100 systemic banking crises. Part of the costs
of these crises owes to the protracted nature of recovery. On average, it takes about eight years to reach
the pre-crisis level of income; the median is about 6 ½ years. Five to six years after the onset of crisis,
only Germany and the US (out of 12 systemic cases) have reached their 2007-2008 peaks in real income.
Forty-five percent of the episodes recorded double dips. Postwar business cycles are not the relevant
comparator for the recent crises in advanced economies.

        Examining the evolution of real per capita GDP around 100 systemic banking crises

reveals that a significant part of the costs of these crises lies in the protracted and halting nature

of the recovery. On average it takes about eight years to reach the pre-crisis level of income; the

median is about 6 ½ years. Five to six years after the onset of the current crisis only Germany

and the US (out of 12 systemic crisis cases) have reached their 2007-2008 peaks in per capita

income. In a sample that covers 63 crises in advanced economies and 37 in larger emerging

markets, more than forty percent of the post-crisis episodes experienced double dips. The

analysis summarized here adds another dimension to an observation we have been emphasizing

on the basis of our earlier work—namely, that the subprime crisis is not an anomaly in the

context of the pre-WWII era. Postwar business cycles are not the right comparator for the severe

crises that have swept advanced economies in recent years.

        In the next section, we sketch the methodology used to study the characteristics of cycles

in GDP associated with systemic financial crises. We illustrate the basic concepts by applying

these to US data. In Section II, we examine the output consequences of 100 crises spanning

nearly two centuries. The emphasis is on the most severe crises. The unfolding post-2007 crisis

in many advanced economies and how these compare to the historical norms is the focus of

Section III. We conclude by arguing that speeding up recovery may require that advanced-economy

governments adopt some of the approaches that have been relegated to the emerging markets over

the last few decades—but that advanced countries themselves once practiced vigorously.



                                           I. Methodology

        Our aim is to approximate the loss in living standards (as measured by real per capita

GDP) associated with systemic financial crises. As a preamble, we need to describe what defines



                                                   2
a systemic crisis, why we stress normalizing by population (in lieu of the more common practice

in business cycle literature of focusing on the macroeconomic aggregates), how the depth and

duration of the cycle are measured, and how we characterize the often halting nature of the post-

crisis recovery to incorporate the widespread prevalence of “double dips.” We also present a

simple composite measure of crisis severity as another summary statistic.

    A. Systemic crises and per capita GDP

        The distinction of financial crises (or panics) into systemic and borderline varieties has a

long tradition in this literature. In the days prior to deposit insurance, Charles Calomiris and

Gary Gorton (1991), for example, distinguish between episodes where convertibility is

suspended and more minor types of bank distress. Gerard Caprio et al. (2005) characterize

modern systemic crises as those episodes where there are bank runs, a significant share of

nonperforming assets, bank liquidations, and large-scale policy intervention to support banks.1

        We anchor our analysis of the economic cycle around financial crises on real per capita

GDP for three reasons: (i) Recovery (to be defined) following financial crises is often a five-to-

ten-year process.2 As long as the population is growing, a recovery of the prior peak in real GDP

will still leave the average person worse off than prior to the crisis. (ii) We compare crises that

are decades and sometimes centuries apart. During the 1850s, US population growth peaked at

about 3.8 percent per annum, while it is less than one percent at present. (iii) There are

substantive cross-country variations that persist to this day.

    B. The Ds: Depth, duration, and double dips

        As our primary interest is dating long and rather infrequent cycles associated with deep

crises and going as far back as the data permit, the frequency of our study is annual. Peaks and

troughs are not dated by the quarter or the month. The typical recurring pattern across time and

space in these cycles is one in which economic activity reaches a peak either the year before the

onset of crisis or the year of the financial crisis.3 There are cases where the downturns start

earlier but these are less frequent. As in our earlier work, our measure of the depth of the

recession is standard and focuses on the peak-to-trough decline in real per capita GDP. We also

tally the number of years it takes to reach bottom in each episode. While the view that recessions

associated with financial crises are deeper has gained ground in recent years, academic opinion is

more divided on how to characterize recoveries from crises. Antonio Fatás and Ilian Mihov

(2013) provide an excellent discussion of these and other issues relating to the measurement of

economic cycles. Their analysis is informed by both the modern literature and the early work

pioneered at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).

          As in Reinhart and Rogoff (2009), our duration measure is the number of years it takes to

reach the prior peak in real per capita income. Fatás and Mihov (2013) and others note that this

definition does not capture a return to potential output or to some predetermined trend. Of

course, normalizing by population does allow for some time variation in underlying trend output.

In contrast to NBER dating of turning points, our approach treats any renewed downturn that

takes place before the economy reaches the prior peak as a double dip and part of the same cycle

(our dating is based on the global peak to date). For instance, the upturn in economic activity in

1937 in the US is dated by the NBER as the peak of a new cycle (followed by a trough in 1938).

Because in 1937 per capita GDP remained below its 1929 (global) peak, we record 1938 as a

double dip.

          Figure 1 illustrates these conventions for the US banking crisis of 1893, where the peak

was in 1892. To summarize two dimensions of crisis severity, we define an index that captures

some of the depth and duration aspects for each crisis episode (denoted by subscript i),

(1) Severity indexi = –Peak-to-trough % changei + Number of years from peak to recovery of prior peaki.

Alternative severity measures are discussed in the longer companion paper.

          Figure 2 places the detail of the 1893 banking crisis shown in Figure 1 in historical

context for the US from 1790 until 2013. The Depression of the 1930s predictably stands out for

its virulent contraction and duration (ten years). During the suspension of convertibility over the

1814-1817 banking crisis and its aftermath it also took ten years for the economy to climb back

to its previous peak in real per capita GDP. The depression ushered in by the 1837 panic,

characterized by Calomiris and Gorton (1991) as the longest banking crisis (extending until

1843), left per capita GDP trailing below its peak for almost a decade. As shown in Reinhart,

Rogoff, and Harris (2014), the average peak-to-trough decline for the US real per capita GDP

across nine major crises is about nine percent and it takes an average of 6.7 years to reclaim the

pre-crisis peak. During the post-crises years, five of the nine (56 percent) US episodes were

associated with a double dip. The subprime crisis clocks below these averages with about a 5

percent drop in per capita GDP (subject to the usual revisions) and a duration of six years (from

2007 to 2013) to reach the pre-crisis peak per capita income level. The most salient feature of

Figure 2, however, is an observation we have emphasized on the basis of our earlier work

(Reinhart and Rogoff, 2009) that the subprime crisis is not an anomaly in the context of the pre-

WWII era. A corollary is that postwar business cycles are not the right comparator for the recent

severe crises, as is also obvious from Figure 2. Of course, as Fatás and Mihov (2013) show, if

Figure 2 was recast as deviations from a measure of potential output (rather than deviations from


                                                         6
the previous peak) several postwar recessions and especially those of the early 1980s would look

less benign.

                                         II. 100 Systemic Financial Crises

           While the particulars for each of the 100 crises studied are presented in a longer

companion paper (Reinhart, Rogoff and Harris, 2014), Table 1 shows the basic statistics on

depth and duration for the most severe 35 crises in the sample ranked in descending order by the

severity index. Some dramatic output collapses and lost decades occur among primary

commodity producers faced simultaneously with a severe banking crisis and collapsing terms of

trade. Chile 1926 and Australia 1893 figure among that group.

           Also a substantial number of these crises are not “pure” banking crises in that these

unfold alongside a currency crash and often involve a sovereign default as well. This twin or

triplet crisis scenario is prevalent for both emerging markets and for a number of the advanced

economy crises (notably during the 1930s) as well as the Greek crisis of 2008.4,5 Of course the

distinction between emerging and advanced economies is quite blurred, especially prior to

WWII, as a number of modern-day advanced economies were still emerging markets at the time.

If credit ratings inform the distinction, the dividing line between emerging and advanced

economies has also been blurred in recent years. With these caveats in mind, Table 2 presents

descriptive statistics for the full sample as well as for the advanced and emerging subgroups,

consisting of 63 and 37 crises episodes, respectively. Not surprisingly, emerging market peak-to-

trough average output declines are about 5 percent larger than those in the advanced economies.

But they are not significantly more protracted. The halting, tentative nature of the post-crisis

recoveries (even in cases where there is a sharp—but not sustained— growth rebound) is

evidenced in the relatively high incidence of double dips (or secondary downturns before the

previous peak is reached). For all the crises, the share recording a double dip is 45 percent, while

for the most severe crises (shown in Table 1) about 2/3 of the post-crisis trajectories involved a

double dip.

                           III. The 2007-2009 Crisis in Historical Perspective

         It is premature to construct a definitive measure of the severity of the crises ushered in by

the subprime debacle as the crises are ongoing in most cases by our metric. Of the twelve

countries experiencing a systemic crisis starting in 2007-2008 (France, Germany, Greece,

Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Ukraine, UK, and US), only Germany and

the US have reached their pre-crisis peak in per capita GDP. In Greece, Italy, Netherlands,

Portugal and Spain, per capita GDP continued to contract through 2013 (so 2013 is a trough only

insofar as 2014 shows a rebound, however mild). The 24 percent decline in real per capita GDP

shown for Greece in Table 1, for instance, assumes that 2013 marks the bottom on the basis of

the forecast published by the International Monetary Fund in their latest World Economic

Outlook. Determining the years it will take to return to the pre-crisis output peak is even more

tentative. For countries other than Germany and the US we use the IMF estimates (which have

                                                          9
been often noted for their optimistic assessment) through 2018. Even by 2018, these projections

do not show periphery Europe recovering to pre-crisis levels of per capita GDP. The calculations

in Table 1 and in Figure 3, which compares the frequency distribution for the twelve 2007-2009

crises with the remaining 88 crises, arbitrarily close the gap between actual per capita GDP and

prior peak in 2019. As shown in Figure 3, the crises in Europe are on track to reach extremely

high severity index levels, importantly because of their protracted multi-year nature. For Greece,

Italy and the UK, the severity of the 2007-2009 crises outstrips that recorded in the 1930s (even

in the unlikely scenario that output would rise to match its prior peak in 2014).6

                                                  IV. Concluding Observations

            Even after one of the most severe multi-year crises on record in the advanced economies,

the received wisdom in policy circles clings to the notion that high-income countries are

completely different from their emerging-market counterparts. The current phase of the official


6
 From the vantage point of output losses, as measured here, the banking crisis of the early 1920s was worse for the
UK than the depression of 1930s.

                                                                       10
policy approach is predicated on the assumption that growth, financial stability and debt

sustainability can be achieved through a mix of austerity and forbearance (and some reform).

The claim is that advanced countries do not need to resort to the more eclectic policies of

emerging markets, including debt restructurings and conversions, higher inflation, capital

controls and other forms of financial repression. Now entering the sixth or seventh year

(depending on the country) of crisis, output remains well below its pre-crisis peak in ten of the

twelve crisis countries. The gap with potential output is even greater. Delays in accepting that

desperate times call for desperate measures keeps raising the odds that, as documented here, this

crisis may in the end surpass in severity the depression of the 1930s in a large number of

countries.
