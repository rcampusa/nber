        The Sensitivity of Consumption to Transitory Income:
              Estimates iroin Panel Data on Households


                              ABSTRACT



    We investigate the stochastic relation between income and consumption

(specifically, consumption of food) within a panel of about 2,000 households.

Our major findings are:

     1. Consumption responds much more strongly to permanent than to

        transitory movements of income.

     2. The response to transitory income is nonetheless clearly positive.

     3. A simple test, independent of our model of consumption, rejects

        a central implication of the pure life cycle—permanent income

        hypothesis.

     4. The observed covariation of income and consumption is compatible

       with pure life cycle—permanent income behavior on the part of

        80 percent of families and simple proportionality of consumption

        and income among the remaining 20 percent.

        As a general matter, our findings support the view that families

respond differently to different sources of income variations. In particular,

temporary income tax policies have smaller effects on consumption than do

other, more permanent changes in income of the same magnitude.

                            1. Introduction



     The stochastic relationship of consumption to income has long been

recognized as a critical issue to macro policy analysis. One traditional

view of consumers sees them as largely passive agents in the determination

of aggregate demand. Changes in real incomes are translated reasonably

quickly and fully into changes in consumption. In this view, income tax

changes are a powerful tool for countercyclical stabilization policy, as

Okun (1971) and Tobin and Dolde (1971) have argued. In contrast, the life

cycle—permanent income hypothesis of consumption embodies the opposite view

that consumers maximize utility over a long—term horizon. Rather than

responding passively to every change in income, consumers will alter their

consumption by smaller amounts if they perceive the income change as

temporary rather than permanent. Eisner (1969) has argued along this line.

With the refinement of rational expectations, the life cycle—permanent

income theory (as in Muth (1960), Lucas (1976) and Hall (1978)) casts

serious doubt on the usefulness of income tax policy as a stabilization

tool. Consumers cannot be relied on to react vigorously when an income tax

change goes into effect. Predicting the impact of an income tax change on

consumption requires knowledge of consumers' perceptions of its permanence.

     This paper tries to shed some light on the stochastic relation between

income and consumption (specifically, consumption of food) within a panel

of about 2000 households who reported both variables over a seven—year

span. Our major findings are:

     1. Consumption responds much more strongly to permanent than to

         transitory movements of income.
                                   2



    2. The response to transitory income is nonetheless vigorous; it is

        compatible with interest rates of 10 to 20 percent per year but

        not lower.

    3. A simple test, independent of our model of consumption, rejects

        the pure life cycle—permanent income hypothesis.

    4. The observed covariation of income and consumption is compatible

        with pure life cycle—permanent income behavior on the part of

        80 percent of families and simple proportionality of consumption

        and income among the remaining 20 percent.

    These conclusions are derived from evidence about the joint movements

of income and consumption. Needless to say, consumption and income

frequently rise or fall together in the same year for a particular family.

Our model ecplains the bulk of this correlation as the immediate response

of consumption to changes in permanent income. Most of the rest is

attributed to departures from life cycle—permanent income behavior by a

minority of the sample. We hypothesize that this minority (about a fifth

of all families) set consumption to a fraction of current income instead

of following the more complicated optimal rule.

              II. Stochastic Theory of Consumer Behavior



     An important paper by John Muth (1960) on the permanent income

hypothesis showed that the marginal propensities to consume out of current

and lagged income depend on the stochastic properties of income. An

income process with a large transitory component implies a small propensity

to consume out of current income. At the other extreme, when most changes

in income are permanent——that is, when income is almost a random walk——the

propensity to consume out of current income should differ only slightly

from the propensity to consume out of permanent income. This point was

overlooked in empirical work on consumption long after the publication of

Muth's article; Mayer's (1972b) survey does not mention any studies that

consider the issue, for example. In recent work using data on individual

consumers (Mayer, 1972a), estimates of large propensities to consume out

of current income are interpreted as evidence against the permanent income

hypothesis without any discussion of the stochastic process of income. The

evidence is actually ambiguous because the permanent income hypothesis

together with plausible income processes could well imply exactly the

degree of sensitivity found.

     Recent work by Hall (1978) deals with some of these problems by

deriving a theory of the stochastic process of consumption from the life

cycle—permanent income hypothesis. Empirical tests then find that one of

the important implications of the hypothesis is largely supported by

aggregate time—series data.' A recent paper by Flavin (1979) examines



'These tests are similar to the ones used in testing the efficient markets
hypothesis for financial assets. See Appendix 3 for a discussion of the
relation of that body of research to our work on consumption.
                                   4



aggregate data in a framework similar to the one used here, again with

generally favorable results. Howevr, aggregate evidence is not really

powerful enough to settle the important questions about the behavior of

consumers.

     These considerations have led to the research reported here based on

data for individual households. We bring a rather specific question to

this research: Are consumers more sensitive to current fluctuations in

income than they would be if they followed the dictates of the life cycle—

permanent income model? We approach the question in the following way:

First, we propose a stochastic model of household income. Then, we

hypothesize that households choose current consumption so as to maximize

expected intertemporal utility, as suggested by the life cycle—permanent

income view of consumption. In so doing, they arrive at an estimate of

permanent income, based on the information available about the various

stodhastic components of actual income. Note that permanent income is

not one of the components we hypothesize for actual income. Rather,

permanent income is an intermediate step in the process by which families

determine consumption. In this respect, we expand on earlier microeconomic

research on the permanent income hypothesis. The final step makes observed

consumption equal to a fraction of permanent income plus a transitory

component which can be interpreted as measurement error, inventory

accumulation, and the like.

     The empirical analysis in this paper focuses on the theoretical

implication that consumers should increase consumption by the annuity

value of the increase in wealth brought about by a transitory increase

in income. We test this implication by estimating the model using panel

data on the income and consumption levels of individuals over several
                                    5



years. However, the response of consumption to the transitory component

of income is estimated as a free parameter rather than constraining it to

equal the expression for the annuity value. We then can evaluate whether

consumption is excessively responsive to current income.

    The starting point for our work is the life cycle—permanent income

theory of consumption. According to the theory, consumers form estimates

of lifetime resources and then adopt plans for spreading those resources

over the remaining years of their lives. With explicit considerations of

uncertainty (Yaari, 1976; Bewley, 1976; and Hall, 1978), this principle

becomes: Consumers form estimates of the probability distributions of

lifetime resources and adopt sequential policies for spreading the

resources. We will consider the hypothesis of rational expectations

which asserts that consumers use all available information in estimating

the probability distributions of future resources. This hypothesis is

more of a sharpening and clarification of assumptions already implicit

in the life cycle—permanent income theory rather than a logically

independent assumption.

     Here we consider the case of a consumer whose real income is the sum

of three components:

     1. A deterministic component, y1, which rises with age until just

         before retirement, and then falls rapidly.

     2. A stochastic component, y, which fluctuates as lifetime prospects

         change. Because this lifetime component embodies information

         about essentially permanent family characteristics, a natural

         specification is a random walk.
                                         6


     3. A stochastic component, y, which fluctuates according to

            transitory influences, and obeys a first—order autoregressive

            process with parameter p.

A key feature of our model is the hypothesis that families observe the two

stochastic components separately.

     In year t, the consumer will have accumulated assets At. Then all

information available in year t relevant for this year's consumption

decision,           is contained in y, y, and     (as well as the information

about '         "' ' +r •.. denoted by y, which has always been known).
The consumption decision emerging from the consumer's optimal plan can be

described by


                      —   L   S -
            c   =
                              y,A)                                              (1)




Note that we do not yet assume that consumers make use of certainty

equivalence or even that their preferences over uncertain outcomes can be

described by expected utility.

     For our present purposes, it will be convenient to assume that the

consumption function, f, is linear in its arguments:



                =     +       + tY + Ytt —                                      (2)



where       and       are the deterministic paths of consumption and assets in

the absence of surprises in          and S and ,    ' and      are the marginal

propensities to consume out of y', y, and          at time t. This will hold

exactly for consumers with quadratic utility functions who maximize

expected utility, and will serve as a useful approximation in other cases.
                                           7



Defining c and At as the deviations from the deterministic paths of

consumption and assets, i.e.,



                                                                             (3)




we rewrite (2) as




          c=c*y+8y+YA

      Now, under the assumption about the two components of earnings

introduced earlier,



            L       L    + C                                                 (5)


and



            S        S
          yt =            +
                               nt

where     and        are random innovations in the two components that are

completely unpredictable. Further, the evolution of assets around their

deterministic path is governed by



                =
                    (1+r)(A         + yl + y1 —   ci)                        (7)




We will take the real return to savings, r, as a known, predetermined

constant.
                                              8



     With these assumptions and notations, we are prepared to derive an

explicit stochastic model for consumption. We could begin with the

maximization of the expected value of an intertemporal utility function,

but it is simpler to make use of a proposition derived by Hall (1978):

Consumers who make consumption plans by maximizing the expected value of

an intertemporally separable utility function satisfy the following basic

condition: The expected marginal utility of consumption next year depends

only on the actual level of consumption this yea,r and on the parameters of

the utility function. Again, rational expectations simply sharpens this

proposition: No information available to the consumer in year t has any

value in predicting next year's marginal utility, beyond the predictive

value of this year's consumption. This hypothesis provides constraints

on the coefficients of the consumption model. Again, as an approximation,

the hypothesis is interpreted as applying to consumption itself, which is

exactly true for a quadratic utility function and a reasonable approximation

for other cases.

    Appendix 1 uses this irrelevance of past data apart from immediate

lagged consumption to derive the parameters describing the response of

current consumption to the stock of savings and to current values of the

two components of income. The conclusions are



       =   1   for all years t. Changes in the lifetime component of income

           bring about immediate equal changes in consumption.

                          T —   t+1

              infinite horizons,             is the real interest rate.

              transitory income.



Some illustrative values at a real interest rate of 5 percent per year and

a serial correlation coefficient of transitory income of 0.3 are as follows:




                                                                  propensity

     Because we lack data on total savings for households, we need an

expression describing consumption which eliminates the need for information

on household savings. In Appendix 1 we derive the following:1



                 =        +                                                           (8)

'Note that this formulation assumes that the consumer's rate of time
discount equals the interest rate. Empirical evidence in Hall (1978)
does not reject this assumption.
                                    10




Note that     depends only on information available in year t, namely, the

change in the lifetime component of income, c, and the innovation in

transitory income,       Hence, (8) is simply a restatement of the basic

hypothesis that all information available in year t—1 is incorporated into

c1. Assets    do not appear in (8) because they are just the residual of

income after consumption and observations on At would not add information

about c not already in      and

     Rational consumption behavior is compatible with any degree of

sensitivity to the surprise in income (up to     =   1),   provided a sufficiently

high interest rate faces the consumer. No matter how much they discount the

future, consumers should not simply make consumption proportional to current

income; rather, the optimal strategy is to make the change in consumption

respond only to the surprise in income and not to predictable movements of

income. At very high interest rates, it is true that the information about

future changes in income contained in today's surprise in income has

negligible influence on wealth. However, it is still possible to take

steps today that will insulate consumption from any foreseeable future

changes in income. Exactly because the return to assets is high, a tiny

amount saved from today's temporary increase in income can finance a

complete offset of the subsequent decline in income later. In an economy

with very high interest rates, consumers make small but lucrative and

important asset transactions to achieve the optimal consumption path.

Later in the paper, we will consider the behavior of consumers who are

constrained against making any transactions in assets. They are prevented

from achieving the optimal consumption path, and their actual consumption

behaves in a way that is readily detectable in the data. There is a very
                                   1].




substantial difference between optimal consumption in the face of very high

interest rates and consumption constrained to equal current income.

    As a final note on the interpretation of the theory, we emphasize that

the lifetime component of income, yL, is not the same thing as permanent

income, although the propensity to consume out of    is the same as the

propensity to consume out of permanent Income. Permanent income includes

the annuity values of transitory income and assets, as well as the lifetime

component of income. Our research tries to make a clear distinction

between the statistical decomposition of income into lifetime and

transitory components, on the one hand, and the consumer's inference about

permanent income, on the other hand.

                III. Statistical Model and Estimation



     The data for our investigation are obtained from the University of

Michigan's Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) which contains histories

of earnings and spending for a large number of families over a span of

several years. The PSID reports total annual family income net of estimated

federal income taxes, which we then adjusted to take account of estimated

FICA (social security) tax payments and changes in the overall cost of

living (measured by the Consumer Price Index). The most comprehensive

and reliable consumption measure which can be obtained from the PSID is the

sum of the annual expenditures on food used at home and the amount spent

eating at restaurants. We deflated food expenditures with the food price

component of the CPI. Data from the PSID for food consumption are available

for the years 1969—1971 and 1973—1975 and for income for all years, 1969—

1975. We included all families who reported income and food consumption in

all years and whose responses to the food and income questions were deemed

accurate by the interviewer.1 We used data on six first differences of

income and five first differences of consumption for 2309 families. One

of the first differences of consumption spans two years; Appendix 4

describes how we accommodated this feature of the data.

     In the PSID survey, information about food consumption is elicited by

the following question: "How much to you spend on food in an average week?"

The question is asked sometime in the first half of the year; the average




'The survey interviewers were instructed to estimate income and food
consumption when an interviewee was unsure of the answers to the questions
concerning these items. We excluded all of the cases where this imputation
was done.
                                    13


interview takes place at the end of March. We date the response in the

previous year, as does the PSID. For a typical family interviewed in

March 1971, for example, data on last year's income and usual food

consumption are dated 1970 in our work. Because of the peculiar timing

of the question about average food consumption, we found it necessary to

extend the model described earlier in the paper in the following way. We

assume that the new information about income which the family uses to decide

on consumption dated in year t includes a fraction     of the new information

that will not be recorded by the survey until the following year. For the

simple reason that the consumption question is asked partway into the

following year, we might expect a value of near a quarter. However, a

family might have access to additional information about income for the full

year at the time that consumption is measured early in the year (Appendix 3

mentions the same issue as it arises in securities markets). For example,

in some jobs annual compensation is known with near certainty at the

beginning of the year. If this kind of advance information about income is

commonplace, our estimate of    should be correspondingly higher. We do not

consider the possibility that consumers have information about income in

years after t+1, beyond what can be predicted from the history of income

itself. Out low estimated value of 4 tends to confirm our assumption on

this point. Further details about the role of future information in the

model and the estimation of    appear in Appendix 2.

     In addition to the ambiguity about the timing of the question about

food consumption, there is a further ambiguity about the length of the

period over which consumption is measured. Instead of asking about

average consumption over an unstated period, it would be better for our

purposes if it were about last year specifically or even about last week.
                                   14



We investigated the possibility that families averaged food consumption

over a period even longer than the entire previous year, but did not find

any confirming evidence.

     The use of food consumption in place of total consumption obligates us

to consider the form of the demand function for food, which differs in two

respects from the demand function for total consumption. First, the price

of food relative to the overall cost of living influences food consumption.

Because all the families in the sample faced roughly the same change in

relative prices, and our study relies primarily on the variability of

individual family income, the relative price change presents few problems

for our work. We posit equal relative price effects among families with

similar characteristics, and remove these effects before estimating the

model. Details of this adjustment appear later in the paper.

     The second consideration is the likelihood that the proportion of

income spent on food declines as income rises——the usual view about the

Engel curve for food. In the current research, we approximate the Engel

curve by a straight line with a positive intercept. Though this does imply

a declining expenditure fraction on food, it can be defended only as an

approximation. The slope of the line will be called     it is the marginal

propensity to spend permanent income on food. The parameter    introduced

in the previous section will be defined as the ratio of the marginal

propensity to spend transitory income on food to the marginal propensity

to spend lifetime income on food. Thus the units and the expected

numerical values for   presented earlier will continue to apply.

     Another extension of the basic model is necessary because food

consumption is measured imperfectly. Any study of consumption at the

level of individual households needs to include a stochastic element of
                                        15



measurement error and transitory consumption. We assume that measured

consumption includes a transitory component, c, which obeys a second—

order moving average process with parameters X1 and A2:



             =

We hypothesize that transitory consumption is uncorrelated with both

components of income:



                                        = 0
           Corr(v,c) =    Corr(v,n)                                         (10)




     With these various extensions, our model for the first difference of

consumption becomes'



             =        +     +    — (1_Ai)v         —              —         (11)
                                               i       (Ai2)v_2

The terms involving V     represent   the first difference of a moving average

process.

     A detailed preliminary examination of the serial correlation properties

of Income revealed that a second—order moving average model was more

appropriate than the first—order autoregressive one considered in the theory

section. It does not seem useful to present the details of the consumption

model with a moving average process for income, as they are a good deal




1Here, we are neglecting the issue of advance information about income;
the appropriate modifications appear in Appendix 2.
                                      16



more complex and no more illuminating than for the autoregressive case.1

It remains true that consumption responds to the innovation in income.

With moving—average parameters p1 and p2. the stochastic model for the

first difference of income is



              =    +     —
                                 —i    —               —
                                                           21t—3              (12)




Again, the terms   involving   n are the first difference of a moving average

process. This model embodies the strong assumption that income is measured

without error. A model augmented with an income measurement error would

not be econometrically identified.



     Although in the full life cycle model, the propensity to consume out

of transitory income depends on age, in the results presented here, we

approximate the full model by treating       as constant across the sample.

We tried estimating the model separately for families with younger and

older heads, but failed to find significant differences. Constancy of

across families has the substantial statistical advantage of making the

simple moment matrix over families a sufficient statistic for all of the

parameters of the model.

     We estimate the parameters of the model by maximum likelihood, under

the assumption that c, n, and v obey normal distributions. Maximum

likelihood achieves the best fit of the variances and covariances

predicted by the model to those found in the data; the likelihood function



'An earlier set of empirical results based on the autoregressive model of
income gave almost exactly the same estimates of the structural parameters

is a scalar measure of the fit. A formal discussion of the estimation

procedure appears in Appendix 4. We confine ourselves here to a heuristic

treatment.

     The key idea of our approach is to write out the formulas for the

variances and covariances of the data implied by our theoretical model, and

then solve the resulting system of equations for the parameter estimates.

To keep the exposition simple, we will first work out the case where

transitory income and transitory consumption are not serially correlated

p1, p2, X, and A2 are all taken as zero) and no consumers have advance

information about income (q    = 0).   First, the variance of the first

difference of income is



           V(y t)   02 + 2c2                                              (13)




and the covariance of the first difference of income with its own lagged

value is



                                                                          (14)
           Cov(yt, Ayi) =


These two formulas give us estimates of the variance of the innovation in

transitory income, a2, and of the variance of the increment in lifetime

income, a. Next, the covariance of the first difference of consumption

with its own lagged value is




           Cov(c, ci) = o2                                                (15)
                                              18



This gives us the last of the three variances, that of the innovation in

transitory consumption, a2.

     Information about the structural parameters a. and   comes from the

covariances of consumption and income. The contemporaneous covariance is



         C =                         = a.a2   +                            (16)
                Cov(c,

and the covariance with future income is




         C1 =   Cov(c, y1) =             —ct3a                             (17)




Solving for a. and           gives



                C0 +C 1
                                                                           (18)

                 o
                     +c 1       n


     It is not surprising that the contemporaneous covariance, C, has a

central role in estimating the two propensities to consume, a. and .   It    is

perhaps a little surprising that the covariance of the current change in

consumption with the future change in income is equally important. The

basic finding of the paper is that this covariance is small, so it is not

plausible that consumers are excessively sensitive to transitory income.

Why would we expect excessive sensitivity to show up as a strong negative

correlation between the change in consumption and the future change in

income? Because those upward movements in consumption that are associated
                                      19



with the response to transitory income should be followed by a movement of

income back toward normal in the following year. The first differences of

income are negatively serially correlated (both in the theory and in the

data), so the correlation of the change in consumption and the subsequent

change in income should reflect this negative serial correlation.

     It might appear that the covariance of current consumption and lagged

income could provide similar information. That covariance is also free of

the effects of changes in the lifetime component of income. However, the

optimal use of information hypothesized for consumers in the model implies

that the covariance should be exactly zero; no information available in

year t—1 should help predict the change in consumption in year t. This is

essentially the proposition formulated and tested in Hall (1978). The test

will be carried out with the micro panel data of this study in a later

section of the paper.

     The considerations leading to the introduction of the parameter, ,

which indexes the amount of information currently available about future

income complicate estimation a little. The parameters ,   , and     are

estimated jointly from C, C1, and C2 =                    The relations

If   is zero, this reduces to the case just worked out, while if it is one,

C1 takes the place of C and C2 the place of C1. In general, to solve for

all three parameters, we start with

The equations for         and    are quadratic and it does not seem worth writing

them out explicitly. Provided C2 is negative (as it is in our data), the

equations have a solution with between zero and one and a positive value

       The data whose variances and covariances are the starting point

the estimation process are the deviations of the changes in food

consumption and income from deterministic paths.                 To form the deviations,

we need estimates of the deterministic changes in income and consumption
                                                                   characteristics in that
for each family in each year based on the family's

year. We do this by assuming that the deterministic changes are functions

of the family characteristics, then use ordinary least—squares regressions

as follows: In the case of income, we regress the change in actual income

on an intercept, the age of the household head, the age of the household

head squared, the change in the number-of adults in the household, the

change in the number of children in the household and a linear time trend.

 Since food is a commodity whose relative price changed substantially over

 the period of our sample, we need to take account of the downward slope of

 families' demand functions. Thus the change in food consumption is regressed

 on the percentage change in the relative price of food (as measured by CPI

 components) as well as on the variables used in the income regressions.

 Results for the income and food consumption regressions are given in

 Appendix 5. The residuals from these regressions are then taken to be the

 deviations from the deterministic paths of changes in food consumption and

 income.
                                   21



     The specification of the food and income regressions make little

difference to the results obtained for the stochastic model outlined

above. For example, if the effect of family characteristics on the

deterministic paths of income and food consumption are ignored——i.e., the

change in the deterministic components is just assumed to be a constant——

we find only very small differences in the estimates of the parameters of

the stochastic model.

     The residuals from the preliminary regressions showed mild

heteroskedasticity, especially in the first difference of consumption.

Rather than complicate the model by introducing separate variances for

each year, we simply transformed the covariance matrix of the residuals

by dividing its rows and columns by suitable constants so that the

variances of the first differences of consumption were the same in all

years (equal to the average of the original data over the same years).

We applied the same transformation to the income data. The spirit of this

preliminary treatment of the data is the same as conversion to a correlation

matrix, but it preserves the units of the structural parameters. Experiments

with the alternative of estimating variances gave essentially the same

estimates of the structural parameters.

                                 IV. Results



    Estimation by maximum likelihood yielded the results shown in Table 1.

In summary, they show:

     1. The marginal propensity to consume lifetime income on food, c, is

         about 0.11, well under the average propensity in the raw data of

         0.19.

    2. The propensity to consume out of transitory income relative to

         the propensity to consume out of lifetime income, $, is estimated

         as 0.29, somewhat above its theoretical value at reasonable

         discount rates. The hypothesis of equal response to both

         components,     =   1, is unambiguously rejected.
    3. The fraction of information about next year's income, , is 0.25,

         in line with prior expectations.

     Table 2 presents a reasonably complete accounting of the success of

the model in fitting the pattern of covariation found in the data. For

estimation of the key parameters c, , and c, the covariances of this year's

change in consumption with this year's change in income, next year's change,

and the subsequent year's change are the most important. All three

parameters control the fitted value of the contemporaneous covariance——

  and   make it larger, by making the change in consumption more sensitive

to surprises in income, while c makes it smaller, by making part of this

year's change in consumption depend on next year's surprise in income.

For the covariance with next year's income,       makes the fitted value more

negative, for the reason explained earlier——if this year's consumption is

sensitive to this year's transitory income, it will be negatively related

to the change in next year's income when the transitory movement will

probably be reversed. On the other hand, the fitted covariance is

positively related to c. If consumption is partly based on information

about next year's surprise in income, this year's change will be positively

correlated with next year's change in income. The fitted covariance of

almost exactly zero represents cancellation of the two effects, since both

     and     are quite positive. The estimation process separates the effects

of     and      through the use of the covariance of this year's change in

consumption with the change in income two, three, four, and five years

from now (of these, the closer ones are relatively more important). Under

the hypothesis implicit in our model that consumers have no information

about surprises in income more than one year in advance, the only

explanation of the negative covariation of current consumption and future

income operates through the sensitivity of consumption to transitory

income, controlled by 8. The estimation process chooses a substantially

positive value of 8 in order to try to match the covariance of —.021; the

overstatement in the fitted value of — .038 corresponds to understatements

of some of the more distant covariances not shown in Table 2.

           The only serious failure of the model revealed in Table 2 is its

 inability to explain the observed negative correlation of the current

 change in consumption and the lagged change in income. As we will show,

 the actual correlation is statistically significantly negative, yet the

 model holds that it should be exactly zero. The theoretical justification

 for the fitted correlation of zero is simple: Apart from its transitory

 component, consumption should respond only to new information, and lagged

 income cannot contain any new information. The next section of the paper

 examines the apparent failure of this principle.
                                    26



         V. The Relation Between Consumption and Lagged Income



      The model has the straightforward implication that the simple

regression of       on       should yield a coefficient on —i of zero.

Instead we find



             = —4.95 — 0.010

                  (6.16) (.002)

          6926 observations; standard error = $512; R2 = .0028



Though the coefficient is quite small, it is statistically unambiguously

negative. It would be uninteresting to conclude that the measurement error

in      was negatively correlated with         so we restrict our attention

to explanations of a negative relation between the true change in

consumption and the lagged change in income.

      In this section we investigate the possibility that consumers ar'e

actually more sensitive to transitory income than is predicted by theory,

but in a way not revealed in our examination of the joint behavior of

and        The results in the previous section did not draw on the observed

correlation between ct and        1——maximum likelihood is blind to

covariances whose theoretical values are zero for all values of the

parameters. An extended model proposed in Hall (1978) for a similar

purpose can be used to examine the lagged relation. Suppose that a

fraction i— of families follow the life cycle—permanent income theory

and the rest, a fraction p, simply let consumption track current total

income passively and so have an excessive sensitivity to transitory income.

A stochastic model expressing the passive behavior of consumers is

consumption.

2These are not strictly maximum likelihood estimates for the model as
described. Rather, they are the result of fitting the covariance matrix
of the model to the covariance matrix of the data and using the multivariate
normal distribution as the metric of fit. They are not precisely maximum
likelihood because the distribution implied by the model is a mixture of
two multivariate normals, which is not itself exactly multivariate normal.
There is no reason to expect any bias on this account.

The other parameter estimates are similar to their previous values. The

new specification is about halfway successful in matching the covariance

of this year's change in consumption with last year's change in income——

the predicted value is —.032 against the sample value of —.077. Not

surprisingly, the sensitivity of consumption to the innovation in

transitory income is found to be smaller in the extended model, as the

positive estimate of i has taken over part of the job of explaining the

positive contemporaneous covariation of consumption and income. Further,

because u and         are partly estimated from the same features of the data,

joint estimation very substantially raises the sampling variation of the

estimate of ,     relative    to the earlier results. The confidence interval

for       now includes the theoretically expected value of about 0.10.

                         VI. Concluding Remarks



    According to our extended model, about 80 percent of the households

in the sample obey the life cycle—permanent income hypothesis. They do

not adjust consumption in the same mechanical way to every change in income.

Instead, they think about the source of a change in income and react

vigorously only to those changes that signal a major shift in economic

well—being. But the data reject the strong hypothesis that all consumption

is governed by the life cycle—permanent income principle. This conclusion

is independent of the model developed in this paper; it rests solely on the

rather general principle that changes in consumption should not be

predictable on the basis of information available to the household. The

negative relation between the lagged change in income and the current

change in consumption is consistent with constrained consumption behavior

on the part of about 20 percent of the families in the sample. We are able

to distinguish this symptom of inability (or unwillingness) to borrow and

lend from the type of behavior characteristic of consumers who simply face

high effective interest rates. The data show signs of both influences.

Consumption is somewhat more sensitive to current income than it would be

in an economy where every consumer borrowed and lent freely at the

Treasury bill rate. Still, it is much less sensitive than in an economy

where no consumer ever borrowed or lent at all.

     The overwhelming bulk of the movements in income that give rise to

our inference from the data are unrelated to the behavior of the national

economy; most are probably highly personal. It is purely an inference,

though a reasonable one in our opinion, that households respond to income

fluctuations attributable to the business cycle or to countercyclical tax
                                   30



policy in the same way they respond to purely personal income fluctuations.

Our results cast doubt on the wisdom of tax policies to manipulate

aggregate demand by changing disposable income. If, as the results

indicate, most consumers react only to the new information about their

permanent incomes conveyed by the announcement of a tax change, then

policy—makers face the complicated task of inferring consumers'

interpretation of the announcement. Lucas (1976) has pointed out the

obstacles to policy evaluation in these circumstances.

     Our evidence and conclusions refer specifically to food consumption

and more generally to the consumption of nondurables. Nothing in our

work describes the response of consumer purchases of durable goods to

changes in income. Our findings that relatively few consumers behave as

if constraints on borrowing were important for food consumption do not

rule out important constraints for the acquisition of durables. The

sensitivity of durables purchases to transitory income is very definitely

a topic for further research, where some of the techniques developed in

this paper may be helpful.

                                               Appendix 1

                 Derivation of the Propensities to Consume Out of
                          Lifetime and Transitory Income



    The model is contained in four equations:



                 =
                     cty +           tt + iA                              (Al)




        At =          (i+r) (At_i + y1 + y1 — ct_i)                       (A2)




             L =         L
                                 +   c                                    (A3)



             S               S
                 =               +                                        (A4)




Together these imply the following equation for the first difference of

consumption as a function of contemporaneous innovations and lagged

variables:



                     =           + (l+r)y — (1 + (1+r)Yt)t 1]yL   1
                                                                      +


                         +               + (i+r) - (1 + (1+r)y) 1y1 +

                         + [(1+r)t — (1 + (1+r)Yt)Yi]Ati                  (A5)




Our conclusions are derived from the theoretical proposition that the

coefficients of the lagged variables are all zeros:

    To explain this, define                       as the annual income from a $1 investment

    paying equal amounts in years t, t+1, ••, T:




           =
                                         r                                                (A9)
                                             T -   t+1

                   (1+r)[1                            ]



                                                                            recursion,
     This is the annuity value of $1 and it obeys the



                            (l+r)t                                                       (Alo)

                                                     33


   Now         =      1   for the reason given above, and                             = 1.   The coefficients

      and 4 obey the same recursion with the same initial values, so
   they are equal. We conclude that                                    is the annuity value of $1 in

   year t.



3. Set coefficient of                              to zero:

                                                                                                      (All)


   Let         be the present value of a stream paying 1 in t, p in t+l,

   p2 in t+2, •.., pT_t in T. Then                                     =    1   and




           t—l =                      +   1                                                           (A12)




   Suppose it were true that                                               that   is, the propensity to

    consume out of transitory income is the annuity value of the

    increment to wealth implied by an innovation in transitory income.

        Because           =   = 1,   the recursion establishes   =   for
         all t.




    With all lagged variables excluded, the change in consumption depends

solely on new information,

           Characterization of Information About Future Income



      We assume that the annual income innovations                                   and     are the sums of

N micron innovations c              and ii         ,       T   = 1,    •••,   N.    Consumption decisions
                            t,t              t,t
recorded in year t are based on knowledge of the first M innovations for

the following year. Our parameter c                            is   M/N.

The vector of c and y observations for a family is thus multivariate normal

with these covariances, and maximum likelihood estimation is appropriate.

     In our model, we assume that families are homogeneous with respect to

information about income——they all know a fraction       of next year's income

in making this year's consumption decisions. The covariances of this model

are exactly the same as those for a model of hetergeneous families, where a

fraction    are fully aware of next year's income and the rest know nothing

about it. The models are not completely the same, however. In the

heterogeneous case, the distribution of          and    is not multivariate

normal, but is a mixture of multivariate normals. Our estimates cannot be

said to be maximum likelihood for the heterogeneous model.

                              Appendix 3

           Relation to Research on Efficient Financial Markets



    Our work is closely related to the large body of research on the

behavior of financial markets under rational expectations. Consumption

is the analogue of a stock price, for example, and income is the analogue

of the earnings per share of the corporation issuing the stock. Our test

of the predictive power of lagged income is the analogue of similar tests

for market efficiency in the stock market, in the sense of the

unpredictability of changes in stock prices from publicly available

information (Fama (1970) and Mishkin (1978)). In contrast to our findings

for consumption, the hypothesis of unpredictability is generally supported

by the data for security markets.

     The issue of advance information which might be available to market

participants but not to the econometrician has also been considered in

research on financial markets. The problem of the timing of the collection

of data which obligates us to consider the issue here is not generally

present in data on securities markets, but it may still be true that market

participants have information in period t about what the econometrician

labels an innovation in period t+1. One supporting piece of evidence is

the predictive power of stock prices for future movements of the money

stock, found by Rozeff (1974) and Rogalski and Vinso (1977).

     The technique developed in our paper could be transplanted directly

to securities markets to answer the questions: Do stock prices overreact

to current movements of earnings? Do market participants have advance

information about earnings?

Under an interpretation where z itself is multivariate normal (homogeneous

versions of advance information and rule—of—thumb consumption), the log—

likelihood of the sample is




        L(0) =       —
                         log det(0) —                       z.l'(0)z.          (A35)




plus an inessential constant. We estimate 0 by full numerical maximization

of the likelihood. Its estimated covariance matrix is computed as the

inverse of the information matrix, 2L/00'. All computations were

carried out by a program written by Bronwyn Hall, which uses analytical

derivatives and the method of scoring.
