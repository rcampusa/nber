        FACTORS AFFECTING DIVORCE: A STUDY OF THE TERNAN SAMPLE

                           Robert T. Michael*



       Factors that contribute to the happy marriage . . . have
   been treated by innumerable writers. . . . Around few topics,
   indeed, has there ever accumulated such a hopelessly jumbled
   confusion of information and misinformation.
        Where light is so much needed but is so greatly lacking,
    even the most trifling contribution becomes a worthwhile goal.

        1. Introduction. There was considerable effort by social

scientists in the 1930's and 1940's to construct prediction equations

for marital success.' These were in part inspired by the previous success

of psychologists in predicting achievement in school by means of an IQ

test.2 These studies attempted to construct both an index of marital

success and an estimating equation for predicting success by using personal

and family background, economic and attitudinal information from the

couple. Constructing the marital success index proved a manageable task,

but the subsequent lack of attention paid these predicting equations is

testimony to their limited usefulness.3

        For the twenty years following these efforts, social scientists

avoided such research with more determination than economists eschewing

predictions   about the economy's future. But within the past few years
                                                                             .
renewed interest in understanding marital behavior has resulted in a

number of studies which focus on an equation estimating the probability

of divorce or remarriage.4

        This paper reports on one such effort. It offers a brief

rationale for and an estimation of probability functions for divorce

rates at specific lengths of marriage duration for a very unrepresentative

sample of American women——a group of geniuses. The data are from the

"Terman sample" of some 671 women selected in 1921 (together with a

comparable group of men) by psychologist Lewis N. Terman. The sample

was chosen from children enrolled in California schools in urban areas.

It included children, preselected by their teachers, whose measured IQ

was 135 or above. The sample thus represented students in the highest

one percent of the school population In general intelligence. In

addition to Information obtained in the early 1920's from the children,

their parents and their teachers, the subjects were resurveyed in 1927—28

and again in 1936, 1940, 1950—52, 1955 and l96O. The available data

file includes information on each individual's marital history and

marital status in 1940, 1950 and 1960. That information is the basis of

the study reported here.

        This sample differs in many respects from those more often

analyzed by economists or sociologists. There are both advantages and

disadvantages in using these data. The advantages include: (a) The

opportunity to study the marital behavior of people with unique social

characteristics. Samples obtained from the general population by defini-

tion have relatively little information on the behavior of individuals
                                      3



in the tails of distributions of characteristics——the very poor, the

very wealthy, etc. With the Terman data we can determine if relation-

ships observed in more general samples are also in evidence among

geniuses. (b) The longitudinal (not retrospective) nature of the data

allows us to study the impact of certain variables on marital patterns

through time. (c) The data contain some information on the character-

istics of both the subject and the spouse, so the sample is relatively

well—suited for a study of marital behavior.

          The disadvantages in analyzing the Terman sample include the

following: (a) The sample is, by conventional standards, quite small;

after any appreciable amount of cross classification, the data files

have only a hundred or so observations.    (b) The sample is also quite

homogeneous with respect to many of the characteristics of Interest, thus

one cannot parcel out separate effects of variables as easily as In more

diffused, broadly based samples.    (c) Despite the abundance of some kinds

of information, especially psychological and social variables, there is

relatively little good information on economic variables. (d) Since

the sample was selected from California schools, comparisons between

the sample and a population at large are made more difficult by the

differences in behavior between Californians and residents of other

states.

          In another report I have compared the marital behavior of these

Terman subjects to the relevant California population, controlling for

the very high level of schooling and the somewhat constricted distribu-

tion of age at first marriage among the Terman subjects (Michael 1976).

The Terman subjects generally exhibited the same qualitative relationships
                                    4




between marital patterns and such variables as age at marriage and

schooling as the California population. Furthermore, there were

remarkably few statistically significant differences between the Terman

subjects and the Californians in terms of the proportions which had

remained single by 1960, the proportions currently widowed or the propor-

tions currently divorced in 1960; so the results reported below may be

more generally applicable than one might think. However, one should

keep in mind the very special nature of this sample when comparing results

with other studies.

        2. Analytical Context. An extensive statement of theoretical

work on divorce appears in Becker, Landes, Michael (1976) and will be

summarized quite briefly. The essence of that theory is that individuals

enter into marriage only when doing so is expected to increase their

well—being, broadly defined to include pecuniary and nonmarket real

income. Activities outside as well as in the labor market are viewed

as productive, and potential gains from marriage in the form of larger

amounts of output accrue from (a) efficiency in production which results

from mates' pooling resources (i.e., from economies of scale, speciali-

zation in the division of labor, and technical complementarity in the

use of their own time) and from (b) joint consumption of public—goods

aspects of household activities (e.g., both spouses enjoy the same

paintings and share the same electric light). These gains can be shown

to be greater the greater the level of resources of either spouse, the

greater their ability to capitalize on the division of labor——e.g., by

having different skills which can be substituted for each other——and

the greater the similarity and complementarity between spouses in traits
                                     5




used in joint productive activities. Individuals are assumed to search

for a mate and to be constrained in their selection of a mate by their

own limited set of abilities, traits or endowments through competition

from others. Since search is costly, many marriages which take place

may be less than ideal, although "optimal" in light of these costs.

        The analysis of divorce assumes, likewise, that individuals

divorce when doing so is expected to increase their real income broadly

defined. Since the individual is assumed to marry when that action

maximizes the expected net present value of real income, the analysis

of divorce focuses on why that evaluation may change sufficiently to

induce or justify divorce. Let Mt be the expected net present value of

the person's real income at age t when married to a particular spouse.

It is the discounted expected stream of benefits from the marriage net

of the expected next best alternative marital arrangement. Aside from

the costs of getting married, a person chooses to marry when Mt >    0,   so

the question of divorce is, if Mt > 0 why might Mt÷k < 0?     If one's

expectation proved to be incorrect, either with respect to the benefits

in this marriage (e.g., he is not what she thought he would be or she

is not what she thought she was) or the alternatives available (e.g., via

another spouse or an unforseen career), then M might change signs as

new information is acquired. Alternatively, even if the expectations

are borne out perfectly, it is possible that when evaluated at age 22,

say, M22 > 0 but that after living out a few years of the marriage, the

remaining streams yield, for example, M30 <   0.   Here the divorce might

have been fully anticipated, even planned for, at the outset.
                                     6



        Divorce doesn t automatically occur, of course, when M < 0.    One
                                                                              .
reason is the cost of divorce. If C represents the many kinds of costs

incurred in divorcing, then the individual chooses divorce when Mt + C < 0.

These costs include not only the direct dollar and time costs involved

in effecting the divorce, but the pecuniary and nonpecuniary capital

losses in property, human capital, plans and nemories.

        The discussion here has not introduced the complication of which

spouse it is that calculates these M's and C's, or what happens if M + C

is negative for one spouse and positive for the other. This situation

is ripe for a game—theoretic analysis with interdependent bilateral

monopolists, but a case can be made that if the costs of negotiating,

redistributing and policing are sufficiently small, then in principle

at least the two parties can reach agreement. The partner for which

N + C > 0 may have sufficient gains to be able to transfer enough real

income to the other spouse so that after the transfer M + C > 0 for both.

If so, they can agree to remain married; if not, there is some transfer

which might leave M + C < 0 for both and they could agree to end the

marriage. The disagreements which frequently accompany a couple's

discussion of whether or not to divorce is sufficient evidence that these

costs of negotiating, transferring and policing are generally not small!

[Perhaps Callahans self—interested guidance isn't too strong: "The

subject of divorce is extremely complicated and no one without extensive

legal training should attempt to solve his marital problems without the

advice of an attorney" (Callahan, 1970)!] Whether the couple can agree

or not, it is likely that the spouse who Initially found M + C > 0 will

be displeased at incurring a capital loss by either transferring some
                                     7




income in order to maintain the marriage or by losing the gain entirely

and incurring the cost of dissolution. (Becker, Landes, Michael (1976)

discuss the issues in this paragraph in some detail.)

        The results reported below estimate the impact of a small set

of variables on the probability of dissolution of the first marriage.

These variables are the level of schooling of the wife and the husband,

the wife's age at first marriage, and two dummy variables, one reflecting

whether either the husband or wife was Catholic (defined as 1.0 if so)

and one reflecting whether the wife and husband had the same religious

affiliation (defined as 1.0 if so). The explanatory variables represent

characteristics of the individual or the marriage partnership at the time

of marriage. Thus the five variables on which attention is focused are

not themselves affected by the success of the marriage; they are more or

less parametric to the couple by the time the marriage takes place.7

Their impact on the stability by 1940, by 1950, and by 1960, of first

marriages formed 1—4 years and 5—8 years before 1940 have been studied.

        These five variables reflect several kinds of factors which may

affect the value of M or C. One of these variables, AGE MARRIED, can

be interpreted as reflecting the amount of information available to the

marriage partners at the time of the marriage. The older one is at

marriage, the better informed one should be about the prospective spouse

and available alternatives. Likewise, the older one is the better one

knows his or her own characteristics, and thus the better one should be

at predicting the success of a marital relationship with any particular

prospective spouse.

        Thus, it is expected that age at marriage will be negatively

related to marital dissolution. That relationship is one of the most
                                      8



pervasive and robust in the literature on marital stability. So the         .
prediction of a negative relationship is not strictly an hypothesis

derived in the abstract from our theory. It indicates, instead, that

the model described here can quite easily explain this ubiquitous

finding, and that this sample of geniuses is expected to behave like

other samples.

        The variable CATHOLIC is a dummy variable defined as one if

either spouse is Catholic and zero if not. A prediction that this

variable is negatively related to marital dissolution is predicated on

the strong religious teachings against divorce by the Catholic church.

Expressed in the language of our analytical framework, the costs of

divo'-ce--—defined broadly, as they should be, to incorporate all real

income foregone——are higher for a Catholic and hence, this higher cost

is expected to deter marital dissolution.

        The SANE RELIGION dummy variable is defined as one if the

spouses were of the same religious affiliation and zero if not.

Sociological literature has, for decades, emphasized the destabilizing

effects on marriage of differences in the religions of spouses. Landis

(1949) and Bell (1938), for example, found the percentage of marriages

which were dissolved to be between 4 and 6 percent for marriages composed

of spouses who were both Catholic or both Jewish or both Protestant,

compared to about 14 or 15 percent in marriages between mixed religious

affiliations.8 In the language of our analytical framework, similarity

of religious beliefs or affiliation is one of the nonmarket traits which

involves complementarity between spouses, and therefore, the more similar

the pair the greater the economic gains from joint household production,
                                    9




thus the smaller the probability of dissolution. Hence, this dummy

variable is expected to be negatively related to marital instability.

         The effects of the other two variables are more difficult

to predict.   Schooling levels reflect, as social scientists frequently

emphasize, several different attributes and circumstances which include

market earnings potential, knowledge of or proficiency in many market

and home activities, several family and personal background characteris-

tics, and perhaps differences in attitude, motivation, time perspective,

and so forth. In the particular sample under study, the schooling

levels of both spouses are relatively high, and less closely

associated with intelligence and perhaps other personal characteristics

such as health level than is true in more broadly defined samples.9

These lower—than—usual correlations of schooling with background variables

may partly justify the simplifying assumption that schooling level

reflects labor market opportunities or wages. Becker's (1974) theory

of marriage suggests that the higher the level of family real income,

the greater the gains from marriage, thus the lower the likelihood of

divorce. So the higher the schooling level of the family's primary

earner, the higher the family income and hence the more stable the

marriage. However, the gains from being married are expected to be

greater the greater the dissimilarity between spouses in terms of traits

used independently in activities, such as working in the labor market.

So while a higher level of schooling of the primary earner enhances

marital stability, a higher level of schooling of a family's secondary

earner has, on the one hand, the same stabilizing "Income effect" but

it has, on the other hand, a destablizing influence by reducing the
                                        10



gains from specialization in the division of labor within the family.

Several studies have labeled this latter effect, applied to women, as

an "independence effect."

        Despite the considerable labor market activity of the Terman—

sample women, it appears appropriate to assume that the husbands are the

primary wage earners among the families in the Terman sample.   If

we assume that the only relevant (or at least predominant) effect of

schooling on marital stability is through its effect on potential market

earnings, we would expect an Increase in the husband's schooling level

to be associated with greater marital stability. Increases in the wife's

schooling level would be expected to be less positively, or perhaps

negatively, related to marital stability.

        Perhaps it would be well to summarize the anticipated effects

of these five variables on the stability of the marriage. In the frame-

work used it is assumed that in considering divorce, individuals act as

if they evaluate the difference between the benefits from the marriage

over the rest of their lifetime and the benefits from their next best

alternative marital life plan and then choose to divorce if that differ—

ence plus the costs of divorce is negative. The variables AGE MARRIED,

SAME RELIGION, and SCHOOL HUSBAND are expected to be positively related

to the gross gains from the marriage, hence negatively related to the

likelihood of divorce. The variable SCHOOL WIFE will be negatively

related to the net benefit from marriage if the "independence" or

substitution effect dominates, and so it may be positively related to

the likelihood of divorce. Finally, the variable CATHOLIC is expected

to be positively related to the costs of divorce, and hence negatively

related to the likelihood of divorce.

        3. Empirical Implementation. The discussion above suggests

that divorce will occur if the value of M + C is negative, so the

probability of divorce for the ,jth couple, Pr., can be expressed as




        Pr = Pr(M       + C < 0)                 j1,... ,n observations.   (1)




The discussion also suggested five variables which are functionally

related to the value of M + C and if we write



        M. + C. =                         + s.
                      (Y1.,...,Y5.)                                        (2)




then




            Pr =      Pr (+ (.) < —e.).                                    (3)




If           >   0, then       <   0:   a variable which raises the net gain

from remaining married lowers the probability of divorce. Writing

Equation (3) as a linear function of



            Pr. =     a +    biYi. + e.,                                   (4)




has the convenient property that b. can be interpreted as the partial

effect of variable Y1 on the probability of divorce. This linear proba-

bility model also has the well—known inconvenient property that the

predicted linear relationship is not bounded at probabilities between

zero and one. An often—used transformation which converts the continuous
                                            12




variable bounded by 0 and 1.0 into a continuous, unbounded variable is
                                                                                S
    Pr.
ln(1) and so we might reformulate Equation (4) as



          lfl(l) =          +                                             (5)
                                iij + Ui,


where the estimated coefficients           can be used to calculate the

intuitively Interpretable b1)°

          If data on individual couples are used, one has only a single,

ex—post measure of that couple's probability of divorce——in particular,

a probability 1.0 if the couple has divorced, and a probability 0 if

they have not. It is well known that estimating Equation (4) directly

with such a binary variable involves several statistical problems (see

Nerlove and Press, 1973) and a direct estimate of Equation (5) by

ordinary regression techniques is impossible since the dependent
                                                                                5
variable's values would be plus and minus infinity. But Equation (5)

is mathematically equivalent to



          Pr. =            1
                                       ,                                  (6)
                        —a—I31Y1.—u.
                  l+e

a logistic function which can be estimated by the generally available

maximum likelihood procedure called logit.

          Notice that the duration of time to which the probability of

divorce Pr refers has not been mentioned. The effects of the passage

of time on a relationship between Pr and          can be either confronted

analytically or conveniently defined away. The latter is accomplished
                                           13




by simply defining Pr as the probability of divorce during the total time

interval under study. One       might   then find, for example, that a one—year

increase in age at marriage lowers by five percentage points the proba-

bility of divorce within the first four years of marriage. Here, one

assumes that Equation (4) or Equation (5) applies directly to the proba-

bility defined over the whole time interval.

        Alternatively, one might choose some basic time unit, such as

a month or a year, and assert that the linear Equations (4) or (5)

pertain to the probability defined for that time interval. Then, with

specified relationships between (a) the per time unit probability from

one time period to another and (b) the stochastic process through which

that probability affects behavior, one models the time—dependent

outcome. If we assume that one year is an appropriate time period, that

the probability of divorce is constant from one year to the next, and

that behavior can be represented as the result of a Bernoulli process,

then if p is the yearly probability of divorce, the probability of

divorce after n years, P, is:



        P   =   1 —   (1_p)fl                                             (7)




If we replace p in Equation (7) by its equivalent in Equation (4) or (6)



                         n—i
                n(l-p)         b1                    given Eq. (4)

            =                                                             (8)

                (1_)n_l 8i(Pr) (1-Pr)                given Eq. (6)
                                               14




and in comparisons of the coefficients on P defined over n years and
                                                                                S
over   m years,



             m
             I    =   m         rn—n
                                                                         (9)




So long as the relationship between Y1 and p, as well as the level of p,

is Constant over time, the coefficient of Y1 on P should rise nearly

proportionately with ()        for   small values of p.

         Equation (7) implies that if p is linearly related to Y1, as in

Equation (4), or linearly related to the log of the odds, as in Equa-

tion (5), P and           are not linearly related. But if we rewrite

Equation (7) as



         Z1—/l—Pp,                                                       (10)



then Z is linearly related to           if p is. But for the binary variable

P defined as an ex—post probability 1.0 or 0,


                  =   1.0                  =    1
         if P                    then Z             ,                    (11)
                  =0                       =0

so if p is related to Y. as in Equation (4) or Equation (6), one can

replace p by "n in the estimating equation and subsequently calculate

b1, the coefficient of Y. on the unit probability p by Equation (8).
                                     15



        Of course, more complex solutions to the estimation of the effect

of Y. on p pertain if p is assumed to be altered by the outcome of the

stochastic process In preceding time intervals, or if the influence of

   is assumed to vary over time. These solutions are not investigated

here.

        4. Empirical Results. Two subsaniples of women from the Terman

sample have been studied. The subsamples were defined by the duration

of time the women were exposed to the risk of divorce. One group con-

tained 114 women first married between one and four years prior to 1940;

the other group contained 97 women first married between five and eight

years prior to 1940. Because of the nature of the available inforina—

tion, these two groups exclude women first married by or before age 20.11

        Table 1 indicates means and standard deviations of a set of

variables for these two groups of women. The variable DIVORCED 1940 is

defined as 1.0 if the woman's first marriage had ended by divorce or

separation by the time of the 1940 survey, and is defined as 0 otherwise.

The table indicates that about 4 percent of these 114 women were divorced

or separated by 1940. The variable DIVORCED 1950 indicates that among

the same set of 114 women, by the 1950 survey approximately 12 percent

had been divorced (that 12 percent includes the 4 percent already divorced

by 1940). Similarly, DIVORCED 1960 indicates that about 16 percent had

been divorced by 1960. These three variables have each been used as

dependent variables in estimated linear and logistic relationships with

the five variables discussed above, SCHOOL WIFE, SCHOOL HUSBAND, AGE

MARRIED, SAME RELIGION, and CATHOLIC. Table 2, Panel A, contains the

estimated coefficients for the group of 114 women first married one to

four years prior to 1940, and Panel B contains the estimates for the

group of 97 women first married five to eight years prior to 1940.

        The qualitative effects of these five variables are, generally,

as expected: the probability of divorce appears to be lower for couples

with both spouses sharing the same religious affiliation, with at least

one of the spouses Catholic, with the wife's age at first marriage

relatively high, with the husband's schooling level relatively high,

and with the wife's schooling level relatively low.

        The effect is quite strong for the SANE RELIGION variable. This

coefficient can be interpreted as indicating that where both spouses

have the same religion, other things the same, the couple's probability

of divorce within the first four years of marriage is 20 percentage

points lower than if the spouses had different religious affiliations.

(The logit estimates suggest a reduction of 13 percentage points.) That

effect is quantitatively quite large, persists over time, and is observed

in both the samples reported In Panel A and in Panel B. The CATHOLIC

variable also has a quite large coefficient throughout these estimates,

but its statistical significance is lower, especially in the logit

estimates where the coefficients are also erratic.

        The wife's age at marriage seems to have a small but persistent

negative effect on the probability of divorce. That variable shows

considerable statistical significance in the 1950 and 1960 regressions,

but only in Panel A. Using the coefficient from the first column of

Panel A for illustration, an increase in the age at marriage from one

standard deviation below the sample mean to one standard deviation above

the sample mean (I.e., from age 22.2 to age 26.8) would be associated
                                       20




with   a 5 percentage—point reduction in the probability of divorce by
                                                                            .
1940 and a 17 percentage—point reduction in the probability of divorce

by 1960. The reader should recall that the distribution of AGE MARRIED

is truncated at age 21. Independent evidence suggests that the relation-

ship between age at marriage and marital dissolution is nonlinear and

stronger at lower ages, so these coefficients reflect the effect of age

at marriage in a range in which that effect is relatively smaiiJ2

          Husband's schooling tends to have a negative effect on divorce

with the magnitude of that effect, at —0.03, suggesting that four years

more schooling is, on the average, associated with a 12 percentage—point

reduction in the probability of divorce. The wife's schooling level is

persistently positively associated with the probability of divorce.

          Two other questions about the equations reported in Table 2

deserve attention: How well do these equations distinguish the maritally

unstable from the maritally stable? What do these estimates of proba-

bility of divorce at three distinct points in time suggest about the
                                                                  2
impact of these explanatory variables over time? The adjusted—R in

the OLS regressions range between 8 and 12 percent, so one answer to

the first question is that about 10 percent of the observed variation

in the dependent variable is correlated with these five variables. That

level of explained variance is surely not overwhelming, but neither is

it exceptionally low when compared to other regression results with micro

data pertaining to demographic phenomena. The usual tests of significance

of the equation are not appropriate, since the error term cannot be

presumed to be distributed normally.


                                                                            S

           To obtain an intuitive sense of the equation's ability to predict

marital dissolution, the probability of divorce has been calculated

using the estimating equations in Table 2 for each observation. The

observations were grouped into three subgroups from each of the two

samples of married women: subgroup A included only those women who had

been divorced by 1940; subgroup B included those women who were maritally

stable in 1940 but who were divorced by 1960; and subgroup C included

those women whose first marriage had not ended in divorce or separation

by 1960.

           Table 3 indicates the average probability of divorce calculated

from the linear and logistic functions for the women in each of these

three groups. The 1940 equation from Panel A, for example, discriminated

between the maritally unstable by 1940 and the maritally stable by

yielding a predicted probability of dissolution of 15.7 percent for the

former group and 3.7 percent for the latter. More interesting is the

fact that the same equation (which was itself estimated for a dummy

variable defined as 1.0 for the observations in group A and 0 for the

observations in groups B and C) discriminated with some success between

those who were stable in 1940 but did not remain stable by 1960 (group B)

and those who were stable in 1940 and did remain stable by 1960 (group C).

It yielded estimated probabilities of divorce appreciably higher for

group B in the OLS estimates, but did so for the logit estimates only

in the case of those married 5—8 years prior to 1940. Using the 1960

estimating equations from Table 2, again the unstable (A's and B's) were

successfully discriminated from the stable (the C's), and here, too,

the equation yielded a higher estimated probability of divorce for those

who had divorced relatively early (i.e., compare the predictions for the

A's with the predictions for the B's). Here the OLS and logit estimates

yielded remarkably similar results. Lest the reader be more optimistic

about the usefulness of these prediction equations than is justified, it

should be noted that these estimates have quite large standard errors.

We have not as yet produced a tool with which to equip marriage counselors
             13
or judges!

        The second question pertained to the implied changes as time

passes in the relationships between the explanatory variables and the

probability of divorce. This is a most difficult issue. One of the

difficulties in analyzing longitudinal data is that if the probability

of a nonrepeating event occurring differs among the individuals in a

sample, then there will be a differential rate of its occurrence over

time from a sample cohort. That differential rate of occurrence from

time period to time period alters (biases) estimates of behavioral

responses.14 One of the reasons for analyzing the total interval of

time since marriage In this paper was to circumvent the problem of

selective attrition through divorce from time interval to time interval.

Although successfully avoided in estimating the effects over the total

time interval, the problem reappears when one attempts to interpret the

coefficients in a per—unit time context. The Interpretations over the

whole time period are nevertheless valid.

        Regarding changes in the effects of the explanatory variables

on divorce over successively longer total time intervals, a very rough

generalization from Table 2 might be that the magnitudes of the coeff i—

dents of most of the variables tend to increase as the   length   of time
                                        24




increases between 1940 and 1950, but not so thereafter.15 As these

coefficients reflect the marginal effect of the variable on the proba-

bility of divorce over the total time span, their increase when estimated

over successively longer time intervals suggests that the effects of

age at marriage, religion, and schooling levels persist over time, at

least through the first dozen years or so of marriage.

        It is tempting to investigate the implied effects of        on the

yearly probability of divorce despite the biases discussed.      As shown

above, if the probability of divorce per year, p, is constant over time

for each couple and differs among couples as summarized in Equation (4)

(or Equation (6)), then the effect of        on p can be estimated from the

coefficients of    on P defined over n years using Equation (8). Using

the coefficients in Panel A of Table 2, the estimated effects of the five

variables on p as estimated by the 1940, 1950 and 1960 OLS regressions

are shown in Table 416 The —.085 in the first column can be inter-

preted as indicating that both spouses sharing the same religion lowers

the yearly probability of divorce by 8.5 percentage points when estimated

over the first one to four years of marriage. Except fGr the wife's

schooling level, the estimated effect of        on p is smaller the longer

the time interval on which the estimate is based. If that is so, then p

is not constant over time and the Bernoulli—trial model underlying the

calculations shown in Table 4 is inappropriate. Table 4 suggests that

although the effects of these variables on the probability of divorce

persist over time, they attenuate as time passes. But this inference

of attenuation may be incorrect if the selective attrition resulting from

heterogeneity in the sample biases the estimated coefficients downward.

        To summarize, this regression and logit analysis indicates that
                                                                           .
among the Terman women studied, marital stability is positively related

to the wife's age at marriage, to the schooling level of the husband,

to the fact that at least one of the spouses is Catholic, and to the

fact that the two spouses express the same religious affiliation, and

is negatively related to the level of schooling of the wife. These

results pertain to the stability of marriages over a total specified

length of time ranging from one to four years of marriage to 25—28 years

of marriage. There is evidence that the effects of these variables

persist over time, but that the effects attenuate as time passes. The

effect of the wife's level of schooling appears to deteriorate least

over time, but none of the cumulative effects over time rise suf-

ficiently to imply a constant impact of the variable on the per—year

probability of divorce. There are, as noted, however, potentially

serious deficiencies in the evidence on which this latter conclusion

is based.

        5. Modifications. In the course of the regression analysis

described above, several modifications were attempted and some will be

mentioned briefly. Only one of these modifications is of interest for

the results obtained; the others are mentioned primarily to indicate

their lack of effect on the original five variables.

        For the sample of women first married one to four years prior

to 1940, the dummy variable SANE RELIGION was decomposed into five

dummy variables defined as one if the spouses were BOTH CATHOLIC, BOTH

JEWISH, BOTH PROTESTANT, BOTH NONE, or BOTH OTHER RELIGION. These five

dummy variables replaced the SAME RELIGION and CATHOLIC variables in one
                                     27




regression estimate, while these five variables plus two separate

dummies indicating whether each spouse was Catholic were used in a

second regression. These variables' means and standard deviations are

included in the variable list in Table 1. The resulting regression

estimates are shown in Table 5. These results are comparable to the

OLS regressions in Panel A of Table 2.

          A comparison of the results in Tables 5 and 2 reveals that

the effects of the non—religion variables are not greatly affected by

the changes in the religion variables. The religion variables themselves

showed several interesting results. The magnitude of the effect of both

spouses having the same religious affiliation is remarkably similar

across religions in the first few years of marriage. The particular

religion does not seem to matter. This result is quite understandable

if, as discussed above, the variable reflects one dimension of comple—

mentarity between spouses in a relevant nonmarket trait. Indeed, this

result is more understandable than the result reported by Weeks (1943)

or by Landis (l949)) However, while the effect of SAME RELIGION In

the regressions in Table 2 suggest a relatively constant partial effect

as time passes, a comparison of columns 1 and 3 in Table 5 reveals that,

in this sample at least, the stabilizing influence differs considerably

among religions over time. In particular, the Catholic couples are

persistently more stable while the stabilizing effect of religion for

Jewish couples especially is not evidenced at all over the entire 21— to

24—year period. The result for Catholics Is explained, I think, by

the effect of the Catholic religion on the costs of dissolution.

If the full cost of marital dissolution is higher for couples of

 the Catholic faith, that higher cost probably does not decline appreciably

 over the lifetime. So the cost of divorcing imposed by Catholicism

 presumably persists over time, while the similarity in interests or the

 absence of conflict present in other marriages of like—religion spouses

 might deteriorate over time.

         The second and fourth columns of Table 5 decompose the Catholic

 religion effect Into the partial effect on stability of each spouse

 being Catholic. The results indicate that there is very little differ-

 ence In terms of the probability of divorce whether the wife or the

 husband is Catholic——the partial effects in the first four years of

marriage are —0.28 and —0.32, respectively. Results for 1940 imply the

 somewhat surprising conclusion that there is no additional effect of

 both spouses being Catholic——the partial effect of both spouses being

Catholic given that one spouse is Catholic is approximately zero. 18

In the 1960 regression the effects of the three Catholic variables are

considerably weaker.

        An additional, closely related regression might be mentioned

here. Terman gave a "marital happiness" test to the subjects and their

spouses in 1940, based on his own extensive research on marriage. For

the 109 maritally—stable couples in 1940 in my subgroup of women married

one to four years before 1940, I regressed the same five variables used

in Table 2 on the marital happiness scores of the subjects and spouses
          19
separately. In the regressions on the subjects' and spouses' marital

happiness scores, the results were:
                                              30

                                   (0.1)

Two   quite   ipteresting results emerged: in the first regression the

Catholic variable was very strongly negatively related to the marital

happiness score. That is what one might have expected. Other variables

which adversely affect the success of the marriage, e.g., AGE MARRIED,

would presumably lead to divorce and among those still married

one would not expect a strong relationship with a true "marital happi-

ness" score. But the Catholic variable is related to the cost of

divorce. At a given level of marital dissatisfaction, a Catholic couple

would not be expected to divorce as readily as a non—Catholic couple.

So among those still married one would expect a lower average score for

Catholics on a marital happiness scale. For the subjects here that

phenomenon is very much in evidence. The other interesting thing to
                                       31




note about these two equations is that in each, own—schooling lowers

while spouse's schooling raises marital happiness, suggestive of the

perceived contributions to and gains from the marriage.

          Since the Terinan data contained several additional background

variables, the 1940 and 1960 regressions were rerun with seven variables

added to the original set of five. These additional variables were the

husband's age at marriage, the number of siblings of the wife and husband,

the education level of the father and mother of the wife, the wife's

self—assessed health status in 1940 (defined as one if she considered

her   health "poor" or "fair") and a dummy variable reflecting the hus-
band's occupation in 1940 (defined as one if   he   was a physician, lawyer,
college   professor or engineer). These regressions are shown in Table 6.

The new variables deserve little comment. Relatively poor health in

1940 and more siblings of the wife seem to be correlated with greater

marital instability, but on the whole these variables add little to the

analysis. Of some note, however, is the small impact these seven vari-

ables had on the five original variables' coefficients. The magnitude

of the religion variable's coefficient increased by several percentage

points, but the age at marriage and wife's education coefficients were

practically unaffected. The husband's schooling level was affected

somewhat, probably by the inclusion of the husband's occupation dummy.

My conclusion from studying the modifications reported here as well as

several others is that the coefficients on the original five variables

are quite insensitive to the inclusion of other variables, or to minor

modifications in the definition of the sample.2°

        A comparison of results reported here and results from other

studies of marital instability is complicated by at least two factors.

First, this sample Is quite atypical. It is comprised of a group of

women with measured IQ's over 135 who spent at least some of their child-

hood in California and spent all of their adulthood being periodically

reminded by reinterviews that they were exceptionally gifted and under

more—than—usual social scrutiny. Despite these differences, there is

evidence that in terms of some aspects of marital behavior——marriage

rates and current divorce status——the Terman subjects did not behave in

a substantially different manner from others of their cohort, adjusted

for schooling level and state of residency (Michael 1976). Yet the

sample is surely atypical In terms of the range and variation in the

variables studied and that, in the case of such nonlinear effects as

age at marriage, helps explain some differences in estimated effects.

        Second, the estimated effects reported here are obtained from

a somewhat different methodology than frequently employed. Both in-

tuition and the type of model outlined in this paper suggest that there

are important dynamic aspects to marital behavior——couples do things in

one time period which affect the likelihood of divorce in subsequent

periods and conversely the likelihood of divorce influences decisions

about such things as the acquisition of capital assets such as buying a

home, moving one's family across country, or having a (or another) child.

Capturing these simultaneous relationships statistically can be done in

two ways: either a fully dynamic model can be explored (a route no

researcher has taken so far as I am aware), or a sequential model can be

estimated in which each successive time—period is studied separately with
                                     34



statements about conditional probabilities (so far as I am aware, only

the Becker, Landes, Michael (1976) study takes this approach).

        Most investigations of marital instability do neither. They

ignore or avoid the dynamic process altogether. The present study

avoids the dynamics by studying factors which are themselves invariant

with duration of marriage and by investigating their impact on divorce

over the total interval of time from marriage to some specified date——

e.g., the first four years of marriage or the first 24 years of marriage.

In this methodology the dynamics are not studied. Only the total or

gross effect of, say, age at marriage on the probability of divorce by

the 24th year of marriage is estimated (eg., in Panel A of Table 2 that

effect is estimated as —.0379: roughly speaking, marrying one year

older lowers the probability of a divorce by the 24th anniversary by

about four percentage points). This methodology does not reveal how

the age at marriage effect works its way out in terms of time or in

terms of influence through intervening behavior such as childbearing.

But neither is this methodology biased by the dynamics. No other recent

study of divorce which I have seen uses this methodology.

        Several studies use longitudinal data with information on

behavior over a short interval such as six months or a few years. These

studies often look at the effects of variables on the probability of

dissolution during that fixed—length period, but the period is drawn

from different locations in the marriage—duration spectrum. As an

example, one couple may be observed in their second to fifth years of

marriage, while another may be In their sixteenth to nineteenth years

of marriage. This procedure ignores the dynamics. Only if the exogenous
                                    35




variables have the same effect at each duration of marriage for a given

family and its different effects among families are independent of the

average probability of divorce among families can this procedure be used

to estimate the exogenous variable's average effect; otherwise, the

estimated coefficients are biased by selective attrition.21 In addition,

such studies often use as explanatory variables factors such as number

of children or wife's labor force status which probably reflect as well

as affect differences in the probability of divorce. Simultaneity biases

result from such a procedure.

                                                                              .
        1. These studies include Terman's (1938) study of some 400

variables affecting the marital happiness of a group of 800 married

couples surveyed in the mid—1930's, Burgess and Cottrell's (1939) socio-

logical study of some 500 couples surveyed in 1931—33, and a study of

several hundred married and divorced couples surveyed between 1938—44

by Locke (1951). Also see Terman and Wallin (1949).

        2. In motivating his extensive marriage study, Tertnan wrote,

"Twenty years ago the use of intelligence tests in the selection and

guidance of college students aroused widespread derision, but at present

admission to college is denied to thousands of high school graduates

every year in part on the basis of their intelligence scores. . .   .


Inasmuch as our data suggest that marital happiness can be predicted

by our scale almost as accurately as the college success of a high

school graduate can be predicted from an intelligence test, we are

sanguine enough to believe that such a scale, once its validity has

been thoroughly established, will not be entirely neglected." (Terman,

1938, p. 6)

        3. A recent paper by Welch (1976) suggests that the reliance

on the IQ tests referenced in the preceding footnote might best have

been avoided as well.

        4. These studies have been prompted partly by recent Increases in

divorce rates and   median ageat first marriage, partlybyrecent theoretical

advances and partly by availability of new large—scale data sets. The

studies include Bumpass and Sweet's (1972) analysis Of marital instability
                                     37



from the 1970 National Fertility Survey; Ross and Sawhill's (1975) study

of divorce from the University of Michigan's Survey of Income Dynam:ics;

Kneisner's (1975) preliminary work with the National Longitudinal Surveys;

studies of the marital behavior evidenced in the New Jersey and Denver!

Seattle income maintenance social experiment by Sawhill, Peabody, Jones

and Caldwell (1975) and Hannan, Tuma and Groeneveld (1976, preliminary)

respectively; and Becker, Landes and Michael's (1976, preliminary) study

of the Survey of Economic Opportunity data. The final three studies

consider both first marriage dissolution probabilities and remarriage

probabilities.

        5. The analysis of these data by Professor Terman and his

associates is reported In a Several—volume study entitled Genetic Studies

of Genius, edited by Lewis M. Terman (1925—1959). Incidentally, this

is a wholly Independent sample from the one used in Terman's study of

Psychological Factors in Marital Success (Terman, 1938).

        6.   The data were provided toNBERbyProfessors RobertR. Sears and

Lee J. Cronbach, of Stanford, the executors of the Terman data archive.

The data were at that time on Hollerith cards in a form which was not

readable by a computer. Extensive data processing was undertaken by

Susan Crayne under the direction of Arleen Leibowitz and myself. I am

happy to express my indebtedness to these individuals.

       Ms. Ann Barbee, of the Terman Project at Stanford, has also been

most helpful with problems related to the data set. A 1972 follow-up

questionnaire was also administered and will eventually be a part of

the Terman data archive.

        7.    This is strictly true of the age at marriage variable only,
                                                                            .
but religious affiliation is not likely to be altered by experience in

marriage and any changes in religious affiliation at the time of marriage

and in behalf of the marriage may still be considered independent of

subsequent marital success. The schooling levels are somewhat more

troublesome since marriage prior to the completion of formal schooling

is not unusual. We will assume that the level of schooling attained by

1940 for couples who married in the eight years prior to 1940 was

determined prior to marriage.

        A recent study by Davis and Bumpass (1976) indicates the extent

of post—marriage schooling from the 1970 NFS data. They find that about

20 percent of white women married since 1950 have attended school since

marriage for an average of about one year of schooling.

        8. These studies of 4,000 and 13,000 observations respectively

both used data obtained from surveying children about their parents'

marital behavior.    The studies also found that if both parents had no

religious affiliation the divorce rate was higher still——about 17 or

18 percent.




                                                                            .

         9. The simple correlation between the subject's measured IQ

 and schooling level for the subsample of 114 women married between 1936

 and 1939 was +0.12 and the simple correlation between the subject's

 self—assessed (in 1940) health level and schooling level was —0.15; the

 simple correlations between the subject's schooling level and the

 subject's father's and mother's schooling levels were +0.21 and +0.31,

 respectively, while the correlation between the parents' schooling levels

 themselves was +0.58 and between the subject and spouse, +0.33.

        10        =   (Pr11—Pr)     =                     b
              I                         (Pr) (1 —   Pr)   I

        11. The variable AGE MARRIED was coded "20" for women first

married at or before age 20, and since the duration of time since first

marriage by 1940 was calculated as age in 1940 minus AGE MARRIED, the

duration was not known for those women with an age at marriage coded

as 20 years. Since AGE MARRIED is one of the explanatory variables, this

criterion for selection in the group somewhat restricts the range of that

independent variable. More importantly, since marital instability is

significantly greater for women married at younger ages, the criterion

also constitutes some degree of conditioning the sample on the dependent

variable. Consequently, throughout this section the empirical results

should be understood as conditioned on an AGE MARRIED of 21 or above.

For reference, among couples known (or estimated) to have first married

one to four years prior to 1940, the divorce rate by 1960 for the 114

women studied was 15.8 percent, while for the 7 women married by age 20

the divorce rate was 28.6 percent. Similarly, among couples known (or

estimated) to have first married five to eight years before 1940, the

divorce rate by 1960 for the 97 women studied was 19.6 percent, while
                                     40




for the 28 women married by age 20 the divorce rate was 53.6 percent.

To compute these figures I assumed that those women married      age 20

were married at age 20 for purposes of defining the duration of their

time at risk.   If a woman in the latter group of 28 had been married

at, say, age 16 instead of 20, she might have been first married 12

years before 1940 instead of, say, 8 years. It is the absence of that

information which necessitates her exclusion from the group. Many of

the regressions reported below were also run on the duration—specific

groups, Including these 7 and 28 women, assuming their age at marriage

had been 20.

        12. This phenomenon is in evidence, for example, in the 1970

U.S. Census data on age at marriage. For example, among white women

first married between 1930—1934, the first marriage divorce rates fall

rapidly from 33.0 percent to 25.5 to 17.6 as age at marriage rose from

14—17 to 18—19 to 20—24, and fails somewhat more to 13.8 percent at

ages 25—29, then rises to 14.5 percent at age at marriage     30. This

identical pattern is evidenced for every five—year cohort from 1920

through 1964 and for divorce rates as well as for divorce and separation

rates! (See Census 1973, Table 4.) This pattern is one of the more

persistent relationships in marital behavior; It is also observed, for

example, in the SEO data. It is discussed at some length in Becker,

Landes, and MIchael (1976).

        13. In his volume on predicting marital happiness, Terman mused

"Many readers will smile at the optimism of a psychologist who assumes

that any man and woman contemplating marriage will ever stay their

intentions long enough to appeal for guidance to this modernized version
                                                 41



of the oracle" (Terman, 1938, P. 6). Neither Terman in his day, nor we,

have succeeded in devising a useful prediction formula, but the evidence

adduced here does suggest that there are understandable, systematic, and

persistent effects of certain socioeconomic variables on divorce patterns.

         14. See Heckman, Willis, 1975 or 1976, for discussions of the

problems in longitudinal analyses of heterogeneous populations.

         15. For instance, the wife's schooling level in Panel A raises

the probability of divorce within the first one to four years of marriage

by +0.003 and raises the probability of divorce within the first 11—14

years by 0.035, but raises the probability of divorce within the first

21—24 years by only 0.032.

         16. These effects were calculated from the slope coefficients

    of      in the jth year OLS regression in Table 2 as                      n(l—p.)'1 1,

where n =   2.5,   12.5 and 22.5 for the three regressions and p. is calculated

from P. = 1 —      (1_p•)fl   where P. is the sample mean of the DIVORCED 1940,

DIVORCED 1950 and DIVORCED 1960 variables, respectively.

         17. Weeks and Landis observed that the probability of divorce was

particularly high for couples with both spouses expressing no religious

affiliation. In his summary of evidence on marital dissolution, Levinger

(1965) states that,"Like—faitb marriages in which both members are either

Catholic, Jews, or reasonably strict Protestants have the lowest proba-

bility of divorce .      .    . while   .   .   . persons   of unconventional religious

convictions are most prone to use divorce as a solution to their marital

problems" (p. 24). If the stabilizing influence of the same religion

comes through greater complementarity in activities between spouses,

then the particular religion should not matter so much as the fact of
                                     42




similarity   of religious beliefs and practices. Similarity of interests
                                                                               .
in the absence of what Ackerman (1963) calls "disjunctive affiliation

networks" may be one of the important stabilizing influences on marriage.

          18. The total effect of both spouses being Catholic is the sum

of the three coefficients on the Catholic dummy variables. Or the

partial effect of the wife being Catholic given that the other spouse is

Catholic is the sum of the two coefficients on CATHOLIC, WIFE and BOTH

CATHOLIC.

          19. The scores were scaled from 0—100 and for these 109 observa-

tions the means (and standard deviations) for the subjects and their

husbands were 64.2 (17.5) and 64.9 (15.3) respectively. The correlation

across spouses was +.36 and the correlation with subsequent marital

dissolution was quite high for the subjects: —.26 correlation of

subjects' 1940 marital happiness score and a divorce dummy for 1950,

—. 25   correlation with a divorce dummy for 1960. The correlations were

very weak for the husbands' scores and the divorce dummies: —.01 for

1950 and —.07 for 1960. These correlations for the subject suggest that

the variable is indeed reflecting something related to marital satisfaction.

           20. Several additional modifications of the regression analysis

were also attempted. To the original set of five explanatory variables

were added the age of the wife and the age of the husband, as well as an

interaction term between these two variables. In another set of regres-

sions the education levels of the spouses were interacted. In a further

regression analysis a variable was added reflecting whether the subject

had been widowed, and in a separate analysis the widows were deleted

from the regressions. None of these modifications nor the results which
                                       43



included the women married at or before age 20 seem to warrant attention

here. The regression results for the five original variables were not

substantially altered by these modifications.

          21. Perhaps a hypothetical illustration would be useful.

Suppose age at marriage raised the probability of divorce in the first

year of marriage by thirty percentage points and had no effect on the

probability in any subsequent year. Then if one estimates the effect

of age at marriage on the probability of divorce on one—year intervals

selected randomly from observations at all durations of marriage, the

estimated coefficient will be a positive function of the number of

observations that happen to have been selected from the first year of

marriage. If the sample happened to have no observations from the first

year of marriage the coefficient would be zero! Such a coefficient

should not be interpreted as indicating no effect of the variable on the

annual probability of divorce, and more strongly, should not be inter-

preted as indicating no effect on the probability over an extended

period of time.

          If Q is the probability of survival of the marriage through a
                                                            n
periods and p the per—period probability of divorce, Q =   J (i—p.)
                                                           i=l   1
                                                                      and

Q/X is a weighted average of the effect on each period's p1. The

random selection of observations by marriage duration would essentially

weight the observations by the probabilities of survival up to that

duration rather than up to the period n, so the sample selection does

not yield an unbiased approximation to Q/3X. Of course, if the p's are

not independent of the level of X •(e.g., nonlinear effects), the

approximation to SQ/aX is poorer still.
