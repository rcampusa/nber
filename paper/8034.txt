I.      Introduction


How does the physical environment effect social interaction? Policy decisions, such as zoning
laws and public housing rules, that influence the physical environment of many people are made
regularly.   Yet, we know very little about the social impact of housing structure. Are taller,
larger buildings more social or more anonymous? Do single-family detached homes make better
citizens by increasing the connection between residents and the space that surrounds them? Is
there more crime in tall buildings? If building structure has an impact on citizenship, crime and
social connection then there are externalities associated with housing design. Housing policy
should be made with these externalities in mind. Indeed, popular beliefs about these questions
already influence policy. The goal of this paper is to bring some statistical light to bear on these
popular beliefs.


The paper attempts to provide answers to three questions about housing structure. First, is there
a connection between housing structure and citizenship? One possible reason for this connection
is that individuals in single-family homes are directly connected with the area that surrounds
them; individuals in large apartment buildings are separated physically from public
infrastructure. Furthermore, the division of labor within a building rises with the size of the
building. In larger buildings, there are professionals who handle the interaction with the outside
community. In single-family detached homes, every owner is his own community-relations
specialist and sewage expert.


Indeed there is a connection between living in multi-unit dwelling and involvement in local
politics and solving local problems. This connection survives controlling for a large range of
individual characteristics.     The connection also holds when we instrument for apartment-
residence using the average apartment residence of the individual’s state-city size cell and
various interactions of this average with other demographic characteristics. As one would
expect, building structure has no effect on participation in national politics. Unsurprisingly,
house-dwellers are also more likely to garden and engage in yard work and this connection with
the outside physical environment may explain why house-dwellers are more involved in local
politics.


Our second question is whether apartments lead to more social connection or more anonymity.
Individuals in multi-unit dwellings are physically more proximate to their neighbors.            As

                                                 2
physical distance tends to deter interaction, one might expect therefore that apartment-dwellers
are more connected with their neighbors. On the other hand, stories about the anonymous nature
of life in big apartment buildings also abound. People in single-family detached homes might
have more connection with their neighbors because of shared outside space that leads to
interaction.


We find that individuals in large apartment buildings are more likely to socialize with their
neighbors. They also socialize in public spaces in the neighborhood. Again, this connection
appears robust to an instrumental variables strategy.        It is also robust to estimation using
individual fixed effects utilizing German data. This extra socialization with neighbors appears
to crowd out other forms of social activity such as attending church or seeing relatives.


Our third question is whether building structure influences crime. There are two potential
reasons why multi-unit dwellings might be associated with more crime: density and distance
from the street. Higher density in large dwellings might lead to greater returns from criminal
activity, or perhaps residents tend to free ride and not take care of security.    Second, distance
from the street might be important in that when residents are more separated from the public
spaces that surround them, it is harder to observe crime or to intervene to stop criminal activity
(see the discussion in Jacobs, 1961).


We find that street crime is much higher for residents of taller, larger buildings. This is true both
for robberies and auto thefts in the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR).             The National Crime
Victimization Survey (NCVS) shows a very powerful connection between the probability of
victimization and building size. Using the American Housing Survey, we find that this effect is
more closely connected with building height than building size, which suggests the importance
of proximity to the streets in making those streets safe.


The findings of this paper confirm the general importance of space and housing in driving social
interactions. Housing structure appears to effect citizenship, social interaction and the crime
rate. While these results certainly do not lead to a clear policy endorsement, they do have a clear
policy implication. When designing policies that effect housing structure, the government needs
to consider the effects of housing structure on social relationships.




                                                  3
In Section II, we first discuss the theoretical connection between citizenship and housing
structure and then we test the hypotheses generated by this discussion. In Section III, we test
whether social connection rises or falls in multi-unit dwellings. In Section IV, we examine the
connection between building structure and crime. In Section V, we conclude.


II.      Building Structure and Citizenship


In this case, we discuss why we might expect building structure to affect social capital. We then
present our empirical results.


Why Would Building Type Affect Social Capital?


The mechanisms through which homeownership might be expected to affect citizenship are
relatively   straightforward      (see   DiPasquale      and    Glaeser,    1999,     for   a   discussion).1
Homeownership creates incentives to improve one's neighborhood because homeowners have a
significant asset, the value of which is tied to the quality of the community. Homeownership
also creates barriers to mobility. Lower levels of mobility also create incentives to invest in
social capital. When someone expects to live longer in a community, the incentives to invest in
that community become stronger.


The connections between building structure and community quality are more elusive.2 One
possible theory is that high-rise apartments provide more of a cocoon from the outside world
than single-family homes. Thus, actions in the street (i.e. the presence of trees or construction)
might be more directly relevant to a person in a detached home than to a person on the fifth floor
of an apartment building. The same argument applies to the actions of neighbors. If a neighbor
changes a third floor roof into a deck, this will not matter to someone who lives on the fifth floor
of an apartment building. However, the new deck would influence someone who lives in a three
story home because of the lost privacy in the house and the yard and because of any visual
externalities which might come from the deck. If the neighbors of single-family homeowners
create more externalities, then it is natural to expect that single-family homeowners will be more
likely to act politically to attempt to correct these externalities.

1
  Rossi and Weber (1996) also provide evidence on this topic.
2
  The theories that we discuss are all tied to simple economics. More complicated theories also connect housing
choice and political behavior, such as ideas about how crowding can alter preferences. The research on crowding
(for example Freeman et al., 1972) has basically failed to find a significant connection between crowding and
political behavior.
                                                         4
A second, perhaps more important, reason why single family homeowners might be more
involved in local politics is that in large apartments the division of labor begins to operate and
political functions are taken over by apartment managers. Few residents of large apartment
building are directly involved with problems relating to sewage or flood conditions during
storms. If the apartment building is effected by these concerns, then there will be a professional
who handles the problem. Single-family homeowners do not hire professionals because the fixed
costs of having a specialized outsider to handle sewage relations for a particular house would
exceed any possible gains from specialization.3


Thus there are two reasons why single-family homeowners might be expected to be more
involved in local politics. First, they have more connection to surrounding public services and
the actions of neighbors. This connection to things that are governed by local politics means that
the returns to local political activity should rise. Second, residents of large apartment buildings
hire specialists who handle their political involvement for them. These specialists do not work
for residents of single-family homes because it would not pay to have a specialist work on the
political needs of a single home.


Table 1


Table 1 presents a basic series of facts from the National Opinion Research Center’s General
Social Survey (GSS). The GSS is an annual survey given to between 1,500 and 2,500 persons
since 1973. The survey attempts to be a representative sample of the United States. The General
Social Survey is particularly valuable because it has a wide range of both economic and social
variables. One unfortunate aspect of this survey is that the same questions are not asked in all of
the years. Rather than aim for an impossible consistency by keeping the number of observations
constant across tables and regressions, we just included as much data as possible.


We have divided the data into three groups. The first group does not inhabit an apartment
building (i.e. they have less than 5 units in their buildings). The second group inhabits an
apartment building with between 5 and 9 units. The third group lives in “big apartments” which
are defined as apartments with more than 10 units. These cutoffs are provided by the GSS and

3
 There is a question about why groups of single-family home owners don’t get together and hire a specialized
consultant. The natural explanation for this is that because of lower densities for these individuals, any large group
has so much heterogeneity that there is not the same benefit from having a single specialized professional.
                                                           5
since this survey was not designed to address housing issues, it does not have more helpful
building structure measures.


The first row in the table shows the basic connection between home ownership (which could
mean ownership of an apartment) and structure type. Almost 84 percent of the respondents
living in single family detached dwellings are also homeowners. Less than 15 percent of either
type of apartment dwellers are homeowners. The majority of our sample will be homeowners.
The sample of apartment residents is about one-fourth of the size of the sample of single family
dwelling residents. The big apartment building residents are rarer still.


The second and third rows of the table give basic demographics of the different types of building
residents. Residents of apartment buildings are slightly less likely to be male. They are much
less likely to be married. 73 percent of single family home residents are married. Around 40
percent of the apartment dwellers are married. Residents of apartments are also more likely to be
black. Since these figures are so different for the different building structures, we will certainly
need to control for gender and marital status in our later empirical work.


In the fifth row, we find that residents of medium size apartments are much more likely to be
young (under 30) than residents of homes. Surprisingly, residents of big apartment buildings are
likely to be older than residents of smaller apartment buildings. This is a surprising fact that
probably bears more investigation.


The sixth and seventh rows investigate education. Interestingly, residents of big apartment
buildings are more likely to be high school dropouts and more likely to be college graduates. We
suspect that this dichotomy reflects the inequality that is present in dense cities and perhaps the
role of public housing, where less advantaged people end up living in very tall buildings.
Alternatively this result may just come from apartment dwellers being young and younger people
having more education.      Residents of medium sized apartment buildings are slightly better
educated than the residents of homes. This again may be due to the younger age of residents of
those structures. The eighth row shows that apartment dwellers tend to be poorer.


The ninth row shows that they have fewer children. It is unsurprising that people with children
choose to consume the greater amount of space that is generally inherent in buying a house rather
than an apartment.

                                                 6
The tenth row shows the unsurprising result that apartment dwellers live in big cities. Naturally,
higher land prices in those areas cause developers to build up rather than using more land.
Again, this is a variable that will be important to control for in our later regressions.


The next set of rows show the dependent variables that we will consider elsewhere in the paper.
Since we believe that it is important to control for demographic and other characteristics when
we compare residents of houses and apartments, we will refrain from discussing these results
here. The most important thing to take away from the remaining rows of the table is that every
result that appears in our regression setting also appears in the basic means.


Table 2


Table 2 shows our first set of results using regression analysis. In this table, we show the effects
of building structure (and other variables) holding all other variables constant. In practice, we
estimate a regression of the form:


      Outcomei = a + b * Apartment i +c * Big Apartment i + d * mobile homei +
(1)                                                                                      .
      e * 2 − 3 family i + Other Controls


The coefficients b and c show the effect of apartment status relative to the residents of single
family detached dwellings and holding everything else constant. In the bulk of our regressions,
the variable takes on values of one or zero only. In those cases, we have estimated probit
regressions. We do not report probit coefficients but rather the estimated marginal impact of a
change in the independent variable on the dependent variable.


In the GSOEP, we run individual fixed effects regressions of the form:


      Outcomei ,t = ai + b * Apartment i ,t + c * Big Apartment i ,t + d * mobile homei ,t +
(2)
      e * 2 − 3 family i ,t + Other Controls


The term ai refers to the fact that we allow for an individual-specific intercept term. This term
means that when we estimate the connection between apartment residence and the relevant

                                                      7
outcome variable, we are testing whether individuals who have moved from single family homes
to apartments see a change in the outcome variable. The presence of the individual specific
intercept means that we have controlled for the possibility that individuals who own apartments
are just innately different from people who own single family homes.4


Columns (4) and (6) of Table 2 show the connection between apartment residence and
gardening. Column (4) shows that people who live in apartment buildings with 10 or more units
are 25 percent less likely to garden than people who live in single family detached homes.
Column (6) shows that people who switch into apartment buildings in the GSOEP are 10 percent
less likely to garden. The bulk of the difference between the results occurs because we are
controlling for individual-specific fixed effects in the German data and not in the U.S. The strong
connection between apartment residence and gardening is obviously not itself a test of
citizenship. However, this evidence does support the specialization argument made above—
people in multi-person structures are more likely to have professionals help than to do things
themselves. The greater level of gardening is one way in which residents of houses interact with
their neighbors and with the public space that surrounds them.


Column (1) presents our first test of whether architecture affects citizenship. Our dependent
variable is whether you have ever voted in local elections. As in DiPasquale and Glaeser (1999),
homeownership has a significant positive effect on this variable. Education and income also
positively influence this social capital variable.                 Most of the other control variables are
insignificant, including marital status and number of children.


Apartment status strongly, negatively affects this variable. Residents of big apartment buildings
are 16.8 percent less likely to vote in local elections. Residents of mobile homes are 14.9 percent
less likely. Interestingly, there is only an insignificant negative effect of small apartments on this
social variable. Perhaps, it is the residents of the biggest apartment buildings who are most
separated from the political issues that surround them.


The next regression show results for a less precise question, which asks respondents if they have
worked to solve local problems. While there is a significant effect of homeownership on this
variable, there is not a significant effect of either building structure variable. If both apartment
types are grouped together, we find that living in a single family detached home is significantly

4
    Of course, it is possible that the change in building status is accompanied by other changes which we do not

                                                            8
positively related to working to solve local problems. As usual, education is also a very strong
predictor of this outcome variable.


Column (3) shows the results for voting in the most recent national election. Since theory
predicts more activity in local, not national, elections, we see this regression as a placebo and we
expect no connection. Indeed, apartment residence is insignificantly positively connected with
voting in national elections. Living in a mobile home does, however, negatively predict voting
in the presidential election. This leads us to suspect that the mobile home results are quite
possibly the result of omitted personal characteristics that are correlated with living in a mobile
home.


Column (5) shows the effect of apartment status on involvement in local politics using the
German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP).                   This data set, of course, may be slightly less
comparable because it relates to Germany rather than the United States.5 As before, we are
controlling for individual fixed effects.           In this regression, apartment status has a negative
impact on political involvement but this impact is not statistically significant. When we run
these regressions without individual fixed effects, we do find that apartment status significantly
effects the citizenship variable.


Table 3—Addressing Endogeneity


In Table 3, we address the endogeneity of apartment structure. One problem with the previous
regressions is that housing choice is itself endogenous. As such, more politically involved
persons may just choose to live in single family detached homes and our previous results could
be spurious. To control for this possibility, we follow an instrumental variables strategy.


Our basic instrument follows DiPasquale and Glaeser (1999) and uses the housing structure of
the geographic area in which the person resides. Our instrument is formed by considering the
average level of the apartment variables in the state-city size quartile in which the person resides
(based on the GSS). In other words, we use the average probability of living in an apartment in
the person’s state in cities which fall in a particular size category (e.g. top quartile of the state,


observe. This would lead to biased coefficients.
5
  The German housing market is substantially different from that of the United States. Homeownership rates are
lower, homes are smaller and more people live in apartments (see DiPasquale and Glaeser, 1999, for further
discussion of these differences).
                                                          9
etc.).6 Naturally, we will continue to control for city size itself (and almost all of our other
variables). We also use interactions of this variable with other exogenous characteristics of the
person to instrument for whether the person lives in an apartment. This instrument will be
acceptable as long as location is not itself determined by citizenship.


In Table 3, we make two added changes to our basic specification. Because of the usual
difficulties performing two-stage least squares with a probit specification, everything is done
with ordinary least squares. We have also grouped our two apartment variables to get more
precision. Finally, we have dropped homeownership as a control variable. We needed to drop
homeownership, because at the location level homeownership and apartment status is
particularly highly correlated. We have run our specifications both in ordinary least squares
specification and using instrumental variables to facilitate the comparison of coefficients.


In regressions (1) and (2), we revisit the connection between apartment status and voting in local
elections. As in Table 2, the basic effect is quite strong. Using instrumental variables barely
changes the coefficient although the standard error does increase. Regression (3) and (4) look at
working to solve local problems. The ordinary least squares results are significant here (as
opposed to Table 2) because we combine the two apartment variables and because we exclude
homeownership. Again, using the instrumental variables specification increases the standard
error but barely moves the coefficient. We conclude that the results are robust to this alternative
specification.


Overall, we believe that there is a weak, negative relationship between apartment residence and
local citizenship. We have three regressions that focus on local citizenship and of these, only
one yields a strongly significant result. The German data is significant if we do not include fixed
effects and all apartment status effects are negative. Still, it is hard to believe that apartment
status compares with homeownership as a determinant of citizenship.


III.       Buildings and Social Connection


In this section, we discuss the connection between building structure and various forms of social
connection.

Why Would Building Type Affect Social Connection


The basic theory about why building type might effect social connection is extremely simple.
Large buildings have less physical space between residents. Even if each housing unit is the
same size, and if there is the same amount of land area per person, when individuals are in a
large apartment building there will be less distance between them than if the same people lived in
single family detached dwellings that are each surrounded by their own plot. The simplest
theories of social connection suggest that social connection declines as the costs of that
connection increase and that distance will increase the costs of that connection.


Indeed, there is a wide range of evidence supporting the point that even modest distances
seriously decrease social interaction (Baldassare, 1979, provides a survey, Festinger et al., 1950,
is a classic study). The General Social Survey asks how often you see your closest friend and
how far the trip is to that friend. The correlation between these variables is -64 percent. The
correlation between distance to your closest relative and frequency of visiting that relative is –73
percent. Reductions in physical distance between neighbors in apartment buildings could very
well drive up social interaction between neighbors. This effect will be augmented by the fact
that people in apartment buildings are likely to use common spaces such as entryways and
elevators.


Alternatively, there are arguments about single-family homes creating more connection between
neighbors. Most of these arguments tend to focus on other attributes of the residents detached
houses (i.e. their tenure in the community) rather than housing structure itself. However, in
principle it is still possible that the common areas surrounding detached homes lead to high
levels of interaction and more neighborliness.


A second effect of apartments comes from the lack of space in smaller building units. In smaller
living units, using public spaces outside of the home will become more desirable. For example,
it will be more attractive to go out to eat or drink or recreate, if the individual has less space
inside the home. It may be that recreating outside of the home leads to more social interactions
with neighbors.     This force may also explain the finding of Green and White (1998).
Homeowners may have more successful children, because greater interior space leads to these
people spending more time at home.



                                                 11
Of course, if either detached houses or apartments lead to more socializing with near neighbors,
this may crowd out socializing along other fronts. As such we should expect that whichever
group socializes more in their own area should do less socializing elsewhere. This may have
positive or negative social effects depending on whether socializing with neighbors is more
beneficial for the community as a whole, than socializing with others.


Table 4


In this table, we examine the correlation between social connection and building structure. In the
first regression using the General Social Survey, we explore the determinants of socializing with
a neighbor. This variable is on a one to seven scale, where one refers to never going out and
seven refers to always going out. Individuals who live in big apartments are much more likely to
spend an evening out with someone from the neighborhood. City size seems to be negatively
associated with this variable, big apartment building residence is positively associated with this
variable. Living in a moderately sized apartment building is also significantly associated with
this variable. This result is important because it suggests that big apartment buildings are
associated with community, not anonymity.              This finding supports the basic view that
transportation costs play a major role in determining social interactions.


The second regression repeats this regression where we have used going to a bar or tavern as the
dependent variable. We see this variable as a measure of socializing in public spaces outside of
the home, and our discussion predicted that people in apartments would be more likely to use
these external public spaces. Again the outcome variable is on a one to seven scale. People in
big apartment buildings are more likely to use these public spaces.


In regressions (6) and (7), we consider similar variables using the GSOEP. We again use this
data set to control for individual fixed effects, which means that our results are not being driven
by the fact that apartment-dwellers are intrinsically different from people in detached homes. In
regression (6), we look at attending cultural events. In regression, (7) we look at spending the
night out. Both of these variables show recreation in external public spaces that might lead to
more contact with neighbors. People in big apartment buildings are more likely to attend cultural
events and they are more likely to spend the night out. This again supports the basic hypothesis
that social interactions are a function of housing structure.



                                                  12
Regions (3), (4) and (5) show the effects of apartment status on socializing with relatives and
going to church. Regression (3) shows that in the General Social Survey people living in
apartment (but not big apartments) are less likely to socialize with relatives. One explanation for
this is that other forms of socialization are crowding out seeing relatives.


Regression (4) shows that church attendance is lower for people in big apartments. Regression
(5) confirms the church attendance—apartment status results. The negative connection between
living in a big apartment and going to church is quite robust. Our best explanation of this is that
other social activities in big apartments crowd out churchgoing, but we believe that this is only
part of the answer. Hopefully future research will address this question more fully.


We are more confident with our results on social connection and apartment status than we are
with our results on local political involvement and apartment status. People in apartments are
more likely to socialize with neighbors, spend nights out and go to cultural events. The absence
of distance to neighbors and to exterior public events seems to be important. However, these
increases in sociability appear to drive out other forms of social interaction such as church going
and seeing relatives.


IV.     Buildings and Crime


Finally, we address the connection between building structure and crime.


Why Would Building Structure Affect Crime?


Perhaps the most natural theory about why building structure, and in particular, large apartments
might affect the crime rate is that building structure determines the access to living space.
According to different versions of this theory, either apartments or single-family homes are more
accessible to potential burglars. Apartments may be more accessible if the building itself is not
well defended. Alternatively, if apartment buildings have doormen or solidly locked external
doors, it may be that apartment buildings are harder to enter. Both versions of this theory
suggest that building structure should be particularly important in creating crimes against the
home.




                                                 13
A second reason that building structure might effect crime is that densities are higher with
apartment buildings. Crime is an activity where “transport” costs are very high. In other words,
criminals do not appear to travel far away from their place of residence even when the financial
inducements would appear to be quite strong. Criminals will have greater access to victims in
dense areas, because transport costs, to victims will be lower and more crimes will occur. Big
apartment buildings will be associated with a steady stream of people over a particular area and
as such present an easy target for criminals who want to engage in crime against people.7


Jacobs (1961) emphasizes the connection between citizens and the streets. She argues that
density is not a problem, and indeed high density areas might be safer.                         However, she
emphasizes the important role that private monitoring can play in stopping crime. One major
effect of tall apartment buildings is that it greatly increases the physical distance between the
average apartment and the street below. If people themselves are the most important policing
force, then distance between residential quarters and public space may lead to much less policing
and much more crime. This theory predicts that it is height rather than building size, which will
lead to more crime.


A final theory argues that density changes human behavior and leads to more aggression.
Following Lorenz (1966) there was a great bout of research on this topic and the evidence is
mixed at best. However, to the extent that we observe a connection between dense large
apartment buildings and crime, it might be related to this type of force.


Tables 5 and 6


In Table 5, we examine the connection between apartment status and crime using the Federal
Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Reports. The Uniform Crime Reports represent the
amount of reported crime in all larger jurisdictions within the U.S. This regression is run at the
city level and the key independent variable is the share of the population living in apartment
buildings. We examine crime rates (per capita) across all cities (where data is available) with
more than 25,000 inhabitants.




7
  Of course, there are many mechanisms through which this process may work. Close proximity of crime-prone
persons may lead to congestion of law enforcement and lower arrest rates. Alternatively, crime-prone persons may
teach each other crime-related skills or act to legitimize crime-related activities.
                                                            14
The first regression shows no connection between overall serious crimes and percent of
population living in multi-unit dwellings. The overall serious crime measure is driven primarily
by petty larceny (which is theft without threat of violence) and this larceny measure is indeed
uncorrelated with building structure. While crime rises with city size, it does not rise in multi-
unit dwellings. The second regression shows the connection between burglaries and apartment
buildings. Again, there is no significant correlation.


The third and fourth regressions look at two particular forms of crime that are particularly likely
to occur on the street. The third regression looks at robberies. These are crimes which involve
threat of violence and typically occur on the street. There is a very strong connection between
multi-unit dwellings and robberies. The fourth regression examines auto thefts, another street
crime. Again, multi-unit dwellings strongly predict auto thefts.


Overall, Table 5 suggests that there is no general connection between crime and multi-unit
dwellings. There is particularly no connection between burglaries and multi-unit dwellings.
However, there is a strong connection between street crimes (i.e. robberies and auto theft) and
multi-unit dwellings. This seems to support the idea that the distance between residents and the
neighborhood means that the streets are less safe with big apartment buildings.


Table 6 examines this hypothesis more closely using data from the National Crime Victimization
Survey and the American Housing Survey. The National Crime Victimization Survey asks
respondents whether or not they have been victimized over the six months prior to the interview.
The NCVS also asks about building structure and public housing, as well as individual
demographics. In the NCVS regressions we define big apartment buildings as those with 10 or
more units, and apartment buildings as those with 5-9 units.


Regression (1) shows a strong positive coefficient of big apartment building residence on being
victimized. This coefficient is quite strong. The coefficient means that the predicted level of
victimization is 6.7 percent greater in a big apartment building relative to living in a single
family detached house. There is also a significant positive effect of living in a smaller apartment
building. Interesting, public housing is associated with less victimization, rather than more. It is
also true that minority status is not associated with more victimization in this data. If we did not
control for the other variables (particularly income, age and poverty status), public housing and
minority status would continue to have their expected signs.

                                                 15
The second regression shows that there is no apartment effect on being victimized in a “house
crime,” where a house crime is defined as either a burglary or a crime that took place in your
own house. Big apartment buildings do not lead to unsafe residences.


Regression (3) shows people in big apartment buildings are much more likely to be victimized
by a crime against their person.      These crimes are again most likely to happen on streets
surrounding one’s place of residence. From this we conclude that the apartments are themselves
just as safe as houses. However, the shared common spaces and dense areas around apartment
buildings are more likely to have victimization.


The fourth and fifth regressions show results for the American Housing Survey. This survey
contains much better information about a wide range of housing characteristics. However, it
does not actually contain victimization data. Instead, it contains the resident's assessment of the
level of street crime in the neighborhood. This is a 0-1 variable with 0 meaning that street crime
is not a problem and 1 meaning that street crime is a problem.


In regression (4), we show that people living in either type of apartment are more likely to face
street crime. In this data set we are also able to control for public housing and find that there is
substantially more street crime reported around public housing units. There is no significant
difference between big apartment buildings and apartments generally.


In regression (5) we separate out the role of floors with the role of units.         This helps to
distinguish between the role of building size and the role of distance from the ground. In this
survey, we find that the important variable for explaining street crime is the number of floors not
the number of units. This means that the connection between crime and apartment buildings
appears to have more to do with height than with the number of residents.


There is a fairly persistent connection between street crime and building structure. Big, and
particularly, tall apartment buildings are associated with less safe streets. We suspect that this
comes from the greater distance between people and the streets in big buildings.




                                                   16
V. Conclusion


This study found that building structure matters for behavior in ways that correspond with simple
economic ideas. Large apartment buildings appear to have two important effects on behavior.
First, they reduce the distance between neighbors. Second, they increase the distance between
residents and the streets.


Because of these two different effects, the impact of apartments on behavior is often subtle.
Apartment buildings increase the social connection between neighbors but reduce individual
involvement in local politics. Apartment buildings increase recreation outside of the home in
some ways, but also reduce church attendance. Most strikingly, big apartment buildings are
strongly associated with street crime. This is most probably the effect of distance between where
people live and the streets.


These subtle, but quite significant, connections between housing structure and important social
outcomes suggest that housing must be integrated into a wide range of social policies. However,
there is no clear policy implication of this research other than housing must be taken seriously
and studied further.
