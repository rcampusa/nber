                                              ABSTRACT

This paper studies the impact of several factors on the geographical distribution of basic scientific
research across countries and time, and explains the dynamics of the process that has resulted in the
United States becoming the undisputed leader in basic research. Our study is based on the records
of major scientific awards, and on data dealing with global economic and historical trends. We investigate
the degree to which scale or threshold effects account for the number of major prizes (Nobel, Fields,
Kyoto, Wolf) won by different countries. We constructed a stylized model, predicting that lagged relative
GDP of a country relative to the GDP of all countries engaging in basic research is an important explanatory
variable of a country?s share of prizes. Scale effects imply that the association between the GDP share
of a country and its prize share can be logistic -- above a certain threshold, there is a take-off range,
where the prize share increases at an accelerating rate relative to the GDP share of the country, until
it reaches "maturity" stage. Our empirical research findings confirm the importance of lagged relative
GDP in accounting for a country's prize shares, and the presence of a "winner-takes-all" scale effect
benefiting the leader. We found that U.S. basic research take-off started during the 1920s, with this
research being done in the United States by U.S. scholars, prior to the immigration of scientists after
Hitler's rise to power in Germany (1932-33). This is consistent with the notion that World War II set
in motion forces that did not start, but hastened, the U.S. take-off, triggering immigration that contributed
to the speed and intensity of U.S. research dominance. Using more recent data, we also documented
the growing importance of countries that used to be at the periphery of global research, but are now
possibly advancing towards the take-off stage.

                                   Prizes for Basic Research —
                 Human Capital, Economic Might and the Shadow of History
This paper studies the impact of a variety of factors on the geographical distribution of basic
scientific research across countries and time. Our goal is to explain the dynamics of the process
that has resulted in the United States becoming the leader in basic research, and to identify
factors that may shape the future patterns of global research. Understanding creativity and path-
breaking scientific research remains a black box. Given the absence of detailed information on
networks of scientific research, and the effort associated with these networks, we relied on the
records of major scientific awards, and on data dealing with global economic and historical
trends. The cumulative records of major prizes included more than one hundred years of Nobel
laureates in chemistry, medicine and physics, as well as the significant, albeit shorter, records of
the Fields Medal, Kyoto and Wolf Prizes for basic research. We used this information to study
the degree to which scale or threshold effects account for a country’s share of major prizes.
       When collecting and processing this information, we recognized the time lag between the
actual research to the time when the prize was awarded, and the likelihood that the migration of
scholars resulted in a discrepancy between the country of residence at award time and the country
where the research was actually carried out. We dealt with these complications by compiling
two data sets, dubbed award time and research time. Each prize was first recorded at the time
and place where the awarded research was actually done (research time). It was then recorded at
the time the award was presented, crediting it to the scholar’s actual place of residence at award
time. We used both data sets to infer the average lags between conducting research and receiving
the award, in order to define more accurately the patterns of migration and infer the factors
explaining global patterns of basic research.
       Figure 1A, which focuses on award time, plots the averages of shares of Nobel Prizes for
science (chemistry, medicine and physics) during the twentieth century, where the time unit is
composed of five-year segments starting 1900–1904. The most dramatic development in this
figure is the take-off of the U.S. share, starting from 0% in 1900 and reaching about 70% by the
end of the century. Figure 2 plots the U.S. GDP, as share of total GDP of all countries for which
at least ten science Nobel Prizes were awarded from 1900 to 2005, and the U.S. share of Nobel
Prizes for sciences, where GDP share lags by two decades (reflecting the average gap between
research time and award time). The fitted line in figure 2 is a third-order polynomial.
                                                  2

       These figures suggest that the U.S. take-off was closely linked to the sizable increase in
the U.S. GDP share, and to the decline in the GDP share of Germany. The purpose of our paper
was to analyze the factors accounting for these dramatic changes systematically, putting these
factors in the context of a model that provides possible links between relative GDPs and prize
shares, in the presence of scale effects associated with scientific research.
       The starting point of our analysis is the conjecture that the U.S. basic research take-off
and its present leadership position is the direct outcome of the collapse of the research position of
Germany, which was the research leader at the beginning of the twentieth century. Using both
research-time and award-time data sets, we examined this conjecture in detail, a procedure that
was essential, both because of the lags between research and award times (two decades on
average) and because of the migration of prominent scholars resulting from historical events.
These concerns were crucial to our attempts to identify the impact of World War II on patterns of
basic research. Using the research-time data allowed us to identify the timing of the actual
research take-offs in several countries, timing that would have been blurred had only the award-
time data been used. Examining the data, we inferred that attributing the research take-off of the
U.S. to the breakdown of research in Germany is only half the story.
       U.S. basic research take-off started during the first third of the twentieth century. This
research was done in the United States by U.S. scholars, prior to the immigration of gifted
scientists before and during World War II. As is shown in table 1a and figure 6a, U.S. prize
share using the research time panel was about 15% in the early 1900s, over 25% in the 1920s,
and over 35% in the 1930s, reflecting research done in the United States prior to the sizable
immigration triggered by Hitler. These observations reflect both the average two-decade gap in
time between the research and the awards, and the timing of immigration of prominent scholars.
The U.S. take-off reached the maturity stage during the 1940s through the 1960s. The 1930s
was the watershed decade, where the United States emerged as the basic research leader, due
both to the scientific achievements of U.S. scholars, and to the sharp decline of research in
Germany. World War II set in motion forces that hastened the U.S. take-off, triggering
immigration patterns that accelerated and intensified this process.
       Another goal of our work was to increase our understanding of the linkage between basic
research and economic power. Figure 2 suggests that the association between GDP at research
time, and prize shares two decades hence, i.e. at award time, is logistic. This observation is
                                                         3

consistent with the predictions of the stylized model described in the next section, explaining
countries’ prize shares, when scale effects characterize the production of basic research.
Specifically, the model predicts that lagged relative GDP of a country, relative to that of other
countries engaging in basic research, is an important explanatory variable of a country’s share of
prizes. Scale effects imply that the association between the GDP share of a country and its prize
share tends to be logistic — that is, above a certain threshold there is a take-off range, where the
prize share increases at an accelerating rate, until it reaches maturity stage.
        Simulating a simple version of our model suggested that the model fitted the first part of
the U.S. basic research take-off, though it underestimated its momentum (see figure 5).1 Our
empirical analysis confirmed the importance of lagged relative GDP in accounting for a
country’s prize shares, and the presence of a winner-takes-all scale effect, reflecting a convex
association between income and basic research. Apparently, the winner-takes-all effect was
reinforced even further by immigration patterns: from 1936 onward, 73 of the U.S. Nobel
laureates were immigrants from other countries, amounting to 18.2% of the total Nobel Prizes in
basic research awarded to all countries during that time period. The corresponding Nobel awards
gained by immigrants to other major recipient countries are 15 for the UK, 12 for Switzerland,
and only 4 for Germany (see table 1A). During that same period, 26 Nobel laureates were of
German, 8 of Austrian, 7 of British, 7 of Canadian, 6 of Hungarian, 5 of Polish, and 4 of Russian
origin (see table 1B for more details).2 Our analysis is consistent with the notion that World War
II set in motion forces that hastened the U.S. take-off, suggesting that migration patterns
accelerated this process.
        An additional finding of our analysis was that, ceteris paribus, the return toward a more
symmetric configuration among leading industrial countries may eventually reverse some of the
trends observed during the twentieth century. A glimpse into this possibility is provided in figure
1B, which plots the combined prize share of all countries, excepting Europe and the United
States, hence referred to as AOC (All Other Countries). When reading this graph, one should
keep in mind the two-decade average lag between the actual research and the award for it. Figure

  There was, however, an intriguing discontinuity in the U.S. basic research take-off: the U.S. prize shares (using
research time) were below 40% during most of the first third of the twentieth century, but well above 50% after
1940. Using the award time data, the U.S. prize shares were either below 30% during most of that period, or well
above 50% after 1940.

  Hence, the net immigration of Nobel laureates for 1936–2005 was 73 to the U.S., 12 to Switzerland, 8 to the UK, 1
from France, 4 from Russia, 5 from Poland, 5 from China, 6 from Hungary, 7 from Canada, 8 from Austria, 21 from
Germany.

1B suggests two instances of impending AOC take-offs in the last 70 years: the first is 1940–
1960 (reflecting research done, approximately, during 1920–1940), and 1990–2005 (reflecting
research done during 1970–1985). The first take-off was apparently aborted due to the upheaval
of World War II. These trends stand out even more clearly when one looks at the aggregation of
the Nobel with other prizes for basic research (see figure 1B).
       Related questions were investigated in the literature on economic development. In a
number of intriguing studies, carried out by Davis and Weinstein (2002 and 2004) on the long-
term distribution of economic activity within Japan, for instance, even very large temporary
shocks to urban areas seemed to have no long-run impact on city size. When examining this
question in the context of the intense Allied bombing of Japanese cities and industries in World
War II, they found that, even in the aftermath of severe shocks, a city typically recovered not
only its population and its share of aggregate manufacturing, but also the composition of specific
industries it had had before. Hence, they did not find support for path dependency, which was
frequently linked to returns to scale (see Krugman, 1991, and David, 2000). To the best of our
knowledge, there has been very little research on these questions in the context of basic scientific
research. The tremendous global shocks of the twentieth century provide the background to our
investigation, provoking questions akin to the ones studied by Davis and Weinstein regarding the
degree to which economic power and the world wars have affected basic scientific research in
enduring ways.
       Section 1 outlines a stylized model explaining key determinants of basic research.
Section 2 discusses the data used in the paper. Section 3 summarizes the empirical regularities
and the results of regressions, explaining the changing prize shares of various countries. In our
concluding remarks in section 4, we have outlined important issues that are beyond the scope of
the present paper, such as the role of public versus private funding of basic research, the quality
of governance, the changing roles of research networks and the diffusion of information
technology.


1.     Stylized model of key determinants of basic research.
       This section outlines the stylized model used to identify the variables applied in our
empirical study. We modeled prizes awarded for basic research as the outcome of a periodic
contest between prominent recent contributions. Since prizes are not awarded posthumously,
                                                         5

there is a time limit set by the scholars’ life cycles. The intertemporal importance of major
contributions is determined by the speed of knowledge diffusion. As we did not have a tractable
way of comparing the relative importance of the major contributions, we adopted a simple
threshold approach: all major scientific contributions of the same period were treated as equal
candidates for winning the prize contest. The arrival rate of major contributions in a country
depends on the stock of knowledge in that country, potentially interacting with the global stock
of knowledge in non-linear ways, due to scale and networking effects. Such knowledge, dubbed
“human capital,” evolves as the outcome of invested resources, adjusted for the depreciation
caused by aging, and/or such calamities as wars or natural disasters.3 The investment in human
capital depends positively on the scale of the economy that supports the research, e.g. real GDP,
and/or real GDP pre capita.
        A key aspect of scientific research is the presence of returns to scale, possibly due to
fixed costs and networking effects. Basic research may lack immediate commercial use, yet it is
associated with significant fixed set-up costs (costs of setting laboratories, running experiments,
and disseminating results). These costs may be prohibitive enough to be supported only by a few
affluent countries, in a few well-endowed centers. One therefore expects these centers to be
magnets for scientific work, leading to scale economics and agglomeration (see CERN in
Switzerland,4 or the Brookhaven National Laboratory in the United States5). Furthermore,
research frequently benefits from peer interaction, leading to network externalities when
doubling the number of scholars in the network may more than double the productivity of the
network.6,7 These considerations suggest that doubling the investment in knowledge more than

  Human capital is the stock of expertise, knowledge, and skill embodied in an individual as a result of education,
training, and experience that raises their productivity (on conceptualization and measurement of human capital, see
Becker, 1975).

  CERN (French for European Nuclear Research Centre) is located near Geneva. Its recent purchase of Europe's
flagship particle accelerator (LHC) has been associated with capital costs of more than $ 2 B. A Why Geneva Web
page credits the proximity of CERN to making Geneva a research hub: “Many of the no fewer than 44 Nobel prizes
awarded to residents of Geneva came as a result of the presence of CERN in the city” (see
http://www.geneva.ch/f/lhc.htm). The presence of prize winning immigrants is also evident in our table 1A and 1B.

  Established in 1947 on Long Island, Upton, New York, Brookhaven is a multi-program national laboratory,
operated by Brookhaven Science Associates for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Six Nobel prizes have been
awarded for discoveries made at the laboratory. Brookhaven has a staff of approximately 3,000 scientists, engineers,
technicians and support staff, and over 4,000 guest researchers annually (see http://www.bnl.gov/world/ ).
6
  Network externalities refer to the effects of other users on an individual user of a service. Positive network
externalities exist if the benefits are an increasing function of the number of other users. For example, a network
connecting n scholars entails potential 0.5n(n-1) pair interactions. If the productivity of the network depends
linearly on pair interactions, doubling the network would almost quadruple its productivity. This effect is further
                                                           6

double the efficacy of research. Further magnification of these effects occurs when scholars are
mobile; this implies that research centers located in countries that are friendlier to immigrants are
attractors of talent, and end up as key research hubs. Conversely, research hubs may be destroyed
rapidly if tolerance towards immigrants diminishes, or if calamities reduce the resources
available to basic research, as has been vividly illustrated in the first half of the twentieth
century.
         Here, we focus on the degree to which macroeconomic variables, interacting with
historical events, explain the cross-country distribution of basic research, quantified by the
countries’ share of Nobel and other major scientific prizes. We concentrated on countries that
have reached the threshold level of development necessary for meaningful investment in basic
research. We refrained from modeling the micro details of the network effects associated with
scientific research. We considered a stylistic model, where possible scale effects might imply that
the arrival rate of scientific contributions depends in a non-linear manner on human capital. In
short, we assume the stock of human capital changes with a simple accumulation rule, where a
fraction of the real GDP is invested in forming future human capital.
         We sketched the following model for prizes:
Notation
φi,t = number of major contributions occurring in country i during time t that may qualify for a
prize in a given discipline, scaled by the importance of the contribution.
φin,t − k = contributions credited to country i dating to period t-k, net of the contributions that

already won prizes (i.e., φin,t − k is obtained by adjusting φi ,t − k downward by the contributions that

were already rewarded).
         T
Φ i ,t = ∑ φin,t − k dt − k = stock of contributions credited to country i that may qualify for a prize at
        k =0

time t (net of contributions that were already awarded prizes). The stock was obtained by
applying the discount factor d k to contributions going back T years ago. T, the backward-looking




magnified if, as is frequently the case, basic experimental research needs a sizable crew of scholars, well above pair
interactions.

  Wuchty et al. (2007) document the increasing importance of teams in generating scientific peer-reviewed research
and patents.
                                                                      7


discounting horizon, was bounded by scholars’ life expectancies, and d k was determined by the

speed of diffusion of new contributions, apparently characterized by an inverted U shape.
           Assuming that the size of the prizes that won awards was small, relative to the pool of
major new contributions, and that all contributions were entered identically, winning the prize
was akin to sampling with replacement. Hence, the outcome of the Nobel contest could be
approximated by generalized Bernoulli trials, with their convenient Gaussian properties.
           Subject to all these assumptions, the probability of winning a prize at time t by country i
in a given discipline, si ,t , was approximated by

                                 Φ i ,t
           (1)       si ,t =   N

where N is the number of countries engaging in active basic research. We parameterized the
flows of new contributions of country i as a proportion ki of the human capital index, [H i ,t ] ;
                                                                                                                  β




           (2)       φi ,t = ki [H i ,t ]β ,


where β > 0 captures any scale effects. More generally, complementarities between local and
global knowledge were captured by a CES aggregator:



                                 {                                }
                                                                β
                     φi ,t = ki ai [H i ,t ]γ + (1 − ai )[H t ]
                                                              γ γ
           (2’)


where H t denotes the foreign human capital (i.e., the sum of the human capital of all other
countries), and 1-a measures the externality associated with research attributed to foreign human
capital (a = 1 denotes the case of no externality as in equation 2). The human capital of country i
follows a simple accumulation rule: a fraction ci ,t the real GDP is invested into forming future

human capital;8 fraction δ i,t depreciates, due to aging, wars, or natural disasters.


8
    If basic research is “luxury activity,” ci , t would increase with the GDP per Capita. In these circumstances, our
model predicts that the prize share of a country would depend positively on lagged GDP, and negatively on lagged
population.
                                                                          8



        (3)      H i ,t = (1 − δ i ,t ) H i ,t −1 + ci ,tYi ,t −1 .


To illustrate the model, we first considered the case where periods were set to cover a generation
of scientists, e.g. 25 years, such that δ i ,t = 1 (for all i and t); hence


        (3’)     H i ,t = ci ,tYi ,t −1


        We aggregated all the countries doing frontier research into 2 blocks, e.g. the United
States and AOC, and assume that the AOC block was composed of n symmetric countries. These
assumptions allowed us to solve the prize share of the United States as a function of the lagged
real U.S. GDP relative to all other countries GDP, denoted by Γ (i.e. Γ = YUS , −1 / YAOC , −1 ).

Assuming identical productivity structure across countries (i.e. both blocks have the same k, c,
and a), we can infer that:


                                                                              β

        (4)      sUS   =
                                           {aΓ + (1 − a)}        γ            γ
                                                  β                                 β
                         {aΓ + (1 − a)} + n{a(1/ n) + (1 − a)(Γ + (n − 1) / n) }
                                γ                 γ                   γ           γ γ




A useful benchmark is the case where a = 1, corresponding to the absence of the global human
capital externality:


                              Γβ
        (4’)     sUS =
                          Γ β + n1− β


        Figure 3a plots the U.S. share of the prizes predicted by our model as a function of the
relative GDP share of the U.S./AOC. The bold curve corresponds to the benchmark case of two
country groups — the United States and a uniform AOC (n = 1), the absence of foreign human
capital externality (a = 1), and significant scale effects ( β = 2 ). The solid curve to the left of the
bold curve modifies the benchmark by considering the case where AOC are composed of two
                                                             9

symmetric countries (n = 2; a =1). Note that a more fractured composition of AOC reduces the
research effectiveness there, thereby increasing the U.S. prize share. The dotted curve modifies
the benchmark by allowing modest human capital externality (n = 1, a = 0.95). The latter
increases the share of the smaller block at the expense of the larger block. Figure 3b plots the
same curves in the absence of returns to scale in research ( β = 1 ). Removing scale effects
considerably mitigates the prize share of the larger block (thus increasing the share of the smaller
block). It also implies simple additivity of the countries comprising the block of AOC, and
eliminates the inflection point.
           The presence of scale effects implies that the association between the relative GDP shares
and the prize share of the United States resembles a logistic curve. In fact, (4’) demonstrates that
for relatively small countries, the initial effect of higher GDP share on the prize share is nil:
dsUS / d Γ|Γ=0 = 0 for β > 1 . As the GDP share grows further, it increases the prize share at an

accelerating rate, reflecting the growing impact of scale effects. This acceleration reaches its
                                                                ~
                                                                                         [   ]
                                                                                            1/ β
peak and the inflection point when the U.S. relative GDP equals Γ = n1− β ( β − 1) /( β + 1) .
           From then on, further increase of the GDP share increase the prize share at diminishing
rates.9 It also follows that with greater scale effects, a higher threshold of relative GDP is needed
in order to reach the take-off range associated with the accelerating increase in prize share. Once
this range has been reached, the take-off is faster. This result is illustrated in figure 4a, which
describes the case where the scale effect is magnified from 2 (the bold curve) to 4 (the solid
curve) — the curves are drawn for the cases where AOC is composed of a unique country.
Figure 4b replicates this for instances when the AOC is fractured into two symmetric countries.
As one may expect, it demonstrates that the large country (the United States) takes off at a lower
relative share.
           Figure 5 plots the U.S. Nobel shares / lagged U.S. share of World GDP during the
twentieth century with the corresponding shares obtained from a simulated version of the stylistic
model. While the model captures the first part of the take-off, it underestimates the speed at
which the United States reaches the mature stage. Our empirical work suggests that some of the


                                                                    β Γ β −1n1− β

    These results follow from the observations that dsUS / d Γ =                     ; and
                                                                   [Γ β + n1− β ]2
sign [d 2 sUS / d Γ 2 ] = sign [( β − 1)n1− β − ( β + 1)Γ β ] .

fast take-off of the United States may be accounted for by the effects of World War II, thus
disrupting research networks in favor of the United States.10


The above model offers several predictions, some of which are summarized below:
     •   The GDP of a country relative to the GDP of other countries engaging in basic research is
         an important explanatory variable of that country’s share of prizes.
     •   Scale effects imply that above a certain threshold, there is a take-off range, where the
         prize share increases at an accelerating rate with the relative GDP share of a country, until
         it reaches maturity stage.
     •   In the presence of scale effects, a more fractured AOC block reduces the relative GDP
         needed to induce a prize-share take-off.
     •   Greater fluidity of the flow of information and scholars across countries (possibly due to
         the proliferation of IT technology and the drop of airfares) increases the positive
         externality associated with foreign human capital, thereby mitigating the advantages
         enjoyed by the large block — advantages induced by scale effects.


2.       Data
         Our data were generally taken from two sources: First, data on prizes were obtained from
the official websites of the respective prizes; when the relevant biographical data were not
available on the prize’s website, we obtained additional information from other on-line sources.
All the macroeconomic data were taken from the OECD’s The World Economy: Historical
Statistics CD-ROM, based on data compiled by Maddison (2003).
         For the Nobel Prizes, we noted the country in which each recipient resided at the time of
the award. We also recorded the country location and the decade in which the research for which
the award was given was conducted — these data were obtained by reading the narrative
biographical description of each awardee. In case no description was provided (as for some of the
early Nobel awards) we obtained the data from other sources. Our sample covers 509 Nobel
Prizes awarded in chemistry, medicine and physics from 1901 to 2005. We did not record the


10
  Other obvious shortcomings of this paper are that our simulation assumes that the key parameters (the scale
effects, number of countries engaged in basic research, etc.) have been constant throughout the twentieth century,
and that we imposed an assumption of equal productivity for all the relevant countries.
                                                          11

economics, peace and literature awards.11 We recorded the same variables for the following
prizes: the Wolf Prize in agriculture, chemistry, mathematics, medicine and physics (199 prizes
awarded annually since 1978); the Kyoto Prize in advanced technology and basic sciences (47
prizes awarded annually since 1985); and the Fields Medal in mathematics (44 prizes awarded
every four years since 1936).


         We constructed two separate panel data sets. The first, dubbed award-time data set,
includes five-year totals for prizes awarded, for each country in five-year segments
(observations). In this data set, each prize is recorded for the year in which it was awarded and
the location of the researcher/s at the time of the award. In the second data set, dubbed research-
time set, we compiled a panel of observations for each country in each decade in which each
prize was recorded for the time and place when the most important awarded research was done.
The reason for using decades in the research time versus five-year segments in the award time is
that each award was given at a precise time; however, the award recognizes research that was
conducted over a prolonged gestation period, often around a decade long. Consequently, the data
did not make it possible for us to identify the exact year of the research for which the prize is
presented, only the decade and place of that research. Hence, a prize awarded for research done
in Germany, but awarded to a scientist who was residing in the UK 20 years later, at the time of
the award, will be counted for the UK for the five-year data set (award-time). For the ten-year
data set, the prize would be credited to Germany, two decades before the award.12
         Since for many of the smaller countries, very few awards have been given over the past
century, we recorded these data in ten separate country groups. We aggregated the data according
to cultural and geographical affinity: i.e. the United States; the United Kingdom; Germany;
France; Scandinavia; other European countries; Australia and Canada; Japan; the USSR (and




11
   A few papers have looked at the same Nobel data from a microperspective (without aggregation) in research
examining the life-cycle characteristics of innovation. See, in particular, Jones (2005) and Weinberg and Galenson
(2005).
12
   This implies that with our ten-year data set, we are controlling for the effect of immigration (see discussion on the
importance of immigration in the introduction to this paper). Since results for the two data sets are very similar, we
argue that while immigration is important, it cannot be the only reason for the U.S. scale effect we observed.

later Russia); and all other countries (including all countries that received at least one prize).13
Correlations between the different prize measures are provided in appendix B.
        For the macroeconomic data, we used GDP (in constant 1990 international dollars), and
population measures taken from Maddison (2003). These data are averaged over five and ten
years for the corresponding data panels. To measure World War I and World War II casualties,
we obtained data on war deaths (both civilian and military) and divided those by the population
in each country.14 Appendix B details the data sources and provides descriptive statistics.


3.      Empirical results
        We constructed an empirical model that is based on equation (4). Since we were
interested in the amount of generated basic research, as proxied by the amount of prizes won, we
stipulated a benchmark model in which the share of each country’s prizes (out of the total global
amount) depends on a country’s income (GDP) and its population.15 Since GDP per capita might
be the relevant income measure to approximate the amount of resources available for domestic
R&D investment, the stipulated hypothesis was that the population variable has a negative
coefficient.
        Since the construction of the LHS variable (prize share) is censored on the left by zero,
we estimate a standard Tobit, estimated by maximum likelihood. The model we estimated was
the following:
                      ⎧        N it     Y          Y                                     ⎫
                  Pit ⎪Tit = α      + β1 it + β 2 [ it ]2 + γ Dit + ε it   if   Tit > 0 ⎪
        (5)          =⎨        NW       YW         YW                                    ⎬
                  PW ⎪
                      ⎩                                        0           if   Tit ≤ 0 ⎪⎭

where Pit ; N it ; Yit ; PW ; NW ; YW are the total prizes (P) credited to research done in country i during
period t (t is typically two decades earlier than the time the prize was awarded), the population
(N) and gross domestic product (Y) for country i and time t, or for the total world (W) where the
world is defined as all countries that have won prizes. In a number of specifications we also

   Our sample covers 509 Nobel prizes awarded in chemistry, medicine and physics during 1901-2005. The last, the
all other countries, group received only 9 Nobel Prizes, less than 2% of the total awarded. This observation is
consistent with the presence of the strong scale effects discussed above.
14
   The WWI casualties are attributed to 1916-1920, or 1911-1920 in the cases of the five- and ten-year data sets,
respectively.
15
   The empirical model we employed is similar to that implemented by Bernard and Busse (2004) for predicting
Olympics medal counts.
                                                          13


included binary variables ( Dit ) or a measure of casualties from the world wars per country panel

observation. For the error term, we assumed ε it ~ N [0, σ 2 ] .
         In table 2, we reported the results of our benchmark specification, examining the impact
of GDP and population on the incidence of prizes. Table 2A employs the ten-year research-time
panel. We also estimated the same specifications for the five-year award-time panel; because of
the observed lag between research and award, in table 2B, we lag the independent variables by
four lags (20 years) for this data set. We confirmed the need to lag the independent
macrovariables by estimating specifications for different lag structures and observing that the
optimal lag is indeed 20 years.16
         Results in columns 1–3 (tables 2A and 2B) demonstrate that the incidence of Nobel
winnings is clearly positively associated with GDP and negatively associated with population
(after controlling for GDP). Results in columns 4–6 (tables 2A and 2B) confirm the same
associations with a different dependent variable: the total number of prizes (Nobel, Fields, Kyoto
and Wolf) awarded for each country-period as a share of the total awards for that period.
         In table 3, we presented the complete specifications examining the importance of scale
effects. Since results were qualitatively the same across the research- and the award-time data
sets when we used the proper lags on the conditioning variable, we then discussed the results,
using the ten-year research-time panel.17 In column 1, table 3A, we added the square of GDP to
our benchmark specification. The coefficient is statistically significant at the 99% confidence
level, suggesting a clear incidence of scale effects.18 In column 2, we employed, instead, binary
variables that examine whether Germany before World War I, and the United States after World
War II are unique in their acquisition of prizes. Since we speculated there might be a home-team
bias — at least for the Nobel Prize — we included a binary variable for Scandinavia. Pre-World
War I Germany and post-World War II United States (with their coefficients significant at the




16
   We estimated the model with a variety of lag structures and in all cases the only coefficient that came out
significant was the (t-4) one — implying a lag of two decades. Results are available upon request.
17
   We also report the results in the award-time panel.
18
   This finding contrasts with a recent work, Rose (2006), which failed to find scale effects in “the level of income,
inflation, material well-being, health, education, the quality of a country’s institutions, heterogeneity, and a number
of different international indices and rankings.”
                                                        14

1% level) are clearly unique cases. We found no evidence, however, of home-team bias and
discarded this variable in all subsequent estimations.19
        In column 3 (table 3A) we added the dummy for the post-World War II United States to
the (GDP)2 variable. Since the coefficient on (GDP)2 is not significant once the U.S. post-World
War II dummy is included, we concluded that the dynamic scale effects we obtained are
completely driven by the impact of the U.S. presence in this competition. This is also evidenced
by the fact that our fit measures did not improve when (GDP)2 was included in the specification
(compare columns 2 and 3 in table 3A). These results carried through once we used the country
share of total prizes (instead of the country share in Nobel Prizes) as our dependent variable in
columns 4–6 of table 3A.
        Since we observed an increase in the share of prizes going to previously peripheral
countries in the last two decades, we postulated that it was possible that the structure of the
relationships we identified had recently changed. In table 4, column 1, we ran the same
specification as in table 3B, column 1, but included additional interactions of all the coefficients
with a 1975–2004 binary indicator. We found evidence of a change in the magnitude of the post-
1975 coefficients. The GDP variable seemed to have a smaller correlation with prize shares in
the latter period, while the scale effect appeared to matter more than in the pre-1975 period. The
importance of the relative population size also declined.20
        Another interesting question was whether we would be able to identify scale effects in
non-leading countries as well. In table 4, column 2, we reran the specification in table 3B,
column 1, but excluded the U.S. observations from our data set. Interestingly, the GDP2 variable
was no longer significant; this confirms our previous result that the scale effect we observed was
apparently captured entirely by the leader.
        We also investigated whether our results were driven by the destruction World War II
wrought on continental Europe, and not by the U.S.-dominated scale effects we had observed.
We found that the only significant effect could be found for a lag of three decades — i.e. deaths
in the war negatively impact the viability of basic research about 30 years after the fact. This
19
   For the Kyoto prize, four awards (out of 46) were given to Japanese nationals, while for the Wolf eleven awards
went to Israeli citizens (out of 199). In both cases, this appears to be somewhat more than was predicted by our
empirical model (especially for the Wolf), but identification of a statistically robust finding of home bias was not
possible in the aggregate data sets. The Fields Medal is awarded by an international organization (the International
Mathematical Union) so the question of a home bias becomes largely mute. The Field Medal offices are located at
the University of Toronto, but the medal was never given to a Canadian.

result is not very robust, however; we find that the effect could be accounted for by non-linear
changes in incomes or just by the rising post-war dominance of the United States. We concluded,
not unlike Davis and Weinstein (2002 and 2004), that the destruction did not have a long-term
statistically observable effect on the production of basic research. These results are presented in
table D in the appendix.


       Figure 6a reports the Nobel Prize shares of the United States in two distinct ways. The
shaded curve, award time, reports the average Nobel share awarded to U.S. residents per decade
in the twentieth century (it is obtained from the five-year panel described in the data section).
The solid curve, i.e. real research time, reports the research share of the United States, during the
actual decade of research, between the 1880s and the1970s, which was later credited with the
Nobel Prize (it was obtained from the ten-year panel described in the data section). The
difference between the two curves reflects the delay between the actual research, with an average
of two decades, and the impact of scholars’ mobility. The solid curve indicates that the U.S. basic
research take-off, measured by actual research done in real research time, started in the 1920s
and 1930s, and reached maturity stage between the 1940s and 1970s. Comparison of these two
curves suggests that the first stage of the U.S. take-off occurred prior to the immigration of talent
brought about by World War II. This immigration contributed to the speed and intensity of U.S.
take-off. Applying a similar methodology, we reported the Nobel Prizes shares for Germany in
figure 7b. It vividly shows the basic research leadership status of Germany from the 1890s to the
1920s — a status abruptly lost in the 1930s. Comparison of the two curves in figure 6b reveals
that the bulk of the actual basic research done in Germany during the 1920s was credited to other
countries, as is suggested by the immigration patterns summarized in table 1. The 1930s was the
watershed decade, when the United States emerged as the undisputed basic research leader.


4.     Concluding remarks
       Our empirical analysis confirms the importance of lagged relative GDP in accounting for
prize shares, and the presence of a winner-takes-all scale effect. The relative GDP variable
accounts for the prize shares of the non-leading countries, yet it falls short of accounting for the
scale effects impacting the leading country. Intriguing events dominating the patterns of basic
research over the last hundred years are the leadership role of Germany during the first two
                                                      16

decades of the twentieth century, and the rapid U.S. take-off in the 1930s, which solidified the
U.S. basic research leadership position shortly thereafter.
        We close this paper with a number of concluding remarks and a discussion of some issues
left open for future research. This paper investigated the process of producing basic research.
We did not examine the link between successful basic research, private investment, the corporate
sector’s ability to appropriate results, and other possible social benefits. After all, basic research
is rarely the end target and the economic literature has suggested a number of alternative desired
goals for research. These issues have been examined before, albeit without producing any
emerging consensus (for a recent survey, see Salter and Martin, 2001). The answers to some of
these questions could be related to our own research on the preliminary stages of basic research,
since one expects that it would be easier to fund basic research in countries with deeper spillover
from basic research to private (or public) rents.
        The interplay between the private and the public sectors in promoting basic research
deserves more investigation. The basic research take-off of the United States happened during
the first third of the twentieth century, when the involvement of public funding in basic research
was limited. The solidification of the role of the United States as a hub of basic research
happened later, at a time of greater involvement of the public sector in funding and directing of
basic research. This observation is validated in figure 7, where the solid curve depicts the
constant dollar involvement of the U.S. government in funding basic research by sectors.21
Obtaining more detailed information about private vs. public funding of basic research in various
countries could potentially enable researchers to identify the role of public funding in the take-off
process.
     Besides public vs. private funding, other factors might also lead to differing magnitudes of
the scale effects in basic research across countries and time. In-depth studies of the role of
research networks, possibly using empirical methodologies similar to the Erdös number project,
might shed some light on these questions.
        The recent diffusion of information technology has led to cheaper means of
communication, and reduced the coordination costs of conducting joint research across


21
  The point is exemplified by the growing role of NSF, NIH, and NASA, and is reinforced by the time lag between
the actual research and the timing of awards. The NSF was established by the National Science Foundation Act of
1950. The NIH emerged out of the Laboratory of Hygiene, and was reorganized in 1930 by the Ransdell Act into the
National Institutes of Health. NASA was established in 1958.
                                                       17

geographical distance. The presence of these new technologies increases the spillovers from
foreign to domestic research, as well as the possibility of greater cross-country collaboration.
Whether the telecommunication revolution has indeed changed the calculus of basic research
remains an open question for future research.
        In conclusion, we would like to emphasize the inability of this kind of econometric
inference to prove causality, and the limited predictive ability of correlations without the
opportunity of conducting controlled experiments — see Lucas’s (1976) critique of econometric
policy evaluation. This is especially true in circumstances such as in our study, which dealt with
the black box process associated with creativity. An obvious implication of our study is that, in
the presence of scale effects, a critical size is a necessary condition for basic research take-off.
While the evidence in this paper is consistent with the growing significance of countries that used
to be at the periphery of global research, it is a mistake to equate economic take-off with basic
research take-off, as it may confuse necessary and sufficient conditions. A loose interpretation of
the U.S. experience is that the growing allegiance of public and private resources helped solidify
and speed up basic research take-off. Yet, a growing body of economic research cautions us that
the quality of public investment is determined by the overall quality of governance, transparency,
contestability, and openness of the allocation process. These factors are essential to prevent the
misuse of public funds as a means of redistributing political rents.22 One expects the same to
apply to the evaluation of the role of public funds in enhancing basic research. Further
investigation of all these issues is needed in order to provide us with better policy guidelines.

(2001) concluded that “ . . . corruption lowers the quality of public investment, and this poor quality public
investment is associated with lower private investment.”

Note: Dependent variable is the prize share (in %) per country-decade observation. The model is
estimated with a Tobit methodology. T-statistics in parentheses; significance levels are 10% *, 5%
** and 1% ***. σ is the estimated standard deviation of the error term. The decomposition fit
measure is a goodness-of-fit measure for non-linear models (for details, see Greene, 2002).

            U.S. prize share and the relative U.S./AOC GDP, no scale effects ( β = 1 ).
The bold curve corresponds to the base case: the absence of externalities associated with foreign human capital,
where the AOC block is composed of one country ( a    = 1; n = 1 ). The solid curve modifies the base case by
assuming that the AOC block is composed of two symmetric countries ( a = 1; n = 2 ). The dotted curve modifies
                                                       25

the base case by assuming modest externality where foreign human capital increases the efficacy of domestic human
capital ( a   = 0.95; n = 1 ).

                 U.S. prize share and the relative U.S./AOC GDP, varying scale effects
The bold curve corresponds to the base case of scale effect ( β = 2 ), and no externality associated
with foreign human capital (a = 1). The dotted curve corresponds to magnified scale
effects, β = 4 , a = 1. The top panel assumes symmetry, where the AOC is, like the United
States, composed on one country. The lower panel assumed fractured AOC, composed of two
symmetric countries.

 measure
Note: Dependent variable is the prize share (in %) per country-decade observation. The model is estimated with
a Tobit methodology. T-statistics in parentheses; significance levels are 10% *, 5% ** and 1%***. σ is the
estimated standard deviation of the error term. The decomposition fit measure is a goodness-of-fit measure for
non-linear models (for details see Greene, 2002).
