We review the experimental and quasi-experimental research evidence on the causal relationship between
college costs and educational attainment, with a particular focus on low-income populations. The weight
of the evidence indicates that reducing college costs can increase college entry and persistence. Simple
and transparent programs appear to be most effective. Programs that link money to incentives and/or
the takeup of academic support services appear to be particularly effective.

I. Introduction

        College-going has risen substantially over the past forty years. In 1968, 36 percent of 23-

year-olds had gone to college, while by 2005, that figure had grown to 58 percent.1 But these

gains have been uneven. African-Americans are about half as likely as non-Hispanic whites

to earn a bachelor’s degree (19 percent vs. 37 percent) and Hispanics less than one-third

as likely (11 percent).2 Females are about twelve percentage points more likely to have attended

college by age 23 (64 versus 52 percent), and about seven percentage points more likely to have

completed a BA (32 versus 25 percent.)

        Some of these differences trace back to performance gaps in elementary school

and high school. But even among those who do well on achievement tests,

socioeconomic inequalities remain: 74 percent of high-scorers who grew up in upper-

income families complete college, compared to only 29 percent of those who grew up in

low-income families (College Board, 2005).

        While thirty years ago a high school degree was sufficient for financial security, it is now

a college degree that is the key to a middle-class lifestyle. Since the 1970s, high school dropouts

and graduates have lost ground, with their real earnings dropping substantially (Figure 1, from

College Board, 2005). Typical earnings for a full-time, male high school graduate in 1972 were

$45,000 (in constant 2003 dollars). That figure had dropped by a third ($30,000) by 2005.3 By

contrast, real earnings for the college-educated have held steady; among women, they have risen.

        These two sets of trends - steady earnings for those with a college education, plunging

earnings for those without - mean that college is increasingly important to financial well-being.

In 1972, men with a bachelor’s degree typically earned 22 percent more than those with a high

school degree. By 2003, this return had nearly tripled, to 60 percent.

       In light of the rising importance of a college degree, policymakers have focused on

increasing college enrollment as an important tool for mitigating poverty. This chapter reviews

the evidence on a key tool available to policymakers – reducing college costs. Section II briefly

outlines the policy context; Section III reviews the evidence from experimental and high-quality

quasi-experimental studies of college cost reduction; Section IV discusses the broad lessons

derived from these studies and concludes.



II. Policy context

       Colleges, state and federal government and private organizations spend billions to

subsidize college costs. In this section, we briefly describe the major programs.

       Two federal programs provide the bulk of aid to college students: the Pell Grant and the

Stafford Loan. Pell Grants flow almost exclusively to families with incomes below $40,000

(Stedman, 2003). During the 2004-05 academic year, $13.6 billion in Pell Grants was delivered

to over five million students (College Board, 2005). During the same year, $55 billion in loans

was delivered to undergraduates through the Stafford Loan program.

       States hold down college costs by subsidizing public universities, which in turn charge

lower tuition prices than their private counterparts. The vast majority of students attend public

colleges, so this is an important channel through which government subsidizes college costs. In

addition to charging artificially low prices to all students, states also offer scholarships to

individual students. Most of these are small-scale programs, but beginning in the early 1990s,

more than a dozen states established broad-based merit aid programs. These programs typically



                                                   2
award full tuition and fees at state public universities (or in some cases, an equivalent voucher to

attend a private school) to residents who maintain a minimum high school grade point average.

Many require a grade point average of 3.0, not a particularly high threshold – Dynarski (2004)

calculates that in 1999, 40 percent of high school seniors met this standard.

       In recent years, the federal and state tax codes have also been used as a vehicle for

subsidizing college costs. The Hope and Lifetime Learning tax credits and the deduction for

college tuition and fees help families pay for current college costs. Parents can also claim

children under 24 as dependents if they are enrolled in college. The federal Coverdell Education

Savings Account and the state 529 savings plans help families pay for college in the future by

increasing their after-tax returns on savings. With a total cost of $10.5 billion, these education

tax incentives approach spending on the Pell Grant, historically the cornerstone of federal aid for

college students (College Board, 2005). But, as they are currently configured, these programs

almost exclusively benefit upper income families (Dynarski, 2004; Dynarski and Scott-Clayton,

2006a) and so are not candidate instruments for reducing poverty.

       Foundations and colleges are additional sources of student aid. Programs such as the

Gates Millenium Scholars, the I Have a Dream foundation, and Kalamazoo Promise fully

sponsor college attendance (or “top up” the difference between government grants and estimated

need) for low-income and/or minority students. Although these programs are small in scale

compared to the federal and state aid programs discussed above, they are highly visible and

intended to increase college attendance, and so we will discuss them in the chapter.

       We will not examine the new and widely-discussed scholarship programs of elite colleges

(such as Harvard and Princeton) which offer a free ride for low-income students (Pallais and

Turner, 2007, Avery et al, 2006; Linsenmeier et al 2006; Rothstein and Rouse 2007, van der



                                                  3
Klaauw 2002). Helping low-income students make the leap from high school into any college is

the critical task if the goal is poverty reduction, and these programs do not serve this function.

The low-income student who takes up Princeton’s offer of a free ride would likely have gone to

Harvard (or Berkeley) had Princeton not been so generous. Convincing more nonwhite and low-

income students to attend Princeton instead of Berkeley may serve important social goals, such

as diversifying our political leadership (Bok and Bowen, 2000), but poverty reduction is not

among them.

          Most evaluations of the programs we have mentioned focus on the enrollment margin.

However, while enrollment has risen substantially over the past forty years, degree receipt has

barely budged (Turner, 2006). Thus retention and graduation of college enrollees has also

become an important policy issue. We review evidence from several recent experimental

evaluations that provide scholarships and services to existing college enrollees. These programs

are of particular interest since they focus on marginal students, for whom retention rates are

lowest.



III. Evidence

          Economic theory (and common sense) predicts that lowering the price of college will

increase attendance. While the theoretical prediction is clear, students’ marginal responsiveness

to additional dollars of aid is an empirical question. Answering this question is a challenge, since

eligibility for subsidies is certainly not random and is likely correlated with unobserved

determinants of schooling. As a result, estimates based on the cross-sectional correlation of aid

with schooling are subject to multiple sources of bias.




                                                  4
           A long empirical literature examines the effect of college costs on schooling decisions.

Leslie and Brinkman (1988) review more than seventy of these studies.4 With few exceptions,

discussed below, this long literature suffers from a key limitation: the response of schooling to

price is poorly identified. That is, the variation in schooling prices used to estimate the parameter

of interest is likely to be correlated with the unobserved determinants of schooling.


           More formally, the relationship between financial aid and schooling decisions can be

expressed with the following equation:


(1)         Si = α + β Aidi + ε i


Here, Si is some measure of an individual’s schooling, such as college attendance or completed

years of college, Aidi is the amount of student aid (expressed in dollars) for which an individual

is eligible, and the error term ε i represents the unobserved determinants of schooling. If aid is

uncorrelated with ε i , then β can be interpreted as the effect of an additional dollar of aid on

college attendance or completed education.


           If financial aid is randomly assigned in an experimental setting, Aidi is uncorrelated with

ε i . In nearly all nonexperimental studies, however, aid is offered to students on the basis of

characteristics that independently affect the probability of college attendance. For example, the

federal government uses the Pell Grant to increase the college attendance of low-income youth.

If such students are relatively unlikely to attend college, perhaps because of low levels of

parental education or poor secondary schooling, then estimates of β based on this source of

variation in aid will be biased downward. Conversely, since many colleges use merit

4
    Heller (1997) updates this review with studies done after Leslie and Brinkman (1988.)

                                                           5
scholarships to attract high-achieving students, β could be biased upward if such scholarships

are included in the analysis.


          One can attempt to correct for this bias by controlling for observed determinants of

schooling (such as parental income or academic achievement) in a vector of regressors X i :


(2)       Si = α + β Aidi + δ X i + ε i


If X i is sufficiently rich that it captures all other sources of variation in individual schooling

decisions and schooling costs, then β will be unbiased. However, under plausible conditions this

approach will fail, for two reasons:


      •   Complete data on relevant characteristics is rarely available. For example, parental

          wealth affects schooling decisions, both directly and through eligibility for aid, but

          comprehensive measures of parental (and extended family) wealth are rarely present in

          survey data, especially among adults who have completed their education.


      •   Even if all relevant variables are available, their role in the schooling decision may not be

          properly modeled. Theory provides little guidance as to which attributes should be held

          constant in estimating Equation (2). This is particularly problematic because point

          estimates in this literature are often quite fragile, even changing sign with small changes

          in specification. As a practical example, the effect of income on Pell Grant eligibility is

          highly nonlinear, and unless the functional form of the underlying relationship between

          income and schooling is perfectly specified, the resulting estimate will be biased.




                                                    6
B. Quasi-experimental studies

We now discuss analyses of natural (or quasi-) experiments, in which a discrete shift in aid

policy affects one group of individuals but not others. Beginning with Hansen (1983), who

examined the introduction of the Pell Grant in the early 1970s, a small but growing number of

studies has used this approach to estimate the effect of schooling costs on college-going. We

summarize the main results of these studies in Table I.


Federal Programs


       Most of these studies examine the effect of grant aid. Studies which examine the Pell

Grant, currently the largest source of federal grant aid, produce mixed results: Hansen (1983) and

Kane (1995) found no effect of the introduction of the Pell on the college enrollment rate of low-

income recent high school graduates. Seftor and Turner (2002) use a differences-in-differences

framework to examine the effect of changing Pell Grant eligibility rules, and find that “non-

traditional” students are about 4 percentage points more likely to attend college once they are

considered eligible. Bettinger (2004) uses a regression-discontinuity approach to look at the

effect of the Pell Grant on persistence using a sample of college students; his estimates are

extremely sensitive to specification.


       Veterans’ educational benefits have historically been one of the largest sources of grant

aid for college in the US. Since children from poor families are more likely than others to enroll

in the military, programs that increase veterans’ education have the potential to reduce poverty.

Multiple studies of the post-World-War-II GI Bills (Angrist, 1993; Stanley, 2003; Turner and

Bound, 2003; Bound and Turner, 2003) have found these benefits to have raised schooling levels

substantially.


                                                 7
       Evaluating another federal program, Dynarski (2003) concludes that an additional $1000

in aid increases college attendance by about four percentage points. She examines the

elimination of the Social Security student benefit program, which paid the college costs of the

children of deceased, disabled or retired Social Security beneficiaries. Eligible students were

disproportionately poor, nonwhite and from single-parent families, so these estimates are quite

relevant. Dynarski uses the death of a parent during a person’s childhood as a proxy for Social

Security beneficiary status, and finds that college attendance of the affected group dropped by

more than a third, and schooling by two-thirds of a year.


       While loans are the dominant form of federal aid today, we unfortunately know little

about how they affect behavior. Reyes (1995) examines the effect of relative changes in loan

eligibility across income groups in the early eighties, and concludes that loan access increases

attendance and completed schooling. Dynarski (2005) addresses this question using variation in

loan eligibility induced by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, which removed home

equity from the set of assets “taxed” by the federal aid formula. She finds a small effect of loan

eligibility on college attendance and a larger effect on the choice of college.


State Programs


       Subsidized public tuitions, which vary considerably by state, are one of the largest

sources of education subsidies. Estimates based on cross-sectional variation in tuition may be

biased, since states with a preference for education may have both low tuition prices and high

college attendance rates. The solution of Kane (1995) is to use state fixed effects; his identifying

assumption is that within-state changes in tuition prices are uncorrelated with changes in a state’s




                                                  8
taste for college. He concludes that a $1,000 drop in public tuition produces about a four

percentage point increase in college attendance rates of recent high school graduates.


        Several studies have used the introduction of state merit scholarship programs as a source

of variation in schooling costs. Dynarski (2000) and Cornwell, Mustard and Sridhar (2006)

conclude that the Georgia HOPE scholarship increase college attendance by 4-6 percentage

points per $1000 in grant aid. Dynarski (2004) finds that a dozen states' scholarship programs

have had similar, but slightly smaller effects, and that their positive effects on college attendance

are greater for nonwhites. Kane (2003) uses a regression discontinuity approach to examine the

CalGrant, and finds substantial impacts on college entry for students who had already applied for

financial aid. Abraham and Clark (2006) and Kane (2007) evaluate the DC Tuition Assistance

Grant program, which allowed DC residents to pay in-state tuition at public schools across the

country. They find that the fraction of DC residents that attended Maryland and Virginia schools

more than doubled, and estimate an impact on overall enrollment of 3-4 percentage points per

$1000 of effective tuition reduction. Goodman (2008) examines a program in Massachusetts that

assigns aid on the basis of a standardized test score, and finds that the scholarship induced 6

percent of winners to switch from private to public 4-year colleges. He also finds that low-

income (and low test-score) students are more price sensitive. However, there was no impact on

overall enrollment.


        Dynarski (2008) finds that the Georgia and Arkansas merit scholarship programs have

also increased degree completion, by around 3-4 percentage points. She estimates that the

scholarships increases persistence by 5-11 percent for those who would have entered college

anyway. This suggests that the positive effect of lower cost on retention outweighs any negative

effect of enrolling marginally weaker students who are less likely to persist.

                                                  9
        Finally, a recent paper by Scott-Clayton (2009) examines the impact of the PROMISE

scholarship, a merit aid program in West Virginia. The PROMISE scholarship was similar to

other state merit programs in its initial eligibility requirements and the amount of aid it offered.

But it was unique in requiring students to complete at least thirty credits per year in order to keep

their scholarships, a rate which would put them on track to graduate in four years. She finds that

PROMISE increased eventual graduation rates by almost 4 percentage points, while the

percentage of students graduating on time increased by about 7 percentage points from a baseline

of just 27 percent. The impacts on year-by-year credit completion were concentrated around the

annual renewal threshold in the freshman through junior years, but disappeared in the senior year

when students were still receiving their scholarships but no longer faced any renewal

requirements (scholarships could not be renewed for a fifth year in any case). Scott-Clayton'

concludes that incentives are a powerful play are at least as important as cost reduction suggests

that a combination of cost reduction and performance incentives may have a greater impact than

financial aid alone.




Other Programs


       DesJardins and McCall (2007) study the impact of the Gates Millenium Scholarship

(GMS) using a regression discontinuity design. GMS “tops up” the difference between need-

based grants and unmet financial need for eligible minority applicants. Scholars are selected on

the basis of high school record and a scored application process, which generates discontinuous

changes in the probability of receiving an award. Although the evaluation is still ongoing, they




                                                 10
find weak impacts on overall retention but strong evidence of decreased loan debt and work

hours.


         Table 1 summarizes the findings from the quasi-experimental studies discussed above.

The studies in this table are those which we consider as estimating causal impacts of the effect of

schooling costs on schooling decisions. Subsidies to post-secondary schooling do appear to

affect schooling decisions. The best estimates suggest that eligibility for $1,000 of subsidy

increases college attendance rates by roughly four percentage points. Aid eligibility also appears

to increase completed schooling and shift students from community colleges toward four-year

schools.


C. Experimental Evaluations

         One straightforward way to assess the causal impact of financial aid on college

enrollment and persistence is to randomly allocate scarce scholarship funds to an eligible

population. Several experimental studies have examined the effect of scholarships when they are

combined with mentoring or other services. A key, unresolved question in these studies is the

extent to which services, and the cost of providing them, are more effective than the

scholarships.

         Most randomized trials in higher education examine the effect of aid or services on

grades, credit accumulation and/or persistence past the first year, conditional on enrollment. The

reasons for this are largely practical – school-based interventions are more administratively

feasible than tracking high school students to their chosen colleges around the country. To our

knowledge, only one randomized trial looks directly at the enrollment margin.




                                                11
Upward Bound

        Upward Bound is a federal and nationwide program that provides comprehensive

precollege services to participants, including supplemental college-preparatory coursework in

math, science, English; tutoring; counseling; and activities such as attendance at museums and

plays. Mathematica Policy Research conducted a randomized trial of Upward Bound from 1992

to 1994, following participants for several years. They found weak impacts of Upward Bound on

performance in high school courses (Myers and Schirm, 1999.) A more recent evaluation finds

no statistically insignificant impact on college enrollment (Myers et al, 2004) though there is

some evidence of substitution from 2 to 4-year colleges.5 There is no impact on total college

credits earned.6 See the paper by Long (2008) in this volume for more detail on the

administration and evaluation of Upward Bound.



Experimental Effects of College Persistence Programs

        About twenty percent of students who enroll at a 4-year college leave within one year.

About forty percent fail to obtain a degree within six years (College Board, 2005.) Attrition is

even higher at non-selective schools, where the majority of students commute from home and

work part- or full-time. Since these students are more weakly attached to their institutions,

policies have focused on creating a stronger connection with the college experience via more

extensive mentoring, counseling, and collaborative “learning communities” (Bloom and Sommo,




5
  The treatment group was 5 to 6 percentage points more likely to have attended a 4-year college and 3 to 5
percentage points less likely to have attended a 2-year college than the control group.
6
  The evaluation does report much larger results for students with low (versus high) “educational expectations.”
Among students who did not expect to earn a bachelor’s degree, the treatment group was about 20 percentage points
more likely to attend a 4-year college than the control group, although the overall enrollment effect was still not
significant. However, since this evaluation does not actually measure degree receipt, this result is difficult to
interpret. Other results by subgroup are available in Myers et al (2004.)

2005). Two randomized trials have evaluated the effect of such programs; we discuss them

below.



Student Achievement and Retention Project

         The Student Achievement and Retention Project was a large-scale randomized trial

launched in 2005 at the urban campus of a major Canadian public university (Angrist, Lang and

Oreopoulos 2009). Participants in the STAR experiment are similar to students at non-selective

universities in the U.S. About eighty percent of the sample lived with their parents and

commuted to school, and the majority planned to work part-time while enrolled. Many of the

students were first- or second-generation immigrants.

         Incoming freshman were randomly assigned to one of four groups. The first was offered

enhanced services, in the form of peer advising and organized study groups. The second was

offered a financial incentive of $5,000 to complete a full course load with a grade point average

of 3.0 or higher (the payment was $1,000 for a GPA of at least 2.3). A third group was offered

both services and a financial incentive, while a fourth group formed a control group and was

offered the college’s typical services.

         Overall, the effect of STAR was moderate. The largest impacts were found for the group

offered both services and a financial incentive. First-year grade point average increased between

0.1 and 0.2 standard deviations, and the combined group was about five percentage points less

likely to be placed on academic probation. Significant effects of STAR were driven entirely by

female participants – there was no effect of the program on males in any group. There was also

no effect of the program for the services or scholarship-only groups.




                                                13
Opening Doors

           Opening Doors is a large-scale randomized trial at six community colleges in four states

run by Manpower Research Development Corporation (MDRC). Preliminary results are

currently available for five of the six sites. The intervention at each site consists of “learning

communities” (in which entering students take blocks of classes together and are offered extra

tutoring); supplementary financial aid; and enhanced student services (extra counseling and

monitoring).

           The first Opening Doors evaluation occurred at Kingsborough Community College in

Brooklyn, NY in the fall of 2003 (Bloom and Sommo, 2005.) The intervention targeted

approximately 750 entering freshman, who were ethnically and racially diverse; many were

recent immigrants that needed training in remedial English. Treatment group members were

place in learning communities of about 25 students each and received textbook vouchers.

           Three semesters after the program at Kingsborough Community College, the treatment

group was 5.6 percentage points more likely to be enrolled in any college (Scrivener et al,

2008.). Treatment group members earned an average of 2.4 more credits and were in school

about 0.1 more semesters. They were more likely to attempt and pass standardized reading and

writing assessments. The effect sizes for these various assessments were around 0.1 standard

deviations, but were closer to 0.2 SDs for students whose initial English skills were worse at

baseline.7

           A second set of Opening Doors demonstrations took place in northern Ohio (Scrivener

and Au, 2007; Scrivener and Pih, 2007.) Students were given regular appointments with an

Opening Doors counselor and given a $150 per semester scholarship that if they attended these

meetings. Results were weak. There was no increase in credits attempted or earned in the initial
7

semester, nor any impact on pass rate or grade point average. However, there was an effect on

retention of 5 to 10 percentage points and a small effect on earned credits.

       Two Opening Doors demonstrations also took place at community colleges in New

Orleans in 2004 (Brock and Ritchburg-Hayes, 2006.) In addition to the learning communities,

the treatment group was offered $1000 per semester for half-time enrollment and a C average.

First year impacts were substantial. Opening Doors participants were about nine percentage

points more likely to be enrolled full-time, and earned on average 1.1 additional credits in the

first semester. They were about twelve percentage points more likely to pass and about seven

percentage points less likely to withdraw from an attempted course. These effects persisted into

the second and third semesters. The treatment group was about eighteen percentage points more

likely to remain enrolled into the second semester and about eleven percentage points more

likely to enroll for a third semester. The pass rate for enrolled courses also remained significantly

higher, and there was some evidence of small grade point average increases as well. The

cumulative effect of the program was a large and statistically significant increase of 3.3 credits

earned, and an average gain of 0.3 semesters worth of enrollment.

       Overall, the results from Opening Doors are very encouraging. While cost estimates were

unavailable in the paper, the financial incentives offered were modest and the cost of providing

services was likely to be relatively low as well (especially to the extent that they were integrated

into the colleges’ existing programs). Opening Doors had effects that were at least as large as the

state merit aid programs reviewed earlier. Still, sample sizes in the evaluations were relatively

small, and caution is warranted until the results can be scaled up and replicated. Further research

is needed on these promising programs.




                                                 15
        Several themes emerge from these experimental evaluations. First, the effect of aid

appears to be greater than that of services. Interventions that offered services alone generally had

weak impacts, whereas aid typically generated positive effects on enrollment and persistence.

Second, aid has a larger impact when combined with services. In the STAR experiment, the only

sustained gains were found in the treatment group that combined aid and services. The impact of

Opening Doors (which combined aid and services) was proportionally larger than quasi-

experimental estimates of aid alone from the studies reviewed in Section III.B.



IV. Discussion


    The effects of the financial aid programs we have discussed appear to depend critically on

form taken by the intervention. Program design matters. In particular, there appears to be an

important tradeoff between targeting and program effectiveness. Highly-targeted programs such

as the Pell focus their dollars on poorer students, but impose substantial paperwork burdens in

order to identify the neediest. If targeted students are deterred by administrative hurdles, these

programs will not work as well as intended. This is consistent with the pattern in Table 1, in

which the Pell and Stafford have small to zero effects while simpler, less-targeted programs have

substantial effects.


        The paperwork requirements of the federal, need-based aid programs are high. For the

typical household, the aid application (the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA)

is longer and more complicated than the federal tax return. The aid process is also highly

uncertain, with definitive information about freshman-year aid not revealed until the spring of

the senior year in high school. (Dynarski and Scott-Clayton, 2006). This process may be

particularly daunting for low-income families. Parents in these families have typically not gone

                                                 16
to college themselves, so cannot draw from their own experiences to help their children. Low-

income high school students have few guidance counselors to guide them through the process.

They are unlikely to have Internet access at home and frequently speak English as a second

language. As a result, need-based aid -- which requires gathering extensive information about

income and expenses -- may have a smaller effect on this population than less-targeted forms of

subsidy with fewer application requirements and lower transaction costs.


       By contrast, Georgia’s HOPE scholarship requires only that high school students

maintain a 3.0 GPA in order to have their tuition and fees paid at any public college in Georgia.

High schools proactively send transcript data to the state in order to identify scholarship winners.

For most students, the HOPE application consists of a half- page of basic biographical

information. High school students are knowledgeable about HOPE. More than seventy percent

of Georgia high-school freshmen surveyed were able to name the program without prompting.

Fifty-nine percent, when asked to list some requirements of HOPE, volunteered that a high

school GPA of 3.0 is necessary (Bugler and Henry, 1998). The compliance costs of the Social

Security student benefit program were also minimal.


       Promising recent evidence on the benefits of simplification comes from a randomized

trial of assisted FAFSA completion conducted in partnership with H&R Block, an accounting

firm that provides tax preparation assistance (Bettinger, Long, Oreopoulos and Sanbonmatsu,

2009). Tax professionals pre-populated the FAFSA with income and asset information and

assisted families with completion and filing of the form. The treatment group was also provided

with an immediate estimate of aid eligibility and information about local postsecondary options

and costs. Early results from the program suggest that assistance increased college enrollment

substantially, both for recent high school graduates and for older, independent students with no

                                                17
college experience (Bettinger, Long, Oreopoulos and Sanbonmatsu 2009). The results suggest

that simplification may be a highly cost-effective way to improve college access. In contrast,

there was no effect for a second treatment group that received only information, with no

assistance. This implies that compliance costs, rather than lack of information, may be the more

important barrier. The results suggest that increases in educational attainment could be achieved

at virtually no cost by making existing aid programs simpler and more transparent


       In sum, the best evidence for effective financial aid on educational attainment comes

from simple, broad-based programs. Given that most students in these programs are

inframarginal, the benefits of simplicity versus targeting are an empirical question. The empirical

evidence suggests that even broad-based programs may pass a social cost-benefit test. Dynarski

(2008) estimates that state merit aid programs in Georgia and Arkansas pass a cost-benefit test if

the return to schooling is between 5 and 9 percent. This is on the low end of instrumental

variable rates of return to schooling, and is well below the rate of return estimated for recent

cohorts (Angrist and Krueger 1991; Kane and Rouse 1995; Oreopoulos 2007.) Thus it appears

that even with a low “effective” increase in enrollment due to subsidization of inframarginal

students, a simple, broad-based aid program can increase social welfare.


       Students who enter college but drop out without a degree are an important target for those

who wish to increase educational attainment. Dropout rates are especially high at community

colleges, where poor students are concentrated. Interventions that increase persistence in

community colleges are therefore a sensible focus if the goal is to increase the educational

attainment of the poor. The Opening Doors demonstration projects provide strong evidence that

pairing financial incentives with support services can increase college persistence among low-



                                                 18
income students attending community colleges. Testing the efficacy of these programs at scale is

an important next step for researchers and policymakers.
