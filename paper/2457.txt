          Patents, Citations and Innovations: Tracing the Links




                                 ABSTRACT



     The goal is to tackle anew the main problems encountered in using patent

data in economic research, namely, the large variance in the value of patents,

and the difficulties in matching patents with economic categories. The first

is addressed with the aid of patent citations, the second with computerized

search techniques for large databases. The proposed solutions are applied to

the case of Computed Tomography (CT) Scanners a pathbreaking innovation in

medical technology. The main findings are that patents weighted by citations

are highly correlated with the value of innovations, and that important

innovations generate further innovative activity (R&D), and hence bring about

down-the-line patents.

1. INTRODUCTION

     The study of technological change has been hampered all along by the

scarcity of appropriate data and, in particular, by the. lack of good

indicators of innovation having a wide coverage. Patents are the one important

exception: these legal documents, going back in some countries two centuries

and more, remain the only observable manifestation of inventive activity,

covering virtually every field of innovation. However, their use in economic

research has been impeded by two formidable problems: first, the enormous

variance in the 'importance' or 'value' of patents, and second, the lack of a

satisfactory matching between the patent classification system and any set of

meaningful economic categories.

     The main goal here is to show that one can now bring powerful tools to

bear on these problems, and hopefully tackle them successfully. The first can

be addressed with the use of patent citations, which appear to be highly

informative of the value of innovations. The second with the aid of now widely

available computerized search techniques in large databases: those techniques

enable the researcher to easily identify and retrieve all the patents issued

in narrowly defined 'product classes' of his choice, thus doing away with the

need to rely on questionable classification schemes (at least for case studies

or small panels).

     The proposed methodological solutions are discussed in the context of a

particular application, namely, the history of technical advance in Computed

Tomography (CT) Scanners, one of the most remarkable innovations in medical

technology of recent times. Using the search techniques just mentioned, I

gathered the complete set of patents issued in this field, since its advent in
                                    -2-



1972, and through the end of 1986 (456 patents in all). With the aid of

additional data on CT from a previous study, I analyse the role that patent

statistics may come to play as indicators of innovation. In particular, it is

shown that patents weighted by a citations-based index can serve as a good

proxy for the magnitude (or value) of innovations occuring over time; on the

other hand, simple patent counts are indicative only of the extent of

innovative activity, as reflected for example in R&D outlays. Pertinent to the

recently reawaken demand-pull vs. supply-push debate, I also show that

important innovations seem to generate further innovative activity, and hence

to bring about down-the-line patents.

     In light of those results, it appears that one of the most fertile uses

of patent data may be in the study of the emergence of new, technological

advanced sectors: innovation plays of course a crucial role in the dynamics of

those sectors, and moreover, most of the innovation experienced by them over

time seems to occur during their initial stages. The advantage of patents and

patent citations is that they can be traced right to the very beginning of a

sector, whereas conventional industry data usually commence much later, when

the thrust of the 'action' may well be over.

     One of the first regularities found is that the average number of

citations per patent decreases drastically over the years. raising the

suspicion that time (or age) itself might be the main determinant of

citations, rather than anything like 'importance'. In Appendix B I put forward

a statistical procedure to test for 'age vs. importance', and for truncation

biases. Applying them to the case studied here, the objection is strongly

rejected, thus legitimizing the use of citations-based indicators.

     The paper is organized as follows: section 2 discusses the problems with

the use of patents in research, and outlines the proposed solutions. Section 3

lays out the patent data in CT, and section 4 the additional measures of

innovation from the previous study. The core of the empirical analysis is

carried out in section 5, whereas section 6 makes the case for the existence

of supply-push effects, and suggests other extensions. Finally, the results

are summarized and interpreted in section 7.



2. US INC   PATENT DATA: AN OVERVIEW OF TIlE MAIN ISSUES

     2.a The Classification Problem

     The use of patents in economic research for any purpose requires, first

of all, that we relate them to economic categories of interest, such as

products, industries, countries, etc. What makes this         task extremely
problematic is the enormous size of the Patent File, which consist nowadays of

over 4 million US patents, and some 25 million worldwide (about 70,000 new

patents are issued annualy in the US). There is of course a very elaborate

Patent Classification System (PCS) in the US, comprising more than 110,000

patent categories (called subclasses), aggregated into some .400 patent

classes, with no well-defined layers of aggregation in-between1. The problem

is that this vast classification scheme has not been designed according to a

clear set of criteria (scientific or other), that could be mapped into an




     1Mirroring the rapid pace of technological advance, the US-PCS is being
changed   and upgraded continuously, primarily by creating new patent
subclasses. Thus, for example, at the time when Schmookler was engaged in his
massive classification effort (in the early sixties), there were just about
half the number of subclasses that we have today. There is also an
international PCS, of similar dimensions and complexity.
                                    -4-



economic system2. Instead, the PCS has evolved first and foremost according to

operational convenience, and with good reason: after all, its main goal is to

assist patent examiners in establishing the patentability of new applications,

by facilitating the search for related patents. Thus, it is inherently very

difficult to create a satisfactory matching between those 110,000 patent

sub-classes and any set of economic categories. To wit, the Patent Office

constructed in the mid seventies such a 'concordance' between the US-PCS and

the Standard Industrial Classification (at the request of the NSF -   see   OTAF

[1975]), but the results have been so far quite dissapointing, primarily

because most patent subclasses have been assigned to multiple industries in

the SIC.

    Aside from various ad-hoc solutions raised in the literature, there have

been two major attempts in recent years to deal with the classification

problem in a more general way, namely, that of Griliches [1984], and of

Scherer[l984]. Criliches and his associates at the N.B.E.R. obviated the

problem by using firms as the unit of analysis, rather than industry-type

categories. The main drawback of that approach is that for many purposes firms

are not the most appropriate units to look at, and the grouping of fins by

SIC's is a very unsatisfactory solution. Scherer actually classified over

15,000 patents according to industry of origin and industry of use, by
examining with a team of experts the contents of each patent. The problem of

course is that such a massive and team-dependent enterprise cannot be put




     2The Canadian Patent Office does classify patents according to economic
categories during the review process, in addition to assigning them to a PCS.
Note, however, that this is very different from trying ex-post to match patent
sub-classes to, say, industries.
                                     -5-



forward as an universal research strategy, but has to be regarded as a

one-time event. Thus, and even though both projects made big strides in this

area, the classification problem remained essentially unsolved.

     As already suggested, I propose here a more modest approach to the

problem, based upon the availability of powerful techniques for computerized

search in large databases. As described in detail in Appendix A, those

techniques allow one to identify quite easily all the patents issued in

predetermined economic categories, and retrieve them for further analysis.

With the aid of these properly classified patents, one can conduct in-depth

studies of innovation in single sectors, or comparative studies involving, as

of now, a not-too-large number of industries3. Clearly, this does not provide

for an all-out solution to the classification problem, but it does open up a

promising avenue of research 'in the small', whereas the feasibility of

'universal' solutions of any sort remains dubious.



     2.b The problem of a large variance in the value of patents

     The second major obstacle in using patents in economic research, resides

in the well-known fact that patents vary enormously in their technological and

economic 'importance' or 'value'4. Thus, the mere counting of patents, at any



     3There is nothing in the nature of the approach that precludes the
undertaking of more ambitious projects (e.g. large panels). However, and aside
from requiring generous research budgets, more experience in searching by
industries is needed before larger studies can be contemplated, and eventually
conducted on a routine basis.

     4Thus, for example, Scherer [1965) cites evidence to the effect that the
distribution of patent 'values' is highly skewed toward the low end, with a
very long and thin tail into the high value side. Moreover, he notes that
those Pareto-type distributions might not have finite moments, implying that
the 'mean values of patents is a rather elusive magnitude, and that one should
                                      -6-



level, cannot be regarded a priori as a good indicator of the 'amount' of

innovation. As with the classification issue, the problem of a large variance

is inherent to the patent system as such5, and therefore definite solutions

can hardly be expected.

     An idea that has been often suggested in this context, is to use patent

citations as an index of the importance of patents, i.e. to count the number

of times that each patent was cited in subsequent patents, and compute with it

weighted patent counts (the intention of course is to use those weighted

counts as indicators of innovation further down the line). This idea can be

traced directly to the widespread use of citations appearing in the scientific

literature, in the study of various aspects of the scientific enterprise6.

However, and contrary to the somewhat arbitrary nature of citations in

scientific publications, those in patents are grounded in the Patent Law, and

are ultimately decided by a supposedely objective third party, the patent

examiner7 .To quote,




be very cautious in making inferences in that respect from finite samples (see
also section 5..a).

     5This is so because the iniportance of a patent - however defined - can
hardly be assessed ex-ante, and because it is not the task of patent examiners
to make sure that the patents granted are of 'comparable worth'.

     6lndeed,    numerous   studies   in    'scientometrics'   (or   'evaluative
bibliometrics') have shown that citation-based indices can serve as good
indicators of the 'impact' of scientific contributions, of the 'influence' of
scientific journals, etc. Classic works in this field are those of Derek de
Solla Price (e.g. Price[1963J and (19751), and of Cole and Cole [1913). See
also Harm [1916] for an extensive review of scores of studies on the subject.

        am referring here only to the citations appearing on the front page of
each patent, under 'References Cited' (Item 56), and not those that may be
mentioned in the text of the patent. To the best of my knowledge the latter
play only a descriptive role, and do not carry legal weight.
                                    -7-



     "During the examination procedure the examiner searches the pertinent
     portion of the patent file. His purpose is to identify any prior
     disclosures of technology. . .which might anticipate the claimed invention
     and preclude the issuance of a patent; which might be similar to the
     claimed invention and limit the scope of patent protection...; or which,.
     generally, reveal the state of the technology to which the invention is
     directed" .(OTAF [1976], p. 167).

     Thus, and as Campbell and Nieves [1979] argue at lenght, there is an

important legal dimension to patent citations, since they represent a

limitation on the scope of the property rights established by a patent's

claims, that carry weight in court. Moreover, the process of arriving at the

final list of references, involving also the applicant and his attorney,

apparently does generate the right incentives so as to have all truly relevant

patents cited, and only those (see Campbell and Nieves [1979), Appendix II).

The presumption that citation counts are potentially informative of the

'importance' of patents is thus well-grounded.

     In practice, however, patent citations have rarely been used in research

(see end of this section), primarily because of two serious obstacles: first,

until not long ago it was quite difficult to obtain the necessary data, for

reasons similar to those mentioned in the context of the classification

problem. Second, in the absence of independent evidence on thevalue of the

innovations disclosed in patents, it is virtually impossible to ascertain the

merits of a citations-based index or, for that matter, of any alternative

indicator of the outcome of innovative activities.

     In light of the discussion in the previous. section, it is clear that the

problem of data availability can be easily overcome nowadays, with the aid of

the same search techniques described there: once the relevant set of patents

has been identified, the number of citations that each of them received can be
                                     -8-



obtained by searching in the 'references cited' field of those same patents

(i.e. 'within referencing'), or of all subsequent patents. Better still, some

of the patent databases in DIALOG already include citation counts as a

standard information item in each patent.

     The second problem is much more difficult, since it hinges on our ability

to obtain self-justifiable measures of the value of innovations, that could

help validate citations-weighted patent counts. The trouble is that the

assessment of innovations poses      formidable   empirical   and conceptual

difficulties,      primarily when it comes to product innovations (process

innovations are better understood, following Criliches[19571 seminal work on

hybrid corn). Not surprisingly, few studies of that sort have ever been

conducted (notable exceptions are Mansfield et al [1977), and Eresnahan

[19861), and hence the lack of value indicators that could be of help in the

present context.

    I have addressed those issues extensively in a previous study (Trajtenberg

[1983)): using discrete choice models of consumer behavior, I put forward a

methodology for measuring the social gains from product innovations, and

applied it to CT scanners. The intention is to use those measures here, in

order to assess directly the performance of the citations weighting scheme.

Aside from the very availability of a well-grounded measure of innovation, the

advantage in this case is that both the patent counts and the measures used to

validate them refer precisely to the same 'stretch' of innovative activity,

i.e. to advances in a carefully circumscribed product-class and time period.

Thus, the usual problems that arise when trying to match information belonging

to disparate units (as often happens in this context) are altogether absent
                                       -9-



here.

        As already mentioned, there have been up to now just a handful of studies

using patent citations, and all but one (Lieberman [1987]) are outside the

realm of economics proper8. Lieberman (1987] looked at the impact of patent

counts on price changes (as proxies for costs) for a sample of chemical

products. He finds that own-patents are positively correlated with prices, and

that they become statistically insignificant when weighted by citations.

Lieberman provides plausible explanations for these 'negative' results, having

to do with the nature of process innovations in those sectors. Carpenter et al

(1981] show that 100 'important' patents received more than twice as many

citations as a matching sample of randomly chosen patents. They took

'important' to mean patents associated with products that received the IRlOG

Award of the Journal of Industrial R&D, in 1969 and 1970. Ellis et al [1978J

use citation 'networks' to map the technological history of selected fields.

Thus, for example, starting from a handful of patents issued in the 1970's in

semi-synthetic penicillin, they were able to trace back the key patents in the

develpment of the field. They make use of conventional historical material to

validate the 'historiographs' thus constructed. Campbell and Nieves (1979]

also put the emphasis on tracing the evolution of a technology, and propose

for that purpose a variety of patent-based indicators. In sum, there are some

bits and pieces of evidence to the effect that patent citations may be

indicative of something like 'importance', but the issue remains wide open.




     8Aside from those reviewed here, additional (unpublished) studies putting
forward the use of patent citations include Narin and Wolf [1983], and Narin
[l983J. However, the intended use of patent data in the later two is for
business consulting, rather than academic research.

3. PATENTS IN Cr: A FIRST LOOK

     Using the search methods described in Appendix A, the complete set of

patents granted in Computed Tomography was located and retrieved, from the

very start of the field in 1971, and up to the end of 1986, totalling 456

patents10. In order to appreciate the extent to which the search techniques

used here represent a quantum jump in our ability to identify patents in a

given field, consider the following facts: The 456 patents in CT are spread'

over 75 patent sub-classes, the leading one comprising 43% of them, the

largest five 69*, and the remaining 31% of the patents being scattered over 70

categories, each of them with no more than 1% of the patents. Thus, had I

tried to locate the patents in CT by going over the PCS, I would have probably

succeeded in identifying just about 70% of the total. Moreover, even in the

sub-classes with the largest numbers of patents, in CT, the latter represent

only a fraction of the total in those categories (except for the leading

sub-class, where 90% of the patents belong to CT); thus, the percentage of

patents wrongly selected would have been quite large.




     91n this case it tyas very easy to identify the first patent: the origin
of Computed Tomography is unequivocally associated with the invention by C.
Hounsfield of EMI, England, as described in his US patent # 3778614, applied
for in December 1971. Since there were no patents in CT in 1972, I shall treat
this first patent as if it had been applied in January 72 rather than in
December 71, so as to avoid an unnecessary discontinuity in the data points.

     10The computerized search actually produced 501 patents, but 45 of them
were eliminated after a careful examination of their abstracts. Thus, I am
certain that all the patents included do belong to CT, but obviously one
cannot be equally sure that those constitute all the relevant patents. Still,
in this case I am quite confident in that respect as well, since I have been
able to cross-check with other sources, including listings of patents from
manufacturers of CT scanners.

      As is by now standard practice, patents will be dated according to their

application, rather than granting date, since the later depends enterily upon

the examination procedure at the Patent Office, and hence has nothing to do

with the innovation process itself. However, since the availability of patents

at the time of the search obviously reflects granting rather than application

dates, there is a question as to how well the data cover the period under

consideration, particulary the more recent years. In order to answer it we

just need to look at the distribution of lags between application and
        11

                  4                            11                         98.7
                  5                             4                         99.6

      Assuming that the distribution is stable, and recalling that the search

was conducted in December 1986 (i.e. the set includes all patents granted in

CT up to 12-86), I conclude that the data comprise virtually all patents

applied for up to (including) 1982, about 96% of the patents applied for in

1983, 76% of those applied in 1984,and a mere 23% of the 1985 patents. Thus,

the analysis will be restricted to the period 1972-82, although the citations

appearing in the 1983-86 patents will be taken into account.

      Now to the data on citations: as mentioned earlier, citation counts can



     The lag is computed as the difference: (year granted - year applied);
thus, the second row, for example, means that 76% of the patents applied for
in any given year, were granted within the following two calendar years. The
distribution is virtually identical if the 1982-86 patents are excluded.
                                      - 12   -




be done in two different ways, namely, counting all citations, or Just those

appearing in the set   of   patents belonging to the same field. Each has its own

merits, and leads to a different interpretation of the resulting weighted

patent counts: in the 'within referencing' case the weighted counts will be

associated with the 'value' of the patents for -      and   in terms of -    the
specific technological field to which they belong. On the other hand, an

all-inclusive index will presumably capture the value 'spilled-over' to other

areas as well. Given that the measures of innovation to be used in conjuction

with the patent data refer to the gains from advances in CT as such, with no

attempt to account for spillovers, the citations data are taken accordingly

just from references appearing in patents in CT12.

     The first two columns of Table 1, graphically displayed in Figure 1, show

the basic patent data to be used troughout. Note the smooth, cycle-like path

followed by the yearly count of patents: it rises quite fast after 1973, peaks

in 1977, and then declines steadely, carrying forward a long and thin tail

(presumably extending into the indefinite future). Notice also that the

weighting scheme strongly influences the shape of the time distribution,

shifting it back towards the earlier period. In fact, the mean of the

distribution of simple counts is 70.6 (in number of months elapsed since 1/72,

the date of the first patent), whereas that of weighted counts is 54.0. That

is, the weighting scheme moves back 'the action' 17 months, centering it

around mid 1976, rather than at late 1977. Given the very fast pace at which



     12th this case it would have not matter much which count was used: in a
sample of 30 patents in CT, the correlation between the two counts was of
0.99. Likewise, Campbell and Nieves (1979j report a correlation of 0.73
between what they called 'in-set' and total patents, for some 800 patents in
the field of catalytic converters.

the CT technology evolved, and that the period is just 11        years long, a
difference of 1-1/2 years in the means is certainly very significant. Clearly,

the reason for it has to be that earlier patents were cited more frequentely

than later ones. And indeed, Table 1 proves that to be the case: the average

number of citations per patent goes down dramatically over time (from 72 to

less than 1), the pecentage of patents with no citations increases from 0 to

92%, etc.

     The crucial question is whether the observed citation frequencies are to

be regarded as a 'real' phenomemon, presumably reflecting something like the

importance of patents, or just as a statistical artifact, induced primarily by

the mere passage of time. Two main concerns arise in this context: first, it

could be that older patents are cited more often simply because they have been

around longer, i.e. because they have had more opportunities to be cited,

since they precede a larger set of patents that could cite them. Second, given

that CT is an ongoing technology, it is quite certain that additional patents

have been - and will be -   issued since the time of the search (12/86). Thus,

the data set is necessarily truncated, and that might bias downwards the

citation counts of recent patents, since the probability of being cited is

likely to decline over time. In that case the observed phenomenon could just

be the result of the arbitrariness of the cut-off point.

     These are serious a priori objections that may arise whenever trying to

attach   any    meaning to citations data, and therefore deserve careful


            fact, the issue of 'age vs. importance' (closely related to de Solla
Price's 'immediacy factor') has commanded a great deal of attention in the
scientometric literature; however, and to the best of knowledge, so far it has
not been addressed with the aid rigorous statistical tests (see for example
Line [1970), and Campbell and Nieves [1979]).
                                    - 14   -




scrutiny13.   In Appendix B I analyse them in detail, and find that neither age

nor truncation can account for the observed distribution of citation counts.

The issue of age is tackled by constructing an hypothetical 'iso-important'

distribution of citations, and testing it against the observed distribution

with the aid of a     test: the null hypothesis that older patents received

more citations just because of the passage of time is rejected by a wide

margin. As to the effect of truncation, the magnitude of the biases is

estimated by extrapolating from the observed distribution of citation lags,

and of the application-granting lags. The main finding is that a bias does

exist, but the absolute expected number of missing citations to recent patents

is so small, that they could not possible affect the statistical analysis to

be performed.



4. ESTIMATES OF THE VALUE OF INNOVATIONS iN COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY

     As already mentioned, the intention is to relate patent counts weighted

by citations, to the independent measures of innovation from Trajtenberg

(1983], so as to test whether the former could serve as indicators of the

latter. Following is a brief description of these measures.

     The first problem encountered in trying to quantify product innovations,

is that there is nowhere to be found a natural -   let   alone unique -   way   •of


doing so in meaningful economic terms. In my previous study I chose to

associate the 'amount' of innovation occuring in a certain product class at

time t, with the social gains stemming from the technical advances embedded in

the set of products offered at t. That is, given a monetized 'social surplus'

function W(.), and the sets of products St and           offered in two successive
                                       - 15    -




periods, the amount of innovation is defined simply as                       AWt_s   W(S)
                                                                                            -



W(S1Y4.     Thus, the question "how much innovation is there" is taken to mean

how much do consumers benefit from the underlying technical improvements,

using as a yardstick their preferences for the attributes of the products.

      The methodology used to compute the values                     consists in estimating

discrete choice models of demand (more specifically, the multinomial logit

model), and integrating the ensuing probabilistic demand functions so as to

obtain the measures of consumer surplus:




(1)                      in t   Eexp   f4'
                                              (z.,   Pft)) /   At)


where z is the vector of attributes, p price, in         the number of alternatives

(different brands) in the choice set, A the estimate of the marginal utility

of income, and 4i(.) the relevant portion of the estimated indirect utility

function. Lastly, the differences             are computed from the yearly values of

(I), for every pair of adjacent years. In short, tsW is just like a

compensating (or equivalent) variation measure, except that it is designed for

the assessment of product changes in discrete choice sets, rather than of

price changes in a given set of products. Thus, as time goes by new brands are

added to the set S, existing products get better (in the sense of having

'more' of some of the z's), older models drop-out, and so forth. All those

changes are emcompassed in what is referred to to as 'product innovation1, and




     141n practice LIW is confined to changes in consumer surplus, since net
aggregate profits were nil during the period studied. As to S. it comprises
the prices and main performance characteristics of the products in the set.
                                      - 16   -




it is their compound value for the consumer that AW is measuring.
      Noting that AW refers to the Incretental gains accruing to                the

representative consumer, I compute also the total gains associated with the

innovations at t, as follows,




(2)         —
                AW [n + K( E W) ff(r)
                            r—O     t+l
                                             e (ttl)d ]   AWt   (
                                                                    n+   nf)




where n is the number of consumers buying at t, K(.) is the ceiling of the

diffusion process (that shifts-up as a consequence of successive innovations),

f(.) the diffusion path, and r the interest rate. Thus, TW simply multiplies

AW by the number of current beneficiaries from the innovations at t,           plus

the discounted number of those that will benefit from those same innovations

in the future, flf the later being assessed on the basis of the observed

diffusion process.

      I gathered for the earlier study a comprehensive data set on CT scanners,

including the prices and attributes of all scanners marketed in the US since

the inception of the technology in 1973 and up to 1982, details of all sales

to hospitals and clinics (i.e. who bought which scanner and when), R&D

expenditures of firms on CT, etc. Applying the methodology just sketched to

these data, yearly estimates of tsW and of TW were obtained (see table 2):

those are the figures that wIll be related to patent counts, Note that the two

measures follow a very similar pattern over time: they are very large - and

rising -   at   first, and then decline dramatically, carrying a long tail into

the future. Thus, and eventhough the 'action' in terms of R&D, entry, etc.,

peaks later-on, the bulk of the gains from innovation are generated during the
first few years. This time profile seems to be typical of the emergence of

entirely new products, and may be attributed to an initial phase of sharply

increasing returns both in the 'production' of innovations, and in the utility

derived from them, followed promptly by the setting-in of diminishing returns

in both dimensions.



5. PATENTS AS INDICATORS OF INNOVATION: THE STATISTICAL EVIDENCE

     The main hypotheses to be put forward are (note that they refer to a

given technological field -   or   industry -     as it evolves over time):


     Hi: Patent counts weighted by citations are good indicators of the
         magnitude, or value, of innovations, but simple counts are not.

     H2: Simple patent counts are good indicators of the extent of innovative
            activity taking place in a field, and are therefore related to R&D
         expenditures.



     These hypotheses are examined in the simplest possible way, namely, using

pairwise correlations between the different variables, for two reasons: first,

since the point of departure is that LxW, TW, R&D, etc. accuraterely represent

the phenomena of interest, the only remaining question is whether patents

(which are at best just an indirect manifestation of the same phenomena),

closely follow the path of those variables over time. Any conventional measure

of association along the time dimension will do, certainly the Pearson

coefficient. Second, and more pragmatically, there are just ten observations

in all (1973-82), and that is obviously too little to estimate anything but

correlations.
                                    - 18   -




5.a   The First Hypothesis

      In order to proceed with the statistical analysis, the hypotheses have to

be formulated in more detail, i.e. one needs to define more precisely the

scope of the patents counts, and the time structure of their links with the

measures of innovation. With regard to scope, the question is whether the

counts should include all patents in CT, as done until now, or just those

granted to firms that were active in the market for CT scanners (the latter

accounted for 66% of all patents, and for 80% of all citations). Since AR and

1W were computed on the basis of the CT scanners actually marketed in the US,

we would expect these measures to be more highly correlated with the patents

granted to manufacturers of CT. That would not be so only             if      the

appropriability of the patents issued to the other assignees had been

extremely low, i.e. only if the manufacturers of CT scanners benefitted from

the innovations done by other inventors as much as they did from their own.

      The issue of timing (i.e. of the lag structure) is much more complex,

primarily because it is not clear what is precisely the information conveyed

by the application dates of patents: innovation is obviously not a one-shot

event1 but a continuous time process, starting from the formulation of a novel

idea, and ending with the introduction in the market of the product embedding

that idea (and hence with AW). Sometime along the way the inventor files for a

patent application, presumably before the development stage is completed; butt

how much earlier, and what determines the lenght of the lag? Eventhough the

answers are far from clear, one can at least identify two of the main forces

at work: the first has to do with the stringency of the application
                                   - 19   -




requirements set by the Patent Office, the second with the technological
characteristics and the competitive structure of the industry. Thus, the more

stringet the requirements are, and the more intense the technological rivalry

in the field is, the shorter will be the lag between patent counts and AW.

Beyond that, however, no general prior can be put forward regarding the

expected lag: in principle the patent might be filed just before the

innovation reaches the market, or much before; notice, also that there is no

reason for the lag to be constant over time.

     There is, however, further information on dates that may shed light on

the lag structure: in addition to the application date in the US, many patents

have a 'foreign priority application date', and some make reference to earlier

'Related US Application Data"15. To quote in relation to the former,

     "It is common to seek patent protection on a single invention in several
     countries.. .International multiple patenting has been facilitated by a
     treaty which permits applications filed in a foreign country within a
     year of filing in the home country to be accorded the home country filing
     date. However, the treaty requires that. ..the initially filed patent
     application must be identified by country, serial number and filing date,
     and that the 'priority' of this filing be claimed." (OTAF [1977], p.17).


     Thus, for example, according to OTAF [1977] 30% of all patents granted in

the US in 1975 contain foreign priority data. In the case of patents in CT,

56% of them mention a foreign application date, with an average lag between it

and the application date in the US of fourteen months (see table 3)l6 Such a



    Sfxteen percent of the patents in CT make reference to an earlier
'related US application', i.e. they are designated as 'continuations' of
previous applications, which may have failed, or given rise to other (related)
patents. Unfortunately, I do not have the actual dates of those earlier
applications, only the fact of a reference to them.

     '16As quoted above, the application in the foreign country has to be made
within a year of the home country filing date; and indeed, some 80% of the

lag simply implies that the innovation process underlying those patents,
streches back at least 14 months longer than what could be infered just from

the US application date. The lag is also consistent with the observation that

patenting requirements are more exacting in the US than in foreign countries,

since often times the innovations had not been developed enough at the time of

the foreign application, for them to meet US standards. Now, because the

standards differ, and moreover, because the composition of the foreign

priority countries changed significantly over the period studied (the UK

ceding its initial dominant place to Germany and Japan), it does not make

sense to date all patents according to the earliest date appearing on them.

Thus, they will still be dated according to the US application date, so as to

be able to interpret consistently whatever lag between patent counts and AW is

found, in light of the implied (uniform) standard. One can then superimpose on

it the foreign-US application lag (which, as t.able 3 reveals, varies by year),

thus gaining some notion of the minimal overall span of the innovation process

in CT.

     Finally, it should be clear that the most serious limitation in this

respect stems from the fact that the period studied is very short, not

allowing for the estimation of any sort of lag structure, let alone of a

changing lag. Thus, the findings refering to the lag between patents and MY,

obtained by maximizing pairwise correlations over the time dimension, should



patents with foreign priority were filed in the [IS just before a year elapsed.
The rest have a bridging 'related US application', i.e. within a year of the
filing abroad a patent was indeed applied for in the US, but it either failed,
or gave rise to another patent; in either case, the present patent, by being
designated as a 'continuation' of the related US application, can still claim
the foreign priority date.

be regarded as tentative,

     Now to the statistical results: table 4 presents the correlations between

alternative versions of simple and weighted patent counts, and (AW        ,   TW),
with the former variables lagged between 0 and 6 months17. The first and most

important finding is that, in effect, weighted patent counts are correlated

with the value measures of innovation, whereas simple counts are clearly not,

in all the cases considered. Thus, the first hypothesis is confirmed, and

decisively so. Second, the correlations increase substantially, as             we

narrow-down the scope of the (weighted) counts to the patents granted to firms

in CT. This supports my prior and implies, as suggested, that the patents

awarded to other assignees did not quite become a 'public good' (i.e.

appropriability was not nil).

     Third, the correlations peak when the patent counts are lagged just one

quarter, declining monotonically as the lag increases (this is true for lags

far beyond the 6 months shown in table 4)18, Superimposing on it the mean

foreign-US application lag of 12.7 months (for patents to firms in CT,

weighted by citations    -   see table 3), one obtains a minimum innovation span

(or minimum 'lead time') of 16 months. This may strike as rather short



     L7Notice that, even though the variables refer to yearly figures, the lag
can be varied by .onthly increments, since the patent data is virtually
continuous in time. It is also important to note that, since the AW series
begins in 1973, I just added the 1972 (first) patent to the patent count of
1973, i.e. the AW figu.re for 1973 refers to the first CT scanner marketed, and
hence it obviously corresponds to the initial patents in the field, including
the very first.

     18llowever, recall from the previous footnote that the 1972 patent was
simply added to the 1973 patents in computing the correlations. Thus, the
first lag was actually longer (about one year long), and the overall lag would
increase from 3 to 4 months if one averages that first lag with the rest.

 (although   it is not clear against what standard one ought to judge it), but if

o it would certainly be consistent with the intense technological rivalry

that characterized the evolution of CT scanners. Note also from table 3 that

the overall lag drops from close to five years in 1973, to one and a half year

in 1974, hoovering around one year from then on. Figure 2, tracing the

'geneological tree' of the first patents taken by G. Hounsfield, the inventor

of CT, throws light on those initial long lags, and confirms the stringency of

the US application requirements vis a vis those in the UK19. Closely related,

figure 2 implies also that the innovations contained in those first patents

were more 'general' (and hence more 'important' indeed), in the sense that it

took longer to embed them in demonstrably working - and useful - systems    that

could comply with the US requirements for patentability.

     Returning to the basic finding of this section (i.e., that weighted

patent counts are highly correlated with AW), we can now (re)interpret the

distribution of citation counts across patents, as an implied distribution of

the value of innovations. As shown in table 5, the observed distribution fits

well the received wisdom on this matter (see for example Shenkerman and Fakes

(1984], and Pakes [1986)): it is very skewed, with almost half the patents

never cited (and hence of little ex post value), and a 'lucky few' being worth

a great deal20. Thus, and contrary to Scherer's pessimistic note to the effect



     '9Notice that the first US application actually failed, even though it
was filed one year after the first application in the UK. It then took
Hounsfield more than two years of further development (in the course of which
a first working prototype of a CT scanner was installed in a London hospital),
in order to win a US patent.

     20Campbell and Nieves (1979] present the distribution of citations for
all US patents issued from 1791 to 1978 (over four million patents), whereas
Narin [1983) shows the distribution corresponding to 13,264 chemical and
                                    -23-




innovations per se, than of the size of the market for the products embedding

those innovations. This is a reassuring result, since we expect technological-

related factors to be dominant in the patenting and citing processes.



     S.c The Second Hypothesis

     To recall, the second hypothesis is that simple patent counts would be

good indicators of the level of innovative activity in a field, as reflected

for example in R&D expenditures. The relationship between patents and R&D has

been intensively scrutinized in past research25, and the results appear to be

quite uniform, centering around the following 'stylized facts': a) there is a

strong statistical association between patents and R&D expenditures; b)

this relationship apears to be mostly contemporaneous; and c) R&D explains a

great deal of the cross-sectional variance in patenting, but not much of the

variation along time. Much of this research has been done on short panels of

firmst data, leading Griliches to conclude, in summing-up, that    "...patents

are a good indicator of differences in inventive activity across firms, but

that short term fluctuations in their numbers within firms have a large noise

component in them" (Griliches[l984), p.3).

     The second hypothesis can be seen as extending those results to the time

dimension, i.e. it also postulates a close association between ptents and

R&D, but within a given field and along time, rather than across firms and/or

industries. I resort again to simple correlations, and explore in detail the

possible existence of lags. The main findings, drawn from Table 7, are: First,

there is indeed a high correlation between yearly patent counts and R&D, and a

      The answers emerge clearly from table 6: a1 — 1.30       ,   and            4 —    1.10,
i.e. there are in fact 'increasing returns' to citations, and they manifest

themselves more strongly in the context of the relationship of patent counts

with AW, rather than with TW. Note that these results are robust, in that they

obtain also in the absence of a lag, and when using counts of all patents

rather than counts of patents to firms in CT23. Moreover, and as figure 3

shows, the highest correlations arrived at can be taken indeed as global

maxima. In other words, the WPC's based upon patents to firms in CT, lagged I

quarter and using as exponents a1 — 1.30          and a2 — 1.10, dominate all other

cases along the three diniensions considered here.

      The finding that       >   1   is in itself an important one            :     first, it

provides further evidence to the effect that WPC's convey a great deal of

information on the value of innovations disclosed in patents; in particular,

it means that the aarginal informational content of the WPC's increases with




each patent, and not in the aggregate (weighted) patent count.

             actual maximized values of the exponents are somewhat higher in the
latter case: 4 — 1.40, and 4 — 1.30. This may be related to the fact that,
as already mentioned, the patents of firms in CT received more than their
proportional share of citations.

     24And it came as a surprise: originally I thought that there might be
diminishing returns to citations, i.e. that citations may be given 'too
generously', and hence that their marginal informative value would be low and
declining. Had that been the case, the role of WPC's as indicators of
innovations would have been weakened.

the   number of citations. Second, it implies that the variance in the value of

patents is larger, and that the distribution of those values more skewed, than

what could be inferred from the simple count of citations (recall table 5).

      Now to the finding that a >
                                    c4. Recall that AW is a measure of the
gains to the representative consumer from improvements in the set of available

products, and therefore it amounts to a snapshot valuation of the innovations

underlying those improvements. TW, on the other hand, multiplies tW by the

number of consumers that benefit from the innovation, at present and in the

future. Thus, the fact that a >         4, and    that   Corr[WPC(4), aw     >
Corr[WPC(c4), TWJ, means that citations are more informative of the value of

innovations per se, than of the size of the market for the products embedding

those innovations. This is a reassuring result, since we expect technological-

related factors to be dominant in the patenting and citing processes.



      S.c The Second Hypothesis

      To recall, the second hypothesis is that simple patent counts would be

good indicators of the level of innovative activity in a field, as reflected

for example in R&D expenditures. The relationship between patents and R&D has

been intensively scrutinized in past research25, and the results appear to be

quite uniform, centering around the following 'stylized factst: a) there is a

strong statistical association between patents and R&D expenditures; b) this

relationship apears to be mostly contemporaneous; and c) R&D explains a great

deal of the cross-sectional variance in patenting, but not much of the


     25Many of the papers in Griliches[l984] have to do in one way or the
other with this issue; extensive references to previous works can also be
found there.
                                       - 26   -




variation   along time. Much of this research has been done on short panels of

firms' data, leading Griliches to conclude, in summing-up, that        "...patents

are a good indicator of differences in inventive activity across firms, but

that short term fluctuations in their numbers within firms have a large noise

component in them" (Griliches[l984], p.3).

     The second hypothesis can be seen as extending those results to the time

dimension, i.e. it also postulates a close association between patents and

R&D, but within a given field and along time, rather than across firms and/or

industries. I resort again to simple correlations, and explore in detail the

possible existence of lags. The main findings, drawn from Table 7, are: First,

there is indeed a high correlation between yearly patent counts and R&D, and a

much weaker one between R&D and patents weighted by citations; thus, the

second hypothesis is amply confirmed. Second, the degree of association peaks

when R&D is lagged just 5 months, supporting previous findings of short

'gestation lags'. Third, the correlations are sligthly higher for counts of

all patents than for patents to firms in CT, suggesting some degree of

spill-overs from the R&D done by manufacturers of CT to other assignees.

     In order to strenghten the notion that patent counts are to be seen as

indicators of innovative activity in the broad sense, and not just as proxies

for R&D, I computed also the following correlations (all are contemporaneous,

     The   first two reflect the fact that competition in this technologically

progressive market was driven by rivalry in innovation; the third correlation

has to do with the impact of innovation on diffusion, i.e., it indicates that

the market expanded as the technology improved (see Trajtenberg [1983] for a

detailed account of this relationship).



6. THE PATENTS -, R&D   -,   PATENTS LINK • AND FURTHER KXnHSIONS

     So    far   the     discussion has been confined to simple statistical

associations, in order to shed light on the proper use of patent statistics as

indicators of innovation. Here I venture into some causal links that may help

grasp the dynamics of the innovative process, and suggest two possible

extensions.

     Eventhough hard evidence is difficult to come about, it has been widely

observed that important innovations often generate a flurry of further

innovative activity, that brings in turn a host of minor improvements. In

fact, new products embedding truly novel technologies are usually crude and

lacking at first, but gradually improve over time as a result of further

research efforts26. Thus, and returning to patent indicators, one would expect

to find a causal link going from WPC to R&D, probably with a substantial lag.

Moreover, since as shown above simple patent counts (SPC) follow R&D after a 5

month lag, we would also expect to observe a link between WPC and SFC, the lag

between them being the sum      of   the waiting period between Wit and R&D, and the




     26lndirect support to this contention can be found in the often-noted
fact that consumers are well aware of this process, and their ensuing
'technological expectations' appear to play a key role in their decision of
when to purchase a new or rapidly advancing product.
                                       - 28   -




gestation lag. In other words, I have in mind a sort of self-propelling
innovative cycle, by which important innovations (as reflected in high WPC)

bring about further R&D aimed at implementing and perfecting them, and this in

turn results in further patents. Some of the later may prove to be important

innovations (and thus collect many citations), opening-up a new phase in.the

cycle.

     Table 8 shows the correlations between WEC, R&D and SPC, allowing for

various lags: first, there is indeed a strong correlation between lagged WPC

and R&D, peaking with a lag of 9 months; second, the correlation between WPC

and Sit is highest when the two are 14 months apart, this corresponding

exactly to the sum of the WPC -+ R&D    9-month lag, and the R&D -.     Sit           5-month

gestation lag. Notice also that the correlations between lagged WPC and R&D

are systematically higher than those between SPC and R&D, and hence the chain

of events is clearly of the form WPC -, R&D       -#
                                                       SPC, and not SPC -. R&D   -t    SPC.

     The process just described has a strong 'supply-push' flavour, and evokes

Schumpeterian •notions of innovation-induced cycles. It should be clear,

however, that within the narrow context of this paper I cannot undertake to

weigh this view versus its main contender, namely, that of Schmookler[1966J

upholding the centrality of demand-inducement mechanisms. At the same time,

Schmookler's results cannot be seen as excluding, or negating, the findings

here: to begin with, Schmookler had at his disposal only simple patent counts

(that reflect just the level of innovative activity, and not the magnitude of

innovation) and hence could not really address the 'supply-push' story27.


     270ne cannot take too seriously the tests that Schmookler performed in
chapter IV of his book, using various series of 'important innovations';
moreover, it seems that Schmookler himself doubted the appropriateness of

Furthermore,    he studied the innovation process in conventional,       well-

established sectors, whereas the case here refers to a radically new product,

for which an element of demand creation is undeniable.

     In sum, the above results should be regarded for now as suggestive, and

be seen as part of recent efforts to shed new light on the classic supply-push

demand-pull debate (e.g. Beggs [1984], Criliches et al [1986], and Cort and

Wall [1986]).

     Now to the intended extensions: the first has to do with the question of

whether patent data are also informative at a more dissagregated level (e.g.

fins within a product class), and the extent to which they may be indicative

of the private value of innovations (recall that AW refers to their social

value). The idea is to have a panel of sales by firms over time, with own

patents,   and patents by everybody else, as independent variables (I do have

all the data needed in the context of CT scanners). The basic model would be

that of Spence [1984), and hence one of the interesting issues that could be

investigated is the degree of appropriability (i.e. the coefficient of others'

patents). The second extension refers to spill-overs across sectors: a

possible source to study this elusive issue may be in cross-sectoral

citations, that is, references to patents in the source' sector, appearing in

patents belonging to the field that benefits from the spill-overs. In the case

of CT scanners, for example, one would look into citations to CT patents, made

in patents belonging to more recent imaging technologies, such as NMR (also

called MRI), ultrasound, and positron emission tomography.

7. CONCLUDING RflIARKS
     In   light of the results presented above, there is indeed room to believe

that patent data hold a significant potential for research in economics. A key

element lies with the search techniques used here: with their help one     can

unlock the wealth of information contained in the patent file, and overcome

the classification problem, at least for case studies or small panels.

     A distinguishing feature of the approach put forward, is that the units

of   analysis   are narrowly-defined product classes (very close to the
economist's notion of markets), rather than firms or SIC categories. Aside

from the obvious advantages for analjrsing issues in industrial organization,.

this shift in units carries a major additional benefit: patent counts by

product classes appear to be good indicators in the time dimension, and not

just cross-sectionally as is the case with counts of firms' patents28. This

may be of great significance, in view of the fact that innovation is in

essence a dynamic phenomenon. Closely related, patent data can be easily

obtained all the way to the very beginning of a product class, whereas the

gathering of conventional industry data usually starts only when a sector is

well established. Thus, and as shown for CT scanners, patent counts and

citations may play an important role in studying the very emergence of new

markets, which seems to be the period when most of the innovative activity

takes place (quite clearly, studies focused on mature industries are very

likely to miss the bulk of the innovative segment). Moreover, the why's and



     28As Griliches et al [1986] point out in summing-up previous research,
both the fact that the R&D budgets of firms are typically stable over time,
and that most firms take a small but highly variable number of patents per
year, make it very difficult to trace innovative activity over time on the
basis of firms' data.
                                     - 31   -




how's of cross-sectional results regarding the structural characteristics of

mature sectors (e.g. concentration, entry barriers, étc), cannot really be

understood but in light of how those sectors evolved into their observed

equilibrium; again, the type of patent data used here seems to be particulary

well-suited to trace that process.

     The results having to do with the lag structure (e.g. from patents to

tW), underscore the importance of correctly dating patents, and call for extra

caution in interpreting such findings. The relatively long lags between

foreign and US applications suggest that the filing of patents in the US

occurs fairly late along the innovation process; this fact may help explain

the pervasive result found in the literature,         of a contemporaneous

relationship between patents and other indicators, such as R&D, the value of

firms, etc.

     The close association of patents with R&D raises once again some

questions as to the proper use (and interpretation) of either variable in

empirical research. In accord with the prevailing view, the results here show

that simple patent counts are certainly not to be regarded as a measure of

innovative output: that requires the weighting by citations. Yet, patents are

not quite akin to an input either (as R&D is), since they also reflect to some

extent 'effort', and a modicum of technological success.

     In order to understand their role, it may be helpful perhaps to think of

patents as working papers in economics (and hence of economic departments as

firms, and fields in economics as industries): papers are 'produced' roughly

in proportion to the number of faculty29, as patents are with respect to R&D.

                                     32 -




The fact is that it does not take much to get a patent, once the firm has an

established R&D facility going, as it does not take much to write a working

paper. Still, a larger number of patents presumably indicate, ceteris paribus,

that more research efforts have been invested by the R&D staff (as more papers

would suggest that the faculty is 'trying harder'). Thus, it seems that patent

counts can be regarded as a more 'refined' measure of innovative activity (vis

a vis R&D), in the sense that they incorporate at least part of the

differences in effort, and net-out the influence of 'luck' in the first round

of the innovative process. On the pragmatic side, good R&D data are much more

difficult to obtain than patent data, and the latter have a wider coverage.

Moreover, patent data are richer and 'finer', in that they are practically

continuous in time, and can be further classified by a variety of criteria.

Thus, there is plenty of room to expand the use of patent counts, lessening at

the same time the dependancy upon hard-to-get R&D data.

    The results that hold the greatest promise are those related to the use

of citations, since they offer a quantitative indicator for a key variable

that had virtually none, namely, the value of innovations. The marked skewness

in the distribution of those values appears to be no longer an impediment to

the use of patent data, but rather the main source of their usefulness. This

as well as all previous conclusions are expressed in a qualified manner, for

the obvious reason that they are based upon the findings from a case study;

hopefully, future research will bring-in more supportive evidence, and further

demonstrate the attractiveness of the proposed indicators.


contribution to economics: for that purpose one would need information on
whether and where the working papers get published, the number of citations
that they receive over time, etc.

                                   APPENDIX      A
         Online search and retrieval of patent data iron large databases



        The search techniques referred to above make use of the following basic

elements: (a) Large computerized databases, to which one can gain easy access

just with a PC equipped with a modem; (b) Online search facilities, consisting

essentially of basic boolean operators such as 'and', 'or', 'not' etc, and a

set of rules governing the use of keywords, fields of search, and the like.

(c) Online retrieval capabilities, that allows one to unload the selected data

into the PC. There are today thousands of databases containing millions of

documents, and their use is spreading extremely fast, both in business and in

academia (it seems though that economists have been particularly slow in

taking advantage of these services).

        I have used for the present study the PATDATA database, through BPS. This

database includes all patents issued in the US from July 1975 to the present,

it is updated weekly, and its current size is in the order of 800,000 patents.

Each patent document consists of fifteen 'fields' ,   such   as application and

issue dates, classification codes, assignee, a descriptive abstract of about

10-30 lines long, etc. It is worth pointing out that DIALOG offers access to

about 10 databases on patents, covering most countries and going back in some

areas to the sixties.

        The search for patents in a particular product field or industry can be

done in a variety of ways: using key words pertaining to the product in

question that may appear in the title and/or in the abstract, identifying a

small     set of relevant patent classification codes, locating assignees
                                       - 36   -




(typically     firms) that are known to operate in the field, etc. Needless to

Gay, there isn't a well-defined method that would deliver with centainty all

the patents in a given field, and only those. Rather, the search process

consists   ,    at   least at first, of trial and error: it involves sampling by a

given set of initial criteria, examining the abstracts in order to determine

whether the sampled patents do belong to the desired category, searching anew

according to an updated set of criteria, and so forth. Since it is always

possible to re-examine the patents after the search so as to eliminate those

that do not belong, the dominant a ante concern is to minimize the

probability of overlooking in advance patents that may belong to the desired

field, subject of course to the researcher's budget constraint. Lastly, once

the desired set of patents has been identified and retrieved, one can extract

from them the required data, with the aid of a specially designed computer

programme (patents come in the form of full-text documents). At this point the

actual analysis can begin30.




     30Narin [1983] suggested. a similar search procedure, aimed at corporate
consulting rather than academic research. Moreover, he relied upon proprietory
search techniques and data, whereas one of the appeals of the approach here is
easy access and widespread availability.

                                     APPENDIX B

   Patent Citations: A Statistical Analysis of Tnmcation and Age Effects
       Li Testing    sage vs. importance'
       I   begin by defining a hypothetical citation process by which all patents

are of equal importance, and the only differentiating factor is 'age. The

distribution of citations thus generated will be then compared to the actual

one, and the maintained hypothesis that all patents are equally important

tested with the aid of a x2 test.

       As a first step, patents are ordered along time according to their

application date, and indexed with i —            1,... ,N   (N-'456); note that i thus

indicates the cumulative number of patents in CT applied for up to patent i.

Denoting by          the probability that patent i will be cited in patent j (for

i<j), and by rj the number of references to previous patents in CT appearing

in patent j, one can now define:

       All patents 1 s I < j are said to be iso-important if
                          r
(Bl)                   —____ = p4-                     j —   1,...
                          j-l
       Thus,    equal importance is taken to mean that all patents applied for up

to a point in time, have the same probability of being cited by a subsequent

patent. In other wurds, (Bl) means that the citations appearing in patent j

are the result of r. random drawings (without replacement) from a pooi

containing the j-l patents that preceeded it31. Noting that (Bl) implies also


       31Clearly, this is not the only possible way of designing a citation
process that would render patents of 'equal importance'. Notice, however, that
by defining        to be independent of the time interval (j-i), I implicitly
favor the earlier patents, thus increasing the power of the test. That is, any
plausible departure form (31) would have the probabilities decrease with
                                                 - 35   -




time     independence (i.e. for any i <                 j   < k,           is independent of P1j), the

npected number of citations of patent i can be computed simply as
                                                                 N
(B2)                            CE(C) —                          E    p.
                                    3.

                                                            ji+i
        Obviously, c7 >       for        any i <   j,   i.e. older patents will get on average

more citations than recent ones, just by virtue of their age. Notice also that

    has to decrease eventually with j (unless r were to increase indefinitely
p
over time, but in fact r. is quite stable), thus reinforcing the pure 'age

effect'. In other words, not only do later patents miss the earlier pJs, but

those probabilities tend to be the large ones, a fact that further reduces the

expected number of citations of recent patents vis a vis older ones.

        In order to actually perform the x2 test, the data are aggregated by

months, since it would be unreasonably to attach any significance (in the

sense of differences in         ) to the precise day of application. Indexing by r

              the

                         j
and       t         number of months since 1/72, the observed (or actual) number of


citations is         =         where         nt is the number of patents in month
                       i— 1

Similarily, and redefining (BI) in monthly terms,
                                             n
                                              r             r-l
(31)'                                    p Er./                  E   n.
                                            i=1             j=1
and, accordingly,
                                                            T
                                             —              >2




        Turning now to the test itself,




(i-i), making the distribution of expected citation more uniform, and hence
making it easier to reject the null hypothesis.

        Thus, the hypothesis that the observed distribution of citations is due

just to age is strongly rejected. As is to be expected, the largest

discrepancies between actual and expected values occur at the very beginning

of the period. In particular, the values for the first patent are C — 72,

   —    5.96, and hence (C -                       731,   which amounts to 3/4 of the
                                  C)2/ C =
computed x2• Since this first patent can be regarded in many ways as an

exception, the test was redone after deleting it, and again the null

hypothesis is rejected by a wide margin.



        B.2 Assessing the truncation bias

        Now to the other potential problem in this context, namely, the fact that

the -   unavoidable    -   truncation   of the data might induce a bias in the citation

counts. Of course, the further back in the past the period studied is, the

less there would be reason for concern. For a given distance in time, though,

the extent of the bias will be determined by the behavior of citation lags,

and by the rate of new patent arrivals after the date of search. Citation lags

refer to the length of time elapsed between the dates of the citing and of the

cited patent: the shorter they are, the less severe the problem will be. Table

B.l presents the distribution of these lags, by year of the cited patents: for

example, the 1975-77 patents were subsequently cited 508 times, 12.6% of those

citations occuring during the first year following the application date, 37.4%

in the course of the second year, etc. the mean lag being almost of 3 years.

Note that the frequency distribution of citation lags for all patents is very

skewed to the left, most citations occuring within the first 3-4 years after a

patent has been applied for, and the process dwindling down to a trickle after

5-6 years32. In particular, this is true for the distribution of lags of the

1975-77 patents1 which is arguably the most 'representative' period in this

context. As for the maximum lag, it seems quite certain that it does not

exceed 10 years. judging from the evidence of the initial years (1972-74), for

which the maximum lag could have been significantly longer (11-14 years).

     So far the qualitative evidence seems to indicate that the truncation

problem is not too severe; still, we need actual estimates of the biases in

order to make a final judgement. Denote by f the frequency distribution of

citation lags, i.e. if year t patents are to receive (on average) C citations

per patent, f stands for the percentage of those citations to be received

after r years (obviously, E f= 1 ). Likewise,
                            1•   —t
                                                          define ca fC and gn
c/ n ,    where n is as before the total number of patents in year i-.                   Now,

suppose that because of truncation, one can actually obtain only a fraction h

of them; then, assuming that          is invariant with respect to h (i.e., that

citations to year t patents are randomly distributed among the n                    patents),

the observed average number of citations to year t patents will be: c7-

 tr r r    rrt
g h n — Ii f C . Thus, given the sequences {h
                                              r
                                                      ,   f   r
                                                                  ),   one   can compute for

each year the fraction v= >hf ,         that     is, v stands for the percentage of

citations that patents in year t can be expected to receive, out of the total



     32Campbell and Nieves [1979] report longer lags for the case of catalytic
converters, but theirs refer to all citations (which would have longer lags
indeed), rather than to 'within citations' only, as is the case here.

that   they would have received had it not been for the truncation of the data.

       The figures for h are obtained from the granting-application lags shown

in section 3, e.g. h83a 0.76, h85' 0.23, etc. (obviously, for r         81,    h—
1.001 and for r        86, h— 0); those for f are a slight variation of the

citation lags displayed in Table 3.1 . The results are as follows:

       Thus, I do miss a few citations because of the truncation of the data;

more importantly, there is as expected a truncation bias, in the sense that

there is a smaller fraction of the %true# number of citations to later patents

than to earlier ones. Notice, however, that the absolute expected number of

missing citations is very small and that, even if the bias was somehow

underestimated in those calculations by a factor of 2, the trued citations

count would still differ only slightly from the count used here. Thus, it is

clear that the truncation problem is mostly inconsequential            for     the




       33The citation lags were computed here as: (year of citing patent -    year
of cited patent), rather than according to their respective months, as in
table B.l. The figures for v shown in the table are the averages of two
values, one computed on the basis of the distribution f       corresponding to
the 1975-77 patents, and a second on the basis of the fs for all patents.

computations and findings presented above.
    Finally, and to press the truncation issue further, I asked the following

question: given that the above calculations are done on the basis of averages,

could it not be that one or more of the patents applied for in say, 1982,

actually turned out to be very important, but it went undetected here because

there are just 4 years of granted patents since? Quite clearly, one cannot

rule that out with certainty, but as the following exercise indicates, such

possibilIty is very unlikely: I took the three patents applied for in 1973

(each of which received a large number of citations), and counted the number

of citations that they would have been given, if just the patents granted up

to the end of 1977 had been available, thus replicating the situation now vis

a vis the 1982 patents. The partial count for the first patent was of 7

citations vs. a true count of 11, of 5 vs. 18 for the second, and of 8 vs 21

for the third, i.e., the importance of those patents would have been

recognized right away. I repeated the exercise with the latest two patents to

receive more than 10 citations each (both were applied for in 1976), obtaining

similar results: the restricted count was of 16 citations vs. a total of 20

for one, and of 6 vs. 13 for the other. These findings are important not so

much for the statistical analysis, but rather in that they make sure that we

get an accurate description of the evolution of the CT scanners over time. In

other words, it is very unlikely that some major innovation occured in the

field of CT in the early eighties, and the patent data failed to detect it

because of truncation. Instead, the field seems to be lingering on, as Figure

1 shows, giving way to KRI   and   other rising technologies.
