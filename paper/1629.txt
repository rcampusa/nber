                  Borrowing Restrictions and Wealth
                   Constraints: Implications for
                        Aggregate Consumption




                                ABSTRACT




   Recent empirical studies have found that consumption is more sensitive to

current income than the life-cycle, permanent income hypothesis would predict.

The present paper studies a model in which the fraction of consumers

exhibiting excess sensitivity is endogenously determined. The presence of

income uncertainty and restrictions on borrowing are shown to generate a

distribution of consumption across individuals which is consistent with the

recent empirical evidence. The aggregate marginal propensity to consume out

of transitory income is directly related to the fraction of constrained

consumers and exhibits positive serial correlation in the face of serially

uncorrelated income shocks.

             Borrowing Restrictions and Wealth Constraints:
                 Implications for Aggregate Consumption




  Recent empirical research suggests that the observed co-movements of

income and consumption are consistent with some fraction of consumption

being determined in a manner compatible with the life-cycle, permanent

income hypothesis and the remaining fraction being proportional to in-

come. Hall and Mishkin [1982], for example, investigated the consump-

tion of food using panel data on households and concluded that 80% of

consumption obeys the permanent income hypothesis, while 20% is simply

proportional to income.' In a study of aggregate consumption, Hayashi

[1982] obtains a point estimate of the share of disposable income going

to liquidity constrained households of 17.1%, although he cannot reject

the null hypothesis that this fraction is zero. Using consumer expendi-

tures in place of consumption, Hayashi estimates that 96% of such expen-

ditures are attributable to liquidity constrained households.2 Hansen

and Singleton [1983] are able to reject the restrictions implied by the

first order Euler equations obtained from a standard specification of a

life-cycle consumption choice problem, and Zeldes [1984] presents evi-

dence to suggest that the violation of these restrictions is due to the

presence of liquidity constrained households.   In addition, Ferson and

Merrick [1985] report that the evidence against the Euler restrictions

is strongest in periods of aggregate economic recession.


   If aggregate consumption is the sum of consumption by liquidity con-

strained households and consumption by unconstrained households, then

the aggregate marginal propensity to consume out of transitory income



                                 -1â€”
should be an average of one (for the constrained individuals) and a

small positive number (for the unconstrained) with weights dependent on

the fraction of all consumers who actually are constrained. It is un-

fortunate then that there currently appears to be no model which ex-

plains the determinants of the percentage of households which fall into

each class. For example, previous studies of optimal consumption in the

presence of capital market imperfections (e.g. Flemming [1973], Heller

and Starr [1979] )3 have not explicitly modeled the probability that a

given individual will be constrained nor considered the determinants of

the aggregate fraction of consumers who are constrained. This paper at-

tempts to at least partially fill this gap. The approach adopted is to

study the distribution of assets across households when there are bor-

rowing restrictions and income uncertainty. It is shown that each peri-

od a positive fraction of the population of consumers will find them-

selves wealth constrained, while the remaining fraction will not be so

constrained and will appear to behave according to the life-cycle, per-

manent income hypothesis. The aggregate marginal propensity to consume

out of transitory income is shown to be directly related to the fraction

of all consumers who are wealth constrained, and this fraction is shown

to exhibit positive serial correlation in response to serially unc.orre-

lated income disturbances.


   To constrast sharply with the perfect capital market assumption of

the standard permanent income formulation, the model developed here as-

sumes that consumers cannot borrow against any future income receipts.

Current consumption is therefore limited by current resources. Excess

sensitivity of aggregate consumption then arises because some consumers



                                 -2-
find their current wealth to be insufficient to finance their desired

level of consumption. The evidence from the rec.ent Survey of Consumer

Finances [1984] suggests that a significant fraction of American fami-

lies have levels of financial asset holdings which, in the absence of

the ability to borrow against future labor income, would be insufficient

to insulate consumption from even moderate declines in current income.

F'or example, in 1983, 12% of all families, and 34% of those with incomes

less than $10,000, reported no financial assets. Almost 40% of all fam-

ilies reported fiiiancial asset holdings of less than $10O0. It seems

quite plausible to expect that consumption for a nonnegligible fraction

of the population would be forced to move quite closely with fluctua-

tions in current income.


  The basic choice problem facing the individual consumer is similar to

that analyzed by Sibley [1975], Schechtman [1976], Schechtman and Es-

cudero [1977], and Bewley [1977], and their results will be drawn upon.

The focus of these authors has been the optimal consumption plan of an

individual consumer facing income uncertainty.5 In the formulations of

Schechtman [1976 and Bewley [1977], for example, no borrowing is al-

lowed. They both show, however, that in the limit as the individual's

planning horizon goes to infinity and the subjective rate of time pref-

erence goes to zero, the consumer holds enough wealth to completely

self-insure against any income fluctuations. In this case, the borrow-

ing restriction is never binding. As will be discussed in section I,

this result would seem to be inconsistent with the empirical evidence.

In addition, none of these authors consider the aggregate implications

of borrowing restrictions.



                                 -3-
   The present paper, like those of Lucas [1980] and Clarida [l984J, is

directed towards the aggregate implications of the consumer's choice

problem. Both Lucas [1980} and Clarida [1984] find that the distribu-

tion function of money balances (the single asset in their models) has a

mass point at the minimum value necessary to finance consumption. By

providing a new interpretation of this characteristic of the distribu-

tion of asset holdings, the present paper shows how the empirical re-

suits found by Hall and Mishkin [1982], Hayashi [1982] and Flavin [1984]

might arise. The contribution of the present paper, besides providing a

reinterpretation of earlier results which is consistent with recent em-

pirical findings, is to examine the determinants of the fraction of con-

sumers who are wealth constrained. In addition, by assuming that tran-

sitory income fluctuations have both an individual specific and a common

(business cycle) component, it is shown how the aggregate excess sensi-

tivity of consumption to transitory income is generated as a function of

the endogenously determined fraction of consumers who are constrained.


  The consumer's basic choice problem is discussed in the next section,

and the optimal consumption plan of the individual is studied. Section

II shows that the distribution of wealth across individuals converges to

a unique stationary distribution when income shocks are individual spe-

cific and aggregate transitory income is zero.     This distribution is

used to derive the fraction of consumers who will become wealth con-

strained each period.    Optimal consumption and the distribution of

wealth with a wealth in advance requirement are compared, in section

III, to the outcomes which would arise if borrowing were allowed. Ag-

gregate consumption in the presence of an economy-wide component to



                                 -4-
transitory income is examined in section IV. Section V contains the pa-

per's conclusions.                                         -




I.   The Individual Consumer


     This section sets up the problem facing each consumer and shows that

there is a critical value of spendable resources such that consumers

with assets less than this value are wealth constrained. The consumer's

choice problem is fairly standard (see Sibley [1975], Yaari [1976],

Schechtman [1976], Bewley [1977], Schechtman and Escudero [1977], Lucas

[1980], Clarida [1984]). Consequently, the proofs of some of the propo-

sitions are omitted. The focus of the present analysis, unlike that of

earlier work, is on deriving the probability an individual will find the

restriction against borrowing to be binding.


     The economy studied consists of a large number of identical, inf i-

nitely lived individuals. Only one asset, assumed for simplicity to be

noninterest bearing, is available to wealth holders, and current con-

sumption must be financed by either beginning of period holdings of this

asset or current income receipts. The asset can be thought of as non-

depreciating storage, although Bewley [1980], Lucas [1980] and Clarida

[1984] prefer to call it money. Individuals have preferences given by


                                       E { ZÂ°0   t()                          (1)



The function u( )         is   taken to be bounded, twice continously differentia-

ble, strictly increasing, strictly concave in c, with lim u (c) =
                                                           c                , and
urn u       (c) =   0.   The discount rate       is restricted to lie between 0 and
'â€”      C

1.

                                            -5-
  At the start of each period, the ith individual receives an endowment

equal to y + E. +   u,   where y is a nonstochastic income payment (perma-

nent income), and c. and u are independently distributed, serially un-

correlated random variables with zero means.             Both c and     u   represent

transitory income, with c equalling an idiosyncratic shock while u is a

shock common to all individuals. Let the cumulative distribution func-

tions of E. and u be given by S( ) and G( ), respectively. While the

realizations of the idiosyncratic income shock will differ across indi-

viduals, the distribution from which they are drawn is common to all

consumers. The support of t     is   taken to be the closed interval [c,E},

while that of u is the closed interval [u,Ã¼].            In addition, it is as-

sumed that y +    + U > 0,   so that each individual's endowment is strict-

ly positive for all possible realizations of transitory income.


  Because c and u are i.i.d., the consumer cares only about their sum.

This would not be the case, for example, if either were Markov with

transition probabilities dependent on the current realizations. Even

though each individual's consumption depends only on C           + u,   the distinc-

tion between individual specific and common transitory income will be

needed in order to consider how aggregate consumption responds to aggre-

gate income fluctuations. Define        =   c   + u. Then the support of           is

  +u,E +U], and



                  Prob[      '} =   fUS(u)dG(u)      =   F(').


   If w, is the individual's wealth at the start of period t, prior to

the receipt of the current income endowment, the borrowing restriction

can be written as

                                     -6-
                                                                       (2)



where A denotes currently available spendable resources. The budget

constraint faced by the consumer takes the form


                                                    +   +              (3)
                                               Ct


If the individual's asset holdings, A, are identified with money, equa-

tion (2) is a cash-in-advance constraint. The practical implication of

(2) is that current income can be spent in the current period but future

income cannot. Each individual enters the current period with a level

of wealth determined by past income realizations and spending flows.

The individual then observes ,     the current shock to income. A level of
current consumption is then chosen. Finally, the consumer carries over

into the next period A -   c.

   Let ' denote next period's income shock, and define v(A) as the op-

timal value function for a consumer who has initial spendableresour.ces

A and acts to maximize (1) subject to (2) and (3). The following propo-

sition is proven by Lucas [1980, Prop. 1, p. 136J:




   Proposition 1: There exists a unique, bounded, continuous function

v(A), strictly concave in A, such that


               v(A) = max {     u(c)   +   I    v(A-c+y+')dF(')   }    (4)
                      cA




                                       â€”7â€”
   Letting p and ) denote the Lagrangian multiplers associated with the

constraints (2) and (3) respectively, the first order conditions for

utility maximization, together with the envelope theorem, imply


                          vA(A)=P+X (X ifc<A)                          (5)



                          u(c)p+X (=X ifc<A)                           (6)



                       $EvA(A') =   X                                  (7)



together with (2) and (3).   The individual will be described as wealth

constrained if p > 0 in which case c = A.         From (6) and (7), u(c) >

EvA(A') for a constrained consumer.       This implies that the consumer

would experience a rise in total utility if he/she were able to exchange

a unit of future wealth for a unit of current consumption. The borrow-

ing prohibition prevents the consumer from doing this. Equations (5) -

(7) imply Euc(c')/u(c)    1, with strict equality holding for uncon-

strained consumers. Hansen and Singleton [1983] find, using data on ag-

gregate U.S. consumption, that they can reject the null hypothesis that

Euc = uc â€¢6   With borrowing restrictions, Eu < u for constrained con-
                                              c      c
sumers, and the presence of such constrained individuals may explain the

results Hansen and Singleton obtain. Such an interpretation is support-

ed by the empirical work of Zeldes [1984].


   In order for the presence of borrowing restrictions to explain these

empirical results, it is necessary to verify that there will be some

consumers for whom (2) actually is a binding constraint. Otherwise,

u(c') =   u(c)   for all consumers, and Zeldes' [19841 results could not

be captured in the present model. For example, Schechtman [1976] and



                                    -8-
Bewley [1977) both show, using a very similar framework, that in a fi-

nite horizon model the stationary value of A, approaches          as both the

horizon and l/(lâ€”) go to .          Each consumer completely self-insures

against transitory income fluctuations, and, in the stationary state,

(2) is never binding for any consumer.


   It will be useful to have an explicit representation of optimal con-

sumption behavior by the individual consumer.




  Proposition 2: There exists a unique, continuous function c(A) such

that CA > 0, and


               v(A) =   u(c(A)) +   f   v(A-c(A)+y+')dF(').




  Proof: See Lucas [14, Prop. 2, p. 137] for a proof of the uniqueness

and continuity parts of the proposition. From (5) and (6), vA(A) =

u(c(A))   for all A.    The strict Concavity of v implies that c(A) is

strictly Increasing in A.




  Each individual enters the period with some predetermined level of w.

Each individual also knows the value of permanent income, y. For some

realizations of ,   current   available resources, A        w + y +   i, may   be

insufficient to allow the desired level of consumption to be achieved

without violating the constraint (2).         The rest of this section will

demonstrate that there exists a         such that for all    <   the individ-

ual is constrained. Then, the probability of being constrained is just



                                    -9-
F("). The basic intuition behind this result is straightforward. Sup-

pose the transitory income realization equals " <             0.   Spendable re-

sources, A, fall below their expected value by the full amount .             How-

ever, desired consumption should decline less since           is purely transi-

tory income. A lower realization of transitory income reduces spendable

resources more than it reduces desired consumption, and A - c falls with

.     For some sufficiently low realization of , say          ,    the optimal c
will exactly equal A.


     To show this more formally, define A* as the solution to


                        u(A*) =
                                   EvA(y+').                                   (8)


Given the assumed properties of the utility function and the distribu-

tion of â€¢, such an A exists, since the right hand side of (8) is finite

and    independent of A while the left hand side is monotonic in A, urn0
u (A) =
â€¢0
          , and   urn u (A) = 0.   Then, from (5) -    (7),   if A =   A*, the op-
timal value of current consumption is c = A.        If A < A*, the constraint

c     A will become binding:


     Proposition 3: The borrowing constraint is binding if and only if A

< A.


     Proof: Write the right side of (8) as V where V is independent of

A. Suppose for some A > A the individual is constrained. Then c                 A,

      0, and u(A)     V. But u(A) < u(A*) =           V   if A > A which is a

contradiction. Now suppose A < A*. Then c(A)           A < A* and


                          u(c(A))       u(A) > u(A*)

                                               =   = EvA(y+')
                                    -   10 -
since A -     c(A)    0 and VA 5 nonincreasing.                      But from (6) and (7) this

implies i     > 0.    Finally, for A =     A*,     c(A)             A and   =   0, so the borrow-
ing constraint is not strictly binding.




   Since A = w + y +       c, the     following is immediate:


   Proposition 4: For all w > w* =             A        -
                                                            y   -
                                                                    , p = 0.
   Any individual with beginning of period wealth greater than w* will

not be constrained, since even with the lowest transitory income reali-

zation, the individual has enough spendable resources to finance desired

consumption.


   Similarly, define w**             A* -y -




   Proposition 5: For all w <            w,    i       > 0.

   Individuals with w <         w** will be constrained even with the largest
possible realization of income, since, for them, w +                        y   + <   A*.

   For all w,           < w <   w,    we can define


                             Ã˜(w,A*) =      A      -    w-    y.                              (9)


If an individual with wealth w7 receives an income shock                              <

then   A <   A*,   and the individual will be constrained.                       gives the crit-

ical value of transitory income, as a function of beginning of period




                                          - 11 -
wealth and A*, such that the consumer finds the borrowing restriction

binding if and   only   if   <




   Proposition   6: The probability an individual with beginning of peri-

od wealth w will be constrained is F(*).


   In Figure 1, the function *(w,A*) is illustrated, together with the

associated probability of being constrained. In the right hand panel of

the figure, , which is linear in w, declines from the value             when w

w (Proposition 5) to         when w       w (Proposition 4). If an individual

has wealth equal to w1, for example, he/she will be constrained if

     The left hand panel, which plots the cumulative distribution func-

tion of , shows that the probability of being constrainted is F1. This

probability is nonincreasing in w.


   Equation (9) shows that an increase in A increases *          for   each w and

shifts the * locus in Figure 1 to the right. The shift is a parallel

one as w and w both increase by the same amount as the rise in A*.

Thus, the probability of being constrained in nondecreasing in A*.


   As of yet, it has not been shown that any consumers will have levels

of wealth less than w. It could be the case that all consumers accumu-

late enough wealth to insure that the borrowing constraint never binds.

For all consumers, the probability of being constrained would then be

zero. For example, it has already been mentioned that in a similar mod-

el with no discounting of future utility (            = 1),   Schechtman [1976]

shows that A converges almost surely to .           A then can never fall below

A*, and (2) is never binding.

   Alternatively, if A* = 0, the constraint never binds since A cannot

fall below zero. To see when A* might equal zero, rewrite (8), making

use of (5) and (6), as


                           u(A) =     Eu(c(y+'))
                                     = J u(c(y+.'))dF()

                                       < u(y+) < u(y+fl.                         (8t)


From (8) it follows immediately that A* > y + > 0. However, this re-

sult depended on the assumption that u(y+) < .                 Suppose instead that

the endowment can equal zero with positive probability. Then, since

u(0) =       , the   consumer will insure that spendable resources exceed zero

by always consuming strictly less than A if there is any probability of

the endowment in the next period equalling zero. More specifically, if

f( )    is   the density function of ,




   Proposition       7:   If urn u (y+)f() =
                                 C                 , then   A* =   0.

   Proof:       Under the stated conditions, Eu(y+') =              , so   that, from

(9'), u(A) =         . Hence,   A* = 0.




   Proposition 8:         Given an individual's current spendable resources,

the probability of being constrained is nondecreasing in permanent in-

come.

   Proof: From (8) and Proposition 1, Ev(y+') =                         V       is decreasing in

y. Hence, A* is increasing in y. From (9),, is nondecreasing in A*.

Since F( )   is   a nondecreasing function, F() is nondecreasing in y.




   A rise in future permanent income leads to a rise in current desired

consumption. With current spendable resources fixed, this rise in de-

sired consumption tends to increase the probability that the constraint

(2) will be binding. The probability of becoming constrained in the fu-

ture is   also    affected by decisions about consumption in the current

period. For consumers who are not constrained in the current period, a

decision to increase current consumption will increase the probability

of becoming constrained in the next period. This probability is given

by the probability that           A* - w'   -

y, this is nondecreasing in c.


  As was shown previously, constrained consumers will violate' the Euler

equations commonly assumed to characterize optimal consumption choice.

Equations (5)       (7) can be rearranged to yield



                                  u(c+1) 'u(c) + t+l                                        (10)

X 'is a vector of variables observable at time t or earlier. Kotlikoff

and Pakas [1984] provide a general discussion of the implications of the

standard form of the first order Euler equation. These tests have at-

tempted to exploit the implication of efficient linear predictors that




                                     -   14 -
     should be unforecastable on the basis of any information known at

time t. In particular, E(+1 /                  = 0,   so that     should be serially

uncorrelated. This result no longer holds if any consumers are wealth

constrained. From (10),                =                 0, with strict inequality

for constrained consumers.      Such a result in cross-sectional data is

consistent with Zeldes [1984].        Since           is a decreasing function of

current transitory income,8 E(+1 /         )>0          for constrained consumers.

When transitory income is added to a regression equation based on (10),

it should have a positive coefficient. This is what Flavin [1984] finds

with aggregate data.


   In addition,    will itself be positively serially correlated since a

consumer constrained during period t carries no assets into period t+1

and thereby increases the probability that                   will be positive. Sup-

pose it+l is the probability consumer                 will be constrained during
                  =                                      >   0, then       =   0, and

      =   F((0,A*))    >   F((w,A))    for all w > 0.           Being constrained at

time t increases the probability of being constrained at time t+l. This

raises the expected value of both                and t+2 This serial correla-

tion in the probability of being constrained arises even though the un-

derlying income shocks are i.i.d.




II. The Distribution of Assets With No Common Shock


   By itself, knowledge of the probability an individual consumer will

become constrained, as a function of the consumer's wealth, is of limit-

ed usefulness for understanding aggregate consumption. This is because



                                  - 15     -
the fraction of all consumers who find the borrowing restriction to be

binding will depend on the distribution of wealth across the population

of consumers. In this section, the stationary state fraction of consum-

ers who will actually be constrained is derived for the case in which

there is no aggregate uncertainty. All income shocks are taken to be

idiosyncratic, with the common shock, u, identically zero. The case in

which u has a nondegenerate distribution is considered in section IV.


   At the beginning of each period, there will be some distribution of A

f'(A) equals the fraction of the total population of consumers with be-
ginning of period wealth plus current income less than or equal to A.

The subsequent consumption decisions and realizations for each individu-

al of transitory income result in a new distribution of wealth plus in-

come for the following period.        It will be shown that there exists a

stationary distribution to which any initial distribution of A converg-

positive fraction of all consumers will in fact be constrained each

period. Define

F is the expected fraction of the population of consumers who will expe-

rience a binding wealth constraint. With a continuum of consumers, r is

also the fraction who will actually be constrained.

   Equation (13) suggests that changes in any of the factors exogenous

to the model can potentially affect the fracti,on.-of constrained consurn-

ers in either of two ways. First, for a given distribution of A across

the population of consumers, anything which affects A will cause F to

change. Second, if the stationary state distribution of A is affected,

r will also change..     For example, for a given 'Y( ),            Proposition       8 im-

plies that a rise in y will increase A, by increasing desired current

consumption, and cause 1' to rise. However, a rise in real permanent in-

come will also shift the distribution of wealth to the right.                         In the

new steady state, fewer consumers will have levels of spendable resourc-

es less than or equal to any given value of A. This fall in the frac-

tion of consumers with low A's will tend to reduce r. The net effect

depends on the relative magnitudes of these two opposing influences. In

the special case of constant relative risk aversion and income shocks

proportional to permanent income, the steady state fraction of consumers

who become constrained is independent of the level of permanent income:

state value of r is independent of y.


   Proof: We first show that the distribution of z =                A/y   is homogeneous

of degree zero in y and that A(y) is homogeneous of degree one in y.

It then follows that F(y) = Prob(z            A*(y)/y)        Prob(z      A*(Xy)/Xy)

r(y) for any X > 0.        Write c(A,y) to make explicit the dependence of

consumption on y.       Given the assumed form of the utility function,

c(XA,Xy) =   )c(A,y).   Let H(z) denote the c.d.f. of z for given y.

   The fraction of consumers who become constrained each period will de-

pend on the utility discount factor .               A rise in the subjective rate of

discount ( a fall in ) makes current consumption more urgent.                           This

both increases the probability of being constrained for any given ini-

tial distribution of A and shifts the distribution of A towards lower

asset levels. Both effects work to raise r in the new steady state.

This leads to

III. Consumption With and Without a Borrowing Restriction


   Unconstrained consumers, those with A              A*, appear to be choosing

consumption in a manner consistent with the standard form of the life-

cycle, permanent income hypothesis. For them, the first order Euler

equations are satisfied with equality. This does not imply that uncon-

strained consumers, in a wealth-in-advance world, behave identically to

consumers in a world where borrowing against future income is possible.

In this section, the optimal consumption function derived in section I,

c(A), and the stat.ionary distribution of a, 'Y*(A), will be compaed to

the outcomes which would arise if borrowing were allowed.


   Schechtman and Escudero [1977] provide some results which are rele-

vant for a comparison of optimal consumption with and without a borrow-

ing constraint. Let c'(A) be the optimal consumption function of a con-

sumer with spendable resources A who maximizes (1) subject to (3) and

the solvency condition lim tAt              0. Then Lemma 3.6 in Schechtman and

sumes no more than a similar consumer not faced with the constraint (2).

Because consumers facing borrowing restrictions are unable to borrow to

maintain consumption in the face of a low realization of transitory in-

come, they will tend to consume less, as a function of A, for two rea-

sons. First, if A < A*, they are directly constrained by (2) and are

forced to consume less than they desire. Second, they will tend to con-

sume less even when unconstrained in order to accumulate wealth as a

means of insuring against low realizations of transitory income. This

results in a distribution of A that is to the right of that which would

arise in a stationary state in the absence of (2). This is proven in




   Proposition 14:         ''*(A)        T'(A) where "          is   the stationary distribu-

tion of A in the absence of (2).

IV.    Aggregate Consumption With a Common Income Shock


      It order to derive the stationary distribution of assets, it was nec-

essary to suppress the common income shock, u, which had originally been

introduced in section I.              However, in order to analyze how aggregate

consumption responds to transitory fluctuations in aggregate income, it

is necessary to reintroduce u. This implies, however, that the distri-

bution of spendable resources across the population will vary over time

as a function of the realizations of u.


      Suppose tit(Avt) is the fraction of consumers with spendable resources

less than or equal to Alt at time t. The fraction with resources less

than or equal to A1t at. time t+1, 'i'+1(A"), is given by


                      =   I   S[A't   - A   -              -y   + c(A))d'f(A).     (14)


Thus,          )   depends on the actual realization of the aggregate income

shock at time t+l. Since SC )                   is   nondecreasing, a higher     shifts

the entire distribution of AÃ·i to the right: YÃ·1(A) is nondecreasing

in


      Since the fraction of constrained consumers is equal to the fraction

with spendable resources less than A*, r will now vary in response to

transitory aggregate income shocks as such shocks affect the distribu-

tion of A.     It is necessary, then, to add a time subscript to r:                   =




                                                - 23   -
            From the definition of A in equation (9), it is clear that A*

depends on the probability distribution of the common shock (since' ' =

c'   +   Ut), but    A is independent of the current realization of u. Thus,

the period t        realization   of u affects Ft only through its effect on

the distribution of A* across consumers.




     Proposition 15: The fraction of constrained consumers is a nonin-

creasing function of the contemporaneous aggregate income shock.


     Proof: Since S( )       is    a nondecreasing cumulative distribution func-

tion, equation (14) implies


                        ar/au =

                                  = -J
                                         St[A-u-A-y-c(A))di(A)




     Not surprisingly, a positive transitory income shock that is common

to all consumers increases the level of spendable resources available to

each consumer and thereby reduces the fraction of consumers who find the

borrowing restriction to be binding.


     Even though the shocks are i.i.d., they induce a pattern of serial

correlation in I'. For example, a positive u. reduces Ft and shifts

         to the right, relative to the outcomes which would result if aggre-

gate transitory income were zero. The shift in TÃ·1 implies a fall in
             =            A positive income shock, because it is partially
                 r+1.

saved, leaves consumers with more assets in the next period. This re-

duces the probability an individual will become constrained, and, in the

aggregate the fraction actually constrained falls.




   Proposition 16: rÃ·1 is nonincreasing in Ut.


   Proof: Integrating (14) by parts yields


               = S[A*-Ay+c(A)] + J S'[A-A-y+c(A)][l-c'(A)]T(A)


where A is the minimum A such that 'f(A) = 1.     Differentiating with re-

spect to


                      = J                                   0

since          < 0.




   Heller and Starr [1979) show that individual consumers facing a bind-

ing liquidity constraint exhibit excess sensitivity to transitory in-

come. The empirical evidence cited in the introduction suggested that

aggregate consumption displays such excess sensitivity. Aggregate per

capita consumption, C, is given by



                            C r c(A)dT(A)
                              =
                                  2 AdT(A)   +
                                                 J   c(A)dt(A)         (15)



where A    0 is defined such that ''(A)   0.     The contribution to          of


the constrained consumers is equal to J' Ad(A), while the uncon-


strained contribute f c(A)d(A). All consumers with A < A* are con-
strained. However, since the realizations of transitory income are par-

tially individual specific, not all consumers who begin the period with

equal values of w are constrained (unless w <            w*).   In general, the

fraction of all consumers with wealth w who become constrained is

F((w,A)) =           S((w,A)-u).      The marginal propensity to consume out of

wealth is equal to one for the constrained group. The second term in

(15) is the consumption of those consumers whose initial wealth plus

current income exceeds A*.            From Proposition 3, such individuals will

not be constrained during the current period.


         To assess the excess sensitivity of consumption in the presence of

borrowing restrictions, consider two individuals, i and j, who begin the

period with the same level of wealth: w.             w.. Suppose the transitory

income realizations are such that w.+y+. < A* <            w.+y+.,   so that i is

constrained while j is not. Since c'(A) < 1 for all A           A*, while c'(A)

=    1    for A <   A*, individual i clearly responds more to a small variation
in         than does j. In addition, the binding wealth constraint will make

i less sensitivity to variations in future permanent income.           (See Hell-

er and Starr [1979].) The presence of constrained consumers will make

aggregate consumption more sensitive to current transitory income and

less sensitive to future expected income.


         From (15), the aggregate marginal propensity to consume out of cur-

rent aggregate transitory income can be written as


                                  =
                                      (A)    +
                                                   cA(A)dT(A)

                                  =
                                        + '2 cA(A)dT(A).                    (16)




                                        -   26 -
The marginal propensity to consume out of transitory income depends di-

rectly on the fraction of consumers facing a, binding borrowing restric-

tion. Since income shocks have all been assumed to be i.i.d., one might

expect the second term in (16) to be close to zero.9 Then the aggregate

marginal propensity to consume out of transitory income is simply a

measure of the fraction of consumers who are constrained and is not a

measure of the slope of any representative consumer's optimal consump-

tion function.


    Equation (16) is an intuitively obvious result:          if aggregate con-

sumption is the sum of consumption by liquidity constrained households

and consumption by unconstrained households, the aggregate marginal pro-

pensity to consume out of transitory income is an average of one and a

small positive number, with weights dependent on the fraction of all

households who actually are constrained. The second term in (16) is not

quite 1 - t' times a constant since unconstrained households haye differ-

ing levels of wealth and marginal propensities to consume out of transi-

tory income. The preceding analysis, however, suggests that it is not

legitimate to model aggregate consumption as an average of the consump-

tion of a representative constrained household and the consumption of a

representative unconstrained household with fixed weights.          The weight

in such an average is itself a function of aggregate transitory income.

r   falls   in response to positive transitory income and rises in response

to negative transitory income. Since the aggregate marginal propensity

to consume is an increasing function of r,      it   will be less than   the val-
ue that would be implied by the use of a fixed, cyclical average, value
for   r.

V. Conclusions


       A number of recent empirical studies have re-evaluated the permanent

income-life cycle model of consumption using the insights provided by

the assumption of rational expectations.                                          These studies, using both

cross-sectional panel arid time series data from the U.S., generally re-

ject the implications of the standard formulation of the optimal con-

sumption choice problem. Instead, the data seems to be consistent with

the presence of some consumers who face binding borrowing restrictions.

come uncertainty in which, each period, some fraction of all consumers

do face a binding constraint which limits their current consumption.

Even though all consumers are prohibited from borrowing against future

income, the behavior of some consumers appears consistent with the

life-cycle, permanent income hypothesis. Aggregate consumption is an

average of the consumption of these two groups. The model would seem to

be consistent with the empirical results obtained by Hall and Flishkin

[1982], Hayashi [1982], and Flavin [1984].


       Allowing for a common, transitory income shock, it was shown that the

aggregate marginal propensity to consume is directly related to the

fraction of all consumers who are constrained. Since this fraction was

shown to exhibit positive serial correlation in response to i.i.d. in-

come shocks, consumption will be correlated will both current and lagged

transitory income.


       The analysis has been predicated on the assumption that individuals

are unable to borrow against their future endowments. This restriction



                                                     - 28       -
on borrowing is designed to capture the intuitive notion that individu-

als are limited in their ability to borrow against future labor income.

The assumption that no borrowing is possible is made to contrast sharply

with the standard life-cycle formulation which allows consumers, if they

so desire, to divorce consumption completely from the time pattern of

income. While not crucial for present purposes, for other issues it may

be important to model explicitly the underlying factors which make it

difficult for individuals to issue unsecured liabilities against their

future labor income. For example,. if permanent income is individual

specific and unobservable, credit rationing may arise along the lines

analyzed by Stiglitz and Weiss [1981).
