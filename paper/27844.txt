                                         ABSTRACT

We study international currency risk in a two-country dynamic stochastic general equilibrium
model under incomplete markets. The underlying sources of risk are direct shocks to productivity
growth, shocks to a long-run risk component of productivity growth, shocks to a stochastic
volatility component of productivity growth, and shocks to monetary policy. The long-run risk
and stochastic volatility shocks have the interpretation of aggregate demand shocks. Cross-
country heterogeneity in the model arises from three sources: differences in the long-run risk and
stochastic volatility process parameters that we estimate using United States and Japanese total
factor productivity data, differences in monetary policy parameters, and differences in export
pricing. The driving force behind currency risk is heterogeneity in precautionary saving.
Differences in monetary policy can generate moderate currency risk, but structural differences in
productivity growth are more important. Export pricing conventions are not important sources of
currency risk. Stochastic volatility shocks are key to generating volatility in the currency risk
premium, but they do not help at all in explaining the forward premium bias/anomaly.

Introduction
We study international currency risk in a two-country dynamic stochastic general equilibrium
(DSGE) model under incomplete markets. The underlying sources of risk are direct shocks to
productivity growth, shocks to a long-run risk component of productivity growth, shocks to a
stochastic volatility component of productivity growth, and shocks to monetary policy. Stochastic
volatility shocks and long-run risk shocks can be viewed as aggregate demand shocks. Currency
risk only emerges under structural cross-country heterogeneity. The heterogeneity we examine is
due to empirically motivated differences in the long-run risk and stochastic volatility parameters
governing productivity growth, differences in the conduct of monetary policy, and differences in
export pricing practices. We find that differences in monetary policy generate moderate currency
risk, but structural differences in productivity growth are potentially more important. Export
pricing conventions­the currency in which export prices are set­are not important sources of
currency risk. Stochastic volatility shocks are key to generating volatility in the currency risk
premium, but they do not help at all in explaining the forward premium bias/anomaly.1
    Agents in the model have recursive utility (Epstein and Zin (1989) and Weil (1989)). The
specific functional form we use is from Swanson (2019). Export pricing by producer currency
pricing (PCP), local currency pricing (LCP), and dominant currency pricing (DCP) are evaluated.
The parameters of the long-run risk and stochastic volatility processes are estimated from total
factor productivity growth for the United States and Japan. We choose the United States because
the U. S. dollar typically serves as the dominant currency under DCP and Japan because the
Japanese yen is a typical funding currency in the carry trade. In the model, we refer to country 1 as
the United States and country 2 as Japan. Also in the model, currency risk and the compensation
for bearing that risk are measured by the strength of the forward premium bias/anomaly, the
currency excess return from shorting the Japanese yen and going long the U.S. dollar, and the carry
trade excess return. We also examine the extent to which the model explains the consumption
correlation puzzle (Backus et al. (1992)) and the Backus and Smith (1993) puzzle, which are
auxiliary markers of risk sharing (or lack thereof).
    The primary mechanism driving the currency risk premium in our model is differential pre-
cautionary saving. A relatively more procyclical monetary policy in Japan, for example, stabilizes
its economy relative to the United States. The higher economic volatility in the United States
relative to Japan raises the desire for precautionary saving by people in the United States who
want to go long U.S. dollar denominated bonds. An excess return from shorting the Japanese
yen denominated bonds and using the proceeds to go long the U.S. dollar denominated bonds
emerges. As in Ready et al. (2017), and perhaps a bit unintuitively, the relatively stable country
   1
    Popularized by Fama (1984), the forward premium bias refers to a slope coefficient, from regressing the one-step
ahead change in the log country 1 price of country 2's currency on the interest rate differential between countries
1 and 2, that lies between zero and one. The forward premium anomaly refers to when the slope coefficient is
negative. We refer to this regression as the Fama regression and the slope as F ama .

(Japan) pays the currency risk premium. One might think that because the stable country is
safe, its currency would serve as a hedge asset and earn a negative excess return. Instead, the
relatively stable country tends to pay the excess return.
    We first show that export pricing conventions (PCP, LCP, and DCP) are not significant
drivers of currency risk. If you set identical parameters for monetary policy rules and productivity
growth in both countries, the model generates minuscule carry trade and currency excess returns,
and a small forward premium bias, regardless of the currency in which export prices are set.
Setting Japan's monetary policy to be relatively more procyclical (increasing its interest rate
responsiveness to the output gap) while keeping the productivity process parameters symmetric
across countries substantially decreases the excess return from shorting the Japanese yen and going
long the U.S. dollar (Japan pays the premium). This confirms a key result from Backus et al.
(2020)'s complete markets endowment model. Their mechanism was that Japan's relatively more
procyclical monetary policy increases Japan's inflation risk by lowering the correlation between
consumption and inflation. The increased inflation risk also occurs in our model, but we have the
added mechanism of monetary policy stabilization, which is absent in Backus et al. (2020) because
their exogenous consumption growth is unaffected by monetary policy. Backus et al. (2020)'s
second main result is that if Japan's monetary policy is relatively more accommodating to inflation
(the inflation response coefficient is lower than that for the United States), it will further affect the
joint consumption-inflation dynamics by lowering the correlation, and in their model, reinforces
the excess return. In our production model, however, we get the opposite result. Relative inflation
accommodation in Japan's monetary policy has a trivial effect on Japan's consumption-inflation
correlation, but, it is destabilizing in that it increases output growth volatility. This increases
the desire for precautionary saving by people in Japan. Instead of Japan paying the currency
risk premium as in Backus et al. (2020), the United States pays the premium. The extent of
cross-country monetary policy heterogeneity that we investigate generates a modest currency risk
premium and forward premium bias, but does not bring about the forward premium anomaly.
    We next investigate the role of real cross-country heterogeneity. We show that empirically
motivated heterogeneity in the productivity growth process is an important source of currency
risk­potentially more important than reasonable differences in monetary policy. In the data,
Japan's productivity growth is more volatile than the United States. We estimate a long-run
risk and stochastic volatility process for productivity growth for both countries. We introduce
productivity heterogeneity by setting the productivity parameters equal to the country estimates.
If monetary policy is kept symmetric across countries, the currency risk premium paid by the
United States becomes reasonably large (1.52% per annum under DCP), and generates the forward
premium anomaly, with a Fama slope coefficient of -1.37 (under DCP).
    While the model shows variation in export pricing conventions (LCP, PCP, or DCP) does not
matter for currency risk, it does matter for trade-related variables (terms of trade and balance



                                                   2
of trade), especially in response to monetary policy shocks. This is why Gopinath et al. (2020)'s
paper on DCP focuses on the effect of monetary policy shocks on trade variables. We find that
long-run risk shocks in our model can be interpreted as aggregate demand shocks in the sense
that a positive shock raises output and inflation. Long-run risk shocks also contribute towards
explaining the forward premium bias/anomaly. Stochastic volatility shocks in our model, as in
Xu (2016) and Leduc and Liu (2016), are also aggregate demand shocks in the sense that an
increase in uncertainty depresses output and inflation. Stochastic volatility shocks also make a
large contribution to currency risk premium volatility, but they do not help to explain the forward
premium bias.
    The model has several other qualities that are generally consistent with the data. Cross-
country correlations of consumption growth are very low (near zero) and under DCP and LCP,
lie below cross-country output growth correlations. The implied risk-sharing index is in the range
computed by Brandt et al. (2006). The real exchange rate depreciation is very highly correlated
with the nominal exchange rate depreciation (correlation is -0.936 under DCP). However, the
model does fall short in certain dimensions. Most notably, it cannot generate enough volatility in
inflation and the exchange rate depreciation.
    The remainder of the paper is as follows. The next section discusses related literature. Sec-
tion 2 provides a brief presentation of the model. Section 3 reports our estimates of the pro-
ductivity growth processes for the United States and Japan. The features of the data that we
focus on explaining are presented in Section 4. The main results from the model are presented in
Section 5 and Section 6 concludes.


1    Related Literature
In terms of investigating the role of monetary policy, we draw comparisons to Backus et al. (2020).
They study how cross-country differences in monetary policy create currency risk in a two-country,
complete markets, endowment model where exogenous consumption growth is driven by a long-
run risk and stochastic volatility process. They present two elegant and important results­Japan
pays the currency risk premium if Japan's monetary policy is relatively a) more procyclical or
b) more accommodating to inflation. We confirm that their first result also holds in a production
economy, but their second result does not. We discuss these points further below.
    In terms of investigating the importance of real structural heterogeneity across countries, we
draw comparisons to Benigno et al. (2012) and Ready et al. (2017). Benigno et al. (2012) assume
recursive utility and include a stochastic volatility component into a global productivity factor,
but they do not have a long-run risk component. They also employ their model to study the
effect of volatility and monetary policy shocks on the forward premium puzzle/anomaly. Our
paper shares the mechanism of macroeconomic instability and precautionary saving in driving
the currency risk premium with Ready et al. (2017).

                                                3
    Combining recursive preferences with long-run risk and stochastic volatility processes is com-
mon in studies of international financial markets. Until recently, this has typically been done in
an endowment economy framework. Bansal and Shaliastovich (2012) incorporate long-run risk
and stochastic volatility in consumption growth and inflation. They focused on bond prices and
not on the currency risk premium or the forward premium bias/anomaly. David et al. (2016)
employ a similar structure to study average returns to capital in emerging markets. Kollmann
(2016) models a stochastic volatility component in consumption growth to study international risk
sharing. Colacito et al. (2018a) is a multi-country endowment model where consumption growth
is a long-run risk and stochastic volatility process and is used to explain how the cross-section
of currency risk premia emerge from cross-country variation in exposure to global endowment
shocks. Consumption growth in Backus et al. (2020) is also a long-run risk and stochastic volatil-
ity process.
    Our paper is part of an open economy modeling literature that features recursive utility in
production models. In our model, productivity growth is subject to three shocks­a direct shock,
a shock to the long-run risk component, and a shock to the stochastic volatility component.
In contrast, productivity in Tretvoll (2018), Mumtaz and Theodoridis (2017), Berg and Mark
(2019), and Kollmann (2019) is a cointegrated random walk. Productivity growth in Colacito
et al. (2018b) has a long-run risk component but no stochastic volatility component, whereas in
Benigno et al. (2012), productivity growth has a stochastic volatility component in a common
global productivity component but no long-run risk component, and Gourio et al. (2013) have a
disaster shock in productivity with recursive utility.


2    The Model
We present a two-country New Keynesian model under incomplete markets and refer to country 1
as the United States and country 2 as Japan. Labor is the only input into production, and prices
are sticky in the sense of Calvo (1983). Since models in this class are well known and familiar
to most readers, the text provides only a sketch of the model. We note that the model outlined
in the text is nonstationary because the level of productivity is assumed to be a nonstationary
variable. A numerical solution requires a stationary representation of the model, which we obtain
by dividing the nonstationary variables by the one-period lag of the productivity level. Also, while
we consider PCP, LCP, and DCP, except where indicated, the model is presented under LCP.
    Early research, branching from the Mundell (1963)-Fleming (1962) tradition (e.g., Obstfeld
and Rogoff (1995)), assumed both countries set export prices by PCP. Under PCP, the law-of-one
price holds for every traded good. Questions about the appropriateness of this implication led to
the development of models under LCP (Betts and Devereux (2000)). Recently, Gopinath et al.
(2020) report evidence that the practice of DCP, with the U.S. dollar as the dominant currency,
is widespread and pervasive. In our two-country setup, DCP results when the United States sets

                                                 4
export prices by PCP and Japan sets its export prices by LCP.
    Households have recursive utility and live in an incomplete markets environment. Each country
issues a nominal bond denominated in its own currency and both bonds are traded internationally.
The `foreign' currency bond can serve as a hedge against changes in import prices.

2.1   Households and Asset Markets
Unless it is necessary to distinguish between countries k  {1, 2}, we will suppress the country
subscript. Let ct be household consumption and t be time worked. Households have recursive
utility,
                                               1+
                                                        
                      Vt = (1 -  ) ln (ct ) -  t      - ln Et e-Vt+1                        (1)
                                              1+        

where   (0, 1) is the subjective discount factor,  > 0,  > 0, and   R are also param-
eters. 1/ is the Frisch elasticity of labor supply. This particular logarithmic form of utility,
which constrains the intertemporal elasticity of substitution to be 1, was introduced by Swanson
(2019) and also employed by Berg and Mark (2019). Swanson (2019) shows that relative risk
                                  -1
                            
aversion is RRA =  + 1 +          . The real stochastic discount factor (SDF) or equivalently the
intertemporal marginal rate of substitution (IMRS) is

                                               ct          e-Vt+1
                                 Mt+1 =                                 .                           (2)
                                              ct+1       Et (e-Vt+1 )

If t+1 is the inflation rate from t to t + 1, then the nominal SDF is Nt+1 = Mt+1 e-t+1 .
    Each country issues a nominal, non-state contingent discount bond denominated in their own
currency. The issue price is one unit of the currency and the payoff is 1 + it units of the currency
at t + 1. These are the only internationally traded assets. Let Bk,j,t > 0 be the number of bonds
denominated in currency j and held by agents of country k (k, j  {1, 2}). There are no short-sale
constraints so if country k agents have shorted the bond, then Bk,j,t < 0. Let bk,j,t be the real
value of bonds in terms of currency j .
    To keep bond holdings stationary, we adopt the Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2003) method of
imposing a small fee  on residents on either their long or short positions on foreign currency
denominated bonds. Let Sk,j,t be the nominal exchange rate­the currency k price of currency j ,
and Qk,j,t = (Sk,j,t Pj,t )/Pk,t be the real exchange rate, where Pk,t is the price level of country k .
The real cost to a country k household for taking a position in the currency j bond is  (bk,j,t ) =
                           2
2 Qk,j,t bk,j,t / Ak,t-1 . In the steady state, for any  > 0, households will want bk,j = bj,k = 0.
Because the level of productivity (Ak,t ) is nonstationary, we normalize the model by the one-
period lagged productivity level (Ak,t-1 ) to induce stationarity in the quantities. The term Ak,t-1
enters the bond tax formula in anticipation of the normalization.
    Households own the firms only of their own country. Household resources consists of real firm

                                                     5
profits t , real labor income wt t , and real bond payoffs. These resources are spent on consumption
and a new bond portfolio. Let rt and it be the real and nominal interest rates, respectively. The
gross real bond return is (1 + rt-1 ) = (1 + it-1 ) e-t . The real budget constraint for a country k
household is

ck,t + bk,k,t + Qk,j,t bk,j,t +  (bk,j,t ) = (1 + rk,t-1 ) bk,k,t-1 + (1 + rj,t-1 ) Qk,j,t bk,j,t-1 + wk,t   k,t + k,t .
                                                                                                                    (3)
    In equilibrium, we require zero net bonds outstanding. Hence, for k, j  {1, 2} and k = j ,

                                                  0 = bk,k,t + bj,k,t .                                             (4)

The equilibrium condition equation (4) says if b2,1,t > 0, Japan is long the U.S. dollar denominated
bond but since Japan is a lender, the United States is a borrower and must be short the U.S.
dollar denominated bond, b1,1,t < 0. This setup allows a type of carry trade when b1,1,t < 0 and
b1,2,t > 0. The United States' short position in the U.S. dollar pays for the long position in the
Japanese yen. Japan is the counter party who goes long the U.S. dollar and short the Japanese
yen. International lending by Japan to the United States occurs if b1,1,t < 0 and b1,2,t < 0. Here,
United States residents borrow both U.S. dollar and Japanese yen from Japan residents. The
Euler equations associated with the bond choices for a country k household are

where µ is the elasticity of substitution between the domestically produced and internationally
produced goods.

2.2   Firms
Under LCP, firm f  [0, 1] can distinguish between domestic and foreign shoppers and is able to
charge them different prices. The production function for a firm in country k where k  {1, 2} is

                                            yk,t (f ) = Ak,t        k,t (f ) ,                             (11)

where Ak,t is the productivity level. The firm's total costs are

                                                     wk,t   k,t (f ) .


Output is demand determined, yk,t (f ) = ck,k,t (f ) + cj,k,t (f ), where k = j . Let d be the degree
of home bias. Domestic and foreign demands are, respectively,
                                                                -                  -µ

                          ck,k,t (f ) = d                                                ck,t ,            (12)

It follows that labor employed by firm f is

                                                     ck,k,t (f ) + cj,k,t (f )

     Prices are sticky in the sense of Calvo (1983). Each period, the firm is allowed to change its
price with probability 1 - . LCP means firms in the United States set export prices in Japanese
yen while firms in Japan set export prices in U.S. dollar. Price setting goes as follows. If a firm in
country k, (k, j  {1, 2} and k = j ), is chosen to reset prices, it adjusts both the currency k price
for the domestic market (pk,k,t (f )) and the currency j price for exports (pj,k,t (f )). During the
life of the contract, the price is indexed to the continuously compounded steady state inflation
rate (¯k for domestic or    ¯j for exports). These prices are set to maximize the expected present
value of future profits with prices fixed at the optimal choices. Let Mk,t,t+h = h     z =0 Mk,t+z be

subject to the output demand equations (12) and (13) and the labor demand equation (14).
   Under PCP, firms in the United States set export prices in U.S. dollar while firms in Japan set
export prices in Japanese yen, where Pk,j,t is now denominated in country j 's currency. The price

   Under DCP, firms in the United States set export prices in U.S. dollars (they engage in PCP)
while firms in Japan also set export prices in U.S. dollars (they engage in LCP).

2.3      Monetary policy
The monetary authorities set the interest rate according to a Taylor-type feedback rule that
responds to deviations of inflation from its steady state level and the output gap. For country
k  {1, 2}, we follow Swanson (2019) by setting the natural (log) level of output to be an infinite-
dimensional moving average of output,

                                   ln (¯               yk,t-1 ) + (1 - yk ) ln (yk,t ) .
                                       yk,t ) = yk ln (¯                                                                   (18)

The output gap is then the deviation between ln (yk,t ) and ln(¯
                                                               yk,t ). The monetary authorities set
the short-term interest rate, with interest rate smoothing, according to

         ik,t = (1 - k )¯
                        i + k ik,t-1 + (1 - k ) [k (k,t - ¯k ) + k (ln (yk,t ) - ln (¯
                                                                                     yk,t ))] + ek,t                       (19)

obtained by noting that a fraction  of these firms are stuck with last period's price, pk,j,t-1 (f ).
Since there are a large number of firms charging what they charged last period, it will also be the

to reset the prices for exports and the domestic market. They all reset to the same price, p      k,j,t .
The result is the recursive representation,

3      Long-Run Risk and Stochastic Volatility Process for Produc-
       tivity Growth
We specify productivity growth to be a long-run risk and stochastic volatility process. The
productivity model for the United States and Japan is estimated from Japan and United States
total factor productivity using Bayesian methods.

3.1     The Process
Let at = ln (At ) be log productivity. Let xt be the long-run risk component and t be the
stochastic volatility component. Suppressing notation to differentiate parameter values across

countries, log productivity growth is governed by

                                  at = µg + xt-1 + e t-1 t ,                                              (23)
                                    xt = x xt-1 + t-1 ut ,                                                (24)
                               ln (t ) = µ (1 -  ) +  ln (t-1 ) + e vt ,                                  (25)

    Typically, long-run risk in international macroeconomics and finance is used to model con-
sumption growth in endowment models (Bansal and Yaron. (2004), Bansal and Shaliastovich
(2012), Backus et al. (2020), and Colacito et al. (2018a)). In (closed economy) macro models,
technology shocks with stochastic volatility is more extensively studied (see the review article by
Fern´andez-Villeverde and Guerr´ on-Quintana (2020)). Our specification for the stochastic volatil-
ity process follows Fern´

    Heterogeneity in productivity enters through cross-country differences in parameter values.
Using quarterly GDP, investment, and employment data from Datastream and FRED, and con-
verted to constant U.S. dollar, we construct the capital stock by the perpetual inventory method.
From this, we construct quarterly total factor productivity (TFP). Figure 1 shows log TFP for
Japan and the United States. The time period for the United States is 1973Q1 to 2014Q4 and for
Japan is 1980Q1 to 2014Q4. As can be seen, Japan experienced high growth in the 1980s then
slowed thereafter.

Note:  (·) is the volatility or standard deviation of the variable stated as percent per annum.


   As can be seen, the estimated long-run risk and stochastic volatility model slightly overstates
the volatility of at . Both in the data and implied by the estimated processes, productivity
growth is a good deal more volatile in Japan than in the United States. The stochastic volatility
component in the United States is more volatile than in Japan, but Japan's productivity growth
and it's long-run risk component are considerably more volatile than for the United States.
   Figure 2 plots productivity growth and log levels from the data as well as a realized simulation.
As can be seen, the model does a reasonable job of capturing major features of the productivity
data.

    Two notable features of the productivity data seen in Figure 1 and Figure 2 (data, not sim-
ulated) are that log TFP of the two countries have positive drift and they do not appear to be
cointegrated. To solve the model, however, we modify the specification such that the United
States (country 1) log productivity and Japan (country 2) log productivity are driftless and they
are cointegrated, but not strongly so. The processes are modified as follows,



                        a1,t = x1,t-1 + e1 1,t-1    1,t   +  (a1,t-1 - a2,t-1 )             (26)

4    Measures of International and Currency Risk
We use the DSGE model primarily to further our understanding of the forward premium bias/anomaly,
the currency risk premium, and the carry trade excess return. But, there are associated data
features­the Backus and Smith (1993) puzzle and the consumption correlation puzzle of Backus
et al. (1992)­that are complementary measures of international risk sharing that we also inves-


                                               12
tigate with the model. Because these data features are well-known in the literature, we will be
brief in their presentation.

Forward Premium Bias/Anomaly. This has been well known in international economics ever
since Bilson (1981) and Fama (1984), and is the primary focus of Backus et al. (2020). Uncovered
interest rate parity predicts that a regression of the future nominal exchange rate depreciation
( ln(S1,2,t+1) ) on the interest rate differential (i1,t - i2,t ) has a constant of zero and a slope
coefficient of one. We refer to this as the Fama (1984) regression and the slope coefficient in this
regression as F ama . Researchers typically estimate the slope coefficient to be positive but less than
one. This is known to as the forward premium bias. For many currency pairs, and data samples,
the estimated slope coefficient is negative. This is known as the forward premium anomaly
(Froot and Thaler (1990)). Here, the interest rate differential predicts the future exchange rate
depreciation but with the `wrong' sign. Hodrick and Srivastava (1984) argue that the period from
the breakdown of the fixed exchange rate system under Bretton-Woods until formal ratification
of the Rambouillet agreement should be omitted. Hence, our sample runs from 1976Q1-2020Q1.
The countries are the G-10 plus Australia.
    Individual regressions of the future nominal exchange rate depreciation on the nominal interest
rate differential with the United States as country 1 gives an average value of F ama = -0.825.
In the regression for the United States and Japan, we obtain F ama = -1.718.

Currency Risk Premium. We define this to be the expected excess return from shorting the
Japanese yen and going long the U.S. dollar,

                                 rp1,2,t = Et (i1,t - i2,t -  ln(S1,2,t+1 )) .

This is the expected currency excess return to be paid by the United States, which can be positive
or negative. The mean value in the data from shorting the G-10 currencies (plus Australia) and
going long the U.S. dollar is -0.626 percent per annum. The average currency risk premium from
shorting the Japanese yen and going long the U.S. dollar is 0.238 percent per annum.

Carry Trade Excess Return. This is the excess return from shorting the low interest rate currency
and going long the high interest rate currency. This trading strategy has proven to be profitable
over time. While it is related to the forward premium bias, this is a different phenomenon
(Hassan and Mano (2019)). The average carry trade excess return between the United States and
G-10 countries plus Australia is 2.937 percent per annum. The carry between the United States
and Japan is 2.861 percent per annum.3 See Lustig and Verdelhan (2007), Lustig et al. (2011),
Menkhoff et al. (2012), Berg and Mark (2017) and Berg and Mark (2018) for research on the
`pricing' of and empirical determination of the carry trade excess return.
  3
    Even higher profits can be generated with portfolios of carry trades, but in this paper we look only at the
bilateral carry.

Backus-Smith. Backus and Smith (1993), working with a complete markets two-country model
under expected utility, provided perhaps, the first treatment of the SDF approach to the exchange
rate. The key prediction from their paper is that the real exchange rate depreciation is exactly
proportional to the difference in consumption growth,

                                     ln (Q1,2,t ) =  ( ln (c1,t ) -  ln (c2,t )) ,                                 (28)

where  > 0 is the coefficient of relative risk aversion. The puzzle is, in the data, the difference
in consumption growth explains almost none of the real exchange rate depreciation. Adding
a constant and a set of seasonal dummies to equation (28), we run the quarterly regression
 ln (Q1,2,t ) = c +  ( ln c1,t -  ln c2,t ) + Xt  + t where Xt is a set of seasonal dummies, the
United States is country 1, and each of the other G-10 countries plus Australia take turns being
country 2. This gives an average point estimate of  = 0.300 and an average R2 = 0.037. The
single regression between the United States and Japan gives  = 0.221 and an R2 = 0.025.

International Risk Sharing. Brandt et al. (2006) assume complete markets and begin with the
SDF approach to the exchange rate,  ln(Q1,2,t ) = ln (M2,t ) - ln (M1,t ), where M is the real SDF.
Passing the variance operator through on both sides shows that to explain the observed variance
of exchange rates, risks must be shared extensively across countries (log SDFs highly correlated).
They propose the following index of international risk sharing,

                                                Var(ln(M2,t+1 ) - ln(M1,t+1 ))
                                 Rs = 1 -
                                              Var(ln(M2,t+1 )) + Var(ln(M1,t+1 ))

If the index is one, then all risk is being shared. If Rs is zero, then no risk is shared. Brandt et al.
(2006)'s calculations of the risk-sharing index using consumption data and assuming constant
relative risk aversion utility ranged from 0.17 to 0.42, which they conclude is much too low to
explain exchange rate volatility. Our calculations in the next section use the recursive utility
function in equation (1).

Output and Consumption Correlations. Backus et al. (1992) showed in a complete markets real
business cycle model, when risks are shared internationally, that the cross-country correlation
of consumption is higher than the cross-country correlation of output. The puzzle has been, in
the data, consumption correlations are lower than output correlations. Using the United States
as the base country, the average correlation of output growth against the G-10 countries plus
Australia is 0.260 and the average correlation of consumption growth is 0.300. Using Japan as
the base country, the average output growth correlation is 0.037 and the average consumption
growth correlation is 0.300. In our data, the puzzle is not present, however, both output and
consumption growth correlations are quite low.4
  4
      One point of departure from Backus et al. (1992) and others, is that the literature typically computes correlations


                                                           14
5     Model Simulation
We use the following parameter values throughout. Home bias is d = 0.85 and price stickiness is
 = 0.8, which implies an average contract duration of three quarters. For the utility function,
(, , , ) = (0.993, 0.545, 3, 40). High degrees of risk aversion are typically needed to explain
asset returns data. The parameters governing elasticities are  = 10 and µ = 1.5. Degree of
interest rate smoothing is 1 = 2 = 0.7. Interest rates are less variable in Japan than in the United
States. Standard deviations of monetary policy shocks are e1 = 0.0044 for the United States and
e2 = 0.0034 for Japan, which are drawn from the author's estimates of monetary policy rules
(not reported). The cointegrating coefficient for productivity is  = 0.0005 and the international
asset participation cost is  = 0.001. The model is solved numerically with Dynare 4.5.7 using a
third-order approximation around the nonstochastic steady state with pruning. Implied moments
are from a model simulation of 50,000 periods.

5.1    Symmetry
Opportunities for international risk sharing are limited when the difference between countries
is small. Hence, we begin by benchmarking the model when monetary policy and productivity
growth are symmetric across both countries. For the interest rate response rule for both countries,
the inflation response coefficient is  = 1.5 and the output gap response coefficient is  = 0.5.
The productivity parameters for both countries are set to estimated values for the United States.
We consider the three alternative export pricing conventions. Under PCP and LCP, the model is
completely symmetric. Under DCP, the only country heterogeneity is in export pricing. Here and
in the sections that follow, we continue to refer to country 1 as the United States and country 2
as Japan. Table 3 reports the results under symmetry.
of Hodrick and Prescott (1997) detrended consumption and output, whereas we use the first-difference filter to induce
stationarity in consumption and output.

Note: Monetary policy settings are  = 1.5 and  = 0.5 for both countries 1 and 2. The long-run risk and stochastic
volatility process for productivity growth are calibrated to estimated parameters for the United States for both
countries 1 and 2. Statistics are computed from a simulation of the model for 50,000 periods. The currency risk
premium is from shorting the Japanese yen and going long the U.S. dollar. The currency risk premium and the
carry trade excess return are stated in percent per annum. µ(·) denotes a mean value and (·) denotes a correlation
value.


    This ultra-symmetric world generates a slight forward premium bias (0 < F ama < 1) and tiny
values for the mean currency risk premium and the mean carry trade excess return (lines 2 and 3).
The amount of international risk sharing (line 6) is quite low, which is expected when countries
are so similar. The magnitude of the Rs index is about the same size as the correlation between
the real SDFs. The model qualitatively explains the consumption correlation puzzle under LCP
and DCP.
    However, the model generates too much correlation between relative consumption growth and
the real exchange rate depreciation. The slope in the Backus-Smith regression is relatively large
and positive, and the R2 from the model is also too high, as compared to the data.

5.2       Monetary Policy Risks
Here, we examine monetary policy induced risk by introducing policy heterogeneity while keeping
the productivity parameters in both countries equal to the estimates for the United States. Export
pricing is DCP.5 The results are shown in Table 4. Column 1 (monetary policy symmetry) is
reproduced from Table 3 for ease of comparison.
   5
       The results for LCP and PCP are nearly identical and not reported.

Note: The long-run risk and stochastic volatility process for productivity growth are calibrated to estimated pa-
rameters for the United States for both countries 1 and 2. Statistics are computed from a simulation of the model
for 50,000 periods. The currency risk premium is from shorting the Japanese yen and going long the U.S. dollar.
The currency risk premium and the carry trade excess return are stated in percent per annum. µ(·) denotes a
mean value, (·) denotes a correlation value, and  (·) denotes a standard deviation value.


    We discuss these results in relation to Backus et al. (2020), who study monetary policy induced
international risk. They work with a two-country complete markets endowment economy model.
In their model, consumption growth is exogenous and follows a long-run risk and stochastic
volatility process. Their interest rates are governed by Taylor-type feedback rules (but without
interest rate smoothing) which generates endogenous inflation. Two central predictions from their
paper are, the currency risk premium from long the U.S. dollar and short the Japanese yen is
(a) decreasing in 2 - 1 , if 2 - 1 > 0, and (b) is decreasing in 1 - 2 if 1 - 2 > 0.
    In column 2 of Table 4, Japan's monetary policy is relatively more procyclical (2 - 1 > 0).
This shows that Backus et al. (2020)'s prediction (a) carries over to a production setting under
incomplete markets. The mean currency risk premium from long the U.S. dollar drops to -0.404
from 0.050 under symmetric monetary policy. The forward premium bias is also a bit stronger
(F ama declines). The mechanism articulated in Backus et al. (2020) is increasing 2 lowers


                                                       17
the correlation between consumption growth and inflation, which means increasing inflation risk.
Since the nominal SDF is related to the real SDF by Nt+1 = Mt+1 e-t+1 , and with the real SDF
being exogenous in their framework, lowering the correlation between consumption growth and
inflation necessarily lowers the variance of the nominal SDF (V art (ln(Nt+1 ))). Under complete
markets and log normality of the SDF (Backus et al. (2001)), the currency risk premium is
determined by the difference in the variances of the nominal SDFs,

                                                        Vart (ln(N2,t+1 )) - Vart (ln(N1,t+1 ))
                  Et (i1,t - i2,t -  ln(S1,2,t+1 )) =                                           .
                                                                           2

Hence, depressing Vart (ln(N2,t+1 )) lowers the currency excess return from short the Japanese yen
and long the U.S. dollar. Although we have incomplete markets, our results are consistent with
the complete markets intuition of Backus et al. (2020). (c2 , 2 ) declines from 0.538 to 0.298.
But, the inflation risks channel is not the only one operating in our model. We return to this
point below.
    In column 3, we make Japan's monetary policy relatively more accommodating to inflation
(1 - 2 > 0). This experiment addresses Backus et al. (2020)'s prediction (b), which in comparing
to column 1, says we should see a decline in the long U.S. dollar short Japanese yen currency
excess return. Instead, we see the mean currency risk premium increase from 0.050 to 0.112. In
Backus et al. (2020), changes in the monetary policy rule affect inflation dynamics and, because
consumption growth is exogenous, will necessarily affect the correlation between inflation and
consumption growth. In our model, this is not the case. The inflation risk, as measured by
the correlation between c2 and 2 is essentially unchanged between columns 1 and 3. In fact,
between columns 1 and 3, there are very little differences in correlations of consumption growth,
output growth, and real SDFs. However, inflation accommodation by Japan in our model is
destabilizing. Lowering 2 increases the volatility of Japan inflation, consumption growth, and
output growth.6 This leads to an increased desire for precautionary saving by people in Japan.
To go long in Japanese yen denominated bonds (increase b2,2 ), people in the United States must
be induced to short Japanese yen denominated bonds (decrease b1,2 ). A higher excess return on
the U.S. dollar incentivizes people to do this. People in the United States can use the proceeds
from shorting the Japanese yen denominated bonds to go long the U.S. dollar denominated bond.
Note also that a bit more risk is now being shared internationally (Rs increases from 0.202 to
0.209). The mechanism by which monetary policy is destabilizing is absent in Backus et al. (2020)
due to the exogeneity of consumption.
    Circling back to the experiment in column 2, we see in addition to the added inflation risk
channel discussed above, making Japan's monetary policy relatively more procyclical is also sta-
bilizing (line 17). This stabilizing effect reduces the desire for precautionary saving in Japan
relative to the United States, and reinforces the currency excess return being paid by Japan.
  6
      ( (2 ),  (c2 ), and  (y2 )) increase from (2.484, 4.8068, and 4.6606) to (2.7785, 4.9168, and 4.7657).


                                                         18
   In column 4, we combine the relatively more procyclical and the accommodation to inflation
aspects of monetary policy for Japan. Not surprisingly, some of the effects from the procyclical
aspect are undone by the inflationary accommodation.
   In terms of the complementary risk-sharing measures, introducing monetary policy hetero-
geneity, to the extent that we have considered, have modest effects on the Backus-Smith puzzle,
the consumption correlation puzzle, and the amount of international risk sharing.7

5.3       Productivity Risks
Here, we show that empirically based heterogeneity in productivity growth is potentially a more
important source of currency risk than are differences in monetary policy. Monetary policy is
again symmetric with  = 1.5 and  = 0.5 in both countries. Country 1 productivity growth
parameters are set to the estimated values for the United States and country 2 are set to the
estimated values for Japan. Results under PCP, LCP, and DCP are presented in Table 5.

Note: Monetary policy settings are  = 1.5 and  = 0.5 for both countries 1 and 2. Productivity growth parameters
for country 1 are set to United States estimates and country 2 parameters are set to Japan estimates. Statistics
are computed from a simulation of the model for 50,000 periods. The currency risk premium is from shorting the
Japanese yen and going long the U.S. dollar. The currency risk premium and the carry trade excess return are
stated in percent per annum. µ(·) denotes a mean value, (·) denotes a correlation value, and  (·) denotes a
standard deviation value.

   Recall that these settings make Japan the more volatile country, with higher productivity
and output growth volatility. This cross-country heterogeneity in productivity growth is seen to
   7
       The results of this section are not specific to DCP. They also hold under LCP and PCP.


                                                         19
create a good deal more international currency risk than monetary policy heterogeneity, at least
to the extent that we explored in the previous subsection. Even under symmetric Taylor-rule
monetary policy, the heterogeneous productivity model produces the forward premium anomaly
(i.e., F ama < 0).
     Under DCP, the model generates an mean currency risk premium from shorting the Japanese
yen and going long the U.S. dollar of 1.524 percent per annum, and a mean carry trade excess
return of 1.459 percent per annum. The additional cross-country heterogeneity due to DCP
marginally adds to currency risk beyond that generated under LCP and PCP.
     The complementary risk-sharing measures are not very different from before. The model
continues to explain the consumption correlation puzzle under DCP and LCP. Output correlations
are near zero. Slightly more international risk is being shared. The slope and R2 in the Backus-
Smith puzzle regression are smaller in magnitude, but are still substantially larger than what is
estimated in the data. Currency risk is again driven by higher volatility of the Japanese economy
and higher desired precautionary saving by people in Japan relative to the United States.

5.4   Combined Monetary Policy and Productivity Risks under DCP
In Table 6, we show results from variations in monetary policy, as in Subsection 5.2, combined
with estimated productivity growth heterogeneity, as in Subsection 5.3. Column 1 in Table 6
is taken from Table 5 under symmetric monetary policy and DCP for ease of comparison. In
column 2, Japan's monetary policy is relatively more procyclical. This is stabilizing the Japanese
economy. Volatility of output growth in Japan decreases, and is lower than that of the United
States. This leads to substantial reductions in the mean currency risk premium and the mean
carry trade excess return, but does not change the signs. We do not get a reversal of the sign of the
mean currency risk premium, in part, because there is more inflationary risk in the United States
(line 14), which contributes towards a mean currency risk premium that is paid by the United
States. Comparing columns 1 and 2, the relatively more procyclical Japan monetary policy has
a stabilizing effect (lowering  (y2 )) and reduces the mean currency risk premium paid by the
United States. However, in column 2,  (y2 ) <  (y1 ), but the United States pays the currency
risk premium. While relative output growth volatility evidently is not a sufficient statistic for
determining who pays the premium, these results lead us to conjecture that the mean currency
risk premium is decreasing in  (y1 ) -  (y2 ).

Note: Productivity growth parameters for country 1 are set to United States estimates and country 2 parameters
are set to Japan estimates. Statistics are computed from a simulation of the model for 50,000 periods. The currency
risk premium is from shorting the Japanese yen and going long the U.S. dollar. The currency risk premium and the
carry trade excess return are stated in percent per annum. µ(·) denotes a mean value, (·) denotes a correlation
value, and  (·) denotes a standard deviation value.


    In column 3, Japan's monetary policy is relatively more accommodating to inflation. This is
destabilizing (line 17), which jacks up the average currency risk premium (line 6). The forward
premium anomaly is quite strong with F ama = -4.613. In column 4, Japan's monetary policy
is both relatively more accommodating to inflation and relatively more procyclical. Except for
showing a forward premium anomaly, this largely looks like the economy in column 2.
    Finally, in column 5, we set Japan's monetary policy parameters equal to estimated values
from the literature. We draw upon Miyazawa (2011), who surveys estimates of the Taylor rule
in Japan. Across seven studies, the averages are  = 2.06 and  = 0.43. Here, Japan becomes
the relatively more volatile country (lines 16 and 17). There is a forward premium bias, but
no forward premium anomaly. There is a modest mean carry trade excess return and a mean
currency risk premium of 1.481 percent per annum.

5.5    Impulse Response Functions
Our paper pushes beyond the existing literature primarily in two dimensions. The first is our
consideration of three export pricing conventions, LCP, PCP, and DCP. Typically, the literature
has considered export pricing conventions separately. The second dimension is in modeling pro-
ductivity growth as a long-run risk (LRR) and stochastic volatility (SV) process. In this section,
we present impulse response functions to better understand the contributions of these aspects of
the model, where we continue to refer to country 1 as the United States and country 2 as Japan.

Figure 3: Output Responses to Positive United States Shocks ­ Symmetric Monetary Policy and
Productivity Growth and DCP




Note: The monetary policy settings are  = 1.5 and  = 0.5 for both the United States (country 1) and Japan
(country 2). The productivity growth parameters are set to United States estimates for both countries. The
productivity shock is the direct shock to productivity growth, the LRR shock is the long-run risk shock, and the
SV shock is the stochastic volatility shock.


   Figure 3 shows impulse responses of output for the United States (country 1) and Japan
(country 2) to the four positive United States shocks under DCP and symmetric monetary policy
and productivity growth (corresponding to column 3 in Table 3). Notice that the effects on Japan's
output from United States shocks are tiny relative to the effects on output in the United States. A
positive United States productivity growth (direct) shock raises output in both countries, which


                                                      22
is a well known result. A positive United States long-run risk (LRR) shock leads to persistent
increases in output in both countries. A positive United States stochastic volatility (SV) shock
(increasing uncertainty) leads to output contractions in both countries. Qualitatively, the positive
United States stochastic volatility shock is similar to a positive United States monetary policy
shock.

Figure 4: Inflation Responses to Positive United States Shocks ­ Symmetric Monetary Policy and
Productivity Growth and DCP




Note: The monetary policy settings are  = 1.5 and  = 0.5 for both the United States (country 1) and Japan
(country 2). The productivity growth parameters are set to United States estimates for both countries. The
productivity shock is the direct shock to productivity growth, the LRR shock is the long-run risk shock, and the
SV shock is the stochastic volatility shock.


    Figure 4 shows inflation impulse responses for the United States and Japan to the four posi-
tive United States shocks under DCP and symmetric monetary policy and productivity growth.
Looking at both Figures 3 and 4, stochastic volatility shocks (uncertainty shocks) in our model
have an interpretation as aggregate demand shocks, as in Xu (2016) and Leduc and Liu (2016).
The positive United States stochastic volatility (SV) shock depresses output and inflation. Some-
what more novel is that the long-run risk (LRR) shock also has the interpretation as an aggregate
demand shock since the positive United States long-run risk shock leads to sustained increases in
both output and inflation. A positive United States monetary policy shock is contractionary and

                                                      23
leads to deflation in the United States. However, under DCP, it leads to inflation in Japan due
to the depreciation of Japan's currency, which increases Japan's import prices.
    Figure 5 displays impulse responses of consumption to output ratios for the United States and
Japan to the four positive United States shocks under DCP and symmetric monetary policy and
productivity growth. This provides some insight to precautionary saving responses. A positive
United States productivity growth (direct) shock lowers the ratio in the United States and raises
it in Japan, which is facilitated by a trade surplus in the United States. The positive United
States long-run risk (LRR) shock raises the ratio in the United States while the positive United
States stochastic volatility (SV) shock lowers the ratio in the United States. Again, these patterns
are consistent with long-run risk and stochastic volatility shocks being interpreted as aggregate
demand shocks. The monetary policy shocks act as aggregate demand shocks.

Monetary Policy and Productivity Growth and DCP




Note: The monetary policy settings are  = 1.5 and  = 0.5 for both the United States (country 1) and Japan
(country 2). The productivity growth parameters are set to United States estimates for both countries. The
productivity shock is the direct shock to productivity growth, the LRR shock is the long-run risk shock, and the
SV shock is the stochastic volatility shock.


    Figure 6 shows impulse responses of the interest rate differential (i1,t - i2,t ) and the currency
risk premium (Et (i1,t - i2,t -  ln(S1,2,t+1 ))) to the four positive United States shocks under

DCP and symmetric monetary policy and productivity growth. The scale for the currency risk
premium is on the right and the scale for the interest rate differential is on the left. The currency
risk premium response mimics the interest rate differential (F ama = 0.768 in this case), but with
a much smaller magnitude. The interest rate differential response largely mimics the interest rate
response in the United States as the transmission effects from United States shocks to Japan's
interest rate are quite small. Stochastic volatility (SV) shocks make the largest contribution to the
currency risk premium volatility. In the variance decomposition, the combined United States and
Japan stochastic volatility shocks account for 80 percent of the currency risk premium's variance.

for the currency risk premium (Et (i1,t - i2,t -  ln(S1,2,t+1 ))) is on the right and the scale for the interest rate
differential (i1,t - i2,t ) is on the left. The productivity shock is the direct shock to productivity growth, the LRR
shock is the long-run risk shock, and the SV shock is the stochastic volatility shock.



When Does Export Pricing Matter?: The choice amongst DCP, LCP, and PCP matters most for
international trade variables in response to monetary policy shocks. Perhaps, this is why Gopinath
et al. (2020)'s paper on DCP concentrates on monetary policy. We find the impulse responses
to the other shocks are qualitatively similar across the export pricing conventions and are not
shown. Notably, export pricing conventions do not have a significant effect on international risk
and currency risk premiums.


                                                         25
    Figure 7 shows the terms of trade and the balance of trade impulse responses to positive
United States monetary policy shocks under LCP, PCP, and DCP and symmetric monetary
policy and productivity growth. We define the terms of trade (TOT) as the price of exports over
the price of imports for the United States. The balance of trade (BOT) is similarly defined from
the perspective of the United States. The terms of trade and the balance of trade responses to
monetary policy shocks under PCP are reversed under LCP. Not surprisingly, since DCP is a
combination of LCP and PCP, the terms of trade and the balance of trade responses lie between
the LCP and PCP responses.

Figure 7: Comparing LCP, PCP, and DCP Responses to Positive United States Monetary Policy
Shocks ­ Symmetric Monetary Policy and Productivity Growth




Note: The monetary policy settings are  = 1.5 and  = 0.5 for both the United States (country 1) and Japan
(country 2). The productivity growth parameters are set to United States estimates for both countries. The terms
of trade and the balance of trade are from the perspective of the United States.


    Although the currency in which export prices are set does not affect the average size of the
currency risk premium or the forward premium bias, it does have an effect on the dynamical
response to monetary policy shocks. Under PCP, and to a lesser extent DCP, the United States
monetary policy shock depresses United States precautionary saving (BOT< 0) which turns the
currency risk premium negative (Japan pays). Under LCP, the opposite happens.

Significance of Asymmetries for Currency Risk. Finally, we compare impulse responses of the
interest rate differential and the currency risk premium to Japan shocks under the symmetric
monetary policy and productivity growth model (Table 3, column 3) and the asymmetric monetary
policy and productivity growth model (Table 6, column 3). These impulse responses are shown
in Figure 8.

parameters for country 1 are set to United States estimates and for country 2 are set to Japan estimates (Table 6,
column 3). The scale for the currency risk premium (Et (i1,t - i2,t -  ln(S1,2,t+1 ))) is on the right and the scale
for the interest rate differential (i1,t - i2,t ) is on the left. The productivity shock is the direct shock to productivity
growth, the LRR shock is the long-run risk shock, and the SV shock is the stochastic volatility shock.


    The impulse responses of the interest rate differential are similar under the symmetric and
asymmetric models. Except in response to the stochastic volatility (SV) shock, cross-country
heterogeneity in productivity growth and monetary policy, changes the response of the currency
risk premium significantly. For these shocks, a negative correlation between the currency risk pre-
mium and interest rate differential can be inferred from the impulse responses, which corresponds
to a F ama = -4.613 in the asymmetric case.

5.6     Limitations of the Model
While the goal of this project is not to develop a model that is quantitatively accurate in every
dimension, we would be remiss if we did not point out some of the limitations of our model. Table 7
compares additional moments from the data to the model with heterogeneous productivity and
monetary policy parameters for Japan set to estimates reported in the literature.

Notes: Model specification is from column 5 in Table 6. Productivity parameters are set to estimated values for
the United States (country 1) and Japan (country 2) with Japan monetary policy parameters set to estimated
values reported in the literature. µ(·) denotes a mean value,  (·) denotes a standard deviation value, and (·)
denotes a correlation value. Means and standard deviations are annualized. Exchange rate data are from FRED.
Not seasonally adjusted data on consumption and GDP are from Datastream. Sample is 1976Q1 to 2020Q1, except
for consumption volatility which due to availability for Japan, runs from 1994Q1 to 2019Q4. Moments from the
model are from simulation over 50,000 periods.


    The mean values of inflation and interest rates from the model do a reasonable job of describing
the mean values from the data. The model mildly overstates output and consumption growth
volatility for the United States (country 1) and mildly understates for Japan (country 2). Where
the model falls short is in explaining exchange rate volatility (and to a lesser extent, inflation
volatility). The model is able to generate a very high correlation between real and nominal
exchange rate depreciation.


6    Conclusion
We show in a two-country DSGE model under incomplete markets how the currency risk premium
and the forward premium bias/anomaly depend on the extent of cross-country heterogeneity. The
model features recursive utility and productivity growth exhibiting long-run risk with stochastic
volatility. The primary mechanism behind the currency risk premium lies in the relative strength
of the precautionary saving motive across countries. If people of Japan have a stronger precau-
tionary saving motive, the people in the United States must be incentivized to borrow to satisfy
Japan's saving motive. The result is a positive currency risk premium from going long the U.S.

dollar and short the Japanese yen.
    Our main results are as follows. First, we find if country 2 (Japan) has a relatively more
procyclical monetary policy and productivity growth is symmetric across countries, country 2 will
pay the currency risk premium. This result is in line with Backus et al. (2020). Second, if country 2
is more accommodating towards inflation, country 1 (United States) pays the risk premium. This
result runs contrary to Backus et al. (2020). Third, what is potentially more important for
currency risk, is cross-country productivity growth heterogeneity. While relative output volatility
is not a sufficient statistic, the currency risk premium paid by country 1 appears to be decreasing
in the difference between country 1 and country 2 output growth volatility. Fourth, the export
pricing convention (LCP, PCP, DCP) is unimportant in the determination of the unconditional
mean of the currency risk premium and the forward premium bias/anomaly, but can have an
impact on the dynamic response of the risk premium to monetary policy shocks. Fifth, stochastic
volatility (uncertainty) shocks and long-run risk shocks can be viewed as aggregate demand shocks.
Sixth, stochastic volatility shocks make a large contribution to risk premium volatility, but are
not helpful in explaining the forward premium bias/anomaly.
