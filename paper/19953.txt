                                             ABSTRACT

Cross-listing on a U.S. exchange does not bond foreign firms to follow the corporate governance rules
of that exchange. Hand-collected data show that 80% of cross-listed firms opt out of at least one exchange
governance rule, instead committing to observe the rules of their home country. Relative to firms
that comply, firms that opt out have weaker governance practices in that they have a smaller share
of independent directors. The decision to opt out reflects the relative costs and benefits of doing so.
Cross-listed firms opt out more when coming from countries with weak corporate governance rules,
but if firms based in such countries are growing and have a need for external finance, they are more
likely to comply. Finally, opting out affects the value of cash holdings. For cross-listed firms based
in countries with weak governance rules, a dollar of cash held inside the firm is worth $1.52 if the
firm fully complies with U.S. exchange rules but just $0.32 if it is non-compliant.

    I.       Introduction

         Corporate governance mechanisms provide tools for suppliers of capital to control

managers. However, investor powers and protections vary widely across countries. In some

jurisdictions, corporate governance practices are weak, and insiders can enjoy private benefits at

the expense of external capital providers. As a result, outsiders discount financial claims on firms

and make it costly for firms to raise funds to pursue growth opportunities.

         Firms that conduct business within a single country are typically tied to the corporate

governance practices established by their country’s legal and regulatory environment. However,

firms that cross-list shares on foreign exchanges expose themselves to alternative legal and

regulatory environments. This fact forms the basis of one prominent hypothesis for why firms

cross-list: the legal bonding hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, managers from countries

with weak corporate governance can bond themselves from extracting private benefits at the

expense of capital providers by cross-listing into a legal and regulatory environment offering

greater investor protections. For firms that have a cross-listing in the U.S., some of these

protections are a consequence of needing to comply with SEC regulations concerning disclosures

and corporate actions. Others are exchange-specific, and each of the major U.S. exchanges has

detailed listing requirements.

         This paper documents the extent to which cross-listed firms choose to opt out of

exchange-specific governance regulations and explores the consequences of opting out. Existing

literature has paid little attention to the possibility that firms can opt out of governance rules,

typically assuming that foreign firms agree to comply with the same rules as U.S. firms when

they cross-list on a U.S. exchange.1 In reality, cross-listed firms can decide not to comply with


1
 For instance, Reese and Weisbach (2002) state: “One way to accomplish this bonding is to cross-list on an
exchange (NYSE or Nasdaq) in the United States, whose legal system protects minority shareholder interests as well

                                                                                                                1
exchange governance rules. Historically, these compliance choices were not well publicized, but

this changed in September 2008, when the SEC mandated that foreign firms listed on U.S.

exchanges disclose opt out choices in consolidated and concise form in their 20-F annual filings.

Exchange governance rules are organized in this paper into six categories relating to board

requirements, auditing, stock issuance, and business practices. This paper presents and analyzes

the opt out decisions disclosed in 20-F filings immediately after the SEC rule change.

        Four main findings emerge. First, opting out is very common. Figure 1 displays the share

of firms that opt out of different numbers of exchange governance requirements. 80.2% of cross-

listed firms opt out of at least one category of requirements. A large fraction of firms opt out of

many types as well; 47.2% of firms opt out of three or more categories of requirements. Second,

opting out of exchange governance requirements is correlated with weaker governance practices.

While many governance practices are hard to observe directly, it is possible to measure features

of a firm’s board of directors. Analysis of the board composition of cross-listed firms reveals that

firms opting out of board independence rules, board committee rules, and audit committee rules

have significantly fewer independent board members.

        Third, the decision to opt out of exchange governance requirements seems to reflect the

incentives created by insiders’ ability to consume private benefits when governance remains

weak and by managers’ desire to raise capital when growth opportunities are attractive.

Managers of firms based in countries where corporate governance is weak typically give up

larger private benefits by complying fully with U.S. exchange requirements. Consistent with this

notion, tests reveal that firms are more likely to opt out of U.S. exchange requirements if they are


as any in the world. Such a cross-listing obligates the firm to conform to generally accepted accounting principles
(US GAAP), to file reports with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to comply with the
requirements of the exchange on which it lists, and at least to some extent conform to US securities laws. It thus
provides a mechanism by which foreign firms can voluntarily subject themselves to some shareholders’ protections
under US securities laws.”

                                                                                                                      2
based in civil law countries and countries with lower measures of the Anti-Self-Dealing Index

created by Djankov, LaPorta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (2008). However, managers of

firms based in countries with weak governance appear to be more willing to comply with U.S.

exchange requirements if they need capital to fund growth of their firm. In particular, firms

based in countries with weak corporate governance are less likely to opt out if they are small, are

experiencing higher levels of growth in property, plant, and equipment, or are engaging in equity

issuances.

       The fourth main finding is that opting out has value consequences. Simple analysis of the

relationship between opting out and Tobin’s q is confounded by unobservable determinants of

the value of cross-listed firms, such as the extent of growth opportunities in different countries.

However, methods developed by Faulkender and Wang (2006), Dittmar and Mahrt-Smith

(2007), and Frésard and Salva (2010) enable a study of the value of cash inside cross-listed firms

that are based in countries with weak corporate governance. For cross-listed firms based in civil

law countries that are fully compliant with U.S. exchange governance requirements, a dollar

inside the firm is worth $1.52. However, if such a firm opts out of all six types of requirements,

a dollar inside the firm is worth only $0.32.

       These findings have implications for several strands of the finance literature. The most

direct contributions are to the literature on cross-listing. Karolyi (1998) and Karolyi (2006)

survey this literature and discuss the motives for and effects of cross-listing. In characterizing

the incentives to cross-list, earlier work emphasized a variety of considerations, including market

risk exposures and liquidity. Stulz (1999) and Coffee (1999) raise the possibility that corporate

governance issues are central to explaining cross-listing and that managers decide to list on U.S.

exchanges in order to commit to abide by certain legal and regulatory practices, thereby limiting



                                                                                                      3
opportunities for insiders to expropriate capital providers. These themes have received

significant empirical support, as noted in Karolyi (2012).2 Although this literature has pointed

out differences between exchange-listed and non-exchange listed ADRs, it has not documented

that managers usually opt out of U.S. exchange requirements when they cross-list.3

        In the literature on cross-listings, the insights in Doidge, Karolyi, Lins, Miller, and Stulz

(2009) (DKLMS) and Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2004) (DKS) are particularly relevant to the

study of opting out. DKLMS present evidence that when managers have the opportunity to

enjoy private benefits, they are less likely to cross-list their firms on U.S. exchanges. DKLMS

also find that managers of firms with better investment opportunities are more likely to cross-list

because, by reducing the extraction of private benefits, cross-listing lowers the cost of raising

external capital. These same considerations motivating the decision to cross-list help explain the

decision to opt out of exchange requirements. Managers of firms that are likely to have the

opportunity to enjoy private benefits are less likely to comply with exchange requirements, but,

if such managers are in charge of firms with attractive growth opportunities, compliance levels

are relatively higher. DKS illustrate that cross-listing is associated with a larger valuation gap

for firms based in countries with weak corporate governance practices than it is for firms based

in countries with strong corporate governance practices. Similarly, analysis of the extent to

which firms opt out of exchange requirements illustrates that opting out has value consequences.

        More generally, this paper adds to work on how better governance practices facilitate the

process of raising capital from external sources. The modern formulation of agency costs in

Jensen and Meckling (1976) illustrates that insiders who want to raise capital must give up larger

  See, for example, Reese and Weisbach (2002), Doidge (2004), Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2004), and Doidge,
Karolyi, Lins, Miller, and Stulz (2009).

  Siegel (2005) also questions the legal bonding hypothesis, argues for a nuanced view of what complying with U.S.
securities laws entails, and stresses the importance of reputational bonding as a mechanism for committing to
lawfulness, disclosure, and good governance.

                                                                                                                 4
claims on their firms if they are expected to divert more resources to their own private benefit. A

considerable body of work shows that country-level differences in governance practices affect

the ease with which firms can raise external finance.4 The consequences of opting out offer

more evidence of the effects of strong governance when raising funds from external sources.

          Finally, in illustrating how the value of cash inside of firms varies with the extent to

which firms opt out of exchange requirements, this paper advances the idea that corporate

governance affects valuations. Recent work on this topic, like Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick

(2002), Durnev and Kim (2005), Pinkowitz, Stulz, and Williamson (2006), and Bebchuk, Cohen,

and Farrell (2009), indicates that financial claims are valued more dearly in the market when

corporate governance practices are stronger.

          The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the governance

requirements imposed by U.S. exchanges and documents the extent to which cross-listed firms

opt out of these requirements. Section III discusses whether opting out is associated with

material differences in the governance practices of cross-listed firms. Section IV provides

analysis of potential motivations managers of cross-listed firms might have for opting out, and

Section V considers if opting out has value consequences. Section VI concludes.



    II.      Exchange Governance Requirements and Foreign Firm Opt Outs

          When issuing securities in the U.S., foreign private issuers trigger the Securities Act of

1933, the Exchange Act of 1934, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and thereby become

exposed to potential SEC and private enforcement action. These laws and mandated accounting

standards remain largely silent on firm governance practices. The major exchanges, namely the

 See, for example, LaPorta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny (1997); Rajan and Zingales (1998); Beck,
Demirguc-Kunt, and Maksimovic (2005); and Djankov, LaPorta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (2008).

                                                                                                              5
NYSE, NASDAQ and AMEX, impose additional governance requirements on listed firms.

However, the exchanges make an exception for foreign cross-listing firms, which are excluded

from mandatory compliance with many of these rules.5 Instead, U.S. stock exchanges permit

listed foreign firms to follow their home country governance practices, provided firms disclose

how these practices differ from those stated in the exchange requirements.

           Prior to 2008, firms that opted out of exchange governance requirements had discretion in

how they presented this information, often placing it on the company website or in annual report

footnotes. It was not uncommon for investors to be led through a series of cross-references

among different disclosure documents and websites in order to compile the firm’s governance

details.

           In September 2008, seeking to standardize these disclosures and to facilitate investors’

ability to monitor foreign firms’ corporate governance practices, the SEC amended its rules to

require foreign firms listed on U.S. stock exchanges to file annual governance disclosures on

Form 20-F under a new section, “Item 16G -- Corporate Governance.” This rule went into effect

for fiscal years ending on or after December 15, 2008. This change raised the potential cost of

not disclosing deviations from exchange governance requirements because it added to the risk of

stock exchange penalties the additional liability arising from material misstatements or omissions

in an annual SEC filing.

           This paper presents data of firms’ governance exemptions that were made available by

the SEC’s rule change and hand collected from the first Item 16G of Form 20-F filings. The

dataset covers 519 firms listed on the NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX markets through Level II

ADRs, Level III ADRs, or direct listings, based on the SEC’s official list of “Foreign companies

Proposed Rule Changes by the American Stock Exchange, Inc. and the New York Stock Exchange Inc. to Amend
the Exchanges’ Listing Standards for Foreign Companies”).

                                                                                                            6
registered and reporting with the U.S. SEC; December 31, 2008” (SEC, 2009). The other forms

of cross-listing, namely unregistered transactions and Level I ADRs, maintain the Exchange

Act’s Rule 12g3-2(b) exemption from registration and are not exchange-listed so they are not

subject to exchange governance requirements.6

         Each of the exchanges has a listing standards manual that details the corporate

governance requirements that firms must follow unless they opt out. Table 1 provides general

governance rules and then describes each of the provisions imposed by the NYSE, NASDAQ,

and AMEX. There are 12 provisions for the NYSE and 20 for NASDAQ and AMEX. The

provisions of different exchanges follow the same basic framework. In Table 1, provisions are

grouped in the categories of board independence requirements, board committee requirements,

audit committee requirements, general corporate practices, shareholder approval requirements

for stock issuance, and good governance practices. These categories generally reflect the manner

in which the provisions are presented in the exchanges’ listing manuals and by firms in their Item

16G disclosures.

         Board independence requirements mandate that a majority of board directors be

“independent,” based on several bright line tests including current employment, remuneration,

and family connections to current employees. These provisions also require that independent

directors have regular meetings that exclude inside directors. Board committee requirements

state that executive compensation and nominations for new directors must be determined by a

6
  U.S. securities laws apply to all foreign private issuers—a term that covers non-U.S. issuers, excluding foreign
governments—entering U.S. capital markets to raise capital or to enhance the liquidity of their shares. However, the
regulations imposed on foreign firms are intended to be proportional to the perceived investor risk posed by firms’
modes of accessing the U.S. markets. Unregistered transactions, such as those occurring offshore, or through Level I
ADR programs which represent shares that are traded only over-the-counter in the U.S., through private placements,
or through Rule 144A resales to qualified institutional buyers, do not require filing a registration statement with the
SEC and meeting specific disclosure and financial statement requirements, nor will these transactions typically be
subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (Cohen et al., 2009).


                                                                                                                     7
committee consisting of a majority of independent directors. Audit committee requirements

mandate the existence of a chartered audit committee consisting of independent directors and

restrict the ability of these directors to participate in the preparation of the firm’s financial

statements. Shareholder approval requirements for stock issuance stipulate that shareholders be

allowed to vote on new equity compensation plans, as well as the issuance of additional company

stock. The general corporate practices and good governance practices categories include rules

about, for example, soliciting shareholder proxies, distributing annual reports, reviewing big

transactions for conflicts of interest, and establishing a posted code of conduct. Table 1 contains

additional details about each of these categories.

        Provisions tend to be very similar across exchanges, although there are subtle differences.

For example, all three exchanges require a majority of directors be independent and that there be

executive sessions of non-management directors, but there is variation in exactly how

independence is determined and who can and cannot participate in executive sessions. The most

notable difference between the requirements of different exchanges, as analyzed in this paper, is

that the NYSE’s corporate governance standards section does not have provisions categorized as

general corporate practices.

        The SEC rule requires that a firm note significant differences between its practices and

the governance requirements of its exchange in Item 16G. An exemption is coded anytime a

requirement is reviewed in an Item 16G disclosure, and a foreign firm’s practices are not

consistent with the practices that would be followed by a compliant U.S. firm’s practice. A firm

that opts out of at least one of the specific provisions within a category is coded as opting out of

that category. Because the SEC rules only require the disclosure of exemptions, the absence of

disclosures on any governance requirement is assumed to indicate compliance. Exemptions are



                                                                                                       8
measured in the first year they are reported under the requirements of the September 2008 SEC

rule change; thus these are captured for the first fiscal year of firms that ends on or after

December 15, 2008.

       Firms’ governance exemptions appear to remain very stable following these initial

filings. In order to make a change to governance practices, managers typically must win any

approvals required by their firm’s bylaws or corporate charter. They must also promptly notify

the exchange where the firm’s shares are listed and file forms noting changes with the SEC.

Failing to report exemptions in an accurate and timely manner leaves firms liable to legal action.

A review of Form 6-K filings as well as a hand comparison of a sample of Form 20-F filings

covering the years 2008-2011 revealed few minor changes to governance practices. Therefore,

firms do not appear to temporarily mislead investors by claiming to act in accordance with

certain required governance practices and then changing those required practices.

       To illustrate the collection procedure, consider the case of Advanced Semiconductor

Engineering, Inc., a Taiwan-based company cross-listed on the NYSE. In Item 16G of its 20-F

filing for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2008, the company lists its opt outs from NYSE

governance rules. For example, the NYSE requires that a listed firm have a nominating

committee and a compensation committee, each composed entirely of independent directors and

governed by a written charter that provides for certain responsibilities of the committee set out in

the NYSE listing standards. The company writes, “We do not have a nominating/corporate

governance committee. The ROC Company Law does not require companies incorporated in the

ROC to have a nominating/corporate governance committee.” With regards to a compensation

committee, the company states, “We do not have a compensation committee. Under the ROC

Company Law, companies incorporated in the ROC are not required to have a compensation



                                                                                                   9
committee.” In the previous year’s annual filing, prior to the change in SEC disclosure rule,

there is no mention of the opt outs from exchange requirements, indicating that the SEC rule

change affected company disclosures.

         In another example, the Brazilian company CPFL Energia S.A.’s Form 20-F for the fiscal

year ending December 31, 2008 indicates that, “The non-management directors of CPFL do not

meet at regularly scheduled executive sessions without management”—a would-be violation of

the NYSE requirement regarding executive sessions of the board. As with Advanced

Semiconductor, the Form 20-F from the prior year does not contain a section indicating opt outs.

         The resulting dataset of measured opt outs provides a striking picture of the extent of

compliance with exchange governance requirements. 80.2% of firms opt out of at least one

category of provisions. Table 2 displays the extent to which firms from different countries opt

out of provisions and the extent to which firms opt out of different categories of provisions. The

sample includes cross-listed firms with headquarters based in 45 countries.7 There is

considerable variation in the extent to which firms opt out of different categories of governance

requirements, as indicated in the last row of the table that presents the share of firms opting out

of each provision. Opting out appears to be common regarding board and audit committee

matters. 51.1% of firms opt out of board independence requirements, 54.7% out of board

committee requirements, and 40.7% out of audit committee requirements. 61.2% of firms opt

out of general corporate practices, 31.2% opt out of shareholder approval requirements for stock

issuance, and 27.4% opt out of general good governance practice requirements.8



7
  For eight of the firms in the sample, the headquarters are located in the U.S. Of these firms, six are incorporated in
Canada, one in the U.K., and one in the British Virgin Islands. We include these firms in our analysis but the results
are robust to excluding them.
8
  As explained above, NYSE firms are not subject to general corporate practice requirements and therefore cannot
have more than 5 total opt outs.

                                                                                                                     10
           Table 3 provides pairwise correlations indicating the extent to which firms that opt out of

one category of requirement are likely to opt out of another category. These correlations are all

positive, and 13 of the 15 correlations are also statistically distinguishable from zero. Thus, a

firm that opts out of one category of governance requirement typically opts out of others as well.

As one might expect, the correlation between opting out of board independence requirements and

board committee requirements is very high; its value is 0.6426.

           The main variable used to measure opt outs in the analysis below is the total number of

opt outs. As indicated in Table 4, which presents descriptive statistics, firms have an average of

2.3 opt outs and a median of 2.0. Thus, the median cross-listed firm opts out of 2 of the 6

categories of governance requirements. These basic patterns in the extent to which firms opt out

of exchange governance requirements and the positive correlation among types of opt outs

suggest that opting out significantly reduces the impact of U.S. exchange requirements on the

governance of cross-listed firms. The next section considers this possibility.



    III.      Opting Out and Corporate Governance

           Because many features of a firm’s management practices are difficult to observe, it is

challenging to pinpoint whether opting out of exchange requirements is truly associated with

weaker corporate governance. Fortunately, it is possible to measure the share of a firm’s

directors who are independent. A number of studies have shown that firms with more

independent directors tend to have better financial performance and more professional board

committees.9 Hence, the correlation between the extent to which a firm opts out of exchange

requirements and the fraction of the directors of that firm who are independent directors would

latter survey emphasizes that causal links from board independence to firm outcomes have not been easy to show.

                                                                                                             11
be an indicator that opt outs are associated with weaker governance. Regressions of this fraction

on measures of opt outs reveal this correlation. In such regressions, prior work points out the

importance of controlling for the size of the board as well as the size, leverage, and profitability

of the firm.

Data

        The data for these tests come from a few sources. Information on board independence is

from BoardEx, a database containing information on firm leadership and boards for global firms.

These data track the individual directors of firms in each year and provide information indicating

the extent to which directors also hold management roles. Directors are classified as independent

if their role indicates that they are not insiders.10 The Fraction of Independent Directors is

computed for each firm in each year by dividing the number of independent board directors by

the total number of board members. Measures of the independence of directors and of board size

are merged with the data on cross-listed firms that trade on U.S. exchanges using a name-

matching routine. 439 firms are successfully matched.

        Information on the characteristics of firms is drawn from Compustat. The log of assets is

used as a measure of firm size. Leverage is the ratio of total debt to the sum of total debt and

book equity, and profitability is measured as the ratio of net income to assets, or return on assets.

The measures of board size, board independence, and firm characteristics are time varying, and

in order to reduce the impact of any unusual values in a particular year, average values of these

variables taken using data from 2004 to 2008 are used in the specifications. The specifications

also include fixed effects for the country of a firm’s headquarters as well as fixed effects for the

exchange a firm is listed on.


10
 Specifically, “Independent Director,” “Independent NED,” “Independent Board Member,” and “Independent
Outside Director” are mapped to the independent indicator.

                                                                                                         12
Results

          Analysis of the relationship between opting out and board director independence appears

in Table 5. The -0.0330 coefficient on Number of Opt Outs in column 1 indicates that the

average share of independent directors is 3.30 percentage points lower for each additional

exchange requirement that a firm opts out of. This is a roughly seven percent decrease in the

average number of independent board members. The specification in the second column includes

controls for the size of the board, the log of firm assets, firm leverage, and the firm’s return on

assets. The coefficient on the number of opt outs remains negative and significant in this

specification, and its magnitude is similar. In addition, smaller firms and firms with larger

boards tend to have a lower share of independent directors.

          Only three of the categories of exchange governance requirements described in Table 1

relate directly to the independence of directors, namely those related to board independence

requirements, board committee requirements, and audit committee requirements. The

specifications in columns 3 and 4 of Table 5 provide a test of whether the measures of opting out

of these particular requirements identify the extent to which firms have independent directors.

In column 3, the coefficients on dummies for firms that opt out of board independence

requirements, board committee requirements, and audit committee requirements are each

negative and significant. However, the coefficients on the dummies that are equal to one for the

other categories of opt outs are each statistically insignificant and small in magnitude.11 Similar

results appear in column 4, which presents a specification that includes additional controls.

Thus, the measures of the extent to which firms opt out of exchange governance requirements




11
  As the NYSE does not have requirements characterized as General Corporate Practice requirements, the dummy
for opt outs of such requirements is set equal to zero for NYSE-listed firms.

                                                                                                           13
appear to be meaningfully related to governance practices. Firms that opt out of U.S. exchange

governance requirements seem to follow weaker governance practices.




       IV.      Opting Out and the Costs and Benefits of Complying

             Given that such a large fraction of cross-listed firms opt out of U.S. exchange

requirements and that opting out appears to be associated with materially distinctive corporate

governance choices, it is natural to ask what motivates firms to opt out. Opting out could reflect

some of the same costs and benefits that have been used to explain which firms decide to cross-

list in the existing literature. Given the findings in recent work, notably Doidge, Karolyi, Lins,

Miller, and Stulz (2009), two types of considerations seem especially salient. The first relates to

the private benefits managers enjoy. Evidence suggests that these benefits are larger in countries

where corporate governance is weak.12 Thus, managers of firms based in countries where

corporate governance is weak might be reluctant to comply fully with U.S. exchange

requirements, while the costs of complying for managers of firms based in countries with strong

governance practices might be smaller. Alternatively, the benefits of complying with U.S.

exchange governance requirements may be larger for firms whose home country requirements

are weaker, implying that firms from such countries would be less likely to opt out. These

hypotheses can be tested in country-level analysis of what types of environments are home to

firms that opt out of U.S. exchange governance requirements.

             The second type of consideration relates to a firm’s need for capital. For firms that are

growing and have a need for external finance, complying fully with U.S. exchange governance

requirements might increase access to capital. When a firm is not bound to strong corporate


12
     See, for example, Dyck and Zingales (2004).

                                                                                                         14
governance practices, investors should anticipate potential agency problems and be willing to

pay less for an ownership stake. Thus, firms based in countries with weak governance rules that

are growing quickly and have a need to raise capital are likely to benefit from committing to

stringent governance requirements. Firm-level analysis of the relationship between opting out

and measures of growth for firms based in countries with strong and weak governance sheds

light on these ideas.

Data

        In order to conduct country-level analysis of the correlation between the extent to which a

cross-listed firm opts out of U.S. exchange requirements and the governance practices in a firm’s

home country, firms are assigned a home country on the basis of the location of the firm’s

headquarters.13 Tests consider two measures of the extent to which the home country legal and

regulatory environment permit managers to consume private benefits. The first is a dummy that

is equal to one for firms based in civil law countries and zero for firms based in common law

countries. These legal origins are drawn from Djankov et al. (2008) and the CIA World

Factbook. Common law tends to promote market outcomes by protecting private property and

contract rights while civil law is more concerned with market failures and supports state-desired

allocations in ways that can attenuate the strength of private contracts. La Porta, Lopez-de-

Silanes, and Shleifer (2008) reviews research on legal origins, and La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes,

Shleifer, and Vishny (1998) and Djankov, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (2003) show

that common law countries offer stronger protections to holders of financial claims that are more

efficiently enforced.



13
  An alternative choice of country would be the firm’s country of incorporation. However, because the headquarter
country will likely have more sizeable assets than the incorporating country when these are different, the
headquarter country is a better measure when considering potential legal actions.

                                                                                                               15
       The second measure of corporate governance in a country is the Anti-Self-Dealing Index

created by Djankov, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (2008). This index measures the

legal protection of minority shareholders against expropriation by corporate insiders, and it has

been shown to predict a variety of stock market outcomes. The country-level tests also include

controls for market liquidity and GDP per capita. Stock market turnover is defined as the ratio of

the value of total shares traded to the average market capitalization, and it is taken from the

World Bank Financial Structure Database. GDP per capita is drawn from the Penn World

Tables. Each of the independent variables in the country-level analysis is measured using data

from the year 2008.

       Data for the firm-level analysis are drawn from Compustat. Measures of net property,

plant, and equipment (PP&E) growth, and equity issuance are used as proxies for the extent to

which a firm is growing and has a need for external finance. Net PP&E growth is computed as

the annual percentage change in net PP&E. Equity issuance is the change in common equity

plus the change in deferred tax assets minus the change in retained earnings, scaled by lagged

assets, following the approach in Baker, Stein, and Wurgler (2003). The specifications used in

the firm-level analysis also include country fixed effects, exchange fixed effects, and several

additional controls. Firm size is measured using the log of assets; leverage is measured as the

ratio of total debt to the sum of total debt and the book value of equity; and profitability is

measured as the return on assets or the ratio of net income to assets. The specifications also

control for industry q, which is calculated by first, for each firm, computing the ratio of the book

value of total assets less the book value of equity plus the market value of equity less the book

value of deferred taxes to the book value of total assets. Then the median value of this ratio is

calculated for each 2-digit SIC code. In order to reduce the impact of any unusual values in a



                                                                                                    16
particular year, each of the right hand side variables in the firm-level analysis is measured as an

average of annual values covering the 2004 to 2008 period. To reduce the influence of outliers,

the net PP&E growth and equity issuance variables are censored at the 1% and 99% level.

Summary statistics for these variables appear in Table 4.

Results

          Table 6 presents the results of country-level analysis of the relationship between opting

out and the home country characteristics of cross-listed firms. The dependent variable in the first

two columns is the average of the number of governance categories opted out of by firms that are

headquartered in a particular country. The coefficient on the Civil Law Dummy in column 1 is

0.8768, and it is positive and statistically significant, indicating that firms based in civil law

countries are more likely to opt out of U.S. exchange governance requirements. In column 2, the

coefficient on the Anti-Self-Dealing Index is negative and significant, indicating that firms from

countries where regulations limit self-dealing are less likely to opt out. Each of the

specifications in Table 6 includes controls for stock market turnover and the log of GDP per

capita, so the results on the impact of governance practices in a firm’s home country do not

merely reflect market liquidity or wealth.

          The dependent variable in specifications 3 and 4 is the country average of a dummy equal

to one for firms that opt out of any U.S. exchange governance requirement. As such, these

columns analyze cross-country variation in the share of firms that opt out of any governance

requirement. The results in these columns are similar to those in the first two columns. The

share of firms from civil law countries and countries with weak regulations limiting self-dealing

are more likely to opt out of the governance requirements of U.S. exchanges. The last two

columns present results of tests using a third measure of opting out, namely the average fraction



                                                                                                      17
of opt outs. This measure addresses the issue that the NYSE does not have requirements

characterized as General Corporate Practice requirements by scaling the number of opt outs for

each firm by the number of categories of requirements imposed by the exchange the firm is listed

on. The results in these columns are similar to those in the previous ones.

       Overall, the country-level analysis in Table 6 suggests that cross-listed firms are more

likely to comply with U.S. exchange governance requirements when they already comply with

stringent governance requirements in their home country and are unlikely to be able to consume

private benefits. The costs of compliance with U.S. exchange regulations appear to be more

likely to dominate the benefits for firms from countries with weak as opposed to strong corporate

governance regulations.

       The tests presented in Table 7 examine whether firms with higher growth and external

financing needs adhere to exchange requirements. The dependent variable in each specification

is the number of categories of U.S. exchange governance requirements a firm opts out of. The

specifications estimate the relationship between the number of opt outs and various firm

characteristics. All regressions include fixed effects for the exchange the firm is listed on as well

as country fixed effects. For the sample of firms based in common law countries, the coefficient

on PP&E growth is negative but it is insignificant in explaining the number of opt outs, as

indicated in the first column. However, this coefficient is negative and significant in the second

column, implying that when firms are based in countries with weak corporate governance

regulations, they opt out of fewer requirements if they are experiencing higher levels of growth.

While there are differences in the significance of the coefficients on PP&E Growth for the

sample of firms in common law countries and the sample of firms in civil law countries, an F-test




                                                                                                   18
reveals it is not possible to conclude that the coefficient on net PP&E growth in column 1 is

statistically different from the coefficient on this variable in column 2.

        The specifications in columns 3 and 4 include controls for firm size, firm leverage, firm

profitability, and a measure of q for the firm’s industry. Once again, the coefficient on net PP&E

growth is negative in both specifications, but it is only significant in column 4, which presents

results for the sample of firms based in civil law countries.

        The coefficients on Log Assets in these specifications are also noteworthy. These

coefficients are positive in both specifications, but only the one in column 4 is significant. Thus,

in the sample of firms that are based in civil law countries and cross-list on a U.S. exchange,

smaller firms are less likely to opt out of exchange corporate governance requirements.

Although coefficients on Industry q are negative in both specifications—suggesting the firms in

industries with better investment opportunities are less likely to opt out—these coefficients are

not statistically significant.

        Columns 5-8 repeat this analysis but instead of exploring the relationship between net

PP&E growth and the number of opt outs for firms based in different kinds of countries, the

specifications explore the relationship between equity issuance and the number of opt outs. The

results in these columns are similar to those in the first four columns. Firms that engage in more

equity issuance and that are based in civil law countries opt out of fewer governance

requirements than do other firms. It is noteworthy that the coefficients on Equity Issuance are

statistically different from each other across both the two samples of firms in columns 5 and 6

and columns 7 and 8.

        Taken together, the results in Tables 6 and 7 provide evidence that while on average

cross-listed firms from countries with weak corporate governance practices are more likely to opt



                                                                                                    19
out of U.S. exchange governance requirements, if firms from such countries are small, growing

and need external finance, they are more likely to comply. Thus, the costs of complying with

U.S. exchange governance rules appear, on average, to outweigh the benefits for cross-listed

based in countries with weak governance regulations, but the need to fund growth provides

especially strong incentives to comply for such firms.



    V.        Opting Out and Valuations

           Opting out of governance requirements could affect the market value of firms. If

governance requirements limit the ability of corporate insiders to make choices that generate

private benefits at the expense of capital providers, valuations of firms that abide by

requirements should be higher than those of firms that do not. Empirically analyzing the impact

of opting out on broad measures of firm value such as Tobin’s q, however, is challenging.

Many determinants of value, including the attractiveness of growth opportunities, are difficult to

measure in a cross-country setting. Simple tests of whether Tobin’s q varies with the extent to

which firms abide by U.S. exchange corporate governance requirements do not yield significant

results.

           A more revealing approach to exploring the consequences of opting out on firm value

focuses on the value of cash holdings, and it is based on the work of Faulkender and Wang

(2006), Dittmar and Mahrt-Smith (2007), and Frésard and Salva (2010). These papers develop a

method that uses stock market returns to estimate the impact of changes in cash holdings on

changes in firm value for different types of firms. Dittmar and Mahrt-Smith (2007) find that the

value of cash is lower in poorly governed firms, and their approach can be used to assess if

opting out of U.S. exchange governance requirements appears to reduce the value the market



                                                                                                 20
assigns to cash held inside of cross-listed firms from countries with weak governance

regulations. The motivation for this hypothesis is that cash reserves can be easily accessed by

managers, and managers have considerable discretion in how cash reserves are used. If

managers are not constrained by corporate governance rules and regulations, they might have

greater latitude to use cash in ways that generate private benefits at the expense of shareholder

value. While shareholders of a cross-listed firm from a country with strong governance

regulations are protected whether or not the firm opts out of U.S. exchange governance

requirements, these U.S. exchange governance requirements might play a more significant role

in protecting shareholders of firms from countries with weak governance regulations.

       In order to consider how the relationship between changes in cash holdings and changes

in firm value varies across different kinds of cross-listed firms, it is informative to regress the

annualized excess stock market returns of a firm on changes in cash holdings, changes in cash

holdings interacted with a measure of the extent to which cross-listed firms opt out of U.S.

exchange requirements, and a set of controls. Given that the consequences of opting out of U.S.

exchange requirements are likely to be larger for firms based in countries with weak corporate

governance regulations, it is also informative to separately conduct analysis of the subsample of

firms based in common law countries and the subsample of firms based in civil law countries. In

these specifications, controls for changes in firms’ profitability, financial policy, and investment

capture idiosyncratic firm characteristics that may be correlated with both firm cash holdings and

returns. A more detailed discussion of this approach appears in Faulkender and Wang (2006)

and Dittmar and Mahrt-Smith (2007). Frésard and Salva (2010) use this framework to illustrate

that investors place a higher value on the cash held by foreign firms that are cross listed in the

U.S.



                                                                                                      21
Data

           Following the methodology used in prior work, annualized excess stock market returns

are calculated using CRSP data. The returns of the 25 reference portfolios come from Kenneth

R. French’s website.14 Excess returns are calculated on a monthly basis and annualized for the

regressions. Data used to compute the control variables are drawn from Compustat, and these

controls include the change in earnings, the change in net assets, the change in R&D

expenditures, the change in interest expenses, the change in dividends, beginning of period cash,

the value of total debt, and new finance, which is the sum of new equity issues and new debt

issues. Each of these is scaled by the market value of equity. Following Faulkender and Wang

(2006), the outcome and control variables are censored at the 1% and 99% level. The data used

in analyzing the value of cash holdings cover 2000 through 2011. Each specification includes

exchange fixed effects.

Results

           The first column in Panel A of Table 8 displays results for the full sample. The -0.0927

coefficient on the interaction of the change in cash holdings and the number of opt outs indicates

that opting out of an additional U.S. exchange governance requirement category reduces the

value of cash by almost $0.10, but this coefficient is not statistically significant. The

specification that is presented in column 2 includes country fixed effects, and it yields similar

estimates.

           The next four columns present results for the subsamples of firms based in common and

civil law countries. Opting out of U.S. exchange governance requirements should have larger

effects if governance practices in a firm’s home country are weaker. Consistent with this

hypothesis, the coefficient on the interaction of the change in cash holdings and the number of
14

                                                                                                    22
opt outs is negative and significant in columns 5 and 6, but it is insignificant in columns 3 and 4.

For firms based in civil law countries, opting out of a requirement reduces the value of each

dollar of cash by about $0.20. Opting out of requirements does not appear to have a statistically

significant effect on the value of cash for firms based in common law countries.

       Panel B of Table 8 provides estimates of the marginal value of $1 in cash that are based

on the coefficients in Panel A. For the average firm in the full sample, a dollar inside the firm is

worth about $1.21. This estimate is computed using mean values of leverage, lagged cash, and

the number of opt outs for firms based in all countries in the sample. For the full sample, on the

basis of specifications with country fixed effects, the implied value of a dollar to firms that do

not opt out of any U.S. exchange governance requirements is $1.49, and the implied value of a

dollar to firms that opt out of all six types of U.S. exchange governance requirements is $0.92.

The differences in the sign and magnitude of the coefficients on the interaction of the change in

cash holdings and the number of opt outs across firms in common and civil law countries imply

large disparities in the effects of opting out on the value of cash. For firms based in common law

countries that do not opt out of any U.S. exchange governance requirements, a dollar is worth

$1.54, and it is worth $1.85 for firms from those countries that opt out of all six types of

requirements; the difference between these does not have the expected sign, but it is not

statistically significant. However, for firms based in civil law countries that do not opt out of

any U.S. exchange governance requirements, a dollar is worth $1.52, and it is only $0.32 for

firms from those countries that opt out of all six types of requirements. The difference between

these two values is statistically different from zero.

       The coefficients on the controls in Table 8 are similar to those obtained in prior work. In

both Faulkender and Wang (2006) and Dittmar and Mahrt-Smith (2007), increases in earnings,



                                                                                                     23
dividends, and assets tend to be associated with larger increases in value. Changes in interest

expenses, higher levels of debt, lower levels of lagged cash, and new debt and equity issues tend

to be associated with decreases in value. Changes in R&D expenditures are insignificant in

explaining changes in value, as they were in Dittmar and Marht-Smith (2007). Although the

interactions of the change in cash holdings with lagged cash and with leverage are insignificant

in Dittmar and Mahrt-Smith (2007), these interactions also have negative and significant

coefficients in Faulkender and Wang (2006).



   VI.      Conclusion

         Foreign firms’ ability to opt out of U.S. exchange governance requirements and follow

their home country rules provides a window into central questions in corporate governance. As a

result of recently enacted SEC disclosure rules, foreign firms listed on U.S. exchanges now must

articulate more clearly the extent to which they comply with exchange requirements. Studying

the extent to which cross-listed firms opt out provides insight about the costs and benefits of

complying with stringent governance rules. Such investigation also sheds light on the effect of

governance requirements on valuation.

          Analysis of which firms opt out of U.S. exchange requirements and of the consequences

of opting out reveals four main findings. First, opting out is quite common. 80.2% of cross-

listed firms opt out of at least one U.S. exchange corporate governance requirement. Although

prior literature has emphasized the governance differences between cross-listings that do and do

not trade on a U.S. exchange, there is considerable heterogeneity in the extent to which listed

foreign firms agree to comply with the governance requirements of exchanges. Second, firms




                                                                                                  24
that opt out appear to adopt weaker governance practices. More specifically, firms that opt out

of board requirements have fewer independent directors.

       Third, the decision to opt out appears to reflect the relative costs and benefits of this

governance choice. The costs of complying are likely to be higher for insiders who might enjoy

certain private benefits when following weak governance practices allowed in their home

country. The benefits of complying are likely to be higher for firms that are attempting to raise

capital and grow. Consistent with this tradeoff, the data show that firms based in countries with

weak corporate governance are less likely to comply and those that are based in such countries

and are expanding and issuing equity are more likely to comply. Finally, the results indicate that

opting out of U.S. exchange requirements has consequences for how the market values cash

holdings. For firms from countries with weak governance requirements, cash within the firm is

worth significantly less if the firm opts out of more U.S. exchange requirements.

       While making a causal statement is difficult due to endogeneity concerns, the evidence

indicates that compliance facilitates the ability of firms to raise external finance to pursue

growth. Foreign firms bond themselves to the more stringent corporate governance requirements

of U.S. exchanges in a manner that has meaningful effects on their access to capital and their

market valuation. However, the high share of foreign firms that opts out, especially foreign firms

from countries with weak governance regulations, suggests that the costs of complying with

strict governance requirements are too high for many insiders. This implies a limit to the extent

cross-listed firms can effectively borrow the U.S. governance environment. Strong foreign

institutions do not appear to easily substitute for the institutional environment in a firm’s home

country.




                                                                                                     25
       These results suggest refinements to the legal bonding hypothesis used to explain cross-

listing. While the presumption that all cross-listed firms completely bond themselves to U.S. law

and exchange rules does not appear to be true, the cost-benefit framework proposed in the

existing literature explains the extent of compliance among firms that do cross-list. An

important question for future research is why firms choose to cross-list in the U.S. but opt out of

its exchanges’ rules.

                            Description of the U.S. Stock Exchanges' Governance Requirements
Notes: This table provides a description of each of the governance requirements of the NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX that foreign cross-listed firms
might opt out of. For each exchange, the individual requirements are grouped into the larger categories used in the paper: Board Independence,
Board Committee, Audit Committee, General Corporate Practices, Shareholder Approval for Stock Issuances, and General Good Governance
Practices.
Governance Requirement                          Description
A. NYSE
General Rules                                   Listed firms that are foreign private issuers, as such term is defined in Rule 3b-4 under
                                                the Exchange Act, are permitted to follow home country practice in lieu of the
                                                provisions of Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. Section 303A.11
                                                requires the disclosure of differences between the corporate governance rules contained
                                                in Section 303A which reflect the practices required of domestic firms and a particular
                                                foreign firm's practices. Deviations from exchange requirements related to provisions
                                                for shareholder approval for issuance of securities (Rule 312.03) and solicitation of
                                                proxies (Rule 402.00,402.04) need not be disclosed in Item 16G so these are not
                                                captured in the analysis.

                                                    Board Independence Requirements
Majority Board Independence                     Rule 303A.01 requires that a majority of the directors of a listed firm be independent.
                                                Independence is determined in accordance with the criteria in Rule 303A.02. To be
                                                considered independent, the Board must determine that the member has no material
                                                relationship with the firm. The NYSE also has identified certain specific relationships
                                                with the firm that preclude an individual from being considered independent until 3
                                                years after the specified relationship has ended. The bright line test items include: being
                                                an employee of the firm, receiving direct compensation of $120,000 in any year, or
                                                being an executive officer or having a family member be an executive officer of an
                                                entity that receives the greater of $1 million or 2% of its consolidated gross revenues
                                                from the firm.

Executive Sessions of Non-Management            Rule 303A.03 requires that non-management directors meet at regularly scheduled
Directors                                       sessions without management. This NYSE requirement allows directors to be included
                                                in such sessions who are not considered independent for reasons other than being an
                                                officer of the firm. In the event that executive sessions include non-independent
                                                members, the NYSE recommends that there be one meeting per year where only
                                                independent members meet in executive session.

                                                     Board Committee Requirements
Establish Nominating Committee or               Rule 303A.04 requires that listed firms have a nominating committee composed entirely
Nomination Decisions by Independent             of independent directors or that the directors be nominated by the independent board
Directors                                       members. The committee is required to have a written charter that describes the
                                                committee's purpose and responsibilities and also requires the committee to conduct an
                                                annual performance appraisal. The committee's responsibilities include identifying and
                                                selecting the director nominees unless the firm is legally bound by law or contract to
                                                have others nominate certain directors.
Establish Compensation Committee or             Rule 303A.05 requires that listed firms have a compensation committee composed
Compensation Decisions by Independent           entirely of independent directors. The committee is required to have a written charter
Directors                                       which describes the committee's purpose and responsibilities and also requires the
                                                committee to conduct an annual performance appraisal. Among the committee's
                                                responsibilities are to set the CEO's compensation and to make recommendations to the
                                                board for the compensation of non-CEO executive officers.
                                                  Audit Committee Requirements
Audit Committee: Minimum of Three           Rule 303A.07(a) requires that the audit committee of listed firms have at least three
Members                                     members and each member must have knowledge in finance. At least one of its members
                                            must have experience in accounting or financial matters. This rule also limits the number
                                            of audit committees on which a member can serve to three unless the board determines
                                            that simultaneous service on multiple boards does not interfere with the member's duties
                                            to this committee.
Audit Committee: Independent Members        Rule: 303A.07(b) requires that in addition to the independence requirements set forth in
                                            Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act that prohibit a director from receiving
                                            compensation from the firm or being an affiliated person of the firm or any of its
                                            subsidiaries, each audit committee member must satisfy the specific bright line test
                                            requirements for independence set in 303A.02 that are described above.

Audit Committee: Charter                    Rule 303A.07(c) requires that the audit committee have a written charter that addresses
                                            the duties and responsibilities of the audit committee which must include those set out in
                                            Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act and under Section 303A.07(c). The Exchange Act
                                            principally requires the committee to be responsible for the appointment, compensation,
                                            retention, and oversight of the outside auditors and have such auditors report directly to
                                            the committee. Section 303A.07(c) requires the committee to conduct a performance
                                            appraisal of the committee, to obtain and review the outside auditors report of the firm's
                                            internal controls, to discuss policies regarding risk and risk management, to review the
                                            firm's financial statements and disclosures, and to set hiring policies involving
                                            employees of the outside auditor.

Audit Committee: Internal Audit Function    Rule 303A.07(d) requires that each listed firm have an internal audit department to
                                            provide management and the audit committee with ongoing assessments of the firm’s
                                            risk management processes and system of internal control.

                                     Shareholder Approval Requirements for Stock Issuances
Shareholder Approval to Establish or       Rule 303A.08 requires that shareholders must be given the opportunity to vote on all
Amend Equity Compensation Plan             equity compensation plans and material revisions thereto.

                                              General Good Governance Practices
Corporate Governance Guidelines             Rule 303A.09 requires that listed firms must adopt and disclose their corporate
                                            governance guidelines. The board of directors should evaluate the performance of its
                                            functions and its committees at least once a year.
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics         Rule 303A.10 requires that listed firms must adopt and disclose a Code of Business
                                            Conduct and Ethics for directors and employees and promptly disclose any waivers of
                                            the code for directors or executive officers. The code of ethics must deal with conflicts
                                            of interest, corporate opportunities, compliance with laws and regulations, and
                                            confidentiality.
Corporate Governance Website Portal         Rule 303A.14 requires that listed firms have and maintain a publicly accessible website.

B. NASDAQ
General Rules                               The 5600 series rules of the NASDAQ Manual comprise the NASDAQ's Corporate
                                            Governance Requirements. The requirements under this section are more comprehensive
                                            than the 303A corporate governance requirements contained in the NYSE Listed
                                            Company Manual. Rule 5615 provides that a foreign firm may follow its home country
                                            practice in lieu of the requirements of Rule 5600, provided that the foreign private issuer
                                            discloses in its annual reports filed with the SEC each requirement of the 5600 series
                                            rules that it does not follow and describes the home country practice followed instead.
                                            Board Independence Requirements
Majority Board Independence             Rule 5605(b)(1) requires that a majority of the Board of Directors be independent
                                        directors as defined in Rule 5605(a)(2). To be independent, the individual cannot be an
                                        executive officer or employee of the firm, or an individual that has a relationship with
                                        the firm that the board determines would interfere with the individual exercising
                                        independent judgment. This definition differs from the NYSE definition in that the
                                        NASDAQ permits a relationship so long as the board determines that that it will not
                                        interfere with the individual's independent judgment. The NASDAQ also lists certain
                                        specific relationships with the firm that would disqualify an individual from being
                                        considered independent for a period of 3 years after the specified relationship ends.
                                        The bright line test indicate that a relationship exists if an individual is an employee of
                                        the firm, if he or a family member receives direct compensation of $120,000 or more in
                                        any 12 month period, if the individual is an executive officer of the firm, or if the
                                        individual or a family member is an executive officer of an entity that receives the
                                        greater of $200,000 or 5% of its consolidated gross revenues from the firm in a given
                                        year.
Executive Sessions of Independent       Rule 5605(b)(2) requires that the independent directors must have regularly scheduled
Directors                               meetings at which only they are present. There should be a minimum of two executive
                                        sessions each year.
                                              Board Committee Requirements
Establish Compensation Committee or     Rule 5605(d)(1) requires that the compensation of the CEO and other executive officers

Directors                               independent directors or by a compensation committee comprised solely of independent
                                        directors. The CEO may not be present during voting or deliberations. Unlike the NYSE
                                        rule, no charter is required for the compensation committee.

Establish Nominating Committee or       Rule 5605(e)(1) requires that director nominees must be selected or recommended for
Nominating Decisions by Independent     selection by the board of directors, either by a majority of the independent directors or

                                              Audit Committee Requirements
Audit Committee Charter                 Rule 5605(c)(1) requires that each firm adopt a formal written audit committee charter
                                        that explains the duties and responsibilities of the audit committee which, at a minimum,
                                        must include those set out in Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act. The purpose of the
                                        committee is to oversee the firm's financial reporting process and oversee auditor
                                        independence.

Audit Committee Composition Members     Rule 5605(c)(2)(A)(i) requires that the firm must have an audit committee of at least

                                        independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3(b)(1) under the Exchange Act and satisfy
                                        certain other criteria. The independence requirements set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the
                                        Exchange Act prohibit a director from receiving compensation for anything other than
                                        board and committee service from the firm or being an affiliated person of the firm or
                                        any of its subsidiaries. The SEC provides limited exemptions from the audit committee
                                        requirements for firms from certain countries where country laws require a statutory
                                        auditor or board of auditors.

Audit Committee No Participation in     Rule 5605(c)(2)(A)(iii) requires that each member must certify that they have not

Direct Registration Program                Rule 5255a requires that securities listed on the NASDAQ must be eligible for a direct
                                           registration program operated by a clearing agency. Direct registration allows the
                                           shareholder to be registered directly with the transfer agent without the need of a
                                           physical certificate to provide evidence of ownership.

                                           related party transactions for potential conflict of interest situations on an ongoing basis.

C. AMEX Requirements
General Rules                              AMEX Rule 110 provides that a foreign private issuer may follow its home country
                                           practice in lieu of the requirements of Part 8 of the AMEX Company Guide, provided
                                           that the foreign private issuer discloses in its annual reports filed with the SEC or on its
                                           website each requirement of Part 8, as well as certain specified provisions outside of
                                           Part 8, that it does not follow and describes the home country practice followed instead.
                                            Board Independence Requirements

                                        employee of the firm, or an individual that has a relationship with the firm that the board
                                        determines would interfere with the individual exercising independent judgment. This
                                        differs from the NYSE rule in that it allows a relationship to exist so long as the board
                                        determines that it will not interfere with the individual carrying out the required duties.

Executive Sessions of Independent       Rule 802 (c) requires that the independent directors must have regularly scheduled

                                        required. Under the AMEX rules a compensation is not required if the independent
                                        directors approve CEO compensation.

Establish Nominating Committee or       Rule 804(a) requires that director nominees must be selected, or recommended for

                                        with the nominations process set forth in a formal written charter or board resolution. A
                                        nomination committee is not necessary if the independent directors nominate the
                                        directors.

                                        that explains the duties and responsibilities of the audit committee which, at a minimum,
                                        must include those set out in Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act.

                                        the SEC.
33.33% Quorum                               Rule 123 requires that each firm must have a quorum for any meeting of its
                                            shareholders. The quorum may not be less than 33.33% of the outstanding shares of the

Notes: This table provides basic statistics on opting out. It indicates the number of firms that are cross-listed on a U.S. exchange but headquartered in each of the countries in the first column. It
also provides the share of firms from each of those countries that opt out of U.S. exchange governance requirements that are associated with the categories displayed in the top row. The last row
of the table provides information for the whole sample. General Corporate Practices is only relevant to firms listed on NASDAQ and AMEX, so it is computed only for these firms. The notation
"n.a." indicates that the percentage is not available because all firms for that country are listed on the NYSE, and the NYSE does not have requirements characterized as General Corporate

Notes: This table summarizes the variables used in the regressions in Tables 5-8. For Table 5, Fraction of Independent Directors is the average
fraction of directors who are classified as independent in the BoardEx database. Number of Opt Outs is the number of governance categories the
firm opts out of. The other opt out variables are dummy variables that are equal to one for firms that opt out of distinct categories of requirements
that appear in Table 1. Opt Out of General Corporate Practices is equal to zero for all NYSE-listed firms because the NYSE does not have any
such requirements. Board Size is the number of directors on the company's board. Leverage is total debt, defined as the sum of short term and
long term debt, divided by total debt plus book equity. Return on Assets is net income divided by total assets. All time-varying covariates are
averages of the corresponding variables taken over the five years from 2004 to 2008. For Table 6, Average Number of Opt Outs is the number of
governance categories the firm opts out of, averaged by country. A firm's country is measured as the reported location of their headquarters.
Average of Opt Out Dummy is the country average of a dummy equal to one if a firm opts out of any of the governance requirements. Average
Fraction of Opt Outs is the country average of the fraction of categories of requirements that a firm opts out of; there are six categories for
NASDAQ and AMEX-listed firms and five for NYSE-listed firms. The Civil Law Dummy is a dummy equal to one for firms with headquarters
in a country with a civil law legal origin. The Anti-Self-Dealing Index is drawn from Djankov, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (2008),
and higher values of this variable indicate that a country imposes stronger controls on self dealing. Stock Market Turnover measures the total
value of stocks traded as a fraction of average market capitalization. For Table 7, Number of Opt Outs is the number of governance categories the
firm opts out of. Net PP&E Growth is the annual first difference in net property, plant, and equipment scaled by lagged property, plant, and
equipment. Equity Issuance is the change in common equity plus the change in deferred tax assets minus the change in retained earnings, scaled
by lagged assets. Leverage is total debt, defined as the sum of short term and long term debt, divided by total debt plus book equity. Return on
Assets is net income divided by total assets. Industry q is calculated by first, for each firm, computing the ratio of the book value of total assets
less the book value of equity plus the market value of equity less the book value of deferred taxes to the book value of total assets, and then
taking the median value of this ratio for each 2-digit SIC code. All time-varying characteristics are averages of firm variables over the five years
from 2004-2008. For Table 8, Annualized Excess Returns is the annualized excess return of the firm relative to the Fama and French (1993) 25
size and book-to-market portfolios. Cash includes cash and marketable securities. Many variables are scaled by the market value of equity (ME).
Number of Opt Outs is the number of governance categories that firms opt out of. Earnings is earnings before extraordinary items plus interest,
deferred taxes, and investment tax credits. Net assets is the value of assets net of cash, and R&D is the value of R&D expenses. Interest
expenses include total interest and related expenses. Dividends include common dividends paid, and lagged cash is the lagged value of cash.
Debt/Market Value is the ratio of the sum of long term and short term debt to the sum of the long term debt, short term debt, and the market value
of equity. New Finance is the sum of net equity issues and net debt issues.

                                                Independent Directors and Opting Out
Notes: The dependent variable is the average fraction of directors who are classified as independent in the BoardEx database. Number of Opt Outs
is the number of governance categories the firm opts out of. The other opt out variables are dummy variables that are equal to one for firms that opt
out of distinct categories of requirements that appear in Table 1. Opt Out of General Corporate Practices is equal to zero for all NYSE-listed firms
because the NYSE does not have any such requirements. Board size is the number of directors on the company's board. Leverage is total debt,
defined as the sum of short term and long term debt, divided by total debt plus book equity. Return on Assets is net income divided by total assets.
The dependent variable and the time-varying covariates are averages of the corresponding variables taken over the five years from 2004 to 2008.
Each specification is an OLS specification that includes country fixed effects as well as fixed effects for the exchange the firm is listed on.
Heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors that correct for clustering at the country level appear in parentheses. ***, **, and * denote
significance at the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels, respectively.

Notes: The dependent variable in the first two columns is the number of governance categories the firm opts out of, averaged by country. A firm's home country is measured as the reported location
of its headquarters. The dependent variable in columns 3 and 4 is the country average of a dummy equal to one if a firm opts out of any of the governance requirements. The dependent variable in
columns 5 and 6 is the country average of the fraction of categories of requirements that a firm opts out of; there are six categories for NASDAQ and AMEX-listed firms and five for NYSE-listed
firms. The Civil Law Dummy is a dummy equal to one for firms with headquarters in a country with a civil law legal origin. The Anti-Self-Dealing Index is drawn from Djankov, La Porta, Lopez-
de-Silanes, and Shleifer (2008), and higher values of this variable indicate that a country imposes stronger controls on self dealing. Stock Market Turnover measures the total value of stocks traded
as a fraction of average market capitalization. The specifications are OLS specifications, and heteroskedasticity consistent standard errors appear in parentheses. ***, **, and * denote significance
at the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels, respectively.

Notes: The dependent variable is the number of governance categories the firm opts out of. Net PP&E Growth is the annual first difference in net property, plant, and equipment scaled by lagged
property, plant, and equipment. Equity Issuance is the change in common equity plus the change in deferred tax assets minus the change in retained earnings, scaled by lagged assets. Leverage is
total debt, defined as the sum of short term and long term debt, divided by total debt plus book equity. Return on Assets is net income divided by total assets. Industry q is calculated by first, for
each firm, computing the ratio of the book value of total assets less the book value of equity plus the market value of equity less the book value of deferred taxes to the book value of total assets,
and then taking the median value of this ratio for each 2-digit SIC code. All control variables are averages of firm variables over the five years from 2004 to 2008. Each specification is an OLS
specification with country fixed effects, as well as fixed effects for the exchange the firm is listed on. Standard errors clustered at the country level appear in parentheses. ***, **, and * denote
significance at the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels, respectively.

Panel A
Notes: The dependent variable is the annualized excess return of the firm relative to the Fama and French (1993) 25 size and book-to-market
portfolios. Cash includes cash and marketable securities. Many variables are scaled by the market value of equity (ME). Number of Opt Outs is
the number of governance categories that firms opt out of. Earnings is earnings before extraordinary items plus interest, deferred taxes, and
investment tax credits. Net assets is the value of assets net of cash, and R&D is the value of R&D expenses. Interest expenses include total
interest and related expenses. Dividends include common dividends paid, and lagged cash is the lagged value of cash. Debt/Market Value is the
ratio of the sum of long term and short term debt to the sum of the long term debt, short term debt, and the market value of equity. New Finance is
the sum of net equity issues and net debt issues. The specifications are OLS specifications, and the specification in the even numbered columns
include country fixed effects. All specifications include fixed effects for the exchange the firm is listed on. Heteroskedasticity-consistent standard
errors that correct for clustering at the firm level appear in parentheses. ***, **, and * denote significance at the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels,
