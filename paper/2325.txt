                    The Wealth and Poverty of Widows:

               Assets Before and After the Husband's Death




                                ABSTRACT


     We verify that widows are much more likely than couples to be
poor and that they make up a large proportion of the poor elderly;
80 percent are widows or other single individuals. Then we seek
to explain why the single elderly are poor, with emphasis on
widows. We do this by tracing back over time their financial
status, using the Longitudinal Retirement History Survey. The
death of the husband very often induces the poverty of the

surviving spouse, even though the married couple was not poor.
While only about 9 percent of prior couples are poor,
approximately 35 percent of the subsequent widows are. A large
proportion of the wealth of the couple is lost when the husband
dies. In addition we find that:        (1) the prior households of poor
widows earned and saved less than the prior households of non-poor
widows, (2) more of the smaller accumulated wealth was lost at the
death of the husband, (3) the absence of survivorship benefits or
life insurance insured that the loss in wealth would leave the
widow poor thereafter.

     Although the economic position of the elderly has improved
over the last fifteen years, substantial numbers, especially
single elderly, are still in poverty. For example, according to
the official poverty statistics, 22.1 percent of single elderly
men and 27.7 percent of single elderly women were poor in 1983.
Our goal in this paper is to discover why so many of the single
elderly are poor. Because many of the single elderly are widows,
and in our data set we can observe the economic changes that

accompany widowhood, we concentrate on explaining how so many
widows came to be poor. Our analysis is based on the Longitudinal
Retirement History Survey (RHS), which follows retirement—age
households over ten years, between 1969 and 1979. Our method is
to trace back over the years of the survey the wealth of widows
who were poor, and to compare their wealth paths with the wealth
paths of non-poor widows and of couples. In this way we can
determine, for example, if poor widows come from families that

support and to Tom Prusa for excellent research assistance. John
Shoven, Victor Fuchs, and Judy Bentkover provided very useful
comments on the paper.
                              Page 2

were poor when the husband was alive. By comparing wealth paths
we can find if, in the years near the husband's death, wealth
drops in an unexplained way. We can also examine the components
of wealth; we want to know, for example, if the family held life
insurance.                                  -


     As one would expect, we find that poor widows tend to come
from families that were poor when the husband was alive. But in
addition we find that the mortality rates of the poor are higher
than the mortality rates of the well—to-do. This differential
mortality by wealth level will, by itself, tend to cause a greater
fraction of widows to be poor than the fraction of poor among all
elderly. Furthermore, at the time of the husband's death a
considerable fraction of the family's economic resources are lost:
We find that about 32 percent of non-housing wealth and most of

job—related pensions disappear during the two-year interval in
which the husband dies. This wealth loss puts in poverty many
widows that came from families that were not poor before. In
fact, more than 75 percent of poor widows were not poor when their
husbands were alive. We have not found striking differences in
life insurance by poverty status. Even though there is some
variation in the amount of life insurance, the differences are not
great enough to affect poverty status in an important way.
     The findings reported in this paper set forth the
circumstances that lead to the poverty of widows. In doing this,
the paper also draws attention to our limited understanding of the
underlying determinants of some of these circumstances. These are
                               Page 3

 issues that must be addressed in subsequent research. For

example, why do families in which the husband dies at an early age
accumulate fewer assets by the age of retirement than families in
which the husband dies at a later age, even if their lifetime
earnings are apparently similar? We return to this question and
others at the end of the paper.

     The conclusions reached in the paper are based on a large
number of calculations, some of them in the form of detailed
tables. To facilitate exposition, we have included in the paper
itself only summary tables or illustrative excerpts from the more
extensive tables. The full tables are in a separate appendix
volume. We begin in the next section with documentation of the
wealth and poverty status of the elderly. We then consider the
circumstances that lead to the disproportionate poverty of widows.


I.   Wealth, Income, and Poverty Status

     In this section we discuss our data. Then we give some
wealth and income measures for the elderly population we study.
Finally, we offer several definitions of the poverty level. One
of them is quite close to the official Bureau of Labor Statistics
definition; using that definition we find fractions in poverty
that are similar to those found in the official statistics.

Other, more inclusive definitions, reduce the fraction in poverty
substantially.

A.   Data
     Our data come from the Longitudinal Retirement History Survey
(RBS). The RHS is a self-weighting sample of heads of households
who were born in 1905-1911. The heads, were initially interviewed
in 1969, and either they or their survivors were reinterviewed
every two years through 1979. Of the original sample, about 63
percent were married couples, about 21 percent widows (original
widows), and 16 percent singles. Over the ten years of the
survey, many husbands died: by 1979 about 15 percent of the

sample are surviving spouses.
     The survey collected extensive data on the income, assets,
work behavior and health of the households. We have aggregated
more than forty income and asset categories into our income and
wealth measures. Details may be found in the appendix volume. No
single wealth or income measure is completely satisfactory in
assessing the economic status of widows; therefore we use a number
of measures.

     One measure we call bequeathable wealth. Roughly speaking it
is the sum of stocks of wealth except housing equity. The main
components are saving accounts, stocks and bonds, equity in a
business, property, loans receivable, all net of debt. The
reasoning behind our use of this wealth measure is that it gives
the amount of wealth, other than housing, that may be inherited by
a widow; it measures liquidity better than other wealth
aggregates; and changes in its level are probably the best measure
of desired wealth change. We also study housing wealth, which is
                                 Page 5


the estimated market value of the house less debts on the house.

Because it is costly to vary consumption of housing services,
housing wealth is less useful as a measure of desired wealth
change. It is, of course, useful in understanding economic well-
being.                                         -

     Social    Security wealth is the expected present value of
future Social Security payments. Annuity wealth is the expected
present value of future pension payments. The other income and
wealth measures we use are direct responses from the

questionnaire.
         The value that we place on Medicare-Medicaid services is the
per person value transferred into the Medicare-Medicaid system.2
Our thinking is that it represents the cost of a fair medical
insurance policy which is given each year to those eligible.
Whether the insurance is valued at its true cost by those who use
the services is another question. The value of the services to
users who pay very little for them is likely to be much less than
the cost of providing them. On the other hand, a large fraction
of persons covered by Medicare-Medicaid would be willing to pay
much more for the coverage than this cost. Many of these would be
unable to purchase such insurance in the private market at the per
person value of transfers, and for many it would be unavailable at
any price. Thus the average value of such insurance to its
recipients may be more or less than its cost. Because of these




    2A similar treatment is followed by Hurd and Shoven [1983J.
                              Page 6

ambiguities we offer several wealth measures that exclude
Medicare-Medicaid.

     In our discussion of wealth we usually refer to medians
rather than means. This is because the wealth of the elderly is

highly skewed; the means may give a rnisleadiig impression of the
situation of most of the elderly. The drawback is that one cannot
sum the medians of the individual components to obtain an
aggregate median.

B.   Wealth and Income

     As shown in table 1, widows have much less wealth and income
than married couples. The mean of (non-housing) bequeathable
wealth for married couples is about $58,000 in 1979, but little
more than $21,000 for widows and only $18,000 for other single
persons. The medians are much smaller. Half of widows, for
example, have less than $6,000 in financial saving. Widows have
much less wealth in other categories as well. Their median
housing value is only $12,000, compared to $30,000 for couples.
More than half have no pension income. The average of pension
income is just $936 compared to $2,605 for couples. As we shall
see, this difference reflects the fact that many private pensions

do not have survivorship rights; but, in addition, the husbands
who died during the survey years began with smaller pensions than
the husbands who survived during the survey years.

     Human capital is the expected discounted value of future
labor earnings. At the advanced ages of the RHS population in
1979, the stock is not very important even though earnings are
                              Page 7

about 19 percent of the income of couples and 13 percent of
widows' income.

     By far the largest source of income for widows is Social

Security: their average benefits are S2,72 per year, somewhat
more than half of the mean level of beñefitsyeceived by couples.
A substantial proportion of income of both couples and widows is
in the form of medical care provided through Medicare or Medicaid.

For widows, we estimate its average value to be about 11 percent
of all income.

     Data for the other survey years show a pattern very similar
to that for 1979, except that Medicare-Medicaid income was much
lower in the earlier years. Because eligibility for these
programs does not begin until age 65, most of the elderly did not
have Medicare—Medicaid income in earlier years.

C.   Poverty

     Poverty levels were originally determined by considering the
cost of goods and services that would be necessary to maintain a
minimum acceptable standard of living. Goods and services include
such items as housing and health care. In practice, the poverty
level is usually defined by the income necessary to buy these
goods and services. If some goods and services are provided
through owner-occupied housing or through social insurance, less
current income is required to maintain this standard of living,
and the definition of a poverty level becomes ambiguous. In
principle, the income definition used should correspond to the
services included in the market basket used to determine the
                                 Page 8

poverty income level. The ambiguity is especially acute for the
elderly; 70 percent live in houses that they own, and many receive
large amounts of health care covered by Medicare or Medicaid.

Because there is no single unambiguous wayto account for these
services, we have elected to present estimat.s of the proportions
of persons in poverty based on several income definitions that are
progressively more inclusive. The first includes all standard
measures of income; the second adds car services and subtracts
interest payments on some forms of debt; the third adds the value
of housing services from owner-occupied housing; and the fourth
adds the annual value of Medicare-Medicaid coverage.3 In

evaluating the change in the financial status of the elderly over
time, the latter addition is especially important, although
difficult to measure precisely.
      The mean and median levels of income by these definitions,
together with the proportion below the poverty line are shown in
table 2 for 1979 and for 1969.

     Almost 37 percent of widows were poor in 1979, according to
the most limited income definition. Fewer than 10 percent of
married couples were poor by this measure. The median income of
widows was only 42 percent of the median for couples. Adding the
transportation services from owned cars and adjusting for debt
servicing (B) changes these numbers very little. Including the
cost of renting owner-occupied housing does reduce somewhat the




    3me precise definitions are found in table 2.
                               Page 9

percent below the poverty line.4 For example, the proportion of
widows with incomes below the poverty line is reduced from 36.7
percent to 29.6 percent. We will show below that most widows with
low income and total wealth also have little housing wealth. This
means that most could not improve their financial position

significantly by converting their housing wealth into current
consumption, say by means of a reverse mortgage. Most have little
to mortgage: as we reported in table 1, median housing wealth was
only $12,000. Other single elderly have even less housing wealth,
as indicated by the very small reduction in the percent below the
poverty line when housing services are counted as income.
     Judging by economic theory, our income measure (C) is
probably more accurate than (A) or (B): it adds to the usual
kinds of income, flows from non—financial assets. Although there
is some difference in income levels from measure (A), the general
impression is the same:   irtany more widows and singles than couples
are poor. Of course, it is difficult to compare incomes across
family sizes as one does not know the right correction for
economies of scale. The official poverty scale for the elderly
suggests that a single person requires about 79 percent of the
income of a couple. The Social Security survivorship rights of a




     4Our measure (C) is a rough measure of the added income that
could be obtained from selling the house, and investing the equity
in a bond that would both maintain its real value and return an
additional 3%. Thus (C) is a slight understatement, but not a
great understatement, of the income potential from converting
housing equity to measured income flow.
                              Page 10

widow suggest a widow requires about 67 percent of the income of a
couple. Whichever is correct it is clear that widows have
considerably less, about 45 percent according to (C). Thus, even
if there are economies of scale in household production and
consumption, at the median widows are considerably poorer than

couples.
     Counting as income our rather crude measure of the value of
Medicare-Medicaid, however, has a very substantial effect on the
number of elderly that are classified as poor, reducing the
percent poor from 29.6 to 17.1. Counting housing services and
Medicare-Medicaid almost halves the percent poor. The reduction
is even greater for single persons, from 35.9 to 14.9 percent.
While almost 10 percent of married couples are counted as poor by
the standard definition of income, fewer than 3 percent are below
the poverty line when Medicare-Medicaid and housing services are
counted as income. These large changes in the fraction in poverty
underscore two important points.
     First, it is clear from a comparison of the 1979 with the
1969 numbers that accounting for Medicare-Medicaid can have a
substantial effect on the poverty status of the elderly. This
happens mainly because we included in (D) an income flow from
Medicare-Medicaid only if an individual was eligible. But because
the age of eligibility is 65, almost no one had an income flow
from Medicare-Medicaid in 1969. By 1979 most of the sample were
eligible (except young widows). In addition, benefits under
Medicare-Medicaid increased faster than the Consumer Price Index,
                               Page 11

so   the imputed income from the medical programs increased faster
than the poverty cutoff. Nonetheless, although there can be
dispute about how to measure precisely the benefit from the
medical programs, these programs were intended to help the elderly
population and by these measures they have done just that.
Second, it is evident from the 1979 numbers that relatively small
changes in income can have a large effect on the proportion below
the poverty line. For example, a $2,748 increase in income for
married couples removes from the poverty roles 70 percent of those
who would otherwise be there. This sensitivity to definition
indicates of course that the incomes of many of the poorest
elderly are close to the poverty line.
      To avoid confusion, all of the calculations below are based
on income definition (A). In addition, all money values are in
1979 dollars. For simplicity, we have not reported sample sizes
in the tabulations; differences and other patterns that are
revealed in the data should be taken to be statistically

significant, however.


II. The Husband's Death and the Transition to Poverty

      The death of a woman's husband increases very substantially
the likelihood that she is poor. This is shown in the first panel
of the tabulation below.

      a. The entries are percents. The husbands in
      the couple to widow category died between 1973 and
      1975. The data for 1971 are shown for comparison.

The tabulation classification is based on the transition between
1973 and 1975. A couple is classified in the first column if the
husband and wife were alive in 1973 and in 1975; a couple is
classified in the second column if the husband died between 1973
and 1975. The last two columns pertain to singles and widows
respectively. The data for the groups with no change in marital
status provide a control for economy-wide trends that may have
affected the changes in poverty rates from one year to the next.
     In 1973 the poverty rate of couples in which the husband
survived until 1975 was 8 percent (first column of the first

panel), just slightly lower than the 9 percent poverty rate of
                                Page 13

couples in which the husband died between 1973 and 1975 (second
column) .    Yet in 1975 the poverty rate of the couples fell to 7
percent while the poverty rate of the surviving widows rose to 42
percent. A similar pattern is found in other years.5
     The second and third panels show, as expected, a strong
relationship between the poverty status of the couple when the
husband was alive and the poverty status of the widow. For
example, 85 percent of widows from couples that were poor in 1973
were poor in 1975. What is surprising, however, is that fully 37
percent of widows from couples that were not poor in 1973 were
poor in 1975. This confirms the pattern in panel 1; the death of
the husband is a strong predictor of the poverty of the surviving
household.

     The second panel also illustrates the difficulty in drawing
welfare implications from poverty status defined by income.
Poverty is not a permanent state even among the elderly. It varies
substantially from year to year. For example, (in the first
column) only half of the couples that were poor in 1973 were also
poor in 1971; and only half were poor in 1975. Column 4 shows
similar results for widows. More detailed data show that the
poverty of widows and singles is more likely to persist than the




     5Although these data based on the 1975—1977 transition
suggest that the prior poverty rate of households in which the
husbands died were about the same as those in which he did not,
the data for all possible comparisons made it clear that this is
not the case. In 10 of a possible 14 comparisons, the continuing
couple group had a lower rate of poverty than the couple to widow
group. In the other 4 comparisons, the rates were equal.
                                Page 14

poverty of couples; nonetheless we find considerable movement into
 and out of poverty.6 From a social point of view temporary
poverty is not as serious as permanent poverty.

     Instead of income, suppose that poverty is defined by wealth.
Our wealth poverty line is chosen so that the same proportion of
households has total wealth below this cutoff as the proportion
that has income below the official income-based poverty line. In

addition, we distinguish surviving spouse widows from original
widows. The husbands of surviving spouse widows died during the
RHS survey years; heads of households who were already widows when
the survey began are called original widows. Using these
definitions, we find the following prevalence and persistence of
poverty:

the percent who were also poor in 1969. Surviving spouses
in 1979 were married in 1969.


     6Errors in reporting will of course affect the proportion
classified as poor and the change in the proportion from one
survey period to the next. If a large fraction of those
classified as poor are close to the poverty line, as the data
above suggest, reporting errors will have a greater effect.

Note that the percent of surviving spouses poor in 1969 pertains
to the poverty status of these widows when they were married; all
were married when the survey began. Original widows are the most
likely to be poor.7 They have been widowed the longest and
presumably their husbands died at the youngest ages. The poverty
status of original widows and singles is by far the most
persistent, based on the usual income definition. But this
conclusion is much less obvious if poverty is based on wealth.
The poverty status of all groups is much more permanent based on
the wealth definition. This is particularly true for married
couples and surviving spouses, who appeared to have the greatest
fluctuation in financial status based on the income definition.


III.     Causes of Poverty

       We have shown above that the death of the husband in itself
induces poverty. To understand how widows come to be poor, we
consider their financial position prior to widowhood, and how it
changed when their husbands died. We also consider other prior
attributes, such as health status and the age of the husband at
his death, which may be considered proximate causes of poverty.
It will help at this point to outline how we shall proceed:




     7More detailed data show that new surviving spouse widows are
the most likely to be poor. But original widows are more likely
to be poor than surviving spouses who have been widows for a few
years.
                              Page 16


     • We show first that the husband's death is associated with
       less prior accumulation of wealth; mortality is associated
       with differential wealth.
     • Loss of wealth when the husband dies is then described in
       detail. It is shown that the prior households of poor
       widows had much less wealth than the prior households of
       non-poor widows. And, a larger proportion of the wealth of
       poor widow households was lost at the husband's death.
     • Next it is shown that transfer of wealth to children when
       the husband dies does not explain the loss of wealth at his
       death.

     • The relationship of earnings to wealth accumulation for
       poor and non—poor widows is then explored, albeit in a
       rather crude fashion, and the potential effect of health on
       saving is investigated. The households of poor widows
       apparently accumulated much less wealth per dollar of
       earned income than the households of non-poor widows. The
       husbands in the prior households of widows also had poorer
       health than the husbands in the continuing couple
       households. In addition, the husbands of poor widows had
       poorer health in prior years than the husbands of non—poor
       widows.

     • Finally, there is a brief discussion of the extent of
       support from children. It is very limited, but greater for
       poor than for non—poor widows.

A.   Differential Mortality
     The early death of the husband is itself associated with less
prior wealth accumulation. The tabulation below gives total
wealth in earlier survey years by change in marital status between
1977 and 1979.

      1979          134,953      87,878        46,807         73,312

      a. The column categories are defined by change in
      marital status between 1977 and 1979. The entries
      are in 1979 dollars.

     This tabulation, and others not reported, give convincing
evidence of differential mortality by wealth level. In all the
years before the husband's death the prior couples of widows

(column 2) had less wealth than the continuing couples (column 1).
For example, in 1969, fully eight years before the husband died,
wealth was 7 percent lower. While it may be reasonable to suppose
that wealth is lower in the year just before the husband's death
because of medical expenses associated with his death, it seems
unlikely that wealth differentials of such persistence could be
attributed to differences in medical expenses. Rather the results
raise the possibility that lifetime health differences are
associated with differences in lifetime earnings (and, hence,
differences in retirement-age wealth), and differences in

mortality rates.
     We have shown above that original widows are the most likely
to be poor. And given that households in which the husband later
died had less wealth, prior to his death, than households in which
both the husband and wife lived, one might expect that surviving
                             Page 18

spouse widows would be more likely to be poor the younger the
husband was when he died. The evidence is not consistent with
this presumption, however. As the tabulation below shows for
widows in 1979, there is essentially no relationship between the
percent who are poor and the age of the husband at his death.

                      71            30



There is also no relationship between the proportion of widows who
are poor and the number of years since the husband's death.

B.   Wealth Loss When the Husband Dies
     We have verified, as expected, that a widow is likely to be

poor if the prior couple was poor. Furthermore, differential
mortality implies that widowhood, itself, is an indicator that the
prior couple was poorer than the average couple. From these facts

alone, one would expect higher than average poverty rates among
widows. Yet this is certainly not the only cause of the high
poverty rates. In this section we show that substantial wealth
loss accompanies the husband's death.
                             Page 19

     The following tabulation verifies substantial wealth loss at
the husband's death. We classify according to poverty status in
1977 and consider wealth in 1977 and in 1975. We again present
data for those who had no change in marital status during this
period, as well as the data for widows in 1917 whose husbands were
alive in 1975. The first nwnber of each pair pertains to 1975 and
the second number to 1977.

a. The first of the two entries pertains to 1975 (when the
husband in the couple to widow category was living) and the
second entry to 1977 (after he had died). The entries are
in 1979 dollars.
                              Page 21



     The classification is by poverty status in 1977. The data in
the second column of the first panel, for example, refer to the
wealth of widows who were poor in 1977 and whose husbands died
between 1975 and 1977. Of course, the tabulation shows that the
families of poor widows had less wealth in 1975, when the husband
was alive, than the families of non-poor widows. But an
additional fact is evident. Although both poor and non-poor
widows lost wealth over the period of the husband's death, the

poor widows lost a higher fraction, 37 percent versus 28 percent.
The poor widows had less wealth than non-poor widows in all

categories, both before and after the husbandts death. But, an
interesting finding is that the difference in Social Security
wealth is much smaller than the differences in other kinds of
wealth.

     To the extent that Social Security wealth is proportional to
Social Security benefits for people of the same sex and age, and
Social Security benefits are related to lifetime earnings, the
similarity of Social Security wealth indicates that the two groups
of widows came from families whose lifetime earnings were not

widely different, Of course, the progressivity of the Social
Security benefit schedule dampens earnings differences;
nonetheless, the differences between Social Security wealth, on
the one hand, and bequeathable wealth and housing wealth on the
other hand, suggest that part of the cause of poverty is a failure
of the family to accumulate assets during the working life. These
                              Page 22

data do not indicate why some families accumulated assets and
others did not; but differential mortality, emphasized below, is
consistent with the hypothesis that health was different during
the working life. That, in turn, suggests that medical
expenditures may have been greater during th working life. Of
course, it is certainly possible that rather small lifetime
earnings differences lead to large ex post differences in assets
at retirement.

     Possibly the most striking result is the difference between
the private annuities of poor and non—poor widows. The annuity
wealth of poor widows was virtually eliminated at the death of the
husband, declining from $9,904 to $1,198. Widows who were not
poor had much more annuity wealth when married and lost much less
of it when the husband died, 36 percent instead of 88 percent.

Presumably recent legislation will reduce very substantially this
kind of wealth loss when a spouse dies.

     Even though widows who were not poor had about twice as much
life insurance as those who were poor, neither group had much.

Apparently the life insurance collected by non-poor widows led to
the increase in bequeathable wealth, whereas the bequeathable
wealth of poor widows fell at the death of the husband. Whatever
the interpretation of the reported face value of life insurance,
the tabulation makes it clear that life insurance was not
sufficient to make up for the loss in other wealth.
     In summary: If the husband in a household dies, the
probability that the household is poor typically increases from
                              Page 23

less than 10 percent to more than 35 percent. We find that
households in which the husband died accumulated less wealth than
households in which both the husband and wife survived. This

effect is especially pronounced for personal saving. The prior
couples of poor widows accumulated much less-wealth than the prior
couples of non—poor widows. A large fraction of the wealth of the
couple is dissipated when the husband dies, and the loss of wealth
is greater for poor than for non-poor widows. In the next
sections, we explore further the potential reasons for the lower
prior household wealth of widows and the particularly low prior
wealth of poor widows.

C.   Transfer of Wealth to Children?
     An explanation for the wealth decline at the husband's death
is that children receive inheritances. In the next tabulation we
give data that allow an informal test of that hypothesis and which
also confirm the differential wealth by mortality. Again the
tabulation differentiates households according to whether the
husbands died in the 1977-1979 interval; wealth of the households
is shown back to 1969 by that classification. In this tabulation,

however, only housing wealth and non-housing bequeathable wealth
are shown, that is, wealth that could be passed on to children.
Once again we see differential by mortality and wealth loss at the
husband's death. The wealth difference extends back to 1969, at
least eight years before the husband's death. We can see that the
wealth differential in the year or two before the husband's death
is due to a permanent differential, not one caused by sharp wealth
                                  Page 24

 declines that would be associated with high medical expenses in

 the three or four years just preceding the husbandts death.

      a. The column categories are defined by change in
      marital status between 1977 and 1979. The entries
      are in 1979 dollars.


     The middle and last panels give wealth changes according to
whether the household has children.8 We see that, if anything,
there was more wealth destruction in the households without




     8Because the sample averaged about 70 years old, very few of
the children would be living in the couple's household.
                                 Page 25

children than in those with children. This pattern is also found
in the other years. Thus it seems unlikely that the wealth
decline is due to the transfer of wealth to children. The
tabulation also shows that couples with children have
substantially less wealth than coupleswithout children. We
explore this issue further below, but note now that raising
children substantially decreases the retirement assets of
households.

        One anomaly of the data for this year is that there appears
in some years to be little differential mortality in families with
children. In comparisons for all other two-year periods
differential mortality is revealed. Indeed, the association
between early death and the accumulation of personal saving is
much more pronounced than the relationship for all wealth,

including government directed saving--Social Security--and saving
through firm pension plans. The data typically look like those
above for households without children.

D.      Prior Earnings. Wealth Accumulation, and Health
        The data on Social Security wealth suggest that continuing
couples had somewhat greater wage earnings over their lifetimes
than the prior couples of widows, 2 to 7 percent less depending on
the year for which the calculation is made. The following
tabulation shows prior Social security wealth, housing and other
bequeathable wealth, and total wealth of couples, by change in
marital status in the 1975-1977 interval. Those who became widows
during that period are distinguished by whether they were poor in
1977.

      marital status between 1977 and 1979. The dollar
      entries are in 1979 dollars.

Prior couples of widows had about 3 percent less Social Security
wealth in 1969 than continuing couples; they had about 8 percent
less in 1975. The 1969 prior Social Security wealth of poor
widows was about 21 percent less than that of non-poor widows;
1975 Social Security wealth was about 22 percent less.
                              Page 27

     Differences in wealth accumulation were much greater. If
Social Security wealth is taken as an index of earnings and other
wealth as an index of saving, households in which the husband died
saved much less than households in which the husband did not die.
And, households in which the death of the huband left a poor
widow saved very much less than those in which the widow was not
poor. Thus this admittedly crude indicator of saving suggests
that the early death of the husband was associated with
considerably less saving out of earnings and that poverty of
widows is partially explained by the failure to accumulate assets
while the husband was living.9

     Measures of health status indicate, in turn, that the lower
saving rate may be associated with poor health. We have
speculated about the role of the husband's health in the eventual
poverty of the widow. In the next tabulation we offer direct
evidence that poor widows tend to come from families in which the
husband had bad health. The tabulation records the average of a
subjective health indicator: the higher the value the higher the
respondent rates his own health. The health indicators are
presented for the same marital transition categories as in the
tabulation just above.




     9Th1s is not to say that ex-ante these households made
inappropriate saving decisions, or that they were based on
incorrect knowledge or predictions about the future; they may have
chosen to consume more earlier, running greater risk of limited
financial circumstances later in life. According to this view,
luck was against them when they became old.

      a. The column categories are defined by change in
      marital status between 1977 and 1979.

The last response in the couple to widow column is that of the
surviving spouse and is approximately equal to the response of
continuing couples, typically that of the husband. We see, for
example, that in 1969 the mean response of the husbands of
continuing couples was 63, whereas the mean response in that year
of the husbands of 1977 widows was 49. In later years the
difference becomes much greater: by 1975 the figures are 63 and
37 respectively. In addition, just as poor widows came from
families with lower levels of wealth than non-poor widows, they
also came from families in which the husband had worse health.
The difference between the poor and non-poor widows is not very

pronounced, however, whereas the comparable differences in wealth
were very large. Data not shown indicate that poor widows also
tend to rate their health worse than non-poor widows do.

    An obvious explanation for the change in bequeathable wealth
at the husband's death is medical expenses. We do not have
                              Page 29

complete medical expenditure data, but we do have information on
expenditures for doctor bills. The tabulation below shows that
they are small on average, and, that they generally are larger for
those surviving spouses who were not poor in 1979 than for those
who were poor. If doctor bills are a good indicator of total
medical expenditures, it does not appear that poor widows became
poor because of unusually high medical expenditures)0

E.   aport from Children
     Although intergenerational transfers is not the focus of this
paper we offer some evidence on how they might affect the poverty
status of the elderly. The RHS does not have information on
amounts transferred from children. As reported in Hurd and Shoven
(1985), the amount transferred from relatives is very small: $12
per year in 1979; $23 per year for single females most of whom
would be widows. For this project we collected data on the number
of children who gave transfers. We report by poverty status in
1979 the average number of living children and the average number




     10Data were not collected in 1975.

       a. The entries are number of children.

Again we see that the poor elderly have more children than the
non-poor. Only a small fraction of the elderly receive any
support at all from their children, but the poor elderly are more
likely than the non—poor to receive support, no matter what their
marital status. Poor widows are more than twice as likely as poor
married couples to receive support. Although transfers may
alleviate poverty somewhat, apparently the levels of support from
children don't go far in alleviating the poverty of widows.


IV. Summary and Conclusions
     We verified that widows are much more likely than couples to
be poor and that they make up a large proportion of the poor
elderly; 80 percent are widows or other single individuals. We
also verified that widows have substantially less wealth than

couples; thus, the high frequency of poverty among widows when
                              Page 31

poverty is defined by income is also found when poverty is defined
by wealth. There is an enormous amount of movement in and out of
poverty when it is defined by income, however. The wealth
definition provides a much better measure of permanent poverty;
defined by wealth, there isjnuch less movement from poor to non-
poor poverty status. Were one to include sources of income such
as the value of housing services, the general conclusions about
the incidence of poverty would be unchanged, although the
proportions classified as poor would be somewhat lower. Our rough
valuation of Medicare-Medicaid transfers, however, reduced very
substantially the fraction in poverty. It is clear that what is
counted as income, together with assumptions about the cost of
living for a single person versus a couple, can have an important
effect on the proportion of the elderly classified as poor.
     The death of the husband very often induces the poverty of
the surviving spouse, even though the married couple was not poor.
A large proportion of the wealth of the couple is lost when the
husband dies. Poor widows had much less wealth when married than
non-poor widows had and the loss in wealth at the death of the
husband was greater for poor than for non-poor husbands. The
prior private pension wealth of poor widows was almost totally
lost when the husband died. The prior households of poor widows
had accumulated very little housing (or other bequeathable)
wealth. Thus the potential for widows to increase current
consumption through reverse annuity mortgages, for example, is
very limited. The value of life insurance was typically very
                              Page 32

small and, among subsequently poor widows, rarely enough to offset
the loss in wealth when the husband died.

      In addition, families of husbands who died during the period
of the survey had accumulated less wealth than those who lived
until the end of the survey; those in which the widow was poor had
accumulated even less. The earnings of husbands who died were
less, judging by Social Security wealth, than the earnings of
those who lived throughout the survey; those who left poor widows
earned the least. The crude evidence that we were able to use
suggests also that the prior households of poor widows saved much
less than the households of widows who were not poor. There is
some evidence that the lower earnings of those who died, and
especially those who left poor widows, may have been associated
with poor health. Indeed, the prior households of poor widows may
have saved less than the prior households of non—poor widows
because of poor health as well. Poor health may have caused low
earnings and low saving early in life, and then an early death
later in life. In short: the prior households of poor widows
earned and saved less, more of the smaller accumulated wealth was
lost at the death of the husband, the absence of survivorship
benefits or life insurance insured that the loss in wealth would
leave the widow poor thereafter.

      Several important issues have been addressed only
tangentially in this paper,but should be addressed in future
research. As emphasized above, there is a need to develop a more
robust measure of poverty that includes income transfers like
                              Page 33


medical insurance that were intended to help the elderly. The
valuation method could produce wide swings in the fraction of the
elderly that is thought to be poor.
     The data that we reported suggests that saving differentials
may have played an important role in the poverty of widows. The
RHS data can be used to obtain accurate measures of lifetime
earnings for each individual in the sample and these earnings can
then be compared to individual lifetime wealth accumulation. This
would yield a measure of saving out of saving for each individual.
The rate of saving can in turn be related to the likelihood that
the death of the husband will leave a poor widow. The extent to
which differential saving is do to differences in individual
attributes such as health status and number of children should
also be established.

     Indeed more formal analysis of change in wealth with change
in marital status should in future research be based on the
aggregation of individual changes over time, rather than the
comparison of medians of wealth and other measures by marital
status. This work should be pursued in such a way that the effect
of different definitions of poverty on the apparent wellbeing of
the elderly can be formally analyzed.
     Having estimated the loss in wealth when the husband dies we
are also now in a position to consider the amount and cost of
survivorship insurance that would be necessary to prevent poverty
among widows. We can also determine the effect on the income of
widows of the recent legislation on survivorship arrangements,
                              Page 34


that will be incorporated in firm pension plans in the future.
This may have changed the importance of and need for other forms
of life insurance.
     Many original widows are in poverty i)i the earliest year of
the RHS, and they remain in poverty over the ten years of the
survey. Their Social Security benefits, which typically will be
based on their deceased husbands' earnings, are lower than
average. This is at least a partial explanation for original
widows' poverty. For this group in particular, life insurance
could have had an important effect on the financial fortunes of
the widows. Yet we have little information on the life insurance
coverage of their husbands. Future research can explore this
issue by studying more carefully the life insurance coverage of
the husbands who are still working in the RHS. In fact the RHS
has a special section in several of the survey years in which
surviving spouse widows were asked specific questions on the
estate left by the husband. In this way, one could learn more
about the wealth value of life insurance and its potential effect
on the poverty status of widows.
     A final topic that we need to pursue further is the change in
poverty levels as the RHS population ages. To the extent that
widows maintain their financial position by drawing down
bequeathable wealth, the prospect is for greater poverty in the
future. We cannot explore this issue simply: what is needed is a
utility-based model that will explain how consumption and wealth
holdings vary with age. Such a model could be used to forecast
                             Page 35

future poverty levels. Initial work on this topic is represented
by the companion paper to this one.11
