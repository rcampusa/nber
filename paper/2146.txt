                  Supply Shocks in Macroeconomics




                               ABSTRACT



Supply shocks played an important role in macroeconomic fluctuations during
the 1970's. Supply shocks are also increasingly important in Keynesian and
neo-classical models of the business cycle. This paper is a short survey of
these theoretical models. It also discusses the history of supply shocks in
recent business cycles.

     The decade of the 1970's saw a resurgence of interest in the influence

of the supply side on macroeconomic phenomena. The new attention paid to

the supply side was driven by two major factors. First, the world economy

faced a series of major supply-side shocks. These shocks lead to a

breakdown of major relationships embodied in macroeconomic models. Second,

the new classical macroeconomics brought about a reconsideration of the

Keynesian emphasis on the demand side. The breakdown of the relationships

in the Keynesian models would have been predicted by the new classical

economists. These relationships were often based on historical correlations

that could shift when the nature of the underlying shocks facing the economy

changed. Keynes emphasized the role of effective demand in business cycle

fluctuations. Following Keynes, much macroeconomic analysis neglected the

role of the supply side. In periods when shocks to supply are minimal doing

so will provide an adequate, if incomplete, understanding of economic

fluctuations. The emphasis on effective demand proved inadequate for

forecasting, analysis, and policy prescription in the face of supply shocks

of the 1970's.



Output. the Price Level, and Aggregate Supply

     If prices and wages are less than fully flexible, changes in the cost

of production will have important effects on both the aggregate price level

and aggregate output. Shocks to the cost of production yield very different

business cycle correlations of prices and output than do the shocks to

effective demand. It is convenient to study these movements in terms of the
                                   -2-


aggregate supply and aggregate demand schedules in price-output space. The

aggregate demand curve traces out the negative relation between aggregate

demand and output which holds as long as the interest elasticity of demand

for goods and for real balances are both negative. The aggregate demand

curve defines the set of equilibria in the goods market and asset market for

a fixed price level. Along the aggregate demand curve, output increases as

price decreases because real balances increase. An aggregate demand curve

(DD) is drawn in the Figure. Stimulative shocks to demand such as a tax cut

or a monetary expansion will raise aggregate demand given price. To close

the model, the price level is determined by the intersection of aggregate

supply and aggregate demand. The aggregate supply curve is determined by

the productive capacity of the economy and the market forces determining

factor cost. In the strict, neo-classical case, aggregate supply will be

fixed for all levels of the general price level. More generally, if

frictions in markets for factors of production, especially the labor market,

prevent instantaneous adjustment of prices to shocks, then there will be a

positive relation between the general price level and aggregate supply.

That is, if firms see their prices increasing due to an aggregate demand

shock, but do not expect or perceive that their costs may (eventually)

increase proportionally, they will supply more output, In the long run,

these changes in cost will be fully realized, so there is no long run

positive relationship between the aggregate price level and supply. An

aggregate supply curve (SS) is drawn in the Figure. The point A, the

intersection of the aggregate supply and demand schedules indicates

equilibrium output. The long run aggregate supply curve is defined by FF.
                                    -3-


In the long run the level of output is invariant to the general price level.

The point A is a long run as well as a short run equilibrium.

     The positive slope of the aggregate supply curve can be rationalized by

a variety of models. If firms set their prices as constant mark ups over

their costs and if these costs- -especially labor costs- -react slowly to

changes in demand there will be a positive relation between the aggregate

price level and output. [See Dornbusch and Fischer (1984) for a Keynesian

treatment of aggregate supply.] The derivation of the positive aggregate

supply relation between price and quantity does not depend, however, on

Keynesian price stickiness. If firms have imperfect knowledge of the prices

facing other agents in the economy, they will not know exactly the relative

prices of their outputs and inputs. If, as the general price level

increases, the firm first perceives the increase in the price of its output,

it will increase output, at least temporarily, when the general price level

increases. [See Lucas (1981).] It is difficult to distinguish in the data

these two sources of the positive slope of the aggregate supply schedule.

Misperceptions of the general price level should be short-lived, but costs

of adjustment and other rigidities could make the consequences of a

transitory misperception be long-lived.

     The observed correlations of aggregate output and the aggregate price

level will depend on the shape of the aggregate supply and demand curves and

on the nature and magnitude of the shocks shifting them. Different types of

shocks will be more or less important at different times, so the output-

price correlation will change accordingly. Supply shocks will shift the

aggregate supply curve. Specifically, an adverse supply shock will lower
                                   -4-


aggregate supply given the aggregate price level. Exaniples of adverse

shocks include declines in productivity and increases in crude materials

prices. In order to accommodate such shocks at full employment, the real

wage must fall. If nominal wages are sticky, some of this decline will be

accomplished through an increase in the general price level. As costs

increase due to increases in crude materials prices or declines in

productivity, firms raise prices for a given level of output.

     Consider the correlation of aggregate output and prices when the

economy is subject to both aggregate supply and demand shocks. If the

Keynesian view that demand factors are the major determinants of output

fluctuations at business cycle frequencies is correct, then one would expect

to see a positive correlation of price and quantity in the aggregate data.

Business cycles would be fluctuations of demand which would trace out a

relatively stable aggregate supply relationship. This positive correlation

of price and output is related to, but not identical to the positive

correlation of inflation and output (or negative correlation of inflation

and unemployment) known as the Phillips curve. With lags of adjustment and

data alignment it is difficult, however, to distinguish the relationship in

levels and differences. No attempt is made here to sort out these lags.

     Suppose, on the other hand, that fluctuations in aggregate supply are

relatively more important over the business cycle. That is, that

fluctuations in the cost of production trace out a relatively stable

aggregate demand relationship. An adverse aggregate supply shock will shift

the aggregate supply schedule upward from SS to S'S'. At any level of real

economic activity, the price level is higher. The observed correlation
                                    -5-


between price and output caused by supply shocks will be negative in the

aggregate data. Examination of this correlation, if done in the context of

a structurally invariant model, can provide evidence as to the nature of the

shocks.



Supply Shocks and Stagflation

     The 1970's saw a distinct shift in the output-price correlation. In

the 1960's, the correlation was strongly negative. In the 1970's, the

correlation became positive. Hence, although in the 1960's, there appeared

to be a trade-off between prices and output, the 1970's witnessed the

combination of stagnant real economies and increasing prices that became

known as stagflation.   [See Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (1978), Blinder

(1979), and Bruno and Sachs (1985) for extensive discussion of these events

and their ramifications for economic theory.] During the 1970's, there were

a series of supply shocks that can explain the changing correlation of

output and prices and that caused substantial output loss as world economies

adjusted to the shocks. In the early seventies, there were a series of bad

harvests that raised agricultural prices. These occurred after a policy in

the U.S. of depleting grain reserves. The low stockpiles exacerbated the

price increases. The price of oil rose dramatically during the 1973/74

Organization of Petroleum Exporting Organization's (OPEC) embargo and again

in 1979/80 following the fall of the Shah of Iran. Each of these shocks

have the effect of increasing goods price relative to wages and hence

require an increase in the general price level unless nominal wages fall.

Consequently, the aggregate supply curve shifts upwards. The direct effect
                                      -6-


of the energy and food price increases is illustrated in the Table. The

first column gives the annual inflation rate of consumer prices in the U.S.

The next two columns give the inflation rates for energy and food. These

rose dramatically in 1973. Energy prices again began to rise dramatically

in 1979. The last column gives the inflation for all items excluding food

and energy. The direct impact of increases in food and energy prices

accounted for almost all the acceleration in inflation in 1973 and a high

fraction of it in the later episode.

     The decade of the seventies also witnessed the a dramatic slowdown in

the rate of productivity growth in industrialized nations.     Measured by per

capita real gross national product, productivity in the U.S. grew at 2.8

percent per year from 1964 to 1973. In the European Organization for

Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries it grew 3.7 percent

over the same period. From 1973 to 1981, these rates fell to 1.3 percent in

the U.S. and 1.5 percent in Europe.    [See Organization for Economic

Cooperation and Development, Historical Statistics, 1952-1982 (Paris, 1984),

p. 86, for these statistics.] A decline in productivity growth directly

reduces the rate of output growth. It also has an indirect effect through

the aggregate supply-aggregate demand mechanism. Lower productivity means

higher costs of production for firms. This shifts the aggregate supply

schedule up. Consequently, output falls, at least in the short run, by more

than the amount due directly to the productivity shock.

     This list of supply shocks--those due to OPEC, poor harvests, and slow

productivity growth- - is clearly motivated by the experience of recent

history. It is by no means definitive. Shocks could include exogenous
                                   -7-


changes in any commodity price, natural disasters such as earthquakes,

floods, and draughts, and man-made disasters such as wars or nuclear

accidents. Of course, the shocks need not be adverse. Specifically,

technological improvement has been the key to economic growth in the West

since the Renaissance.

     To see how a supply shock propagates in an economy with less than

perfectly flexible prices, consider in detail the effect of an increase in

the price of imported oil. Firms will immediately attempt to raise prices

to pass through the higher cost of oil used as an input. As long as non-

commodity prices are less than perfectly flexible in the short run, the

increase in the price of oil will increase the aggregate price level. If

the oil price increase took place instantaneously and the cost increase were

reflected in final goods prices instantaneously, the price level would rise

once and for all. Because of lags in adjustment and reporting, prices will

rise only slowly. The slow adjustment of the price level will appear in the

data, and perhaps be perceived by households, firms, and policy makers, as

an increase in the inflation rate. In terms of the Figure, the aggregate

supply curve has shifted up. Holding government policy constant, output

will be lower as the economy moves up the aggregate demand curve. The

increase in the price level reduces real balances and hence raises the real

interest rate and lowers aggregate demand. The change in relative prices

could also have income effects that would shift the aggregate demand curve.

These are neglected in this discussion. For the economy to return to the

long run, full employment equilibrium, real wages must fall. Workers must

be less well off because of the increased payments for imported oil. Note
                                   -8-


 that this real wage cut must be taken in the face of reduced purchasing

power for consumer goods that require a large amount of energy to produce or

to maintain. Consequently, there is the danger that a wage-price spiral

will ensue.

     Absent government policy intervention, a protracted period of less than

full employment may follow the supply shock during which real wages are

reduced. The supply shocks may be attenuated by government policy

intervention. Wage-price controls or incomes policies could be used to

combat the inflationary pressure from the cost increase. These are likely

to be counter-productive, however, because the relative prices of goods and

factors of production must adjust after a supply shock. Since the relative

price of some goods must rise, price controls are likely to cause shortages.

The supply shock can be accommodated by fiscal and monetary policy. Recall

that a protracted recession may be necessary to reduce real wages following

the supply shock. Expansionary policy can ameliorate this fall in output at

the cost of even higher prices. While any expansionary policy will raise

demand, cutting excise taxes would have the compound benefit of producing a

favorable supply shock by lowering costs of production. The extra inflation

from expansionary policy may be a relatively painless way of accomplishing

the reduction in real wages necessary to achieve long run equilibrium. On

the other hand, contractionary policy to combat the incipient inflation from

the supply shock will be particularly costly because it will add to the

recessionary pressures from the supply shock itself.

     It is instructive to consider briefly actual policy experience in light

of the supply shocks of the 1970's. In the U.S., the Nixon price freeze and
                                    -9-


 controls and the Carter guidelines were ineffective in containing price

 increases. Moreover, price controls on gasoline created long lines in both

 1972 and 1979. Monetary policy became contractionary following the oil

 price increases of 1973-4 rather than accommodative and produced what was

 then the largest recession since the Great Depression. [See Blinder (1979)

 and Solow (1980) on the neo-Keynesian model of supply shocks, the shocks of

 the 1970's, and the policy experience in the United States.]

      In Europe, unlike the United States, there was virtually no recovery

between the first and second oil price shocks. Consequently, unemployment

was high in Europe throughout the 1970's. In the U.S., there have been

recoveries punctuated by increases in oil prices. In Europe, real wages

appear to be more rigid than in the United States. Centralized,

synchronized wage negotiations allow unions to take into account the effect

of the wage bargains on the price level. Hence, achieving real wage cuts is

difficult. Moreover, unions appear to have preferred to reduce employment

rather than the wages of employed workers. Consequently, the adjustment to

accommodate the higher oil price was costly in terms of forgone employment

and output. (See Bruno and Sachs (1985)).




Supply Shocks without Price Stickiness

     Simultaneously with the collapse of the Phillips curve correlation

between price and output there was an attack on the theoretical

underpinnings of the neo-Keynesian model. In particular, the belief that
                                     - 10   -




 there   was an exploitable trade off between output and inflation was called

 into question. The theoretical revolution, called rational expectations or

 the new classical macroeconomics, denied the role of Keynesian effective

demand by reintroducing price flexibility into macroeconomics. The

Keynesian macroeconomics models were criticized for treating reduced form

correlations such as the negative correlation between output and inflation

as structurally invariant. Specifically, the models were criticized for the

fact that the correlations embodied in them would change when economic

policy was exercised. [See Lucas and Sargent in Federal Reserve Bank of

Boston (1978) and Lucas (1981)].

     This critique can be broadened to encompass the case where the changes

in the reduced form correlations do not arise from attempts by policy makers

to exploit them but rather from changes in the nature of the shocks facing

the economy. As discussed above, such a change occurred in the decade of

the 1970's when supply shocks were more important than they had been in the

past. The development of new classical macroeconomics was certainly driven

by theoretical considerations, but its wide acceptance was probably abetted

by its explanation of the collapse of the neo-Keynesian models of the

1960's.

     Supply shocks can have an important role in economies not characterized

by price stickiness. Indeed, since the new classical economics discarded

effective demand as a source of fluctuations in output, it is natural that

the supply side features prominently in its analyses of business cycles. In

most textbook treatments of macroeconomic fluctuations, the business cycle

is treated as a cyclical deviation of output from a path determined by
                                     - 11   -




 factors   relating to long term growth. These factors- -growth in population

 and labor supply, technological progress, and increases in the capital-labor

 ratio- -are assumed to evolve independently of fluctuations at business cycle

 frequencies. Hence, whether they are deterministic or random, macroeconomic

phenomena could be analyzed by abstracting from long run growth in the

economy. This dichotomy is especially appealing given the view of business

cycle fluctuations as demand driven deviations from supply determined trend.

      Emphasis on supply factors, especially productivity shocks, in business

cycles vitiates the dichotomy. If factors affecting long term growth are

also important at business cycle frequencies then, in both theoretical and

empirical studies, business cycle fluctuations cannot be divorced from long

term growth. Moveover, statistical tests suggest that it is difficult to

reject the hypothesis that current shocks to aggregate output have a

permanent component. (In the language of statistical time series analysis,

it is difficult to reject the hypothesis that output has a unit root.) The

persistence of output shocks does not guarantee, however, that productivity

shocks are important in the short run. Demand shocks, especially in an

imperfectly competitive economy, may be very persistent.

     Consider the macroeconomic effects of a shock to productivity. The

effects will depend on whether the shock is temporary (from the weather, for

example) or permanent (a technological innovation, for example). A

temporary shock will affect output directly, but should not affect the

technology or level of factor input in the long run. A permanent shock will

affect output in the short run, but the entire response of output should not

take place immediately. Because capital is costly to adjust and investment
                                    - 12   -




entails   delivery lags, the response of the capital stock to a productivity

shock will take time. Hence, output may appear to be leading investment

despite the fact that they are each responding to the same, underlying

productivity shock.

     If productivity shocks are an important determinate of output at

business cycle frequencies, two long-standing empirical puzzles are

resolved. Real wages are acyclical or slightly pro-cyclical. Both

Keynesian sticky wage theory and neo-classical marginal product theory

suggest that real wages should vary counter-cyclically. If productivity

shocks are important at business cycle frequencies, wages will be pro-

cyclical. Productivity shocks can also account for the short run increasing

returns to labor. The estimated short run elasticity of output with respect

to labor equals or exceeds one, which is inconsistent with a neo-classical,

constant returns to scale production function. Such a correlation would be

expected, however, if productivity shocks were jointly moving output and

labor demand. Short run Increasing returns to labor is, however, also

consistent with labor hoarding in response to a demand shock.

     There are difficulties, however, with attributing too much of the

business cycle variance in output to productivity shocks. It seems unlikely

that technology moves enough on a quarter to quarter basis to account for

all of the variability of observed output. Because it is unlikely that

technological regress can be an importance source of fluctuations in modern

economies, that output falls in recessions might be taken as evidence that

demand as well as supply factors account for fluctuations. Hence, to

attribute a high fraction of output variance at the business-cycle
                                      - 13   -




frequencies    to technological shocks, it is necessary to postulate frictions

or costs of adjustments of either Keynesian or classical character that

magnify the effects of the shocks. Examples of such frictions include the

cost to workers of changing jobs or locations in response to technological

change and the difficulty of adapting old capital to new techniques.



Fiscal and Monetary Policy and the Supply Side

     Although fiscal and monetary policy are usually thought to work

primarily through aggregate demand, they have important supply side effects.

Certain supply shocks can be said to be induced by policy decisions. Tax

rules that reduce the cost of capital by investment tax credits and

accelerated deductions for depreciation expenses have been an important

supply side component of fiscal policy in the United States since 1962.

(See the Economic Report of the President (1962) for a discussion of these

investment incentives in particular and for an early treatment of the

supply-side effects of macroeconomic, demand-management policies.) Tight

fiscal policy will encourage investment (for a given level of aggregate

demand) by increasing the supply of saving and hence reducing interest

rates.

         Monetary policy can also have important consequences for the supply

side. Monetary tightening will increase the required rate of return for

holding commodities or the domestic currency. As the interest rate

increases, the opportunity cost of holding these assets increases. Hence, a

monetary contraction will reduce commodity prices and appreciate the

currency. Such relative price changes work just as uncontrollable supply
                                  - 14   -




shocks by changing the cost of production and hence shifting the aggregate

supply schedule. This supply-side channel for monetary policy thus creates

a supply shock that amplifies the demand-side deflationary pressure of a

monetary contraction.
