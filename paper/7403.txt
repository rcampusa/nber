                                           ABSTRACT

     We present a model of the effects of legal protection of minority shareholders and of cash
flow ownership by a controlling shareholder on the valuation of firms. We then test this model
using a sample of 371 large firms from 27 wealthy economies. Consistent with the model, we find
evidence of higher valuation of firms in countries with better protection of minority shareholders,
and weaker evidence of the benefits of higher cash flow ownership by controlling shareholders for
corporate valuation.
