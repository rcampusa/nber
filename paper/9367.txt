                                          ABSTRACT



Japan's deteriorating fiscal situation has attracted international attention. I assess what current
Japanese government policies mean for the future of public debt and the economy in general, given
the inevitable aging of the population. I review how Japan got into this current fiscal mess, and then

perform an analysis of some debt dynamics. With unchanged fiscal policies, Japan's public debt will
rise to between 260% and 380% of GDP in 2030, and to between 700% and 1300% in 2040 --

clearly unsustainable levels. For the debt to be sustainable, significant increases in taxes, or cuts in
government spending are necessary.

          Japan’s deteriorating fiscal situation has attracted world-wide attention.
If the situation does not improve, the resulting huge public debt is expected to
sharply    increase   Japanese   interest   rates,   lower   Japan’s     international
creditworthiness, and adversely affect the welfare of future generations. In this
chapter I assess what current Japanese government fiscal policies mean for the future
of public debt and the economy in general, given the inevitable aging of the
population.
          Owing to a very weak domestic economy, which lowered tax revenues and raised
government spending, Japan’s fiscal balance has deteriorated dramatically. The
budget, in surplus until 1992, turned negative in 1993 and the deficits have continued
to worsen, reaching almost 11% of GDP in 1998.        Debt ballooned: the government
debt-to-GDP ratio increased by almost half from 1991 to 1997 and by another quarter
in the two years after that. By 2000, Japan had the largest ratio among OECD countries.
          Japan's fiscal situation continues to look grim, especially given the
demographic situation. Population aging is expected to slow economic growth and raise
future government health care and social security expenditures. Projections of the
country’s population and the percentage of the total population that is elderly
(Ministry of Health and Welfare 1998) are plotted in Figure 1.
          The population over 65 has grown rapidly, and now stands at about 15%. By
2020, its percentage is expected to approach 25%, and by 2050, 33%. These rates of
aging are much higher than, for example, in the United States, where only about 15%
of the population will be over 65 by 2025.
          This chapter first reviews how Japan got into its current fiscal mess during
the 1990s. This is followed by an analysis of debt dynamics. With unchanged fiscal
policies, Japan’s public debt will rise to between 260% and 380% of GDP in 2020,
and to between 700% and 1300% in 2040 - clearly unsustainable levels. For the debt
to be sustainable, significant increases in taxes, or cuts in government spending
are necessary.
          Next, the government’s fiscal agendas are briefly discussed. The focus has
been on spending cuts rather than tax increases. However, most of the proposed cuts
were postponed or abandoned as the government sought to stimulate demand in light
of the very weak domestic economy. The results of a simulation exercise that explicitly
incorporates the effects of an aging Japanese population are then presented. In the
simulation, I explicitly model the interplay between government fiscal policies and
household and corporate behaviors. This is important, because fiscal policies clearly
can affect private behavior, and these changes in private behavior may, in turn,
influence the dynamics of government debt. The simulation shows that, absent cuts
in government spending, for the government debt to be sustainable, taxes would need
to increase from the current 28% of GDP to over 40% by 2020. The tax increases and
the inevitable aging of the population are projected to sharply reduce household
saving rates. As the labor force declines, and the need to equip workers with capital
decreases, corporate investment rates also are projected to fall.




1    The Current Japanese Fiscal Situation


Government saving declined and public investment rose in the 1990s (Table 1). These
trends were caused by the recession, as well as by structural changes. The recession
and the decline in the rate of economic growth lowered tax revenues.                Structural
changes that worsened government saving included tax reforms that lowered tax
elasticities and thus tax revenues; and the aging of the population, which raised
social security and health care expenditures. In the 1990s the government also boosted
public investment in an attempt to stimulate aggregate demand. These changes in
government saving and public investment led to a sharp deterioration in government
finances.      The resulting increase in outstanding bonds has raised concerns about
fiscal sustainability and calls for fiscal reform.


1.1 Government Saving
Government saving can be divided into its “full-employment” and “cyclical”
components. In a recessionary environment government spending usually increases
because of higher unemployment and social welfare benefits. However, owing to the
low cyclical variability of Japanese unemployment and social welfare benefits,
government spending increases in Japan during the 1990s recession were capped. Also
during recessions, tax revenues can decline because of lowered incomes. I estimate
that during 1990-99, Japan’s “full-employment” government saving was about 2.6%
of GDP, compared to an actual level of 2.0%, making the “cyclical” component -0.6%.
Thus, much of the decline in government saving in the late 1990s was from structural
factors, such as tax reductions, rather than from “automatic stabilizers.”1


1
    I estimate “full-employment” government saving by regressing government saving on the output
gap and a constant, using quarterly data from 1990 to 1999. I interpret the estimated value of
the constant - which is the government saving rate when the output gap is equal to zero - as
“full-employment” government saving.      The estimated value of the constant equaled 2.6%.
         Government saving also can be broken down into the social security surplus,
the surplus in other categories, and health care expenditures (Table 2). The social
security surplus (benefits minus contributions) fell from about 1.3% of GDP in the
early 1990s to about 0.4% in 1999 because of the recession (lowering contributions)
and increase in the number of elderly (raising benefits).               Government health care
expenditures rose from about 3.6% of GDP in the early 1990s to about 4.3% in 1999,
mainly owing to the increase in the elderly, who use most of the hospital services.
However, the health care expenditure-to-GDP ratio in Japan is still smaller than in
the United States (6.6%) and Germany (7.7%). The remaining category of government
saving includes such items as education, defense, and policing and firefighting.
Saving in this category declined sharply from 9.5% of GDP to 3.9% because of the fall
in income and consumption tax revenues.


1.2 Public Investment
During the 1990s the Japanese government passed 10 stimulus packages in an attempt
to jump-start the stalled economy. The most important component of these packages
was public works, which are included in public investment. However, the actual
increases in the late 1990s were rather moderate compared to the prominent and headline
grabbing role of public works in the stimulus packages.
         There are two reasons actual public works fell short of announced levels.
First, the central government assigned roughly two-thirds of the increased public
works spending to local governments without providing a commensurate increase in
funding. The capacity of local governments to expand public investment was affected
by their poor financial situation, and the continued rise in public investment has
increasingly been financed through local bond issues. The amount of outstanding local
government bonds increased from 12% of GDP in 1990 to 22% in 1997.                     Many local
governments surpassed the legally allowed threshold of bonds outstanding and were
put under bond issuance restrictions by the central government. Second, some of the
public investment funds provided by the stimulus packages remained unused because
of poor project implementation. Ishii and Wada (1998) calculated that only 60% to


         Ihori, Nakazato, and Kawade (2002) also show that the “cyclical” component of government
saving was small. They find that much of the decline in government saving can be attributed to

the decline in “trend” output, rather than to the decline in “cyclical” output. The low cyclical
variability of government saving is corroborated in an IMF study showing that a one-percentage point
increase in the output gap translated into an increase of the cyclical deficit by about 0.33% of
GDP, which is about half of the deficit response in other OECD countries (Muhleisen, 2000).
70% of the packages’ public works had been translated into additional demand by the
during late 1990s.2


1.3 Government Debt and Liabilities
The late 1990s decline in government saving and rise in public investment led to a
surge in government debt, as shown in Table 2. The fiscal surplus declined almost
continuously in the 1990s until reaching about minus 11% in 1998. The 1999 improvement
has not carried over in the 2000s.           Correspondingly, the ratio of debt to GDP has
risen sharply. By international standards, Japan’s gross debt-to-GDP in 1999 was
the highest among the G-7 countries; Italy’s was 115% and the United States’ was
62%.
           The fiscal balance as a percentage of GDP is less than the difference between
the government saving ratio and the public investment ratio (Table 1, column 2 minus
column 4) by about two percentage points, mainly because of the inclusion of net
government land purchases in the fiscal balance. During the 1990s the government
bought significant amounts of land from the private sector to prop up land prices.
           Because of the partly funded nature of the Japanese pension system, as well
as the government’s major role in financial intermediation, the Japanese government
holds significant assets, keeping net debt-to-GDP at a moderate level and lower than
in other G-7 countries. However, the assets of the social security system are more
than offset by future pension obligations. Therefore, some, including the OECD and
the IMF, exclude social security net assets when assessing Japan’s debt situation.
As a result, Japan’s net debt excluding social security net assets, at 85%, is
significantly higher than the United States’ 60%, and Germany’s 53%.




2    Projecting the Debt Burden


Table 3 depicts the dynamics of the debt-to-GDP ratio under three scenarios about
tax, public investment, and spending policies and two assumptions regarding real
interest rates.
           In scenario 1, current policies continue; the debt dynamics are clearly
“unsustainable”: even under optimistic interest rate expectations, debt exceeds


2
    Tracking public works budgets in Japan is tricky because so much of the spending is outside the
regular budget of the central government. Thus, looking just at the "general expenditures" data
there actually were declines each year from fiscal 1994 to 1999.
250% of GDP by 2015. (I define “unsustainable” as meaning that the debt-GDP ratio
goes to infinity.) Scenario 2, like Scenario 1, assumes government spending and public
investment policies remain unchanged, but also assumes the government sufficiently
raises taxes so that the debt-to-GDP ratio stabilizes and eventually declines.
Stabilization with 3% interest rates comes around 2015-25, at 140%-150%, and with
6% interest is in the 2010s at just over 200%
        As described later, the government is undertaking fiscal reform, and is
planning deep cuts in spending and public investment. Scenario 3 assumes the reforms
are carried out. This leads to dramatically improved debt dynamics. Still, the
debt-to-GDP ratio continues to grow, albeit significantly more slowly than in Scenario
1, as taxes are not sufficient to cover the government’s total expenditures
(including the interest payments on the outstanding debt). Note that at 6% interest
the debt ratio increases steadily but at 3% it is fairly stable during 2005-35. This
is because at 6% interest, debt grows much faster than GDP.
        At 3% interest rates, spending cuts (Scenario 3) produces lower ratios than
increased taxes (Scenario 2) but, at 6% rates, by 2030 the ratio in Scenario 3 is
higher. The remainder of this section more fully explains the scenarios.


2.1 Assumptions
Because unfunded future social security liabilities are already accounted for in the
scenarios, the net figure of 45% is taken as the initial ratio of debt-to-GDP.
        The dynamics of the debt-to-GDP ratio are highly sensitive to assumptions
regarding the real interest rate and the real GDP growth rate. Other things being
equal, the higher the real interest rate, the higher the ratio; and, the higher the
real GDP growth rate, the lower the ratio.
        Consistent with most forecasters’ projections of real GDP growth for the
next 20 years of between 1% and 1.5% annually (Japan Center of Economic Research 2001),
the analysis here assume an average of 1.2% annually between 2000 and 2040.
        There are two real interest rate assumptions. The first is 3% because, since
the early 1980s, Japanese real interest rates have averaged about 3% and that rate
is used in other studies to project the path of future Japanese government deficits
(IMF 2000, Jinno and Kaneko 2000). However, in the future, the Japanese government
may no longer be able to borrow at such a low rate, and may have to borrow at higher
international real rates. Thus, the second assumption is 6%, which reflects the
average real cost of borrowing in international financial markets in the 1990s. Note
that since 2000, the nominal interest rate on five- to six- year maturity Japanese
Government Bonds (JGBs) has been close to 4%. Because inflation rates are essentially
zero, the real rate on Japanese government borrowing is now close to 4%.


2.2 The Scenarios
Scenario 1, the baseline, is that future government policies essentially remain
unchanged. With regards to tax and public investment policies, the assumption is that
the government keeps the tax-to-GDP and public investment-to-GDP ratios at current
(average, 1996-99) levels. With regards to government spending policies, projections
are more complicated, as population aging affects future government social security
and health care expenditures. It is assumed that the government keeps age-specific
expenditure patterns for social security, health care, and education constant at
current (average 1996-99) real levels. That is, if the average 67-year old receives
190,000 yen in government health care in 2000, the average 67-year old in 2035 will
receive the same inflation-adjusted amount.                In addition, it is assumed that
eligibility for social security remains 60, and for old age health care benefits,
remains 70. Other government spending, mainly defense, policing, and administration,
are assumed to always equal the average 1996-99 ratio to GDP of 5.6%.3
           Under these spending assumptions, Table 4 shows the projections of total
government spending in 1995 yen and as a share of projected GDP. The shift in the
age distribution towards the elderly significantly raises government spending. In
particular, in 2035 the population over 65 increases significantly, leading to a spike
in social security and health care spending. These spending projections (after
rounding) are used directly in Scenarios 1 and 2.
           In Scenario 3, in 2015 the age of eligibility for social security is raised
to 65, and for old-age health care benefits, to 75. Other spending is reduced by 10%
in 2005. These changes in social security and in old-age health care correspond roughly
to what are actually included in the fiscal reform agendas. Public investment is cut
especially sharply - to 3% of GDP by 2005 - the level prevailing in the United States
(Muhleisen, 2000).




3    The True Size of Government Liabilities




3
    For social security, I divided average social security expenditures in 1996-99 by the population
over age 60. For health care, I allocate average health care spending in 1996-99 to different ages,
using the age-specific expenditure patterns reported by in Ishi (2000). For education, I divide
average education spending in 1996-99 by the population aged 5-20.
Because of unfunded liabilities, the government’s true net obligations today may
be substantially higher than the reported 45% of GDP. In addition to unfunded social
security obligations, there are three main sources of unfunded liabilities. These
are potential losses on government assets, explicit government guarantees of private
sector lending, and implicitly guaranteed private sector loans.
        Potential losses on government assets are significant.       A portion of the
government’s assets represent soft loans that may not be repaid. Many large public
or joint public-private infrastructure projects financed from Fiscal Investment and
Loan Program (FILP) loans generate less revenue than budgeted, which may imply
significant contingent liabilities of the government. Doi and Hoshi (this volume)
show that many public corporations and local governments carrying out infrastructure
projects are essentially insolvent. They estimate the amount of potential government
bailout of the FILP and the local governments as over 15% of 2000 GDP.
        The second source of unfunded liabilities are explicit government guarantees
of private sector lending. Explicit guarantees are extended by the FILP and other
government entities to encourage lending by private financial institutions. Examples
are guarantees of bank deposits by the Deposit Insurance Corporation and of lending
by credit cooperatives to small- and medium- enterprises. Although these do not entail
fresh government lending, should the guaranteed loans not be repaid, the government
must   cover   them   from   its   budget.    The   total   amount   of   outstanding
government-guaranteed bonds and loans amounted to about 10% of GDP in 2000. Although
historically only about 1% of such loans are never repaid, the percentage could soar
if the Japanese economy worsens (Bayoumi 1998).
        In addition to explicit government guarantees, there are implicitly
guaranteed private sector loans. Historically, the Japanese government has shown a
willingness to make good the irrecoverable loans of private financial institutions.
In 2000 public funds spent recapitalizing the banking system and included in
government spending totaled about 8 yen trillion (2% of GDP).        This willingness
represents implicit guarantees, and these guarantees are (unfunded) contingent
liabilities of the government. Despite the large amount of public funds already spent,
Fukao (this volume) argues that the Japanese government may have to expend additional
funds to recapitalize the private banking system within the next two or three years.
In that case, the cost to taxpayers would be equal to the estimated losses on problem
loans minus the loan loss reserves of the banking sector. Fukao calculates that this
cost to taxpayers would be about 2% of GDP (7.6 trillion yen at March 2001).
4   Fiscal Reform Measures


To restrain future increases in the government’s debt and in other liabilities, the
government proposed several fiscal reform measures in the 1990s. However, most of
the measures were postponed or abandoned as the government sought to stimulate demand
in light of the very weak domestic economy. The 1997 Fiscal Structural Reform Law,
with its goal of eliminating fiscal deficits by 2003, is the most significant measure.
        The main instruments in the 1997 law were cuts in government consumption and
investment, rather than tax increases. Public investment spending was to be cut by
7% in 1998, with zero nominal growth until 2001; and energy, education, and overseas
development assistance were to be cut by 10% in 1998, with annual reductions until
2001 (Ishi 2000, p 149).      However, with the severe recession of 1997, fiscal
consolidation was put on hold, and a wide range of pump-priming measures were
introduced.   In particular, rather than declining, public investment for 1998 was
increased by over 10%.
        Areas where the 1997 law had an effect were health care and social security.
In 1997 the contribution rate and co-payments by patients for government health
insurance schemes were increased sharply (Ishi 2000). In particular, patients aged
70 and above are required to pay a fixed proportion (10%) of their medical costs.
The government also capped prescription drug prices, which are very high in Japan.
        In 2000, a social security reform bill based on the 1997 law passed the Diet.
The bill contains provisions to cut lifetime benefits by about 20%. Specifically,
benefits for new retirees will be cut by 5%; the age of eligibility will, from 2013,
be raised gradually from 60 to 65; and benefits will be subject to an earnings test.
Analysts have estimated that these reforms will reduce government unfunded social
security liabilities from the current 60% of GDP to 30% of GDP (IMF 2000).
        The government is planning to implement further cuts once the economy recovers
fully. A political commitment has been made to cap government deficit bond issues
at 30 trillion yen (6%) of GDP in 2002. Although “deficit” bonds reflect only a
portion of total government borrowing, this ceiling should help lower future fiscal
deficits.
        As stipulated in the 1997 law, public investment is due for further cuts.
Criticism has been directed at the economic value of public works projects, as well
as contracting procedures.    To address the efficiency issues, new cost-benefit
guidelines for reviewing projects were announced. Contracting procedures also have
been reformed. Public works projects in fiscal 2002 (ends March 2003) were scheduled
to be cut by 10%, although it unclear if the cuts will materialize. The government
intends to change the form of public works from traditional construction projects
to broader social infrastructure investment. This includes environment and
energy-related projects, telecommunications networks, scientific research, nursing
homes, and the like.
        With regards to health care, contribution rates and co-payments, especially
by the elderly, are to increase further. The stated goal is to restrict the growth
of medical costs of the elderly to no more than the rate of inflation. In this regard,
the Diet has just passed a law to increase the health care co-payment ratio from 20
percent to 30 percent. The age of eligibility for elderly medical care eventually
will also be raised from 70 to 75. Further cuts are also planned in social security.
There are even suggestions that average benefits be reduced by another 40% to avoid
large increases in future contribution rates (Sakurai 1998).




5   Interaction with Private Behavior


The calculations of Japanese government debt reported in Table 3 implicitly assume
that private behavior is unaffected by government fiscal policies.        However, in
reality, fiscal policies clearly influence private behavior, and changes in private
behavior may, in turn, affect the dynamics of government debt. For example, government
taxation can alter the path of household saving and corporate investment which, in
turn, can change tax collections. To better project the dynamics of government debt
under an aging population, the interplay between fiscal policy and household and
corporate behavior should be accounted for. To this end, I have constructed a
simulation model.


5.1 A Simulation Model
In Dekle (2002) I projected the path of the government budget, together with the path
of private saving and investment in Japan, using a formal dynamic economic growth
model. Admittedly, the assumptions underlying the model's projections are somewhat
special, but they are plausible and provide a fairly rigorous basis for analyzing
policy implications.
        Specifically, I closely followed Cutler, Poterba, Sheiner, and Summers (1990)
in examining the impact of changing demographics on government debt, private
investment, and saving.    I simulated the growth model using the future path of
demographics, summarized by the support ratio, which is the ratio of the labor force
to the total population. The support ratio is projected to fall by 20% in the next
50 years.4
           In the model, firms maximize profits using labor, private capital, and public
capital as inputs to produce output (GDP). Firms are blessed with technical progress
that raises the efficiency of labor by 1.2% a year. Private capital can be loaned
or borrowed at a constant international rental (real interest) rate of 6%.
           I show that if the support ratio is constant, output per capita grows at 1.2%
per year. A declining support ratio, however, implies output per capita growth of
less than 1.2%, as there are fewer workers to support the population.
           Households are assumed to maximize not only their own welfare, but also the
welfare of their children. Preferences are such that households desire to keep
consumption per capita growing at a constant rate (“consumption smoothing”). The
model shows that by borrowing from international capital markets, households can
indefinitely maintain growth in consumption per capita of 1.2%.                        Thus, although
consumption per capita grows at 1.2%, output per capita grows at less than 1.2% when
the support ratio is declining.                    Thus, a declining support ratio raises the ratio
of consumption to output, and lowers the private saving rate.
           In the model, the government performs three actions, always taking into
account the effect of these actions on private behavior. First, it supplies “goods
and services” to households in the form of social security benefits, health care,
and other services. Government expenditures of this form are assumed to be determined
by the age structure of the population, and the time path of these expenditures is
taken as given (from Table 4).
           Second, the government carries out public investment to supply public capital
to firms. The government is assumed to choose the time path of public capital optimally,
taking into account the offsetting effects of this public capital on GDP growth and
on the public debt burden.
           Third, the government levies a tax on households to pay for its spending and
public investment, and this tax imposes efficiency losses on households. Given these
efficiency losses, the model shows that the government will choose to levy a tax that
is not fluctuating and is growing at the same 1.2% annual rate as consumption (“tax

smoothing”). For the government to remain solvent, the present value of these taxes
must be at least as large as the current stock of public debt plus the present value
of all future government spending and public investment. That is, if government tax
revenues are insufficient to cover government spending today, then tax revenues must
exceed government spending in the future.




6   Projections of Government Debt


The path of government debt and of private saving and investment from 2000 to 2040
are presented in Table 5, using the results of the model. Under tax smoothing, taxes
per capita increase at a constant rate, while output per capita grows at a slower
rate; thus, the tax-to-GDP ratio rises over time. However, the actual tax rate in
the starting year (2000), 28% of GDP, is lower than the 33% necessitated by tax
smoothing and the requirement that the government be solvent.         To satisfy the
government’s solvency constraint, taxes per capita are allowed to increase more
rapidly between 2000 and 2015, and then increases in taxes per capita are smoothed
from 2015 onward. By 2040, tax rates need to increase to almost 50% of GDP for the
government to recoup its current outstanding debt, projected future spending (from
Table 4), and projected future public investment (Table 5).
        Government saving rates rise from about 1% to 2% of GDP in 2000 to about 10%
in 2020 owing to the increased tax receipts. Government saving rates decline somewhat
in 2035 because of increases in social security and health care spending caused by
the spike in the over-65 population in 2035. Because of falling public investment
and high government saving, the fiscal surplus (government saving minus public
investment) turns positive after 2020, and rises thereafter. Thus, the decline in
the government net debt-to-GDP ratio is fairly rapid between 2020 and 2040.
        Private saving rates are projected to fall a few percentage points until 2010,
and then fall rapidly from 2010 to 2040.    This pattern is a result of declines in
the support ratio and increases in tax rates, which reduces disposable income.
Although consumption per capita grows at a constant 1.2%, output per capita grows
at a slower rate (as the support ratio declines), thus lowering saving rates.      In
effect, consumers are seeking to smooth their consumption when income is growing very
slowly by lowering their saving rates.
        As the labor force shrinks, the need to equip workers with capital equipment
decreases, and both private and public investment rates decline. The private
investment rate declines from 20% today to about 16% in 2040; the public investment
rate declines from 8% today to about 6% in 2040.


6.1 Comparison with Earlier Projections
Only a few studies have examined the interplay between fiscal policy and private saving
and investment in Japan. As in my model, these earlier studies generally predict
worsening government budget deficits unless there is significant fiscal reform, and
declining saving and investment rates as the Japanese population ages. These studies
start from the premise that the future path of Japanese government debt is
unsustainable unless there is significant fiscal reform. Their reform scenarios are
shown in Table 6.
        The Economic Planning Agency (1998) study envisages significant cuts in
future social security benefits and moderate increases in payroll taxes. Consequently,
government saving rises, while private saving falls sharply, as a result of the
population aging. The International Monetary Fund (2000) study envisages reductions
in social security benefits, sharp cuts in public investment, and increases in payroll
and consumption taxes. Consequently, fiscal balances improve dramatically and the
debt-to-GDP ratio first stabilizes then plummets. A special feature of the IMF model
is that even when income declines, households do not decumulate their assets; thus,
the fall in private saving is moderated.     Finally, the Japan Center for Economic
Research (2001) envisages sharp increases in taxes and cuts in public investment.
Consequently, fiscal balance improves, although debt-to-GDP continues to increase
slightly owing to sluggish GDP growth.




7   Conclusion


The prospects for improvements in the Japanese fiscal situation are grim unless the
government carries out significant fiscal reform. For example, under unchanged
spending policies taxes would need to increase from the current 28% of GDP to over
40% by 2020 for the government to be solvent. Japanese citizens should brace themselves
for painful adjustments in the near future, in the form of lower public services and
higher taxes.
        A resumption of strong growth in real GDP would reduce the need for spending
and tax adjustments. For example, if real interest rates are 3%, a real GDP growth
rate of slightly in excess of 3% can imply falling debt-to-GDP ratios. The analysis
here has assumed that real growth averages just 1.2% per year from 2000 to 2040. This
assumes labor-augmenting technical progress of about 1.2% per year, or total factor
productivity growth (TFP) growth of 2.0% per year. TFP growth of 2.0% is actually
an assumption on the high side, as it is about equal to Japan’s average TFP growth
between 1970 and 1990, and Japan has not been as innovative it was then (Branstetter
and Nakamura, this volume). What lowers GDP growth from 2.0% to 1.2% is the dramatic
0.8% annual decline in the labor force caused by the aging of the population.
        Thus, one way to increase GDP growth is to raise the labor supply. Ono and
Rebick (this volume) argue for removals of structural impediments that restrict the
movement of labor between firms and discourage women from participating to a greater
extent. Another possibility that has received scant attention until now is to promote
immigration into Japan.    Of high priority are further studies on the impact of
increased foreign immigration on Japanese growth, saving, and the government debt.
        An aging population does not necessarily mean that Japan will sink into
international oblivion. Certainly, Japanese policymakers are aware, not only of the
problems associated with aging, but of a slew of proposals to address the problems,
both directly, and indirectly, through removing the other impediments to growth
discussed in this volume and elsewhere.
