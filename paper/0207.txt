                LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUDGETING: THE ECONOMETRIC

              COMPARISON OF POLITICAL AND BUREAUCRATIC MODELS

       The most basic characteristic of any government's budgetary process

is the way in which final decision—making responsibility is divided between

the political level and the bureaucratic level of government. At a suff 1—

ciently aggregate level of budgetary allocation, the politically responsible

agent decides the amount of expenditure in each broad category. In contrast,

at a more disaggregated level of the budgeting process, the political

authority decides only a total amount of expenditure and then delegates

responsibility for its allocation among subcategories to the bureaucracy.

The interesting econometric problem is to decide whether any given stage

in   the budget process is an example of the "political" or the "bureaucratic"
model. As far as we know, there has been no attempt to solve this type of
problem.
       The current paper presents a method of deciding this question and then

uses it to study local government spending on education. The basis for our

method is the important difference between the effect of intergovernmental

aid   that   is implied by the political budget model and by the bureaucratic

budget model. According to the bureaucratic model, the effect of inter—

governmental aid on each category of educational input (e.g., teachers'

salaries, books, etc.) depends only on the change in total educational

spending induced by the aid and not on the type of aid that causes the

change in spending. In contrast, the political budget model implies that

the overall expenditure increase is the result of separate decisions on

each of the expenditure categories and that the changes in these expendi-

ture categories will depend on the form of the intergovernmental aid. Our

method of exploiting this difference is presented in detail below.

       This difference in the way in which aid affects the allocation of

total educational spending gives potential policy significance to the

distinction between the political and bureaucratic models. State grants

to local school districts are already widely used to assure that all

districts, spend at least some specified minimum amountJ Courts in a

number of states have now ruled that further steps must be taken to reduce

the inequality among districts in educational spending or the correlation

between educational spending and local wealth.2 There is evidence that

     2The California case of Serrano v. Priest was the first in a series
of cases on this point. After the U.S. Supreme Court in Rodriguez v. San
Antonia held that educational spending inequality among income groups did
not violate the U.S. Constitution, a number of state courts have followed
California in interpreting the state constitutions to require a change
in educational finance.

matching grants can be a powerful stimulus to local spending and therefore

that differential matching grants that are inversely correlated with wealth

can be a relatively effective offset to local differences in wealth.'

       There is, however, no information about the pattern of extra spending

on the different categories of educational input that would be stimulated

by such matching grants. With a bureaucratic budget process, the additional

spending that results from matching grants would be spent in the same way

as any other increment to the school budget. This additional spending

would therefore satisfy the courts' mandate to offset the expenditure

effects of wealth differences. In contrast, with a political budget pro-

cess, the pattern of spending would depend on the price elasticities of

demand for each category of expenditure. The impact of a differential

matching     grant when the budget process is "political" might therefore be
to stimulate spending in a way that fails to offset the expenditure effects
of   wealth, differences. These implications will be explored in detail below.

       The   first section of this paper presents a formal statement of the
political and bureaucratic      budget models and discusses the likelihood ratio

test that we use to distinguish between them. Our data are described in

section 2 and     the   estimates presented in section 3. The evidence over-

whelming supports the political budgeting model. A brief concluding

section comments on the implications of these results.

matching grant on educational spending. For a more general review of the
impact of governmental grants, see the important recent papers by Gramlich
(1976) and Inman (1977).

1. Specification, Estimation and Test Procedure

        The difference between the political and bureaucratic budgeting models

is equivalent to the distinction between a one—stage and a two-stage

budget process. According to the political budget model, the level of

expenditure on each category of educational input is decided simultaneously.

The bureaucratic model begins instead with a political (or higher level

bureaucratic) determination of total educational spending; this total is

then divided among the individual expenditure categories in a second stage.

        Consider first the bureaucratic budgeting model. In specifying this

model, we assume only that the politically responsible authority selects

the total level of educational expenditure on the basis of prices, inter-

governmental aid and the economic and demographic attributes of the com-

munity. We shall not develop an explicit detivation of this demand function

in terms of utility maximization, median voter preferences, or any alterna-

tive theory of political choice.1 We write simply that


(1.1)                           T =   Y'a+u
where T is the total expenditure on education in the school district, Y'

is the row vector of exogenous variables that determine expenditure, and u

is a random normal disturbance.

        In the second stage o1 the process, the bureaucrats take this total

expenditure as their budget constraint and select expenditure levels for



     1lnman (1977) provides a valuable discussion of these alternative
foundations for local government expenditure equations.
                                            —5—




each educational input type subject to this constraint. The individual

expenditures are therefore a function of this total education budget and

of a subset of the variables that influenced the political authority's

choice of this total spending level. The restriction to a subset is

important. Intergovernmental aid variables and the value of local taxable

property should influence the political choice of the total level of

spending but will not have a direct effect on how the educational budget

is spent.

        To emphasize this we rewrite equation 1.1 with the exogenous variables

divided into the subset X that influences only total spending and the sub-

set Z that influences both total spending and the individual components:'


(1.2)                       T =       X+Z'y+u.
With this notation, the second stage bureaucratic expenditure equations

can be written

where       is the expenditure on educational inputs of type j.

        The political budgeting model implies that all of the individual

expenditures are decided simultaneously and therefore that all of the

exogenous variables are relevant for each expenditure decision. This

model can therefore be written:

(1.4)                       E
                             j

                                                              I



     1The specific variables in these two subsets will be discussed in the
next section.
                                         —6—



        It is clear that the bureaucratic model is formally equivalent to the

political model subject to additional constraints on the relation among the

.'s in the different equation corresponding to different expenditure cate-

gories. More explicitly, the bureaucratic model implies that the K variables

affect each E. only through T and therefore that the .                      vectors   must be

proportional to each other, i.e., must differ only by the proportionality

factor X. With this proportionality restriction, equations 1.2 and 1.3

imply that 1.4 is equivalent to:


(1.5)                  E. =   X.(X')   + Z'y. + u..


        A procedure developed by Goldberger(1974) and 1-lauser (1972) provides

a computationally efficient maximum likelihood method of estimating the

parameters of 1.5 and testing the restriction that the .                        vectors   are col—

linear.} We describe this canonical correlation procedure briefly, leaving

the interested reader to the original papers for the derivation of the

method as a maximum likelihood estimator. The procedure begins by "purging"

both the E. variables and the X variables of the effect of the variables
             3

(Z) whose coefficients are unconstrained. We write FL                           for the vector of
                                                                         3 .z

residuals of the regression of          on Z and Ez for the matrix of these and other

mixed cross—section and time—series structure of our data.

residuals.       Finally, let Q        = V, E, —      3, the covariance between the E;
variables and their predicted value X R. Goldberger and Ijauser show

that    the   characteristic vector associated with the largest characteristic

root of the matrix QS1 is the maximum likelihood estimator of the vector

S of 1.5. Thus we solve


(1.6)                                    (QS1 - pI)b           —     0


for the value of b associated with the largest value of v and have             found
the   maximum likelihood estimate of 5 in 1.5. The vector of X's in 1.5

is then given by


(1.7)                                    A =   p1RS1b

where u is the largest characteristic root.

        Before turning to the actual estimates, we describe the maximum likeli-

hood test of the restriction in 1.5. This test is based on the determinants

of the covariance matrices of the m's with and without the restriction.
                                               J

More explicitly, let a, be the covariance matrix of the residuals from the

unconstrained equations (1.4) and let XCi" be the corresponding matrix for

the constrained equations 1.5. The constraint implies that the determinant

of the latter matrix is at least as large as the determinant of the former.

The   usual asymptotic likelihood ratio test can be based on the fact that
minus twice the logarithm of the likelihood ratio is distributed as chi

square; i.e.,

                                                           2

where N is the number of observations used to estimate equations 1.4 and

1.5 and K is the number of parameter restrictions imposed in going from 1.4

to 1.5

        The covariance matrix of the uj's for equations 1.4 is obtained directly

by estimating these equations by ordinary least squares and then using the

residuals to compute the covariance matrix i'. For equation 1.5, the

maximum likelihood estimates of     and the Xjs are used to calculate the

2. Data and Specification

     We have estimated the equations of the political and bureaucratic

budget models with data for 105 Massachusetts school districts. This section

describes the data and discusses the specification of the expenditure equa-

tions.

     The school districts of Massachusetts are particularly suitable for

our analysis because of the prevailing system of intergovernmental grants.

More specifically, Massachusetts uses a system of differential matching grants

in which the matching rate is inversely related to local taxable property per

pupil. For the purpose of our analysis, we express the effect of the matching

rate in terms of the local district's implied price of educational spending:

P is the net cost to the local community per dollar of educational inputs

purchased. Although the basic principle of the Massachusetts aid formula

implies that the price variable is proportional to local taxable property

per pupil, a number of limits and "grandfather clauses" make the correlation

only 0. 42 in the most recent year in our sample. For those school districts

in which a constraint on the amount of aid makes the price equal to one (i.e.,

eliminates the matching aid), the state provides a block grant)

     A further advantage of analyzing the Massachusetts experience is that

the current system of intergovernmental aid was only introduced in 1967.

Before that, towns received so—called "foundation" block grants designed to

insure a mimimum lSel of expenditure and to relieve local taxpayers of the

cost of providing that level of spending. Pooling data for several years



     1The system of Massachusetts aid is described briefly in Feldstein
(1975) and more fully in Daniere (1969).
                                   —10—



to include both, the old foundation block grant period and the current

matching grant period provides a source of variation in the price variable

that is completely uncorrelated with interdistrict differences in taxable

property per pupil.

     Our sample consists of data for 105 school districts for seven fiscal

years: 1965, 1966, and 1970 through 1974. Piscal year 1974 was the most

recent year for what data could be obtained when our analysis began. The

three fiscal years in the middle of the sample decade are omitted because

disaggregated data on individual input categories is not available for

those years. The 105 school districts contain approximately 75 percent of

the state population; the remaining districts were generally small and were

excluded because data were not available for all the variables or, for a

few districts, because of their relation to a regional school system.

Because of the polilical structure of Massachusetts, the 105 school dis-

tricts in our sample are coterminous with individual cities or towns.1

     Previous studies of educational expenditure (e.g., Bahl and Saunders,

19.174; Peldstein, 1975 and 1977; Gramlich, 1976; Oates, 1974; Stern, 1973)

have identified a number of variables in addition to intergovernmental aid

that influence local expenditure on education. In describing these vari-

ables, it is useful to distinguish between the two classes of variables

that are relevant in the bureaucratic budget model: the X variables whose




     The data used in the present study are thus an extension of the sample
used in Feldstein (1975) which included the sane 105 towns for only two
fiscal years and no disaggregation of spending into individual input cate-
gories.
                                  —11—



relative coefficients are constrained to be the same in all expenditure

equations and the Z variables whose coefficients are completely .unconMrained.

When there is an ambiguity in this assignment, we err on the conservative

side by including the variable in the unconstrained Z category. This

reduces the likelihood of rejecting the constraint and thus favors the

bureaucratic model. Since, as we indicated in the introduction, our evi-

dence leads us to reject the bureaucratic model in favor of the political

model, this classification procedure strengthens our conclusion.

     The X group contains three variables that influence local expenditure

on education but which, once total educational spending was determined,

would not be expected to influence the bureaucracy's allocation of the

spending.1 These variables are (1) the price implied by the differential

matching grant, (2) the state block grant, and (3) the local taxable pro-

perty per pupil.2 Closely related to the third of these variables is the

fraction of the property value that is residential; a higher fraction of

residential property impoies that local voters will pay a higher fraction

of the tax revenue, rather than "exporting" it or seeing it capitalized in

industrial and commercial land values.3 We have included a measure of the



     1The actual specification of our expenditure equations is nonlinear;
the X variables therefore include not only these three variables but also
non—linear cross—product terms. We return to this below.

     2Taxable property per pupil is an estimated market value and not the
artificially low assessed value.

     3me issue is complex because such "exporting" is limited by the long—
run mobility of capital and because the tax on residential rental property
may also be capitalized. Unfortunately, there is no data on the fraction
of taxable residential property that is rented rather than owner—occupied.
                                         —12—



the residential share of the tax base among the Z variables rather than

the X variables in order to allow for the possibility that a different

composition of local property is associated with differences in the social

class composition of the population or other factors that might influence

the pattern of educational spending.

        The Z variables   are of   three types:   (1) measures of relevant economic

characteristics    of the student population; (2) features of the school dis-
trict   itself; and (3) financial variables that should affect the composition

of educational spending. The economic characteristics of the student popu-

lation include the average family income in the district, the average number

of children per family, the percentage of children in the elementary grades,

and the percentage of children attending private or parochial schools. Two

important characteristics of the school district are included: the total

population size of the school district and the recent growth—rate of the

number of pupils.

     A number of restricted block grants are provided to school districts

to pay for such things as transportation or services for low—income pupils.

A composite aggregate of such specific block grants is included among the

Z variables) As we noted above, the fraction of the local tax base

accounted for by residential property is also included among the Z vari-

ables. The final variable measures the cost of teaching staff relative to



     Lpeldstem (1977) discusses the expenditure impact of the federal grants
to local governments under the Title I program. Title I aid is not included
as a separate variable in the current study because the rates for distributing
such aid among local districts makes estimation impossible with data for a
single state.
                                       —13—



the cast of other educational inputs. This variable is constructed as

a weighted average of the consumer price index and of a statewide index

of teachers' salaries, reflecting the judgment that it is best to treat

intertown differences in teachers' salaries as indicating differences in

the quality chosen by the town.

        Total current expenditure1 is divided by Massachusetts educational

accounting practice into 14 mutually exclusive categories:      (1) teachers'

salaries; (2) textbooks; (3) library material and personnel; (4) audio-

visual material and personnel; (5) guidance services; (6) psychological

services; (7) educational television; (8) principals' offices; (9) super-

intendent's, office; (10) general administration; (11) community services;

(12) general non—instructional school services; (13) operation and    main-
tenance of the school plant; and (14) fixed charges assigned to the current

account. We define the corresponding F.. variables by converting each of

these expenditures to a per pupil amount and deflating to constant 1970

dollars.

        In our estimation we have generalized the linear specifications of

section 1 to allow the impact of the matching rate price variable to depend

on the level of incomes and of taxable property value in the school district.

Equation 1.4 thus becomes


(2.1)              =     +   2INC +           +        + S5JBG1 + Zj1 + U1



        1capital   expenditure is specifically excluded.
                                  —14-



where INC. is average family income in district i, V. is taxable property

value per pupil, BC. is the block grant per pupil and P. is the net cost

to the local community per dollar of educational expenditure. A time sub-

script on each variable is omitted for ease of presentation. The constrained

specification of equation 1.5 can be written:


(2.2)     E.. =        + 1321NC. + V.]P. + 8V. + 5BC.}+ Z!y. + u...



Note that although the two equations are nonlinear in the X variables they

are linear in the parameters; the estimation and test procedure of section

1 is therefore directly applicable.

3. The Likelihood Ratio Test and Individual Expenditure Elasticities


     The likelihood ratio test overwhelmingly rejects the bureaucratic

budget model in favor of the unconstrained political budget model. The

chi—square test statistic (i.e., minus twice the logarithm of the likeli-

hood ratio) is 172, substantially greater than the critical value of 80

for a one percent significance level with 52 degrees of freedom.'

     A more detailed analysis of the actual coefficients shows that the

political budgeting model is not only statistically superior to the

bureaucratic model but also has substantially different implications about

the effects of matching grants and of district wealth differences.

     Consider first how the models differ empirically in their implications

about the Impact of matching grants. A matching grant lowers the net price

to the school district per dollar of educational spending. The elasticity

of each type of educational spending with respect to this price is a useful

way of quantifying the difference between the political and bureaucratic

models. Because our specification does not assume a constant elasticity,

we shall evaluate all elasticities at the sample means of the variables.

No special problem is posed by the nonlinear specification of equation 2.1;

in the notation of that equation, we calculate the elasticity of E. with

respect to price P in the unconstrained political model as n.         +
S2INC + 3.V)P/E. with all of the variables replaced by their mean values.

These elasticities and the estimated standard errors are shosin in column 2



     1Qur sample contains 732 observations. The 14 equations each contain
5 X variables; the restrictions thus reduce the number of parameters of
these variables from 70 to 18.

 of Table 1. The corresponding price elasticities in the constrained

 bureaucratic model are calculated as        =
                                                 )tjS1 +   S2INC + 3V)P/E; these
 are shown in column 3 of Table 1.

        Two general characteristics of the estimated price elasticities deserve

 comment. First, there is substantial variation among the individual price

 elasticities of column 2. Although most
                                             expenditure categories have price
 elasticities that differ significantly from zero, a few do not. Second,

 there are large differences between the unconstrained elasticities of the

political budgeting model and the constrained elasticities of the bureau-

cratic model. Even for a major category of expenditure like teachers'

salaries, the political budgeting model implies a substantially larger

elasticity than the bureaucratic budgeting model.

       A similar set of elasticities of expenditure with respect to local

property value is shown in columns 4 and 5 of Table 1. Again, the

individual property value elasticities vary substantially among the expen-

diture categories and the estimates differ notably between the constrained

and unconstrained models.

       More significant than either the price or property value elasticities

alone is the relation between them. The bureaucratic model implies that

the ratio of the price elasticity to the property value elasticity is the

same for every expenditure category;1 the evidence here indicates that the



'Under the bureaucratic model, the effects of price and value on each
 expenditure can be decomposed into an effect on total spending and an effect
 of total spending on the individual category. It is easily shown that the
 elasticity of    with respect to price (n.) can be written as the product
 of the elasticity of       with respect to total spending           and the
 elasticity of total spending with respect to price                Similarly, ri.   =

ratio is 1.4. In contrast, the unconstrained estimates of the political

model imply very substantial differences in this ratio.

     This variation in the ratio of the elasticities has important implica-

tions for the use of matching grants to offset the effects of interdistrict

differences in property values. As we noted above the landmark case of

Serrano v. Priest held that the system of educational finance must not make

local educational spending a function of local property values. Feldstein

(1975) showed how a formula relating the local matching grant rate to local

property value could achieve a zero elasticity of total expenditure per

pupil with respect to local property value per pupil. If the bureaucratic

model were true, this would also cause the corresponding elasticity for each

type of spending to equal zero. In contrast, the political budgeting model

and the estimates of Table 1 imply that no simple matching grant could make

all of the elasticities simultaneously equal to zero. A grant formula that

made the total spending elasticity equal to zero would leave the individual

estimates as functions of local property value. This casts serious doubt

on the general principle of trying to eliminate the effect of property value

on total spending. There are a number of alternative options: setting a

matching rate for a particular category like teachers' salaries, using

several different matching grants for different types of services, or

abandoning the goal of overall "wealth neutrality" in favor of establishing

minimum spending standards by category. The appropriate choice among these

options clearly lies beyond the scope of this paper.

4. Conclusion

       The evidence that we have examined shows quite clearly that the

categorical budgets of the Massachusetts school districts are determined

by a political process rather than by the bureaucracy of the school system.

The pattern of educational expenditure as well as its total is thus directly

responsive to the preferences of the electorate. For Massachusetts school

districts, the reality of the budgetary process appears to conform to the

constitutional description.

       The extent to which such political control is characteristic of other

areas is currently unknown but is of substantial importance for understanding

the   working of the democratic process. We hope that the method that we have
presented here will be a useful tool for pursuing this question.
