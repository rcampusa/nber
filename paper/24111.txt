                                            ABSTRACT

This paper examines the effect of a court-ordered hiring guidelines intended to increase the share
of black teachers employed in a school district in Louisiana. We find that the court-ordered hiring
policy significantly increased the share of teachers who are black in the district relative to the rest
of the state, and to a matched synthetic control sample. The policy also increased the share of new
teachers hired who are black, and decreased the student-teacher representation gap, defined as the
difference in enrollment share black among students and teachers in a district. There were increases
in the share of black teachers observed in both predominately white and predominately black
schools in the district. The policy had no measurable impacts—either positive or negative—on
district-level measures of student achievement.

    I. Introduction

        The pivotal Supreme Court decision launching the modern civil rights

movement—Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (1954)—was an education case.

Subsequent court rulings and federal initiatives aimed at desegregating schools have

targeted a wide range of policies aimed at students, teachers, and school funding. An

important literature has measured the causes and consequences of school desegregation,

and particularly its impact on students (see, for example Ashenfelter et al., 2006;

Coleman et al., 1975; Farley et al., 1980; Orfield, 2000; Rosenberg, 1991; Welch &

Light, 1987; Guryan 2004; Reber 2005; Cascio et al. 2008; Jackson 2009; Cascio et al.

2010). Less research has focused on teacher sorting and outcomes, and measuring these

effects has proven more challenging due to data limitations.

        The Supreme Court has long held that faculty desegregation is an indispensable

part of the school desegregation process (Harvard Law Review, 1991). In 1968 the

Supreme Court ordered states to dismantle segregated school systems “root and branch”

(Green v. County School Board of New Kent County, 1968), identifying five factors to be

used to gauge a school system’s compliance with the Brown mandate: facilities, staff,

faculty, extracurricular activities, and transportation. In the 1970s, district judges in

several cases found that school boards had engaged in racially discriminatory hiring

practices and imposed permanent faculty quotas designed to create racial parity between

the school system’s faculty and student populations. In addition, when faculty reductions

threatened to diminish the ranks of newly hired blacks, judges ordered race-based layoffs

that overrode the seniority rights of teachers (examples include, Arthur v. Nyquist, 1981;

Morgan v. Kerrigan, 1975; Morgan v. O’Bryant, 1982; Oliver v. Kalamazoo Board of




                                                                                             3
Education, 1980). Hiring and layoff orders remain in effect in school districts even today

(e.g., Morgan v. Burke, 1991).

       Moore v. Tangipahoa Parish School Board provides a modern case study for

assessing the effect of a court-ordered affirmative action policy on teacher hiring and

quality. Originally brought forth in 1965, the court made a number of desegregation

orders at that time focused on student sorting. The case was effectively dormant until it

was reopened in 2006. In 2010 the court issued a new desegregation plan that applied

specialized teacher hiring criteria that gave extensive preference to black applicants. In

summary, if a suitably qualified black applicant applied for a vacant teaching position,

the principal was instructed to select that candidate even if the black applicant was not

the most qualified candidate in the pool. If a black applicant was in the pool but not

chosen, the principal would be required to submit written reasons for the choice to a

district committee.

       In this paper, we assess the impact of the 2010 court-ordered hiring reform. We

find that the reform significantly increased the share of teachers who are black in the

impacted district relative to the rest of the state, and also when compared to a matched

synthetic control sample. The policy increased the share of new teachers hired who are

black, and decreased the student-teacher representation gap—defined as the difference in

enrollment share black among students and teachers in a district. We find increases in the

share of black teachers observed in both predominately white and predominately black

schools in the district. Turning to the impact on student outcomes, we find no measurable

impacts—either positive or negative—on student achievement.




                                                                                             4
    II. Historical Background on Court-Ordered Desegregation of Tangipahoa

        Parish School District

        Louisiana passed the first Jim Crow law in 1890 requiring separate

accommodations for whites and blacks, and racial segregation permeated all areas of

public life including the public-school system. While in 1896 the Supreme Court

provided upheld Louisiana’s “separate but equal” law (Plessy v. Ferguson), a half-

century later, in a unanimous opinion the Supreme Court overturned Plessy and declared

that separate schools are “inherently unequal” (Brown v. Board of Education, 1954). In

Brown v. Board of Education (II) (1955), the Supreme Court ordered the lower federal

courts to require desegregation “with all deliberate speed.” Between 1955 and 1960,

federal judges held more than 200 school desegregation hearings.

        Forty miles northwest of New Orleans is Tangipahoa Parish, a county that

stretches from Lake Pontchartrain to Mississippi’s southern border. In 1965 a group of

black students and their parents filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the

Eastern District of Louisiana against the Tangipahoa Parish School Board for maintaining

an unconstitutionally segregated “dual” school system (Moore v. Tangipahoa Parish

School Board). 1 In June 1965 the court ruled for the plaintiffs and issued a desegregation

order for the school system that relied solely on general mandates of non-discrimination

and a freedom-of-choice plan that gave students the right to choose whether to attend

predominately black schools or predominately white schools, regardless of the student’s

race and residence location. In 1967 the court issued a revised, more comprehensive

                                                                                                             5
desegregation order that consolidated the school system and reinforced the previous

school-choice provisions.

         Shortly after this revised desegregation order was issued, the Supreme Court

ordered states to dismantle segregated school systems “root and branch,” identifying five

factors – facilities, staff, faculty, extracurricular activities, and transportation – to be used

to gauge a school system’s compliance with the Brown mandate (Green v. County School

Board of New Kent County, 1968). Moreover, in this decision the Court found that New

Kent County School Board’s freedom-of-choice plan did not effect meaningful

desegregation within the school district. In light of the Green decision, the plaintiffs in

the Moore case filed a motion to amend the Tangipahoa Parish desegregation order. In

July 1969, a new desegregation order was issued that consolidated the separate “black”

and “white” schools into combined schools. 2 The new desegregation order also included

general provisions prohibiting discrimination in transportation, facilities, extracurricular

activities, and classroom assignments.

         Following the 1969 consent order, several black teachers, coaches, band directors,

and principals formerly employed by Tangipahoa parish sued the school board for

engaging in “a policy and practice of coercing and intimidating Negro teachers in an

effort to force Negro teachers to resign their positions.” The court ultimately ordered

these former faculty members to be reinstated and awarded back pay. As a result of this

litigation, in 1975 the plaintiffs and the school board entered a consent agreement that




2
 The ruling laid out school-by-school plans for each of the 8 wards in the Parish, specifying which schools
were to be closed and the new configuration of each school. For example, in one ward with five elementary
schools, a different school was used to educate all district students in each grade from first through fifth
grades. In another ward, two schools were combined with one serving all grade K-4 students and another
serving all grade 5-12 students.


                                                                                                           6
mandated that the school board achieve a 40:60 ratio of black to white high school

principals, agricultural teachers, band directors, vocal music teachers, coaches, athletic

directors, and central office administrators. The board agreed to fill any new vacant

positions in these areas with black, qualified applicants until the 40:60 ratio was

achieved. In addition, the board agreed to hire an “Equal Opportunity Compliance

Officer,” to act as a liaison between the school board and the court. In 1977 the court held

the board in contempt for refusing to comply with the 1975 order. 3 Although the hiring

provisions of the 1975 order were reiterated, no significant action was taken in the court

to enforce the court orders against the school board.



    III. The 2010 Court-ordered Hiring Guidelines

         The Moore case was effectively dormant until 2006 when a white applicant was

hired to fill a football coaching vacancy. Shortly thereafter, the Moore plaintiffs,

represented by NAACP attorneys, petitioned to reopen the desegregation case. In March

2010, the court issued a new desegregation plan extending specialized hiring criteria to

include all teachers in the school system. The goal of the hiring policy is to reach a 40:60

black-to-white ratio for all teachers in the district, approximately mirroring the student

racial composition.

         The current order lays out specific guidelines for all teacher hiring in the district.

In particular, when any teaching position becomes open in any school, the school district

is required to send the names of qualified black applicants who have submitted



3
 In particular, since the 1975 order, the board had filled three coaching vacancies with white applicants
even though the school system had failed to reach the 40:60 ratio for coaches. In addition, the board had
neglected to hire a compliance officer as ordered.


                                                                                                            7
employment applications to the school principal. The principal is instructed to choose

from these applicants for the open position. If the principal does not choose one of the

qualified black applicants, written reasons for the choice are submitted to a committee

comprised of the Chief Desegregation Plan Implementation Officer, the Director of

Personnel, and the Minority Recruitment Officer for review. The rejected applicant(s) are

then interviewed by the Committee to determine whether the Committee should

recommend the applicant(s) for employment to the Superintendent. Qualitative research

we conducted with teachers hired during this period suggest that the Tangipahoa Parish

School District does not have a strong centralized hiring process, but is driven primarily

at the school level. For example, a majority of recently teachers heard about the job

opening for which they were eventually hired by word of mouth rather than an official

job posting. The hiring process often occurred quickly, with only a limited number of

candidates being interviewed.

       Figure 1 shows over time the fraction of black elementary and secondary teachers

in the district both among the stock of all teachers, and among newly hired teachers. The

vertical line in the year 2006 denotes the first teacher hiring period after the petition was

filed to reopen the Moore case, and the line in 2010 denotes the first teacher hiring period

after the court-order. The black teacher hiring share was trending upward in the decade

prior to the re-opening of Moore, from 13.9 percent in 1998 to 24.5 percent in 2006. The

share climbed to 41.4 percent the first year the new hiring criteria are in place, and

although fraction of black new hires dropped after 2010, it is noteworthy that the school

district hired more black teachers, in raw numbers, in 2012 and 2014 than any other years




                                                                                                8
in the time period. 4 The overall black teacher employment share was slightly decreasing

before the re-opening of Moore, even as the new teacher hiring share was increasing. The

share of black teachers rose from 15.9 percent after the Moore case was reopened, to 19.5

percent after the introduction of the court-ordered hiring criteria, and continuing to climb

to 22.4 percent by the end of the sample period. Over the same time period, the fraction

of black students in the district was slowly drifting up from 45 percent to 48 percent (see

appendix Figure 1.)



    IV. Analytical Framework

         In this study, we address the following questions: (1) Did the court-ordered hiring

policy increase the share of African American teachers hired in the district? (2) Did the

hiring policy increase the overall employment share of African American teachers in the

district? (3) Did the hiring policy decrease the student-teacher representation gap, which

is defined as the difference between the share of black students and black teachers in the

district? (4) Did the hiring policy change student achievement?

         To disentangle the impact of the court-ordered hiring policy from preexisting

trends and other potential confounding factors, we employ a difference-in-differences

(DD) approach, comparing trends in the treated district to a control group made up of

other public school districts in Louisiana. We augment this approach with a synthetic

control group design, and propensity score models.




4
  Between 2010 and 2014, several schools in the district transitioned to magnet schools, resulting in an
increase in teacher turnover and new teacher hires.


                                                                                                           9
        Our primary DD estimation strategy uses all school districts in Louisiana as a

control group, using the following ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model as a

baseline specification:

(1)     Yit = β0 + β1(ORDERit) + β2Xit + μi + δt + εit

where Yit is the outcome variable of interest (e.g. the fraction of new teacher hires that are

black, or share of students scoring higher than a basic achievement level in a particular

subject) for district i in year t. ORDERit is a binary variable equal to one when the court-

ordered hiring policy is in effect—that is, in Tangipahoa Parish Schools starting in the

year 2010. Xit is a vector of time varying district characteristics, including student

enrollment, number of schools, and Census locale classification. The model includes

district fixed effects (μi), year fixed effects (δt), and the usual error term εit. In some

models, we augment the specification with linear time trends that are allowed to differ in

Tangipahoa Parish School District, to account for potentially different pre-treatment

trends in the treated district.

        Tangipahoa Parish School District may have preemptively responded to the

litigation by increasing black employment share when the case was filed but prior to the

final court order, confounding the direct effect of the court order with the effect of the

threat of the order. To address this empirically, as a robustness check we replace

ORDERit, which coincides with the court-ordered hiring guidelines that took effect in

2010, with CASEit, a variable that instead times the treatment with the 2006 filing of the

petition to reopen the Moore case.

        To address remaining concerns about potential confounding influences of prior

trends, we adopt two additional approaches. First, we create a “synthetic control group”




                                                                                              10
(Abadie, Diamond, & Hainmueller, 2010) comprising a weighted average of the available

control units (i.e., other Louisiana school districts), with weights chosen so that the

resulting “synthetic Tangipahoa” best reproduces the values of the dependent variables in

the Tangipahoa Parish School District prior to the implementation of the court-ordered

hiring criteria. Due to data limitations, the synthetic control group approach is limited to

the hiring and representation gap outcomes, but cannot be extended to student

achievement data because there are insufficient pre-treatment observations.

        Second, we employ propensity score matching to adjust for pre-treatment

observable differences between Tangipahoa Parish School District and the untreated

school districts. To create the propensity scores, we estimate the following logistic

regression for each outcome variable of interest, and use it to predict propensity scores:

(2)     TSit = β0 + β1Y1998i + β2Y2000i + β3Y2002i + β4Y2004i + β5Y2006i +

        β6Y2008i + εit

where TSit is a binary variable equal to one if the district is Tangipahoa Parish Schools

and zero otherwise and Yi is the outcome variable for district i in the denoted pre-

treatment year. Using the resulting predicted propensity scores, we then select the

districts that had a propensity score closest to Tangipahoa Parish’s propensity score and

estimate the same difference-in-differences models described above on the propensity-

matched samples.



      V. Data

        A primary challenge to evaluating a court-ordered hiring plan designed to

increase the share of black teachers in a school district is that data on the racial




                                                                                             11
composition of school teachers generally is not publicly available. However, the Equal

Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) collects teacher demographic data from

every school district in the United States on a biennial basis through their EEO-5 form,

which all school districts are legally required to submit. The EEO-5 form includes race-

ethnicity data for all full-time teachers and new full-time teacher hires in the school

district. The EEOC provided access to these district-level confidential data for all

Louisiana school districts from 1998 through 2014.

        To supplement the EEO-5 data, we use enrollment counts and student race and

ethnicity characteristics at the district level over the same time period from the National

Center for Education Statistics’ Common Core of Data (CCD). We also use school-level

teacher demographic data from 2007 through 2014 provided by the Tangipahoa Parish

School District.

        Data on district-level standardized test performance is publicly available through

the Louisiana Department of Education (2007-2014), including End-of-Course exams

(Algebra I and English II) and the state’s standardized achievement exam results for

tested subjects including Math, ELA, Science, and Social Studies. 5 The data include the

percent of students scoring in each proficiency category (advanced, mastery, basic,

approaching basic, and unsatisfactory), by subject, by grade, for every school district in

the state. To be promoted to the next grade, students in grades four and eight must receive

a score of “basic” or above on either the ELA or math LEAP test.




5
 Students in grades three, five, six, and seven are assessed using the Integrated Louisiana Educational
Assessment Program (iLEAP), while students in grades four and eight are assessed using the Louisiana
Educational Assessment Program (LEAP). Both the iLEAP and LEAP are comprised of sections covering
English Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies.


                                                                                                     12
       Summary statistics can be found in Table 1. Prior to the court-ordered hiring

reform, the Tangipahoa district hired a lower fraction of black teachers than did the rest

of Louisiana’s districts (19.8 percent vs. 24.1 percent), and their teacher workforce had

fewer blacks (17.1 percent vs. 23.2 percent), as shown in Panel A. After the reform,

Tangipahoa’s new hires were substantially more likely to be black than those in the rest

of the state (32.2 percent vs. 21.7 percent), and the difference in the share of the teaching

workforce that is black declined to 2 percentage points. In the pre-reform period,

Tangipahoa’s students were 45.4 percent black—a rate nearly identical to the rest of the

state (see Panel B). In the post-reform period, the share of Tangipahoa’s students who are

black increased to 48.0 percent, 2.3 percent higher than the average of the rest of the

state’s districts. The representation gap (the difference between the share of black

students and black teachers) hovered around 28 percent in Tangipahoa, but increased

from 22 to 24 percent in the rest of the state. As shown in Panel C, the average

standardized test passing rates ranged from 55 to 70 percent, and the end-of-course

passing rates ranged from 59 to 92 percent. Average passing rates were lower in

Tangipahoa than in the rest of the state both before and after the hiring reform.



   VI. Impacts on the Composition of the Teacher Workforce

       This section estimates the impacts of the court-ordered hiring reforms on the

flows of new teacher hires that are black, the overall teacher employment share that is

black, and the difference between the share of black students in the student body and the

teaching force. Section A starts with difference-in-differences estimates, then the




                                                                                            13
subsequent section applies a synthetic control group approach, and section C concludes

with additional robustness checks.

    A. Difference-in-differences estimates

        Table 2 presents difference-in-differences estimates of the effect of the court-

ordered hiring reform on the employment of black teachers in Tangipahoa. The first two

columns estimate the impact on black hiring share, calculated as the number of full-time

black elementary and secondary teachers hired by a district in a given year divided by the

total number of full-time elementary and secondary teachers of any race or ethnic group

hired by the district in that year. Column (1) does not control for differential trends over

time by district, and finds that the black hiring share increases by 15.6 percentage points

for new teachers. Since pre-reform trends in new teacher hiring appear to be important in

Figure 1, in column (2) we add separate linear trends for Tangipahoa and the control

districts. This model is our preferred specification, and yields a smaller and not

statistically significant estimate of a 7.3 percentage point increase in black new teacher

hiring share.

        Ultimately, since the court has ordered the district to achieve a 40:60 black-white

ratio for all teachers in the district, it is also important to measure the racial diversity in

the stock of the teaching force directly. Columns (3) and (4) consider the overall black

teacher employment share, defined as the number of full-time black elementary and

secondary teachers employed by the district in a given year divided by the number of

full-time elementary and secondary teachers employed by the district in that year of any

race or ethnicity. After the court-ordered reforms, the black share of employment rose by

approximately 6 percentage points. The point estimates are larger for high-school




                                                                                                  14
teachers than elementary school teachers, though we cannot statistically reject that the

impacts are the same for teachers of older and younger students (results not shown).

       The court’s reasoning to impose a goal of 40:60 black-white teacher

representation was to align the share of teachers who are black in the district with the

share of students who are black in the district. Columns (5) and (6) estimate the impact of

the court-ordered reforms on the student-teacher representation gap, defined as the

percent of black students in the district minus the percent of black teachers in the district.

The policy reduced the representation gap by between 3 and 4 percentage points—

somewhat smaller than the increase in the black teacher employment share because the

share of black students in the district was also increasing over this time period.



   B. Synthetic cohort estimates

       A fundamental concern with inferences from a DD approach is the validity of the

control group—that is, does the comparison group provide a valid counterfactual for what

would have happened to the racial composition of the teaching force had the court-

ordered hiring policy not been implemented? To construct an alternate synthetic control

group, we take a weighted average of the available control units (i.e., Louisiana school

districts), with weights chosen so that the resulting “synthetic Tangipahoa” best

reproduces the values of the dependent variables in the Tangipahoa Parish School District

prior to the implementation of the court-ordered hiring criteria. Results are shown in

Figure 2. Panel A illustrates the trends in the share of new teacher hires who are black.

Tangipahoa and the synthetic control districts track each other closely from 1998 through

2004, with both groups showing an upward trend in the share of new hires that are black.




                                                                                            15
After the Moore case was reopened in 2006, hiring trends diverge with the share black

continuing to increase in Tangipahoa Parish, and a leveling off in the synthetic control

district. After the 2010 court order, the gaps persist with Tangipahoa hiring a

substantially higher share of new black teachers than would have been predicted in the

absence of the reforms.

       Panel B repeats the exercise with the black share of total teacher employment.

The black share of total employment is slowly trending down prior to 2006, at which

points the trends diverge and Tangipahoa employs a larger share of black teachers than

predicted by the synthetic control group. Panel C shows the representation gap. Prior to

the reform the gap was drifting upward, with the share of black students between 26 and

30 percentage points higher than the share of black teachers. After the reform,

Tangipahoa’s representation gap started to trend down, in contrast to the synthetic control

group. Appendix Figure 3 presents results from a series of placebo tests that apply the

synthetic control method used to estimate the effect of the court-ordered hiring criteria on

Tangipahoa Parish to every other district in the donor pool (Galiani & Quistorff, 2016).

This procedure produces the distribution of estimated effects for the districts where no

intervention took place, and allows the estimation of statistical significance.

       According to the synthetic control method, the court-ordered hiring criteria had an

average effect in the post-intervention era of increasing the black teacher employment

share in Tangipahoa Parish by 4.7 percent in comparison to synthetic Tangipahoa, with

an equivalent p-value of 0.09. The effect on new teacher hiring share under this method

of 18.8 percent, however the equivalent p-value of 0.26 indicates the impact on new

teacher hiring is not statistically significant. The representation gap decreased by a




                                                                                           16
2.3 percentage points with an equivalent p-value of 0.09. Together, the results from the

synthetic control group approach are highly consistent with the difference-in-differences

approach in terms of magnitude and statistical significance, suggesting that the court-

ordered hiring criteria had an impact on the employment of black teachers.



       C. Additional robustness checks

           We take two additional approaches to robustness checks. The first, shown in

Appendix Table 1, conducts a difference-in-differences approach on a control group

formed using propensity score matched samples. The table shows results using the 10 and

15 nearest neighbors in the odd and even columns, respectively. 6 Results are qualitatively

similar to those already reported, though less precisely estimated.

           Appendix Table 2 presents difference-in-differences results, similar to those in

Table 2, but replacing the timing of the policy change with the date that the case was

reopened (2006) instead of the date it was decided (2010). Again, the results are

qualitatively similar but less precise, indicating an increase in the share of black teachers

among new hires and employment share, and a decrease in the representation gap.


       VII.         Impacts on Student Achievement

           Although the interest of the court is to stop racial discrimination against black

teachers and improve the black teacher employment share, a complete analysis of the

impact of the ruling must consider potential impacts on student achievement. Evidence

from previous studies indicates that the race of a teacher can impact the achievement of

                                                                                                17
their students, and that outcomes for black students improve when they have black

teachers (Dee, 2004; Egalite et al., 2015; Gershenson et al. 2017).

       To measure the impacts of the court-ordered hiring change on achievement, we

investigate passing rates on state-wide tests. Note that the student achievement data cover

a shorter time period (2007-2014) than do the teacher employment data (1998-2014),

though the sample sizes are similar because the achievement data are reported annually

while the teacher employment data are reported every other year.

       Table 3 presents the DD results. Passing rates for elementary school students on

the state standardized tests in math, ELA, science, and social studies range from 55

percent to 61 percent in Tangipahoa prior to the court-ordered reforms. Columns (1)

through (4) indicate a small, statistically indistinguishable from zero impact on these

passing rates. Columns (5) and (6) estimate the impact of the reforms on high school

students’ passing rates on end-of-course exams in Algebra I and English II. These results

suggest that, although the court-ordered hiring policy did influence the composition of

the teacher workforce, it did not measurably help nor harm student achievement in the

five years after the reform was adopted.



   VIII.       Understanding the Change in Teacher Employment

       The court-ordered hiring reforms in the Tangipahoa Parish School District took

the form of a “hard” affirmative action policy—that is, within the candidate pool for a

given job, schools were required to use different hiring criteria based on race. As shown

above, this court order resulted in an increase in the share of the teaching force in the

district that is black. However, would a so-called “soft” affirmative action policy—that




                                                                                            18
is, a required change to the composition of the candidate pool—have had a different

impact? In particular, in the context of hiring professional football coaches it has been

shown that requiring teams to interview at least one minority candidate increases the

share of black coaches (Dubois, 2016). Would such a “soft” affirmative action approach

be more effective in the context of increasing the representation of black teachers than the

“hard” affirmative action approach taken by the court?

       A necessary condition for a “hard” affirmative action policy to be effective is that

there must be qualified black teachers who apply to open teacher positions in the district.

If there are no black applicants in the pool, however, the remedy ordered by the court in

this case is not activated. While we were unable to obtain systematic data on the number

or race of applicants, in order to address this question, we undertook a series of

qualitative interviews with teachers in the district to better understand the hiring process.

Teachers described a decentralized, accelerated, and insular hiring process in the district.

For example, when asked how they became aware of the job opening, 81 percent of the

teachers interviewed reported “word of mouth” or that they were contacted directly by

the school without any contact with the district. This might raise concerns that some

schools could attempt to “game” the court-order if they wanted to increase the probability

of a white applicant being hired. For example, potential black applicants could be less

likely than potential white applicants to hear about job openings through word of mouth,

potentially due to differences in networks. A centralized job posting system would

potentially alleviate such concerns.

       Another feature of the court ruling is that the guidelines will be lifted when the

district as a whole reaches a 40:60 black-to-white teacher employment ratio, but the




                                                                                            19
incentives for individual schools to increase their black teacher employment share are

less strong. We investigated whether schools that already had a high share of black

teachers or of black students were differentially responsive to the court-ordered reforms.

We were able to obtain school-level teacher demographic data from the district, as

reported in Table 4. Panel A breaks the sample by whether more than 40 percent of the

school’s teachers are black in the pre-reform period (2007-09). Prior to the reform,

schools with a high share of black teachers (“unitary” schools) had on average 54 percent

black teachers, while those with a low share (“non-unitary” schools) had 13 percent.

After the reform, non-unitary schools saw an increase in their black share to 18 percent.

Difference-in-differences estimates of the relative changes between unitary and non-

unitary schools after the reform (column 7) indicate that the difference in their rates of

black teachers narrowed by 8.5 percentage points. Panel B repeats the exercise, this time

with unitary schools defined by the share of black student enrollment. While schools with

a high share of black students employ a higher share of black teachers both before and

after the reform, the difference narrowed by 6.4 percentage points after the court order.

Note that these results are not driven by black teachers transferring across schools in the

district. These results suggest that, even with a decentralized hiring system that provides

little incentive for individual schools to advertise to and hire black teachers, the court-

ordered hiring policy significantly increased black teacher employment share at

predominately white schools.

       Although the “hard” affirmative action policy resulted in a number of desired

outcomes, did it change the way teachers perceive teacher quality in the district? “Hard”

affirmative action policies tend to be less popular than “soft” affirmative action policies.




                                                                                              20
Survey data in the United States suggest that whites are much more sympathetic to

special recruiting and training efforts targeted toward minorities (i.e., “soft” affirmative

action) than to “preferential treatment” in hiring and promotion (i.e., “hard” affirmative

action) (Lipset and Schneider, 1978; Kleugel and Smith, 1986; Kinder and Sanders,

1990; Holzer and Neumark, 2000). When asked specifically about the impact of the

affirmative action policy on the school district, 61.5 percent of the teachers interviewed

thought it had a negative impact, 11.5 percent thought it had a mixed impact, and only 7.7

percent thought it had no impact or a positive impact. Almost one-fifth of teachers

interviewed reported that they were unaware of the policy.

       However, this generally negative perception of the affirmative action policy did

not translate to how teachers perceived new hires at their school or the quality of teachers

in their department. When asked to describe the quality of new hires, 46.2 percent gave a

completely positive review, while 46.2 percent thought new hires exhibited mixed

quality. Nearly 60 percent of teachers described the quality of teachers in their

department as increasing, while just over a quarter described the quality of teachers as

decreasing. A common refrain regarding teacher quality—regardless of race—was

articulated by a Tangipahoa Parish teacher during our interview: “With every school

you’ve got some standout [teachers] that absolutely everybody knows, and then you’ve

got some that are horrific and everybody knows, and then you’ve got the rest of ‘em in

the middle.”




                                                                                             21
    IX. Conclusions

        A long history of racial segregation in American schools has resulted in a number

of court-ordered desegregation policies that relate to both students and teachers.

However, primarily due to data limitations, student, rather than teacher, outcomes have

been more thoroughly analyzed. Moore v. Tangipahoa Parish School Board provides a

modern case study for assessing the effect of a court-ordered affirmative action policy on

teacher hiring and student achievement. Tangipahoa Parish is not particularly unusual in

the state. When Moore was reopened in 2006, 46 percent of Louisiana school districts

had a smaller black teacher employment share than Tangipahoa Parish and 24 percent

had a larger student-teacher representation gap.

        We find that the court-ordered hiring policy increased the black teacher

employment share in the Tangipahoa Parish School District by between 2.0 to 5.6

percentage points in the half-decade after its enactment. It also decreased the student-

teacher representation gap in the district by between 2.3 to 4.0 percentage points.

Increases in black teacher employment share in primarily white schools were

significantly greater than in schools with a high prior share black teachers or students,

even though all schools regardless of their racial composition are subject to the court-

ordered hiring criteria.

        Although the court-ordered hiring policy changed the composition of teachers in

the district, it had no significant effect on student achievement at the district level as

measured by a number of state standardized examinations. Qualitative evidence from

surveys of teachers indicate that while many teachers have a negative view of the court-




                                                                                             22
ordered hiring policy, nonetheless they do not think that the quality of newly hired

teachers has diminished.

       There is great interest in diversifying the teacher workforce in the United States

(Hansen and Quintero, 2017), with considerable attention on improving the diversity of

the pipeline for new teachers (Boser 2011; Lindsay et al. 2017). This study finds a

potentially important role for changes to hiring policies to help increase the share of

minority teachers employed. Further research into the potential impacts of “soft” vs.

“hard” affirmative action policies to diversify the teacher workforce is needed.

Notes: N’s represent the number of district-year observations in each cell. Standard deviations in
brackets; standard errors in parentheses. Sample Period “1998-2008” ends in 2008, rather than
2009, due to the fact that the EEO-5 survey is administered only in even years.

Notes: Data reported at the district level every other year from 1998 through 2014. Each column
provides estimates from a separate OLS regression. The sample includes all Louisiana school
districts. The percent of new elementary and secondary teacher hires who are black is the dependent
variable for columns (1) and (2). The percent of the overall stock of elementary and secondary
teachers who are black is the dependent variable for columns (3) and (4). The difference between the
share black students and black teachers in the district is the dependent variable for columns (5) and
(6). Time trends are included in the even columns, and separate trends are estimated for Tangipahoa
vs. the control districts. “Court order” estimates the effect of the 2010 court ordered hiring criteria in
Tangipahoa. Standard errors in parentheses are clustered by year.

Notes: Data reported annually by district from 2007 to 2014. Each column provides estimates from a
separate OLS regression. The sample includes all Louisiana school districts. The dependent variables
in columns (1) through (4) are the share of students passing (i.e., scoring “Advanced,” “Mastery,” or
“Basic”) the state standardized exam in mathematics, English/Language Arts, Science, and Social
studies, respectively. The dependent variables in columns (5) and (6) are the share of students
passing (i.e., scoring “Excellent,” “Good,” or “Fair”) the Algebra I end-of-course exam and English II
end-of-course exam, respectively. “Court order” estimates the effect of the 2010 court-ordered hiring
criteria in Tangipahoa. Standard errors in parentheses are clustered by year.

Notes: Sample includes Tangipahoa schools only. Standard deviations in brackets; standard errors in
parentheses. Schools categorized as “unitary” by whether during the pre-period their black teacher
employment share is greater than 40 percent (Panel A), or if their black student share is greater than
40 percent (Panel B). Difference-in-differences estimate in column (7) includes school and year fixed
effects, and tests whether the gap in black teacher employment share narrows between non-unitary
schools and unitary schools after the court-ordered hiring reforms in 2010.

Notes: Each column provides estimates from a separate OLS regression. Regression specifications
mirror the even columns in Table 2, and include district and year fixed effects plus differential linear
time trends in the treatment and control districts. “No. Neighbors” denotes how many school districts
with propensity scores closest to Tangipahoa Parish are included in the regression. The percent of
new elementary and secondary teacher hires who are black is the dependent variable for columns
(1) and (2). The percent of the overall stock of elementary and secondary teachers who are black is
the dependent variable for columns (3) and (4). The difference between the share black students and
black teachers in the district is the dependent variable for columns (5) and (6). “Court order”
estimates the effect of the 2010 court order in Tangipahoa. Standard errors in parentheses are
clustered by year.

Notes: Each column provides estimates from a separate OLS regression. The sample includes all
Louisiana school districts. The percent of new elementary and secondary teacher hires who are black
is the dependent variable for columns (1) and (2). The percent of the overall stock of elementary and
secondary teachers who are black is the dependent variable for columns (3) and (4). The difference
between the share black students and black teachers in the district is the dependent variable for
columns (5) and (6). Time trends are included in the even columns, and separate trends are
estimated for Tangipahoa vs. the control districts. “Court case filed” estimates the effect of the 2006
reopening of the Moore case in Tangipahoa, four years prior to the court’s decision. Standard errors
in parentheses are clustered by year.
