                                              ABSTRACT

We investigate an index of returns on professionally managed currency funds and a subset of returns
from 34 individual currency fund managers. Over the period 1990-2006, excess returns earned by
currency fund managers have averaged 25 basis points per month. We examine the relationship of
these returns to four factors representing returns based on carry trading, trend-following, value trading
and currency volatility. These four factors explain a substantial portion of the variability in index returns
in the entire period and in sub-periods. We perform similar regressions for the 34 individual funds,
and find many funds where returns are significantly related to these four factors. Our approach impacts
the definition of alpha returns from currency speculation, modifying it from the excess return earned
by the fund, to only that portion of the excess returns not explained by the four factors. While the impact
on measured alpha is substantial, we find that some currency fund managers continued to generate
alpha returns in the most recent sample period.

              Do Professional Currency Managers
                    Beat the Benchmark?



1. Introduction

Over the last twenty years, the notion of currency as an asset class has gained a wider

following. Inspired, perhaps, by numerous studies reporting profitability in various types

of currency trading strategies, investment consultants have promoted currency products

as a potential source of alpha.1 Taking one measure, the number of funds in the Barclay

Currency Trader Index (BCTI) has grown from 44 in 1993 to 106 in 2006 (see Exhibit

1). While returns on the BCTI (an equally-weighted composite of managed programs

that trade in currency futures and forwards) were initially in the healthy double-digit

range, those returns have tended to diminish over time, especially over the last few

years.



If currency is indeed an asset class, we should be able to identify a set of factors that

correlate with managers’ realized returns from currency investment. In this paper, we

measure the extent to which currency managers’ returns correlate with four factors that

are intended to represent feasible benchmark returns from distinct styles of currency

1
  Poole (1967), Dooley and Shafer (1984), Sweeney (1986), Levich and Thomas (1993), and Neely,
Weller and Dittmar (1997), among others have documented the profitability of technical trend following
models in currency markets. Bilson (1981) demonstrated that a persistent forward rate bias could be
exploited for trading profits, and many others have shown the general tendency for currencies with high
interest rates to appreciate. See Froot and Thaler (1990) for a survey and Burnside, et al. (2006) for a

                                                                                                      1
trading – carry, trend, value and volatility. Our results show that a substantial part of

currency returns (both for the overall index and for 34 individual currency managers)

can be explained by systematic exposure to these alternative trading strategies, i.e. style

betas. We examine the stability of these relationships over time and find that both carry

and trend played a significant role in the 1990s. However, the impact of the carry factor

increased somewhat after 2000, while the impact of the trend factor declined.

Nevertheless, the trend factor remained the most dominant factor in terms of R-squared.

It explains more than 65% in the variability of the excess currency returns in the 1990s

and after 2000. In the 1990s, currency manager returns were, at the margin, significantly

negatively related to the value factor, meaning that currency managers as a group tended

to bet against Purchasing Power Parity and were the worse off for it. After 2000,

currency manager returns are positively and significantly related to the volatility factor.

Post-2000, nearly 77% of the variability in monthly returns on the BCTI can be

explained by our four factors.



The results for individual managers are naturally more diverse than for the overall index.

In the six-year period ending in 2006, we find that 8 of 34 currency fund managers

produced excess returns (over and above the returns associated with the four factors) that

are statistically significant and average about 104 bps per month. While overall managed

currency returns have declined sharply over the last 20 years, some individual managers

appear still capable of generating alpha compared to our four factor benchmarks.


recent study. Studies prepared at Citibank (2003) and Deutsche Bank (2007) suggest that simple trading
strategies based on mean reversion to long run PPP exchange rates have been profitable.

Our approach significantly alters the definition and measurement of alpha returns in the

context of currency speculation. For various reasons (e.g. currency returns alleged to be

unpredictable or uncorrelated with equity benchmarks), most studies have adopted zero

for currency overlay programs and the risk-free return for absolute return programs as

the appropriate return benchmarks for currency speculation.2 In prior studies, all excess

returns were classified as alpha return, i.e. beta returns were assumed away. In our

framework, alpha currency returns are those over and above returns associated with

transparent and readily implemented currency trading strategies. As exchange traded

funds become available to proxy the returns from basic currency trading strategies,

investors can capture these returns (i.e. beta returns) with minimal cost. In our

framework, professional currency managers who simply mimic the strategies embodied

in our four factors are unlikely to earn alpha. Our empirical results support this, showing

a significant inverse relationship between alpha returns and the variation explained by

the four factors.

  A currency overlay program is simply a mandate for trading on the basis of assets invested elsewhere. If
the overlay manager does nothing, he earns zero return. An absolute return program manager holds assets
under management which if left unmanaged earn the risk-free rate.

2. Explaining Currency Index Returns

Until recently, it was nearly unthinkable to propose modelling speculative currency

returns in anything like the framework applied in equity markets. A few stylized

macroeconomic models developed conditions under which a forward currency risk

premium could exist.3 Despite this, a prominent theme in academic studies is that

currency returns are not forecastable and so expected returns are zero.4 However, other

studies have documented that various currency trading strategies have been profitable,

and also that these returns are weakly correlated with other asset classes (e.g. equities,

bonds, and real estate) making currency desirable as a “zero beta” asset for traditional

institutional investors.5



While currency trading returns may be unrelated to equity market returns, they may be

related to other factors. In a recent paper, Anson (2007) argues that there is a continuum

between beta and alpha. In Anson’s view, there exist different types of beta, ranging

from the classic beta, which we know from the CAPM model, to other betas, which

reflect systematic exposure to other defined facets of the market. What could pass for

“alpha” might simply be systematic exposure to some other style factor.



Even so, currency investing does not neatly fit into equity market paradigms. The

currency market is a long-short market, where going long one currency by necessity

  Meese and Rogoff (1983) is the seminal article in this area. Rogoff (2002) argues that the evidence for
unpredictability is still compelling.

uncorrelated with other asset classes.

means going short in another currency. A currency investor might borrow 1 million GBP

to finance an investment in 2 million USD. In principle, currency investing requires no

net investment and there is no natural “market portfolio” to track, making the concept of

beta seem inappropriate for currencies.



With the realization that there are different types of beta and returns may be

systematically related to well-defined factors, the concept of currency betas gains logic.

Recently, both Citibank and Deutsche Bank have introduced currency benchmark

indices to track the performance of currency returns building on several well defined

components.6 We follow on this approach by analyzing four potential factors that could

explain currency returns earned by professional managers. Once specified, we can then

estimate what portion of currency trading profits is due to exposure to these specific

trading style or risk factors, and what portion is due to skill, or alpha.



3. Currency Returns, Factors and Methodology

To measure the systematic components of currency returns (the betas) and isolate the

portion due to skill, we use a standard factor model of the form:


                          Rt = α + ∑i β i Fi ,t + ε t                                           (1)

where

6
  The Citibank (2007) Beta1 Index is constructed from the returns on four trading styles: a trend
component, a G10 carry component, an emerging market carry component, and a Purchasing Power Parity
component. The Beta1 indices are calculated for Citibank by Deutsche-Borse and available through
Bloomberg. The Deutsche Bank Currency Returns Index, described in Hafeez (2007) is a combination of
three trading styles: trend, carry and value (given by PPP). Both Citibank and Deutsche Bank specify well-
defined strategies for each component, however there are differences in the details of each.
                                                                                                        5
        R is the excess return generated by the currency manager, defined as the total
        return ( Rt* ) less the periodic risk-free rate ( RF , t )

        α is a measure of active manager skill,

        F is a beta factor, that requires a systematic risk premium in the market,

        β is a coefficient or factor loading that measures the sensitivity of the manager’s
        returns to the factor, and

        ε is a random error term.


We consider four factors that proxy for types of trading strategies and exposures that

currency managers would be likely to utilize.

        Carry Factor. The so-called carry trade is a well-known strategy employed by

currency managers. In a carry trade, the manager borrows the low interest rate currency

(e.g. Japanese yen) and invests in a high interest rate currency (e.g. New Zealand dollar).

The risk is that the high interest rate currency may depreciate, and possibly by more than

the interest differential which would result in a loss. As a proxy for the carry factor, we

use Citibank’s Beta1 G10 Carry Index which takes a long position in high yielding

currencies against being short in low yielding currencies.7

        Trend-Following Factor. Many currency managers rely on trend-following

strategies in one or more of their many variations. There are many risks inherent in

trend-following such as sudden reversals of trends or patterns, trading based on false

signals, excessive trading costs, and so on. As a proxy for the trend-following factor, we

                                                                                                  6
use the AFX Currency Management Index.8 The AFX Index is based on earlier research

by Lequeux and Acar (1998) which showed that an equally-weighted portfolio of three

moving average rules (32, 61 and 117 days) was a good proxy for a trend-following style

among professional managers.

       Value Factor. Currency managers with a longer-term view may rely on a value

benchmark to gauge when currencies are over or under valued. Purchasing Power Parity

(PPP) in one of its many variants is a commonly used benchmark to represent a long-run

equilibrium value. Empirical evidence suggests that currencies often overshoot their PPP

values in the short run, and show a tendency to revert back toward PPP in the longer

run.9 One trading strategy is then to identify currencies that are substantially misaligned

with the expectation that they will move closer to PPP over time. The risks in this

strategy include the possibility that currency values may become still more misaligned,

that rates will be slow to revert toward PPP, or that the currency’s long-run real

exchange rate has changed consistent with a new PPP exchange rate. As a proxy for the

value factor, we use Citibank’s Beta1 G10 Purchasing Power Parity Index which takes a

long position in currencies that are more than 20% undervalued against short positions in

currencies that are more than 20% overvalued.10

       Volatility Factor. Yet another style of professional currency investment involves

trading on currency volatility. Currency managers gain exposure to volatility risk simply

by taking open currency positions, but also by using options and other derivatives whose

prices are sensitive to volatility. Managers are at risk if they are long (short) volatility

when volatility declines (increases). As a proxy for currency volatility, we use the

average of the 1-month implied volatility for the EUR-USD exchange rate and for the

USD-JPY exchange rate. These two currency pairs have the most liquid options in the

foreign exchange market, accounting for roughly 54% of currency option trading in the

BIS surveys from 1995-2004.11



4. Empirical Results – Currency Index Returns

To investigate the relationship between currency trader returns and our four factors, we

collected monthly data on the BCTI for the period January 1990 until December 2006

(204 months).12 All funds represented in the BCTI are absolute return programs. We use

the 1-month USD LIBID rate to proxy the risk-free return on the assets under

management in these programs.13 Simple descriptive statistics on these variables for the

entire sample and for two sub-periods are presented in Exhibit 2.

currencies and uses OECD measures of Purchasing Power Parity.

The mean monthly return on the Barclay Currency Trader Index is 0.62%, or roughly

7.5% per annum over the 17-year period. The excess return on the BCTI is then the

monthly minus the 1-month USD LIBID rate. As a result, the mean monthly excess

return on the BCTI is only 0.25%, similar to the returns on the G10 Carry Index and the

AFX Index, which averaged 0.15% and 0.21% per month respectively. Returns on the

G10 PPP Index were far smaller, only 0.03% per month. As expected, the carry factor

exhibits negative skewness and the trend factor positive skewness. While trend-

following is a long volatility strategy, carry trading is a short volatility strategy. The

value factor also shows slight negative skewness and positive kurtosis. Kurtosis for the

BCTI is more pronounced than for any of the four factors. The volatility factor

(representing percentage implied volatility rather than a return) has a negative mean

indicating that volatility was, on average, declining over the sample period.14



In the two sub-periods, mean excess returns on the Barclay Index were far higher, 0.36%

per month, in the first period versus only 0.08% per month in the second period.

Likewise, kurtosis in the BCTI was far lower in the second period compared to the first.

Mean monthly returns on two of our factors, trend and volatility, were substantially

lower in the second period (0.05% and -0.08% respectively) as compared to the first

period (0.31% and 0.02%). On the other hand, mean monthly returns on the carry and

value factors were higher in the second period (0.21% and 0.06% respectively) as

compared to the first period (0.13% and 0.02%).

Currency Index Returns and Explanatory Factors.

To examine the relationship between the overall currency returns and explanatory

factors, we regress the excess monthly returns on the Barclay Currency Traders Index

against all possible combinations of our four factors. We report the results for the most

relevant combinations.



The results for the full sample period are shown in Exhibit 3. First, the R-square for the

regression is relatively high, indicating that these factors (carry, trend, value and

volatility) account for roughly 66% of the variability in monthly excess returns over the

entire sample period.15



Trend appears to be the most significant factor. The trend coefficient exceeds one and is

highly significant in each of the specifications which use trend as an explanatory

variable. On average, the managers in the Barclay Index demonstrate an amplified

movement relative to the trend factor. The trend factor alone explains almost 65% of the

variability of the excess returns of the BCTI (see specification 4 in Exhibit 3). The carry

coefficient is also positive and significant. In specification 1, the value coefficient is

significant but negative, suggesting that managers in the BCTI held positions favoring a

continuation of trend rather than mean reversion. In specifications 3 that omits the value




three measures have declined considerably since 2000.
15
   To test for the possibility that monthly returns are managed, we included one-month lagged returns as a
fifth explanatory variable. This variable was not statistically significant.
                                                                                                         10
factor, the carry coefficient drops substantially. This is consistent with the fact that the

carry and value factors are highly correlated (roughly 0.65) in our sample.



The volatility coefficient is not significant in specification 1 for the full sample, but it is

significant on a stand alone bases. The positive volatility coefficient may be suggesting

that excess returns are higher in periods of rising volatility. According to surveys by the

Bank of International Settlement (BIS), turnover in foreign exchange options expanded

five-fold between 1995 and 2007, and the ratio of the turnover in currency options to the

turnover in currency forwards has more than tripled between the 2001 and 2007 surveys.

Volatility, as we will show, could play a larger role in more recent years.



Finally, the intercept term in specification 1 is -0.09% and not statistically significant.

This result implies that managers included in the BCTI were not able to generate alpha

returns. After accounting for our four systematic risk factors – carry, trend, value and

volatility – the first three of which reflect returns on naïve currency trading strategies,

alpha was -9 bps per month or about -1.1% per year over the 204 month period. So while

the overall excess return on the BCTI was 25 bps per month (Exhibit 2), all of that return

and more (34 bps) can be attributed to the four explanatory factors.16



To test for stability of these relationships over time, we divided the sample into two sub-

periods, January 1990 to December 2000 and January 2001 to December 2006. The


16
  Based on our estimated model, the 34 bps comprises 10 bps attributed to carry (equal to the carry
coefficient multiplied by the average carry return), 27 bps to trend, -3 bps to value and 0 bps to volatility.
                                                                                                             11
regressions results for these two sub-periods are shown in Exhibit 4. Our discussion will

focus primarily on specification 1 that includes all four factors.



The coefficient of the trend factor is significant in both sub-periods, but substantially

higher in the 1990s than after 2000. In the first sub-period, 45 bps of monthly beta

returns could be contributed to the trend factor, compared with only 4 bps after 2000.

The coefficient of the carry factor, which is 0.75 in the first period, increases to 1.04 in

the second period, and is highly significant in both periods. In the first sub-period, 10

bps of monthly beta returns could be contributed to the carry factor, compared with 22

bps after 2000. These results imply that, on average, managers included in the BCTI

increased their exposure to the carry factor and reduced their exposure to the trend factor

in the post-2000 period. This is consistent with other evidence that returns to simple

currency trend-following strategies declined in the late 1990s and beyond, leading

currency managers to shift away from trend-following rules.17 Note that carry was not

significant on a stand alone basis (specification 3) in the 1990s, but it is highly

significant after 2000.




17
     See Pukthuanthong, Levich and Thomas (2007).
                                                                                         12
The coefficient on the value factor is negative and significant in the first period, but the

coefficient is smaller and insignificant in the second period. The coefficient on the

volatility factor, which is small (-0.05) and insignificant in the first sub-period, is

substantially larger (0.33) and significant in the second sub-period. This result is

consistent with the fact that trading in currency derivatives increased sharply after 2001,

a point raised earlier. Similarly, it is interesting that -3 bps of beta returns could be

contributed to volatility factor after 2000 (0.33 multiplied by average volatility -0.08%).

Volatility has been declining after 2000 (Exhibit 2), and our analysis suggests that

declining volatility has reduced the excess returns earned by currency managers.



The intercept term, our indicator of alpha after accounting for other systematic risk

factors, is -16 bps in the first sub-period. In the second period, the intercept term is -11

bps. Thus in both sub-periods, most of the variability in returns on the BCTI can be

attributed to our four explanatory factors, with nothing attributed (on average) to excess

performance or alpha.



Interestingly, despite the talk that recent years have been more challenging for active

currency management, our analysis shows that that the average alpha return (as defined

in equation 1) has been negative not only after 2000, but also in the 1990s. The average

alpha is even “higher” after 2000 (-11 bps per month) than in the 1990s (-16 bps per

month). As Exhibit 2 demonstrates, after 2000 we have witnessed a substantial decline in

the returns generated by the trend strategy. Thus, in the post-2000 period, beta returns

have declined substantially, while alpha returns have remained similar.
                                                                                         13
5. Empirical Results – Individual Currency Manager Returns

In addition to the performance of the overall BCTI, we also obtained data on the

monthly performance of all 113 currency managers that make up the index as of the

beginning of 2007.18 As shown in Exhibit 1, the number of currency managers covered

in the BCTI has grown from 44 in 1993 to 113 in 2006. In this section, we examine the

performance of those 34 currency managers included in the BCTI with a track record

that spans a six-year period, January 2001 – December 2006.



Annualized returns, excess returns and standard deviation of excess returns for the 34

managers are shown in Exhibit 5. We also report the annualized alpha return and the

standard deviation of alpha returns (tracking error). The average excess annual return for

all 34 managers is positive, ranging from 0.80% to 22.98%. This broad range of

outcomes highlights a well-known aspect of currency management. There is a lack of

standardized mandates and risk/return profiles vary substantially across different clients.

Therefore it is very difficult to compare one currency manager with another.



The traditional way of computing IR for currency managers is to assume that the excess

returns equal alpha returns (beta returns are zero). The information ratio (IR) is then

simply the annualized excess return divided by the annualized standard deviation of the

excess returns. Our results in Exhibit 5 show that these 34 currency managers have been

performing well since 2001 – their average IR is 0.47. The IRs range from -1.99 to 1.67

  We are grateful to the Barclay Group for supplying the monthly data on individual managers who are
identified only by number and not by name.
                                                                                                  14
with a median value of 0.45. These results probably overstate the performance that could

be expected from currency management due to survivorship bias.19 As important,

however, the results based on IR may be misleading as the calculation assumes that the

risk-free return is the appropriate benchmark for returns.



In our framework as presented in equation (1), alpha returns αj for fund manager j would

be only that portion of excess returns that are not explained by the four factors, or



                          αˆ j = R j ,t − ∑i βˆi , j Fi ,t + ε j ,t                             (2)



We can thus define an alternative information ratio IR *j = α j / σ (α j ) that reflects alpha

returns divided by their standard deviation or tracking error. Calculations shown in Table

6 show that the mean and median values of IR* are smaller than the traditional IR. There

is a substantial impact on the ranking of funds. For example, several funds (M2, M5,

M6, M17, M21 and M22) show a substantial decline using IR* compared with IR. These

six managers switch from positive IR values to negative IR* values. On the other hand,

several funds (M7, M8, and M32) show a marked increase using IR* rather than the

traditional IR. This large impact follows from the fact the some funds are earning beta

returns while other funds are offering pure alpha returns in the sense of equation (2).




19
  As one indicator of the potential bias, in 2001, the BCTI was based on data from 47 funds. Only 34 of
those survived to establish a full six-year history through 2006.
                                                                                                          15
To investigate how much of these returns is pure alpha and how much is due to exposure

to risk factors (beta), we regress the monthly excess returns of the 34 currency managers

against the four explanatory factors. Exhibit 6 summarizes our results.



Several observations stand out. First, only 8 managers exhibit positive and significant

alpha (intercept). This shows that the IRs from Exhibit 5 might be misleading as a

substantial part from the returns stems from exposure to our trading factors. In the

context of our factor model (equation 1), returns generated by currency managers are not

pure alpha returns, but consist of alpha and beta returns. For example, manager M2 has

significant exposure towards three factors – carry, trend, and volatility. The coefficients

on these three factors are highly significant and the R-square (0.688) is the highest of all

34 managers. This manager has generated an annualized excess return of 3.70% since

2001 (see Exhibit 5), but these appear to be primarily beta returns. The alpha for M2 is

negative (2 bps per month) and not statistically different than zero. As highlighted by

Exhibit 5 the annualized alpha return is -2.48%, leading to a poor IR* of -0.52.



On the other end of the spectrum is manager M28. The R-square for M28 is 0.0347,

among the lowest in our sample, suggesting that he has no significant exposure towards

any of our four factors. However, manager M28 has generated a significant alpha of

0.29% per month. The average annualized excess return for manager M28 is 3.02%, a

little less than the excess return generated by manager M2 (3.70%). However, our

analysis shows that M28 is offering alpha returns while M2 is offering beta exposure.

Therefore, the IR* for M28 is higher than his standard IR (0.93 instead of 0.78) while the
                                                                                         16
IR* for M2 turns negative and is much lower than his standard IR (-0.52 instead of 0.74).

The IR*s of these two managers are completely different (which might lead to different

incentive fees), while the IRs are almost identical, 0.74 for M2 and 0.78 for M28.



In Exhibit 6, R-square exceeds 50% for 9 of the 34 managers. This seems remarkable as

the currency managers in our sample are not restricted to developed markets, but our

model uses only factors for developed market currencies. These results are potentially

very important as they could have implications on pricing investment mandates. Clients

may be willing to pay high fees for alpha, but beta exposure should be gained more

cheaply.



Second, the highest exposure remains towards the trend-following factor. The trend

factor is significant for 15 managers. The carry factor is significant for 8 managers and

volatility and value are significant for only 7 and 5 managers, respectively. This suggests

that the trend style continues to dominate among currency managers; however, the other

factors appear to play a significant role for some funds.



Several managers (M7, M8 and M14 for example) have negative exposure towards

carry.20 These could be value managers as currencies which are presumed to be

undervalued often exhibit low interest rates (like the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen).

One manager (M4) has a negative exposure towards the trend factor and might be

characterized as “contrarian.”


                                                                                        17
Twenty-one of the 34 managers have a significant exposure to at least one factor, 9 of

those have a significant exposure to two factors, and 2 funds have a significant exposure

to three factors. Manager M30 has a significant exposure to all four factors. This implies

that managers have been diversifying across different styles by having exposure towards

more than one style factor.21 On the other hand, 13 of the 34 managers have no

significant exposure towards any style factor. For these 13 managers, none of the

coefficient t-statistics are significant at 95% confidence level. These managers might be

classified as the true alpha chasers or they simply might be offering exposure to other

trading styles or risk factors than the four considered here.22



Sources of Alpha – The Role of Timing

In principle, currency managers might earn alpha returns from a variety of skilful trading

decisions including which currencies to pair in a trading strategy, how to weight those

positions in the overall portfolio, which instruments to use to establish their positions,

and when to enter and lift their trades. We wish to investigate whether managers

demonstrate any timing expertise in the sense of shifting their reliance on a particular

trading style as returns from that style vary. A manager with the expertise to increase

(decrease) his reliance on factor Fi when returns on Fi are rising (falling) shows positive

20
   In a specification that omits the value factor, these coefficients are also statistically significant.
21
   Using simulated data, Binny (2005) shows that alternative currency trading styles (value forecasting,
trend following, return forecasting and non-directional strategies) produces returns that were imperfectly
correlated.
22
   We again included lagged returns as a fifth explanatory variable. Lagged returns were significant for 6
managers with significant positive coefficients in 4 cases and significant negative coefficients in 2 cases.


                                                                                                           18
timing ability. To test this possibility, we run regressions of the following form for each

manager:



                                R j ,t = α j + ∑i β i , j Fi ,t + ∑i γ i , j Fi ,2t + µ j ,t         (3)




Our results in Exhibit 7 show 19 significant coefficients (or 14% of the 4 squared terms

in the 34 regressions) on the quadratic terms (3 for carry timing, 7 for trend timing, 3 for

value timing and 6 for volatility timing). Fully 17 of these coefficients are positive

indicating market timing ability. About one-half of the managers have market timing

ability in some style, with the greatest timing ability in the trend factor.



Note also that the intercepts in the market timing regressions are smaller than in the four

factor regression. Only 2 managers (M8 and M29) have positive and significant intercept

terms after accounting for market timing compared with 8 in the four factor model. This

suggests that much the alpha returns come from market timing.



Alpha Returns and Beta Returns – A Possible Trade-Off

To investigate the potential trade-off between true alpha and style betas as hypothesized

by Anson (2007), we regress the intercept terms (alphas) for each of the 34 funds against

the R2 from the time series regression of each fund. The results of this cross-sectional

regression are shown in Exhibit 8. We find a significant inverse relationship such that


These results are consistent with the notion that returns at some funds may be managed. In two cases (M16
and M23), alpha became insignificant after adding lagged returns to the regression.
                                                                                                       19
each 1% increase in R2 tends to reduce monthly excess returns by about 1.4 basis points.

The more that individual fund returns can be explained by our four style factors, the less

likely is the fund to generate a true alpha in the sense of a return that is uncorrelated to a

readily attained market index or trading strategy.



Grouping Managers into a Fund of Funds

As one final experiment, we consider a new portfolio, a “fund of funds” comprised of

equally weighted positions in each of the 34 funds over the 2001-2006 period. The

results in Exhibit 6 show that this particular fund of funds earned alpha returns of 31 bps

per month, which is precisely the same as the simple average alpha of all 34 funds in our

sample. Note, however, that the t-statistic on alpha for the fund of funds is 2.92 and

highly significant, while the average t-statistic for alpha across all 34 funds is only 0.74.

This result captures the diversification effect of investing in 34 funds versus the expected

or average result from investing in a single currency manager. The returns on our naïve,

evenly weighted fund of funds are significantly related to three factors (carry, trend and

volatility), which explain 73% of the variation in those returns. Yet there is a highly

significant alpha for the fund of funds.



Importantly, the superior performance of the fund of funds could in part reflect

survivorship bias. As noted earlier, in 2001 there were 47 funds in the BCTI. A naïve

fund of funds on all 47 funds would have realized different, and probably lower, returns

than our fund of funds based only on survivors. We are not able to quantify this effect

because of data limitations.
                                                                                           20
6. Conclusions

In this paper, we have investigated which factors help to explain an index of currency

trader returns and the returns for individual currency managers. The results show that

four factors, representing four styles of currency investing, explain a significant part of

these returns. The average excess return of the BCTI index was positive at 25 bps per

month between 1990 and 2006. However, once we account for the four systematic beta

factors, the alpha is negative at -9 bps per month and not statistically different from zero.

This is not encouraging news for currency managers.



There are some interesting differences between the 1990s and the post-2000 period.

First, volatility is not a significant factor in the 1990s, but it is significant after 2000.

This may be related to the increase in options turnover in the most recent years. Second,

the average excess return in the 1990s was 36 bps per month, but after 2000 the average

excess return has declined to only 8 bps per month. However, in both periods currency

managers were not able to generate a positive alpha on average. Despite all the talk that

the recent years have been more challenging for currency management, we have

witnessed a decline only in the beta returns. The average alpha has remained almost the

same: -16 bps per month in the 1990 and -11 bps per month after 2000.



However, not all is bad news for currency managers. Our results show that 24% of the

managers were able to generate positive and significant alpha between 2001 and 2006.

The average alpha of these “stars” has been quite high at 104 bps per month or 12.48%

per year and significant. Importantly, this 104 bps alpha is measured after taking into
                                                                                          21
account the four explanatory factors – carry, trend, value and volatility – the first three of

which reflects returns on naïve currency trading strategies. This demonstrates that

currencies have similarities with other asset classes whose returns can be related to risk

factors. Although, the average manager might underperform, there exist some skilled

managers who are able to deliver significant alpha.



What do our results mean for active currency management? Our results support the

notion that the foreign exchange market offers opportunity for alpha generation.

However, greater emphasis should be put on “active” in currency management. Our

factor model makes clear that all returns generated by currency managers are not pure

alpha. A significant part of currency returns comes from exposure to a small set of

factors that proxy the returns from well-known and easily implemented trading styles.

This realisation may lead to some re-pricing for “active” currency products. It will be

difficult to justify a 2% management fee and 20% performance fee for exposure to

currency style betas when exposure to equity style betas might be gained for 3 to 10 bps.



Our results suggest that the recent lacklustre returns from currency managers are the

result of declining beta returns stemming mainly from the declining profitability of

trend-following rules and not the result of declining alpha generation. In the context of

our factor model, alpha generation has not declined after 2000 in comparison to the

1990s. Our results show that delivering alpha has never been an easy task. This explains

why investors might be willing to pay high fees for true alpha performance. An index of

currency managers tended to underperform in the 1990s and post 2000. However, some
                                                                                           22
skilful managers have been able to deliver positive and significant alphas.

      The risk-free return is the 1-month LIBOR rate (less 12.5 bps) quoted at the end of month t-1 for the rate
      earned over month t. We used 1-month rates and not overnight rates since currency managers normally do
      not need 100% liquidity. Source: British Bankers Association and Bloomberg.

      Average annual return is the total return earned by the fund.

      Excess annual return is the total return earned by the fund minus the risk-free
      rate, which we proxy as the 1-month USD LIBID rate.

      IR is an information ratio, equal to the ratio of average annual excess returns to
      the standard deviation of the excess returns.

      Annual alpha is the annualized alpha coefficient estimated for equation 1 for each
      manager.

      Tracking error is the standard deviation of annualized alpha returns.

      IR* is an alternative information ratio, equal to the ratio of average alpha returns,
      αj as defined in our framework in equation (1), to the tracking error (the standard
      deviation of the alpha returns, σ(αj)).
