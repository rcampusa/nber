                                          ABSTRACT

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced federal, state and local policymakers to respond by
legislating, enacting, and enforcing social distancing policies. However, the impact of these
policies on healthcare utilization in the United States has been largely unexplored. We examine
the impact of county-level shelter in place ordinances on healthcare utilization using two unique
datasets--employer-sponsored insurance for over 6 million people in the US and cell phone
location data. We find that introduction of these policies was associated with reductions in the use
of preventive care, elective care, and the number of weekly visits to physician offices and
hospitals. However, controlling for county-level exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic reduces
the impact of these policies. Our results imply that while social distancing policies do lead to
reductions in healthcare utilization, much of these reductions would have occurred even in the
absence of these policies.

1. INTRODUCTION

   The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted health systems and economies throughout the United

States and the world. It is expected that the total economic cost of the pandemic may reach 16

trillion dollars (Cutler and Summers 2020). In the United States, policymakers have responded

by enacting federal and state policies that seek to "flatten the curve" through shelter-in-place

(SIP) policies that encourage social distancing. Previous research suggests that these policies had

their intended effect and reduced spread of COVID-19 infection in the United States (Amuedo-

Dorantes, Kaushal, and Muchow 2020; Courtemanche et al. 2020; Matrajt and Leung 2020).

   However, evidence on the impacts of social distancing and SIP policies on healthcare

utilization remains limited (Ziedan, Simon, and Wing 2020). In previous work, we examined

changes in use of preventive healthcare services, both in-person and telemedicine visits, after the

declaration of nationwide emergency in March 2020 (Whaley et al. 2020). Consistent with other

studies, we find that the use of preventive and elective services declined drastically, and that the

share of visits replaced by telemedicine did not fully replace the gap (Mehrotra et al. 2020).

However, it is unclear from this evidence whether the decline in utilization was in response to

implementation of SIP policies or due to patients' fears of COVID-19 infection while in a

healthcare facility. The effect of SIP policies on healthcare use is a priori ambiguous: While the

decline in COVID-19 cases associated with these policies might instill public confidence and

encourage people to seek healthcare, SIP policies might encourage the public to stay at home and

avoid doctors' offices and hospitals. If these policies do reduce necessary medical care, then,

while they may limit the spread of COVID-19, they may also impose costs. If delayed or forgone

care worsens patient health outcomes, then the positive COVID-related health impacts of SIP

policies must be balanced with the potentially adverse consequences of SIP policies on non-




                                                                                                       2
COVID care. Appropriately weighing these tradeoffs requires precise estimation of the impact of

SIP policies on non-COVID care.

   In this paper, we attempt to inform these tradeoffs by examining the effect of SIP polices on

use of healthcare services. An important empirical challenge with evaluating the impacts of these

policies is the endogenous nature of their implementation (Goodman-Bacon and Marcus 2020).

While there is variation in the timing of implementation of SIP policies across counties, which

can be used to identify the effects of these policies on health care utilization, counties might have

implemented these policies in response to or concurrently with rising COVID cases. Therefore, it

is important to disentangle the effects of SIP policies from the effects of changes in trajectory of

the COVID-19 pandemic within a county. We address this potential endogeneity of SIP policies

by non-parametrically controlling for the number of weeks since the first COVID-19 case and

COVID-19 death in each county.

   To assess the impacts of SIP policies on health services utilization, we used claims data from

a nationwide sample of U.S. individuals with employer-sponsored health insurance. Our results

indicate that county-level SIP policies appear to be endogenously implemented in response to

COVID-19 exposure. We find large reductions in use of preventive care and elective services

following the introduction of SIP policies. We find that fully controlling for variations in

exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduces the magnitude of SIP policies on

healthcare utilization. For example, when not controlling for variations in COVID-19 exposure

SIP policies are associated with an 82% reduction in the use of mammograms. Adding COVID-

19 controls for the number of weeks since the first COVID-19 case and death within a county

reduces the impact of SIP policies on use of mammograms to 16%. We find similar reductions

for other forms of preventive (e.g., colonoscopy screenings and infant immunizations) and




                                                                                                       3
elective care (e.g., MRIs, musculoskeletal surgery, and cataract surgery). In contrast, we find

small changes in non-elective care (chemotherapy and angiograms) and no change in labor and

delivery rates. Thus, while use of health services has declined during the COVID-19 pandemic,

the decline is not due solely to SIP policies. Instead, variation in reductions in care are driven by

both the implementation of SIP policies and variations in the intensity of the COVID-19

pandemic across counties. Our results imply that while SIP policies do lead to reductions in

preventive and elective care, much of these reductions would have occurred even in the absence

of these policies. We confirm our main findings by using cellphone data on visits to physicians

and hospitals that allow for a longer duration of follow-up post implementation of SIP policies.

    Additionally, we examine changes in telemedicine and in-person office visits because many

providers have shifted towards telemedicine services during the pandemic, based on

recommendations from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Centers for Disease

Control and Prevention 2020). For example, over 9 million Medicare beneficiaries have received

a telemedicine service during the public health emergency, mid-March through mid-June (Verma

2020). Similarly, between March 2 and April 14, 2020, telemedicine visits increased from 102.4

daily to 801.6 daily at NYU Langone Health (Mann et al. 2020). Data from four national

telehealth providers showed a 154 percent increase in telehealth visits during the last week of

March 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 (Koonin et al. 2020). Consistent with the

existing literature, we also find that even after controlling for variations in the intensity of the

COVID-19 pandemic, the implementation of SIP policies led to a 35% reduction in the use of

office-based clinician visits and a 100% increase in the use of telemedicine. However, the

absolute change in telemedicine only offset 29% of the reduction in office-based clinician visits.

Our results echo previous work which has also confirmed that telemedicine visits have not fully




                                                                                                       4
replaced office-based visits (Ziedan, Simon, and Wing 2020). Analysis of employer-based claims

data indicates that patients living in zip codes with lower-income or majority racial/ethnic

minority populations experienced smaller reductions in in-person visits but also had lower rates

of adoption of telemedicine (Whaley et al. 2020).

   We believe that these results have several important implications for public policy. First, our

finding that necessary care has been delayed suggests that additional policies designed to restore

avoided care may be required. A concern echoed by other studies (Jain and Santhosh 2020;

Ziedan, Simon, and Wing 2020; Czeisler 2020). Second, for some patients, delaying necessary

care could have potential adverse health impacts in the future. These non-COVID-19 health

impacts are currently not fully accounted for in the health impacts of the COVD-19 pandemic

nor the impact of SIP policies (Woolf et al. 2020). These impacts are also not a major focus in

the current discussion on the impact of the pandemic on healthcare disparities despite the fact

deferred care is happening disproportionately in some populations (Czeisler 2020). Third, the

pandemic, SIP policies and their associated decline in utilization might also affect the supply

side of the market. For example, the decline in utilization of care is expected to have severe

impacts on healthcare provider finances (Farr 2020). This is in stark contrast to insurers where

lower use of health care will improve their profitability putting them in a strong financial

position to withstand COVID-19 (Lucia et al. 2020). The decline in health care utilization also

seems to be impacting employment in the health care industry. Himmelstein and Woolhander

(2020) using the Bureau of Labor Statistics data found that the number of ambulatory workforce

fell by 1.19 million persons, a 14.9% drop and the number of hospital employees decreased by

135, 000 (2.6% decline) (Himmelstein and Woolhandler 2020). Finally, we use real time

cellphone mobility data on weekly visits to offices of physicians and hospitals to confirm the




                                                                                                   5
results of the detailed claims data. This is an important finding given that it suggests that

regulators, healthcare providers, and health departments can use these types of data to make

more rapid decisions on public health interventions.

   The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. First, we outline the data sources and measures

used in the present study. Second, we define the methods used for evaluating the impact county-

level SIP policies on county-level healthcare utilization. Third, we report the results. Finally, we

contextualize the results within the broader literature and present policy implications.



2. DATA


2.1. Medical Claims Data

   Our primary source of data on healthcare utilization comes from weekly aggregates of

medical claims data collected by Castlight Health in 2019 and 2020. Castlight provides price

transparency and health benefits to self-insured employers. As part of operating these services,

Castlight receives medical claims data for all employees and beneficiaries of their employer

customers. The customers vary in both size--ranging from 500 to 50,000 individuals--and in

industry--including manufacturing, education, and financial services. The data covers all U.S.

states and the District of Columbia.

   We obtained de-identified information on the number of patients, number of claims, and

spending for common preventive care (colonoscopies for persons ages 46 to 64, mammograms

for women ages 46 to 64, and vaccines and immunizations for children ages two and younger),

elective (MRIs, musculoskeletal surgery, and cataract surgery), and non-elective (labor and

delivery, chemotherapy, and angioplasty) services. We also obtained information on patient

demographics (age, and gender), geographic market (state and county), and the number of



                                                                                                   6
eligible members within each cell. The demographics of the Castlight sample in 2018 is similar

to the American Community Survey in 2018 as exhibited in Table 1. We used this information to

calculate the weekly number of patients who received each procedure per 10,000 eligible persons

We similarly obtained the number of telemedicine interactions for this population.2


2.2. Cellphone-based Measures of Healthcare Utilization

    In conjunction with medical claims data, we use data from SafeGraph as a second way to

measure healthcare utilization. SafeGraph aggregates GPS pings from about 45 million mobile

devices and 6 million points-of-interest (POI). The effect of this is measurements of traffic

patterns, both to a large collection of POIs, and to/from residences of the users. We used the

"Weekly Patterns" data from SafeGraph to quantify office-based healthcare utilization. In this

dataset, for each weekly file, SafeGraph makes one row for each POI. For each POI, SafeGraph

reports its geographic location, industry via the National American Industry Classification

System (NAICS) code, and the total number of visitors in their mobile device panel that have

visited each day. The weekly data measures begin on Monday and end the following Sunday.

Since visits to each facility is a length 7 array, we are able to calculate this every day, then

combine for each week for 2019 and 2020. We use the four-digit NAICS code to identify office

of physicians (6211) and general medical and surgical hospitals (6221).3 These data have been

commonly used to examine the effect of COVID-19 and COVID-19 related policies on social

distancing (Cronin and Evans 2020; Goolsbee and Syverson 2020; Gupta et al. 2020; Cook,

Newberger, and Smalling 2020; Moreland 2020; Gao et al. 2020). To our knowledge, there are

  Telemedicine procedures were identified as claims with procedure codes in the following set:
('99441','99442','99443','99444','99421','99422','99423','98970','98971','98972','G2061','G2062','G2063'), claims with
a procedure code modifier in ('95','GT','GQ'), or a place of service code equal to 2.

  Note that our weeks which are Wednesday-Tuesday are different than SafeGraph weeks which are Monday-
Sunday. This required breaking each row into seven different daily entries, then re-combining based upon our
weeks. We used the Wednesday-Tuesday designation for computational reasons.


                                                                                                                    7
only two studies that have used the SafeGraph data to measure utilization of healthcare services,

proxied by either visits to hospitals (Jay et al. 2020) or abortion clinics (Andersen, Bryan, and

Slusky 2020).


2.3. Data on Social Distancing Policies

   To measure county-level SIP policies, we use data collected by Cook et al. (2020). The data

include SIP policies from the New York Times and local news and government websites. The

authors collected the dates for statewide orders from the New York Times (The New York Times

2020). For states without a state-wide order the authors searched local news and government

sites for SIP policy dates for individual counties. Counties that the authors failed to find a news

report or website that contained a SIP policy were assumed to have followed the state's policy

(Cook, Newberger, and Smalling 2020).


2.4. COVID-19 Cases and Deaths

       We obtained the total number of COVID-19 cases and deaths for each county from

USAFacts (USAFacts 2020). These data have been used in previous studies examining

disparities in COVID-19 case rates (Adhikari et al. 2020; Brown and Ravallion 2020). The data

are accumulated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) using information

from state public health websites. The data track the total number of COVID-19 cases and deaths

in each county for each day. Based on these data we identified the week of the first COVID-19

case and COVID-19 death for each county.




                                                                                                      8
3. ESTIMATION APPROACH


3.1. Effect of Social Distancing Policies on Healthcare Utilization

   To estimate the effect of SIP on healthcare utilization, we would ideally estimate two-way

fixed effects difference-in-difference models that estimate the difference in utilization following

the implementation of a SIP policy. However, a key challenge of the validity of this type of

approach is the endogenous nature of SIP policies, which are likely implemented in response to

growth in the COVID-19 pandemic. We attempt to address this limitation by controlling for

county-level variations in exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic.

   Our main approach uses non-parametric controls for the duration of exposure to the COVID-

19 pandemic in each county. For each county ! and week ", we calculate the number of weeks

since the first COVID-19 case (#$%&'&&(%)* ) and death (+&$"'&&(%)* ) in that county. We

estimate a regression that includes fixed effects for each measure of COVID-19 exposure

duration:



            -$".&/"%0)* = 2 + 45 678)* + :* #$%&'&&(%)* + ;* +&$"'&&(%)* + <5 =0 +
                             >5 ?@@A* + >B C@DE* + FGHIJKC) + L0)*                               (1)




In this model, -$".&/"%0)* represents the number of patients per 10,000 eligible members who

receive each of the selected procedures. Using a dependent variable in level-terms allows for an

absolute comparison in changes in utilization across procedures. To allow for a relative

comparison, we also estimate models that use the log-transformed number of patients who

receive each procedure. We included controls for patient demographics, age and gender, in =0 .

We also include fixed effects for calendar week, year, and county. We weight each regression by




                                                                                                      9
the number of eligible members within each sample cell. We estimate these models using

ordinary least squares and cluster standard errors at the county level.

    The 45 coefficient measures the effect of SIP policies, indexed by 678)* , on utilization. For

this coefficient to have a causal interpretation, there must not be an unobservable that changes

both the implementation of policies (-QR.#S)* ) and utilization of care. Given the scope of the

COVID-19 pandemic, the validity of this assumption may be challenging. In particular, changes

in COVID-19 cases could lead to both implementation of policies and concerns of infection that

lead to care avoidance that would have occurred even in the absence of formal policy

declarations. Our controls for the duration of exposure attempt to address the potential

endogeneity of SIP policies. We iteratively add these controls to assess the impacts of controlling

for county-level variations in exposure to COVID-19 on the impacts of SIP policies.

    We perform two additional tests to control for variations in the intensity of the COVID-19

pandemic. First, we test for differential trajectories of the COVID-19 pandemic based on county

urbanicity using measures from the National Center for Health Statistics (Centers for Disease

Control and Prevention 2019). We interact the fixed effects for the number of weeks since the

first COVID-19 case and death in each county with indicators for whether the county is an urban

or rural county, and measures of urbanicity.4 We avoid directly controlling for the number of

COVID-19 cases or deaths because both cases and deaths could be impacted by the

implementation of SIP policies.

    Second, we test for pre- and post-implementation trends using an event study approach. For

the 13 weeks before and the 10 weeks following implementation of policy implementation, we

estimate weekly differences in use of each procedure using a regression of the form

 The urban/rural categories include large central metropolitan area, large fringe metropolitan area, medium
metropolitan area, micropolitan area, noncore area, and small metropolitan area.

    In this specification, the 4V coefficients test the impacts of the policy in the weeks before and

4. RESULTS


4.1. Effect of SIP policies on use of preventive, elective, and non-elective care

    Figure 1 presents unadjusted trends in the use of preventive (Panel A), elective (Panel B),

and non-elective care (Panel C). For each outcome, 2020 use rates are relative to the use rates in

the same week in 2019. For all three care categories, we observe stable trends in January and

February. Beginning in March, after the declaration of the pandemic in the US, preventive and

elective care use rates decline rapidly.

    While the unadjusted figures show reductions in care, they do not identify how policy

responses to limit the spread of COVID-19 impacted non-COVID-19 healthcare services. Table

2 presents difference-in-difference estimates of changes in care utilization following county-level

SIP policies. The unit of observation is at the week, county, gender, and age-group level.5 For

colonoscopies, the first four columns, utilization rates decreased by 3.6 per 10,000 persons

following SIP laws when not controlling for the county-level COVID-19 exposure, which

translates to a 89% when compared to the baseline mean utilization rate in the ninth week of

2019. Non-parametrically controlling for the weeks since the first COVID-19 case, death, and

both cases and deaths substantially reduces the impact of SIP policies on colonoscopy use (rows

 The population for colonoscopy procedures is limited to those ages 46 to 64. Mammograms are limited to women
ages 46 to 64.


                                                                                                           11
2-4). In the preferred specification in column 4 that includes both sets of controls, the

introduction of SIP policies lead a 0.9-person decrease in the use of colonoscopies, a relative

decrease of 23%. Thus, controlling for the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic reduces the

impact of SIP policies on colonoscopy utilization by 74%.

   In the rest of Panel A, we observe similar results for the two other forms of preventive

services--mammograms for women ages 46 to 64 (columns 5-8) and immunizations for children

under the age of two (columns 9-12). SIP laws lead to a 17.1-person decline (82% relative

reduction) in use of mammograms when not controlling for COVID-19 exposure. The effect falls

by 80% to a 5.5-person reduction (16% relative reduction) when fully controlling for COVID-19

exposure. For immunizations, we find a 5.5-person reduction (23% relative reduction) when not

controlling for COVID-19 exposure and no impacts of SIP policies when fully controlling for

COVID-19 exposure.

   SIP policies lead to similarly-sized reductions in the use of elective procedures, and the effect

of SIP policies is again influenced by county exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic (Panel B).

For MRIs, musculoskeletal surgery, and cataract surgery, we find absolute reductions of 1.9, 0.5,

and 0.15 per 10,000 when not controlling for COVID-19 exposure, respectively. These absolute

reductions translate to relative reductions of 55%, 50%, and 70% in the use of each service.

However, adding the full set of COVID-19 controls reduces the impact of SIP policies on

elective healthcare utilization by approximately 70%. In columns 4, 8, and 12, we find absolute

reductions of 0.6, 0.1, and 0.05, which translate into relative reductions of 18%, 11%, and 25%.

   For non-elective care (Panel C), we observe smaller changes following SIP policies. We do

not observe changes in labor and delivery rates following SIP policies. We find a small reduction

in use of chemotherapy (columns 5-8). When including the full set of COVID-19 controls, we




                                                                                                  12
find a 0.2-person reduction in chemotherapy rates, which translates to a 14% relative reduction.

Unlike the other procedures, the effect of SIP policies is largest when including the full set of

COVID-19 controls. For cardiac angiograms, we find a 34% relative reduction when not

controlling for COVID-19 exposure and a 11% reduction when including the full set of COVID-

19 controls.

    As shown in Table 3, we find similar results when using the log-transformed number of

patients with each visit. For preventive care and when fully controlling for county-level exposure

to the COVID-19 pandemic, we find a 22% reduction in the use of colonoscopies,6 a 38%

reduction in mammogram use, and a 10% reduction in infant immunization rates. These effects

of SIP policies are approximately 40% of the magnitude of the estimated effect when not

controlling for exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic (columns 1, 5, and 9). We likewise find

12%, 6%, and 2% reductions in MRI, musculoskeletal surgery, and cataract surgery elective

procedures when controlling for variations in exposure to COVID. These effects are similarly

approximately 60% of the estimated effect when not controlling for the county-level intensity of

the COVID-19 pandemic. For non-elective care, we find no change in labor and delivery rates

and small reductions, approximately 4%, in chemotherapy and angiogram rates.

    Our sensitivity test that non-parametrically controls for differing trajectories of the COVID-

19 pandemic based on county-level urban vs. rural status shows similar results (Appendix Table

1 for levels and Appendix Table 2 for logs). Controlling for differential exposure to the COVID-

19 pandemic using both measures of market type (urban vs. rural and categories for urbanicity)

reduces the impact of SIP policies on healthcare utilization. In addition, we obtain similar results

for both measures of market type.

                                                                                                                 13
4.1.1. Event Study Results

    We estimate event studies that examine weekly trends in the use of each procedure for the

year 2020. As shown in Figure 2, the event study results are similar to the previously discussed

regression results. Following the implementation of SIP policies, we observe reductions in use

rates for preventive and elective care, but smaller or no change in weekly trends for non-elective

care. Importantly, we do also find some evidence that the reduction in utilization occurs in the

one- or two-week period prior to the implementation of a SIP policies. This immediate pre-trend

suggests that, consistent with the regression results, SIP policies are implemented in response to

COVID-19 exposure, which concurrently contributes to reductions in use of preventive and

elective services.


4.2. Substitution of in-person office visits with telehealth visits

    Similar to the procedure-level trends, Figure 3 presents unadjusted weekly trends in the use

of in-person office visits and telemedicine. Through February 2020, office visit trends were

stable and averaged approximately 661.2 visits per week. During this period, telemedicine visits

were minimal, and averaged 2.8 calls per 10,000 patients per week. Beginning in March 2020,

there is a clear reduction in in-person office visits and a corresponding spike in telemedicine use.

By the end of April, in-person office visits decreased to 341.7 per 10,000 persons, relative to the

year prior, an absolute reduction of 319.4 visits and a relative decrease of 48%. Use of

telemedicine services increased to 87.6 per 10,000 persons, a relative increase of 3,066%.

However, the absolute increase in the use of telemedicine only offsets approximately 27.4% of

the decline in in-person office visits.

    These descriptive findings are confirmed in the regression results presented in Table 4. Panel

A presents level changes and Panel B presents log changes. In column 1, following SIP laws, use



                                                                                                   14
of in-person office visits declined by 107.4 persons per 10,000. The inclusion of fixed effects for

the number of weeks since the first COVID-19 case within the county reduces the magnitude of

the SIP policy coefficient by half to 49.3 (column 2). Including the number of weeks since the

first COVID-19 death further reduces the SIP coefficient to 34.0, and including both, the

preferred specification, results in a 36.6-person reduction in the use of office visits. In Panel B,

when using log-transformed in-person office visits, SIP policies lead to a 55% reduction in use of

in-person office visits (column 1), which decreases to a 35% reduction when including the full

set of county-level COVID-19 controls (column 4).

    The same factors that cause a reduction in in-person office visits also lead to an increase in

telemedicine visits. SIP policies lead to a 64.2-person increase in the use of telemedicine when

not controlling for variation in COVID-19 exposure, and a 10.5-person increase when adding the

full set of COVID-19 controls. In relative terms (Panel B), the preferred specification in column

8 shows a 99.6% increase in the use of telemedicine, which is smaller than the estimated 766%

in column 5 when not controlling for county-level COVID-19 exposure. However, the large

relative shift towards telemedicine does not offset the even larger absolute reduction in in-person

office visits. The difference between the absolute change coefficients in columns 4 and 8 shows

that the increase in telemedicine offsets only approximately 29% of the decline in in-person

office visits.


4.3. Changes in healthcare utilization using mobile tracking data

    As a robustness check we estimate models using the mobile tracking data. In Appendix

Figure 1 we report the unadjusted number of weekly visits to both office of physicians and

hospitals in 2020. The number of weekly visits dropped drastically for physicians and hospitals

after the national emergency declaration. For the regression models we obtain similar results



                                                                                                       15
when using mobile tracking data that measures the weekly number of visits to healthcare

providers (Table 5). For physician office visits, columns 1-4, we find that weekly visits to

physicians decreased by 11.8 following the introduction of SIP policies, a relative decrease of

26%. The dependent variable is weekly foot traffic to locations of individual offices of

physicians. Panel B presents log-transformed visits, which can be interpreted as relative changes.

Because the SafeGraph data derives from a sample approximately 10% of all cell phone users,

the absolute reductions are an underestimate of the absolute changes in visits. The estimated

impact of SIP laws falls considerably when controlling for the number of weeks since the first

COVID-19 case and death. The preferred specification in column 4 indicates a 3.7 decrease, a

relative change of 8%. The result in Panel B, a 10% reduction, is similar.

    Similar patterns exist for visits to hospitals (Table 8, columns 5-8). Following the

introduction of SIP policies, weekly visits to hospitals decreased by 145.8 visits per week, a

relative decrease of 30%. The relative decreases in Panel B is a 23% reduction. Adding in the

fixed effects that measure COVID-duration in each county reduces the magnitude of the SIP

coefficient. Following the first COVID-19 case, weekly visits to hospitals decrease by 61.9 visits

per week, a relative decrease of 13%. In column 8, the impact of SIP laws on weekly visits to

hospitals decreases to a 49.3 absolute differences, equivalent to a 10.0% reduction off of baseline

rates, and a 14% relative difference when measured in logs.



5. DISCUSSION

   The COVID-19 pandemic has been an unprecedented shock to the U.S. healthcare delivery

system. We found a drastic decline in preventive and elective services due to SIP policies related

to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the impact of these policies is lessened when accounting for

variations in exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic. These reductions in use of non-COVID care


                                                                                                  16
as a result of SIP policies should be weighed against potential benefits when evaluating the

welfare implications of SIP policies.

   Our results also suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic led to drastic reductions in use of

health care. These effects were much larger than the decline in care due to SIP policies. Our

estimates of decline in healthcare utilization during the early stages of the pandemic are in line

with existing studies by Chatterji and Li (2020), Mehrotra and colleagues (2020) and Ziedan et

al. (2020). It is important to note that our findings are during the initial stage of the pandemic,

and that the length of the pandemic and mitigation strategies will define the aggregate cost on

both consumers and providers (Cutler 2020). Some are concerned that the deferred care may

cause some individuals with chronic conditions to become sicker and that it might increase

aggregate costs (Lucia et al. 2020). This may also lead to constraints on care capacity post

pandemic (Wosik et al. 2020). In addition, how the healthcare sector will be able to provide

elective procedures once the pandemic has subsided is not known. Anecdotal evidence from

some providers is that they will shift elective procedures to weekends (Lucia et al. 2020). Future

researchers should explore this possibility and whether there are impacts on quality of care.

   Our results provide a crucial first step on measuring the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare

utilization based on various measures. The findings are important given that the Government

Accountability Office has now pledged to track monthly changes in healthcare employment,

change in volume of elective procedures across settings, median monthly changes in hospital

operating margins, and changes in healthcare services as a proportion of personal consumption

expenditures (Government Accountability Office 2020). The results using cellular phone

geolocation data imply that these data should be considered when measuring healthcare




                                                                                                      17
utilization over the course of the pandemic while waiting for healthcare claims data to be

released.

   We also found that while there were drastic declines in in-person office visits that there was a

rapid increase in telemedicine utilization. Telemedicine services have been used to maintain

access and continuity of medical care (Wosik et al. 2020). However, in line with previous work,

telemedicine utilization did not sufficiently replace the entire drop in in-person office visits

(Mehrotra et al. 2020). Whether telemedicine use will be sustained during and following the

COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain. The uncertainty is driven in part by uncertainty if the

existing policy landscape for telemedicine will be sustained as the pandemic proceeds and

eventually ends (Lucia et al. 2020). For example, insurers are concerned that the increase in

telemedicine may lead to increases in fraud and overutilization of services if it becomes additive

over existing trends post pandemic (Lucia et al. 2020). Separately, many providers report that

they do not have the technology system to make the shift to telemedicine or that in-person office

visits are needed to achieve a positive health outcome (Lucia et al. 2020). These concerns should

be addressed given that after the pandemic, telemedicine can serve as one way to proactively

engage with patients who deferred care and to help the healthcare system manage the upcoming

surge in demand for procedures unrelated to COVID-19 (Wosik et al. 2020).

   This study is not without limitations. First, while we use medical claims data from a large

and diverse study population that is employed, it represents a subset of individuals with private

insurance and it does not include other important populations, such as patients with Medicaid,

and those lacking insurance. Insurers have reported that Medicaid enrollment is increasing at a

rapid rate when compared to marketplace enrollment, but surprisingly enough slower-than

expected (Lucia et al. 2020). Our findings, while large, are potentially an underestimate for the




                                                                                                    18
declines in the number of visits and length of stay. Second, the SafeGraph mobile tracking data,

comprise of approximately 10 percent of all cellphone users and 6 million locations. Thus, our

results using those data are limited to that particular population and those particular locations.

Our measures of number of visits are not necessarily tracking healthcare utilization, instead the

number of individuals who visit locations under that particular NAICS code. Third, we are not

able to examine whether care that has been deferred during the early period of the COVID-19

pandemic will be deferred until the future or avoided completely. Our estimates do not capture

potential innovative approaches by providers to ensure patient resumption of preventive care.

This limitation is important, given that concerted efforts are being made to increase the use of

preventive services such as vaccinations which has exhibited a sharp initial drop after the

national emergency declaration. Future work must monitor each of the preventive measures that

we track in the present study and disparities in the use of preventive services. Fourth, the present

study does not include measures of healthcare capacity. That said, a recent report by the

Government Accountability Office (2020) reports that intensive care unit bed availability data is

not currently up to date given that only 60 percent of hospitals have reported their information as

of early June 2020 and that 95 to 100 percent are needed for effective analysis (Government

Accountability Office 2020).

   To our knowledge, our study is the most comprehensive to date on the effects of county-level

SIP policies on healthcare utilization. We use multiple novel datasets and measures to evaluate

the effect of these policies. Our results indicate that utilization has dropped drastically and that it

varies by the type of care received and the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic within a county.

Finally, our results indicate that while the use of telemedicine has increased, it has not fully




                                                                                                     19
replaced the use of office-based visits. Thus, it is critical that public policy and public health

officials do more to ensure that individuals receive the care that they desperately need.

Caption: Baseline means are calculated based on the ninth week of 2019. Regression models were estimated using ordinary least squares. Regression
models also include measures for the patient's age, gender, and county. Outcome measure is the number of patients, and all models are weighted for
the total number of eligible enrollees. Standard errors are clustered at the county level. Immunizations are restricted to those aged 2 or younger.
Colonoscopy is restricted to those 46 or older. Mammograms were restricted to females aged 46 or older. Deliveries were restricted to women
between the ages of 19 and 45. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1

Caption: Baseline means are calculated based on the ninth week of 2019. Regression models were estimated using ordinary least squares. Regression
models also include measures for the patient's age, gender, and county. Outcome measure is the natural log for the number of patients, and all models
are weighted for the total number of eligible enrollees. Standard errors are clustered at the county level. Immunizations are restricted to those aged 2
or younger. Colonoscopy is restricted to those 46 or older. Mammograms were restricted to females aged 46 or older. Deliveries were restricted to
women between the ages of 19 and 45. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1
