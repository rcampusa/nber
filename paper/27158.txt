                                          ABSTRACT

We show that cheap credit to impaired firms has a disinflationary effect. By helping distressed
firms to stay afloat, "zombie credit" can create excess production capacity, and in turn, put
downward pressure on markups and prices. We test this mechanism exploiting granular inflation
and firm-level data from twelve European countries. In the cross-section of industries and
countries, we find that a rise of zombie credit is associated with a decrease in firm defaults and
entries, firm markups and product prices; lower productivity; and, an increase in aggregate sales
as well as material and labor cost. These results hold at the firm-level, where we document
spillover effects to healthy firms in markets with high zombie credit. Our partial equilibrium
estimates suggest that without a rise in zombie credit post 2012, annual inflation in Europe during
2012-2016 would have been 0.45 percentage points higher.

1     Introduction
More than ten years after the global financial crisis, Europe's economic growth and in-
flation remain depressed, even though the European Central Bank (ECB) and other Euro-
pean central banks provided substantial monetary stimulus, including negative deposit rates,
longer-term refinancing operations, and large-scale asset purchase programs. In former ECB
President Mario Draghi's own words, "although we have seen the successful transmission of
monetary policy to financing conditions, and from financing conditions to GDP and employ-
ment, the final legs of the transmission process to wages and inflation have been slower than
we expected. Wage growth is now strengthening as slack in the labor market diminishes. But
the pass-through from wages to prices remains weak." 1
    Europe's "missing inflation puzzle" bears a striking resemblance to Japan's "lost decades."
Besides a deflationary pressure, both economies have been characterized by ultra accommoda-
tive central bank policies and zombie lending (i.e, cheap credit to impaired firms) by under-
capitalized banks (see Caballero et al., 2008, Giannetti and Simonov, 2013, and Acharya
et al., 2019). Along with search-for-yield behavior of investors, these forces have collectively
pushed borrowing costs to record lows, even for high-risk firms.2 The glut of cheap debt has
allowed many struggling firms to stay afloat, leading to a "zombification" of the economy
(e.g., Borio and Hofmann, 2017 and Banerjee and Hofmann, 2018).
    In this paper, we provide an explanation for the co-occurrence of the rise of zombie credit
and low inflation shown in Figure 1. Building on Caballero et al. (2008), we illustrate in a
simple model that a rise in zombie credit, by keeping alive distressed firms that would oth-
erwise default, slows down the adjustment in the production capacity. Following a negative
demand shock, the excess capacity puts downward pressure on product prices and thereby

on the left axis and the asset-weighted share of zombie firms on the right axis in our sample. A firm is

lowers inflation.3 We test this channel using granular inflation and firm-level data for 1.1
million firms from 12 European countries across 65 industries. This data set allows us to
observe product-level prices and detailed firm-level characteristics.
    Our zombie credit channel mechanism is consistent with a model where firms, potential
entrants and incumbents, draw a productivity parameter every period and set prices to
exploit their market power. If its productivity realization is high, an incumbent firms is
more likely to survive and a potential entrant firm is more likely to enter. If the realization
is low, an incumbent firm is more likely to default and a potential entrant firm is less likely
to enter. Following a negative demand shock and the resulting price decline, zombie credit
keeps alive some firms that would otherwise default, weakening the downward adjustment

     For example, the Italian concrete and cement industry suffered from a global demand shock in 2008.
Many firms subsequently struggled to pay interests and relied on their banks to remain alive and produce.
The CEO of Cementir, one of the industry leaders in Italy, stated in 2017 that "in Italy, in the cement
industry, we have zombies kept alive by banks. [...] Banks do everything they can to keep these zombies alive
to avoid realizing losses on their balance sheets." Industry representatives obtained in 2017 a Senate hearing
(link) to discuss the ongoing crisis. In that hearing, they stated that "the excessive productive capacity caused
an unprecedented price competition that, in turn, caused firms to realize large losses."

in the number of active firms. The resulting excess production capacity puts downward
pressure on firms' markups and product prices. In equilibrium, zombie credit causes (i) a
reduction in firm default and entry, firm markups, product prices, and firm productivity;
and (ii) an increase in sales, number of active firms, and input costs.
   The empirical analysis is based on a new data set, obtained by combining product-level in-
flation data from Eurostat with firm-level accounting data from Bureau van Dijk's Amadeus.
Using input-output linking tables, we calculate inflation at the industry-level from product-
level inflation data. Using Amadeus data, we identify zombie firms as firms that meet two
criteria: (i) the interest coverage ratio is below the median and the leverage ratio is above
the median--where medians are calculated at the industry-country level--and (ii) the cost
of debt financing is lower than the cost paid by the most creditworthy comparable firms.
Zombie firms' ex-post financial and real outcomes suggest that their access to cheap credit
is not driven by a positive future outlook. In particular, while low-quality non-zombie firms
on average deleveraged and maintained a stable profitability, zombie firms increased their
leverage and experienced a drop in their profitability.
   Our analysis in the cross section of countries and industries supports the zombie credit
channel. We find that industry-country pairs (henceforth called "markets") that experience
an increase in the share of zombie firms subsequently have: (i) fewer firm defaults and entries,
(ii) more active firms, (iii) higher sales growth, (iv) higher input costs (material and labor
costs), (v) lower productivity, (vi) lower markups, and (vii) lower inflation growth compared
with markets with a lower prevalence of zombie firms. Our partial equilibrium estimates
suggest that without a rise in zombie credit post 2012, annual inflation in Europe during
2012-2016 would have been 0.45 percentage points higher.
   Our specifications include country-industry, country-year, and industry-year fixed effects
to capture potential omitted variables such as country- and industry-specific shocks. The
positive correlation between zombie credit and aggregate sales growth suggests that the nega-
tive correlation between zombie credit and inflation is not driven by lower demand in markets
with more zombie credit. The negative correlation with productivity suggests that zombie
credit is extended to actual zombie firms and not to firms that are only temporarily weak.
The positive correlation with input costs confirms the zombie credit channel as more firms

compete for the same factor inputs driving up their prices. To further mitigate endogeneity
concerns, we instrument a market's zombie share with the lagged average Tier-1 capital ratio
of the banks connected to the firms in this market.4 Our instrumental variable regression
estimates confirm the negative effect of the share of zombie firms on inflation.
    Finally, at the firm level, we document that the increased presence of zombie firms affects
healthy firms active in the same market. In particular, we find that healthy firms that
compete with a growing number of zombie firms have lower markups, profitability, and sales
growth, as well as higher input costs. These correlations are consistent with healthy firms
trying to prevent a drop in market share and capacity utilization by pricing more aggressively.
    The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the related liter-
ature. Section 3 presents the intuition linking zombie credit to inflation. We present the
formal model in Appendix A. Section 4 illustrates our data and empirical work. Section 5
and Section 6 show our empirical analysis at the industry-country level and at the firm level,
respectively. Section 7 presents robustness checks. Section 8 concludes.



2       Related Literature
Our paper contributes to three strands of literature. First, our paper relates to the litera-
ture on zombie credit, started with the evidence from Japan in the 1990s. In that context,
Peek and Rosengren (2005) document that banks close to the regulatory capital constraint
extended credit to their weak borrowers to avoid realizing losses on outstanding loans. Ca-
ballero et al. (2008) show that this zombie lending affected healthy firms, reducing their
investment and employment growth. Giannetti and Simonov (2013) find that capital in-
jections can stop zombie lending if they are large enough. A few recent papers show that
similar dynamics are at work in Europe in the aftermath of its sovereign debt crisis. Acharya
et al. (2019) show that the ECB's Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) program induced

    The intuition behind this instrument is that weakly-capitalized banks have strong zombie lending incen-
tives (see, e.g., Schivardi et al., 2017, Acharya et al., 2019, and Blattner et al., 2019).

zombie lending by banks that remained weakly-capitalized. Schivardi et al. (2017) confirm
that non-viable Italian firms obtained favorable bank credit from 2004 to 2013. Finally,
using Portuguese data, Blattner et al. (2019) show that these distorted lending decisions
caused a decline in productivity. For OECD countries, Adalet McGowan et al. (2018) show
that the share of zombie firms increased over the period 2003-2013 and that the resulting
market congestion is associated with lower investment and employment growth. Similarly,
using firm-level data on listed firms in 14 advanced economies, Banerjee and Hofmann (2018)
document a rise in the prevalence of zombie firms since the late 1980s, which they link to
reduced financial pressure due to lower interest rates. We contribute to this literature by
documenting the effect of zombie credit on firm markups and inflation.
   Second, our paper relates to the literature on the effect of competition on firm price
setting behavior and inflation. Campbell and Hopenhayn (2005), Lewis and Poilly (2012),
and Lewis and Stevens (2015) show that markups are negatively related to the number of
competitors in an industry. Aghion et al. (2018) find that the monetary easing induced
by the OMT program announcement fostered growth especially for credit-constrained firms,
and more so for a high degree of product market competition. The authors argue that, if
competition is high, weak firms can only avoid exit when funding is readily available. These
findings support the notion that zombie credit, and a resulting lower exit rate, can lead to
excess capacity, which puts downward pressure on markups and prices.
   Third, our paper adds to literature on the impact of financial frictions on inflation dy-
namics. Chevalier and Scharfstein (1996) highlight a "liquidity squeeze channel," arguing
that liquidity-constrained firms have an incentive to raise prices to increase their current
cash flows (assuming sticky customer relationships). Gilchrist et al. (2017) and de Almeida
(2015) incorporate this mechanism into a general equilibrium model to explain the pricing
behavior of U.S. and European firms in response to the 2007-08 financial crisis, respectively.
Barth III and Ramey (2001) suggest the "cost channel" as a possible explanation for an
increase (decrease) in inflation after a monetary tightening (loosening), which suggests that
firms' pricing decisions are related to credit conditions as firms depend on credit to finance
production. Christiano et al. (2015) argue, using a New Keynesian model, that the cost
channel helps to explain the only modest disinflation in the U.S. during the Great Recession.

3    Mechanism from Zombie Credit to (Dis-)Inflation
In this section, we describe the macroeconomic effects of zombie credit. In Appendix A, we
present a formal model which develops a framework similar to Caballero et al. (2008).
    Consider an environment with imperfect competition among firms that produce a single
good. The demand for this good is exogenous. The supply is the sum of the production by
incumbent and entrant firms. Incumbent and potential entrants are subject to an idiosyn-
cratic shock. Incumbent firms that receive a bad shock might be forced to exit and entrant
firms that receive a good shock might enter. In equilibrium, holding demand constant, a
higher number of firms leads to a more competitive market and, therefore, a lower price.
    Suppose the economy is in a steady state, namely the number of firms that default each
period is exactly offset by the number of entrant firms. The equilibrium is illustrated by A
in Figure 2, where the exogenous demand is equal to the production by the constant number
of incumbent firms. To illustrate the effect of zombie credit, we analyze how the economy
transitions to a new equilibrium following a demand shock that reduces the demand to D .
    In the case with no zombie credit, the demand shock causes the price and quantity to
decrease along the supply curve S to the new equilibrium N . The demand shock causes a
direct drop in price making the economy less attractive for both entrant and incumbent firms.
More incumbent firms default and fewer potential entrant firms enter. The lower number of
incumbent firms has a positive effect on price, but not enough to offset the initial decline.
    In the case with zombie credit, the demand shock again causes the equilibrium price and
quantity to decrease, but this time along a flatter supply curve S Z to the new equilibrium Z .
The shock causes a direct drop in price making the economy less attractive for both entrant
and incumbent firms. Similar to the adjustment with no zombie credit, fewer potential
entrant firms enter. However, there is a weaker adjustment through exit as zombie credit
keeps afloat some incumbent firms that would otherwise default. The result is a flatter
supply curve: a reduction in price leads to a muted effect on quantities.
    More formally, consider a linear demand P =  - Q. Given that the good is produced
by surviving incumbent firms and entrant firms, a demand shock (lower ) affects the price

First, the direct effect: a lower demand (lower ) reduces the equilibrium price. Second, the
offsetting indirect effect through entry: a lower price causes fewer firms to enter, increasing
the equilibrium price. Third, the offsetting indirect effect through exit: a lower price causes
more firms to default, increasing the equilibrium price. The last two equilibrium effects only
partially offset the direct effect. Crucially, in an economy with zombie credit, the equilibrium
effect through exit can be considered as being shut down.
   This mechanism can also be adapted to a similar economy where firms are setting prices
in the input markets. In this case, zombie credit causes "too many" firms to compete for the
same inputs (e.g., labor and materials), increasing their prices.
   In sum, zombie credit causes (i) a reduction in firm defaults and entry, firm markups,
product prices, and productivity; and, (ii) an increase in sales, number of active firms, and
input costs. In the remainder of the paper, we test these predictions in the data. In our
empirical strategy, we compare quantities and prices in markets with a high versus low

prevalence of zombie firms. In other words, following Figure 2, we compare equilibria in
markets that, because the heterogeneity in the prevalence of zombie firms, have a different
slope of the supply curve.
    In the next section, we (i) define a "market" as an industry-country pair, and (ii) measure
the market-level prevalence of zombie firms in the data. Consistent with the model, we show
that markets with a high prevalence of zombie firms have lower firm default, entry, markups,
productivity, and product prices; and, higher sales, number of active firms, and input costs
(labor and material costs) compared with markets with a low prevalence of zombie firms.

In this section, we describe our data and our strategy to identify zombie firms.


4.1    Data

Our data set combines detailed firm level and product inflation data. The firm level data
are financial information and firm characteristics from Bureau van Dijk's (BvD) Amadeus
database. This database has information about 21 million public and private companies from
34 countries, including all EU countries. BvD obtains the data, which is initially collected by
local Chambers of Commerce, through roughly 40 information providers including business
registers. Kalemli-Ozcan et al. (2015) show for selected European countries that Amadeus
covers roughly 75-80% of the economic activity reported in Eurostat.
    The inflation data are from Eurostat, which provides information for various consumer
price indices for all European countries. This data set is very granular as we observe consumer
prices at the five-digit COICOP (product category) level. We also use Eurostat to obtain
official data on firm entry, firm exit, firm labor costs, and job's vacancy rates.
    Note that the firm data are at the industry (NACE) level and the inflation data are at the
product (COICOP) level. We use COICOP-NACE linking tables to merge these two data
sets. More precisely, we use the linking tables to obtain inflation at the industry-country
level, by calculating a weighted average of all COICOP (consumer price categories) that are
related to a NACE (two digits) industry. Consider, for example, the textiles industry (NACE

                                                 9

13). The Consumer Price Index (CPI) of this industry is a weighted average of the following
COICOP categories: (i) clothing, (ii) furniture and furnishings, carpets and other floor
coverings, (iii) household textiles, (iv) goods and services for routine household maintenance,
and (v) other major durables for recreation and culture. Following the literature, we exclude
utilities and financial and insurance industries from the sample. With this procedure, we
obtain a measure of the monthly CPI at the industry-country level.
   Our final sample consists of 1,167,460 firms for 12 European countries and 65 industries.
The twelve European countries are Austria, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Finland,
France, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, and Slovakia.


4.2    Identifying Zombie Firms

Following Caballero et al. (2008) and Acharya et al. (2019), we define zombie firms as low-
quality firms that receive debt financing at "very low" interest rates.
   More specifically, we classify a firm as zombie firm if it meets two criteria. First, the
firm has an interest coverage ratio below the median and a leverage ratio above the median,
where the medians are calculated at the industry-country-year level.5 Second, the firm
obtains credit at very low interest rates, i.e. the ratio of its interest expenses relative to the
sum of its outstanding loans, credit, and bonds in a given year is below the interest paid by
the most creditworthy firms, namely AAA-rated firms in the same year in our sample.6
   Figure 1 shows that the share of zombie firms in our sample increased from roughly 4.5%
to 6.7% from 2012 to mid-2016.7 In Figure 3, we document that this rise of zombie firms is
driven by low-quality firms obtaining credit at very low interest rates and not by firms that
already enjoy access to cheap credit deteriorating in quality. The left panel shows that, while
the share of low-quality firms is constant at roughly 27% during our sample period, the share
of zombie firms relative to low-quality firms increased from 17.5% to 22% between 2012 and




   5
     The firms' interest coverage ratio is EBIT/interest expense and the firms' leverage ratio is (loans +
short-term credit + long-term debt)/total assets.
   6
     We infer ratings of firms from their interest coverage ratio as in Acharya et al. (2019).
   7
     In Figure 9, we show that alternative zombie definitions yield a similar time-series pattern.

2015. The right panel shows that bank loans and bonds play an increasingly important role
in the debt funding mix of zombie firms.
              Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for our sample firms separately for high-quality
firms, low-quality non-zombie firms, and zombie firms. Zombie firms are weaker than low-
quality non-zombie firms along several observable dimensions. Zombie firms have on average
a lower (even negative) interest coverage ratio, lower EBITDA margin (EBITDA/sales), lower
net worth, less tangible assets to pledge for new loans, and a higher leverage. Nevertheless,
these firms pay extremely low interest rates, even compared to high-quality firms. Given
their high leverage and low profitability, these firms would have likely had a higher default
rate if they had to pay a higher rate on their debt. Importantly, zombie firms are not
younger nor more reliant on short-term credit compared with low-quality non-zombie firms,
suggesting that our zombie definition does not simply capture early stage companies or
companies reliant on short-term debt.
              We also confirm that the firms that we classify as zombie are not temporarily weak firms,
i.e. firms that "look weak" based on observable characteristics but that might actually have
a promising future outlook that allows them to obtain cheap debt financing. To this end,
we track their ex-post leverage, profitability, and default rates. In Figure 4, we plot the
time-series evolution of leverage and EBITDA margin, respectively, for firms that have been

Table 1: Summary Statistics. This table shows descriptive statistics for our sample firms. We split
firms into high-quality, low-quality non-zombie, and zombie firms. A firm is classified as low-quality if it
has below-median interest coverage ratio and above-median leverage, where medians are calculated at the
industry-country-year level. A low-quality firm is classified as zombie if its interest rate paid on its debt
financing is lower than the rate paid by AAA-rated firms year. Tangibility is fixed assets/assets. Leverage
is debt/assets. Interest Coverage Ratio is EBIT/interest expense. Total assets is measured in million euro.
The definition of firm markup is discussed in Appendix C. Material cost is material input cost/turnover. Net
Worth is total shareholders funds and liabilities-current and non current liabilities-cash, divided by assets.


zombies continuously since 2012 (solid line) and low-quality firms that were never classified
as zombies (dashed line). Panel A shows that, starting in 2011, zombie firms increased their
leverage as they obtained cheap debt financing. In contrast, low-quality non-zombie reduced
their leverage during the same period. Panel B shows a significant drop in profitability for
zombie firms compared with low-quality non-zombie firms, which maintained their EBITDA
margin roughly around its 2009 level.
    In Figure 5, we analyze ex-post defaults, both non-parametrically in Panel A and para-
metrically in Panel B. Panel A shows that the default rate of zombie firms increased toward
the end of the sample period, suggesting that (at least some) zombie firms were not able to
eventually avoid default despite their cheap debt financing. We test this default pattern by
estimating, in the subsample of low-quality firms, the following specification separately for
every year  :
                       Def aultit =  +  It × Zombieit + Xit + jct + it ,                                  (1)

and 0 otherwise and jct are industry-country-year fixed effects. The vector Xit includes

the uninteracted Zombie variable as well as other firm characteristics. The coefficient  ,
shown in Panel B of Figure 5, confirms that zombie firms default more than non-zombie
firms toward the end of our sample period.
    These figures suggest that zombie firms, as they obtained continued cheap debt financing,
underperformed other firms, including low-quality non-zombie firms. This ex-post evidence
validates our measure of zombie firms, suggesting that our measure does not capture tem-
porarily weak firms that are actually positive NPV projects for the lender.



5       Industry-Country Level Evidence
In this section, we test the model predictions at the industry-country ("market") level. In
Section 5.1, we document a robust negative correlation between the presence of zombie firms
and product inflation. In Section 5.2, we show that this correlation is not driven by lower
demand driving both zombie presence and inflation. In Section 5.3, we test the other model
predictions, namely the effect of the presence of zombie firms on markups, sales growth,
number of active firms, default and entry rates, productivity, and input costs.


5.1     Zombie Firms and Inflation

We start by providing non-parametric evidence on the correlation, across markets, between
the share of zombie firms and inflation, our main variable of interest. Figure 6 shows the
year-over-year CPI growth separately for markets with a high (above median) and low (below
median) growth of zombie firms over our sample period. Consistent with the rise of the
share of zombie firms in the aggregate starting in 2012, we see that beginning in mid-2012,
markets with a higher increase in the share of zombie firms experience a decline in CPI
growth compared with markets with a lower increase in zombies firms.8 The timing of the




    8
    In Figure B.1 in the appendix, we show that our aggregate measure of inflation, calculated from our
disaggregated market-level measure of inflation, closely tracks the official inflation for our sample countries.

Figure 6: Inflation Dynamics, Non-Parametric Evidence. This figure shows inflation (year-over-year
CPI growth) at monthly frequency for markets that experienced an above median (High Zombie) and below
median (Low Zombie) increase in the asset-weighted share of zombie firms between 2009 and 2014.


reversal of the inflation dynamics coincides with the adoption of extraordinary monetary
easing measures, including negative rates, by the ECB and other national central banks.
   Next, we estimate the following specification:


                       Yhjt =  × Share Zombieshjt-1 + ht + jt + µjh + hjt ,                      (2)


where the unit of observation is industry j , country h, and year t. Yhjt is the annual CPI
growth rate. Our key explanatory variable is the lagged (asset-weighted) share of zombie
firms in a particular market: Share Zombieshjt-1 . In the most conservative specification,
we control for industry-country, country-year, and industry-year fixed effects. Country-year
fixed effects absorb all shocks at the national level (e.g., changes in tax rates and national
regulations) that could affect firms' policies and performance. Industry-year fixed effects
absorb all shocks at the industry level (e.g., global demand shocks). Country-industry fixed
effects control for time-invariant industry-country characteristics.
   The estimation results in Table 2 confirm that markets that experience an increase in

Table 2: Inflation: Industry-Country Evidence. This table presents estimation results from specifi-
cation (2). The dependent variable is the annual CPI growth rate (inflation) from t to t + 1. Share Zombies
measures the asset-weighted share of zombie firms in a particular market at t. A firm is classified as zombie
if it is low-quality and paid advantageous interest rates (see Section 4.2 for more details). Standard errors
are clustered at the industry-country level and reported in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.


the share of zombie firms subsequently have lower CPI growth. The estimated coefficient is
remarkably stable as we add different layers of fixed effects. Based on the estimates in the
last column, moving from the 10th to the 90th percentile of the zombie share distribution (an
increase of 11 percentage points) is associated with a 0.23 percentage point lower inflation.
   A simple counterfactual exercise shows that these magnitudes are economically significant.
Suppose that the share of zombie firms remained at its 2012 level in each market. Using
our estimates, we can (i) calculate, for each market, what the CPI growth would have
been under this counterfactual scenario in the post-2012 period and (ii) aggregate these
counterfactual inflation rates across all markets, using the CPI industry weights. We present
the results in Figure 7, where the solid line is the observed inflation and the dashed line is
the counterfactual inflation. With the obvious caveats of a partial equilibrium exercise, our
estimates suggest that inflation would have been on average 0.45 percentage points higher if
the share of zombies stayed at its 2012 level.
   In Table 3, we present some examples of markets that experienced a large increase in the
share of zombie firms in the post-2012 period. Consider, for example, the manufacturing
industry in France, which saw a sharp increase in the share of zombie firms by 38.5%.9

Figure 7: Inflation Counterfactual. This figure shows the actual inflation rate in our sample and a
counterfactual inflation rate. The counterfactual inflation rate (at market-level) is measured as the inflation
rate that would have prevailed from 2012 to 2016, if the share of zombie firms had stayed at the 2012 in each
market. These values are aggregated across markets using actual weights for the aggregate CPI.

Table 3: Inflation Counterfactuals, Examples. This table presents examples for some industries that
saw a strong increase (Panel A) and decrease (Panel B) in the share of zombie firms after 2012. CPI growth
is the actual CPI growth between 2012 and 2016 for the respective industry-country pair. ShareZombie
is the increase in the asset-weighted share of zombie firms post-2012. We use the coefficient -0.021, taken
from the most restrictive specification in Table 2. The Effect is calculated as -0.021(Share Zombie). The
Counterfactual CPI growth shows what the inflation rate would have been without an increase in the share
of zombie firms.

Considering our estimates from Table 2, the CPI growth would have been 0.81 percentage
points higher than the observed CPI growth in this market if the share of zombie firms had
not increased post-2012.


5.2    Are Our Results Driven By Lower Demand?

We have documented, in the cross-section of markets, a negative correlation between the
presence of zombie firms and inflation. This correlation is consistent with the mechanism
outlined in Section 3: zombie credit allows some distressed firms to avoid default, increasing
the productive capacity in their market. This higher productive capacity puts, in turn,
a downward pressure on product prices. However, the negative correlation between the
presence of zombie firms and inflation is also consistent with lower product demand, which
might reduce inflation and increase the number of zombie firms.
   We address this potential omitted variable bias in two ways. First, in Table 4, we esti-
mate specification (2), where the dependent variable is sales growth. The estimation results
document a positive correlation, in the cross-section of markets, between the presence of
zombie firms and sales growth. This evidence is consistent with the zombie credit channel
and inconsistent with a demand channel as the latter would predict lower sales growth in
markets with high zombie prevalence.
   Second, we run an instrumental variable (IV) regression, where we focus on the zombie
lending incentives of weakly-capitalized banks as a predictor for the increase in the zombie
prevalence. Besides search-for-yield behavior and ultra accommodative central bank policies,
this zombie lending channel is identified in the literature as a main cause for the rise of zombie
credit (see, e.g., Banerjee and Hofmann, 2018 and Acharya et al., 2019).
   In particular, we instrument a market's share of zombie firms with the lagged average
capitalization (measured as Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets ratio) of the banks connected
to the firms in this market, weighted by the number of firm relationships. We denote this




and debt securities as a percentage of GDP amounts to 141%, which is among the highest levels in Europe.

Table 4: Sales Growth: Industry-Country Evidence. This table presents estimation results from
specification (2). The dependent variable is sales growth from t to t + 1. Share Zombies measures the
asset-weighted share of zombie firms in a particular market at t - 1. A firm is classified as zombie if it
is low-quality and paid advantageous interest rates (see Section 4.2 for more details). Standard errors are

instrument as Average Tier-1 Ratio. This instrument is based on the idea, introduced in Peek
and Rosengren (2005), that weakly-capitalized banks have an incentive to evergreen loans
to distressed borrowers.10 By extending loans at very low interest rates, these banks provide
their impaired borrowers with the liquidity necessary to meet payments on other outstanding
loans. Thereby, these banks avoid (or at least defer) realizing immediate loan losses in the
hope that the respective borrowers will eventually regain solvency. Schivardi et al. (2017),
Acharya et al. (2019), and Blattner et al. (2019) provide evidence for such zombie lending
behavior in Europe in the aftermath of the recent sovereign debt crisis. Figure 8 confirms this
conjecture by documenting a pronounced negative relationship between a market's Average
Tier-1 Ratio and its zombie share growth.
   Of course, banks' capitalization is closely linked to the performance of the industries
banks are exposed to. Specifically, a larger exposure to firms in sectors that experienced a
strong negative demand shock could result in larger loan losses and thus lower capital levels.
However, our analysis of data from the European Banking Authority's EU-wide stress tests
and capital exercises shows that banks' capitalization is to a large extent determined by the
value loss of their holdings of government bonds from stressed European countries during the




  10
    Given that European firms are heavily reliant on bank credit, this instrument is particularly relevant in
our setting.

recent sovereign debt crisis and not loan losses. In particular, the rank correlation between
the banks' pre-crisis (i.e., 2009) sovereign debt holdings from stressed countries and their
equity change between between 2009 and 2012 is -0.49 (linear correlation is -0.53).
    In our preferred IV specification, we determine the bank-firm relationships using both
Amadeus and DealScan (see Table 5, Column 1). As a robustness check, we redo our analysis
(i) using bank-firm relationships solely from Amadeus (Column 2) and (ii) using bank-firm
relationship from Dealscan in Italy (Amadeus does not contain bank-firm relationships for
Italy) and from Amadeus in other countries (Column 3).
    The first stage, shown in Panel B of Table 5, explains the share of zombie firms at time
t - 1 in a particular market (Share Zombies) using the market's Average Tier-1 Ratio at
t - 2, controlling for lagged market quality (i.e., its share of low-quality firms) as well as
stringent sets of fixed effects. The instrument always has a negative and significant effect on
Share Zombies. The F-statistic ranges between 13.9 and 14.6, while the p-value is always
below 0.01, confirming the strength of the instrument. In the second-stage estimation results,
shown in Panel A of Table 5, we replace the Share Zombies with the predicted Share Zombies
based on the first stage. The IV estimated coefficients confirm our results from Table 2,
suggesting a causal negative effect of a market's share of zombies on inflation.

Table 5: Instrumental Variable Estimation. This table presents the estimation results from the IV
specification. The dependent variable in the second stage is the annual CPI growth rate (inflation). Share
Zombies measures the asset-weighted share of zombie firms at t - 1. Average Tier-1 Ratio measures the
average tier-1 ratio of banks (weighted by the number of firm relationships) that are related to firms in an
industry-country at t - 1. Bank relationships are determined using Amadeus and DealScan in Column 1,
solely Amadeus in Column 2, and Amadeus and DealScan solely for Italian firms in Column 3. Standard
errors clustered at the industry-country level reported in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.


   The IV estimate of the inflation elasticity to the zombie share (-0.196) is about 9 times
larger than the OLS estimate (-0.021). The IV estimate corresponds to the change in inflation
due to changes in the zombie lending behavior of (weakly-capitalized) banks. The OLS
estimate, however, corresponds to a regression of inflation on the change in the zombie
share, induced by all zombie credit channels (e.g., zombie lending by banks, search-for-
yield behavior, and ultra accommodative central bank policies) and demand factors. When
these factors are uncorrelated, the variations in other zombie credit factors and demand
are equivalent to measurement error, and the OLS estimate is biased towards zero due to
standard attenuation bias. We can use the magnitude of the OLS bias to backout the
importance of the zombie lending channel relative to other zombie credit channels and the
demand channel (see, e.g., Paravisini et al., 2015). In our setting, the magnitude of the
attenuation bias increases with the fraction of the zombie share variation that is explained
by other factors than the zombie lending channel. Based on the classic measurement error

Table 6: Markups: Industry-Country Evidence. This table presents estimation results from specifica-
tion (2). The dependent variable is the turnover-weighted change in markups from t to t + 1. Share Zombies
measures the asset-weighted share of zombie firms in a particular market at t. A firm is classified as zombie
if it is low-quality and paid advantageous interest rates (see Section 4.2 for more details). Standard errors
are clustered at the industry-country level and reported in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

bias formula, /OLS = 1 + of /zl , where zl stands for zombie lending and of for other
factors, our estimates indicate that the zombie lending channel explains roughly 11% of the
total variation in the zombie share.


5.3       Further Model Predictions

In this section, using specification (2), we show that markets with a higher zombie prevalence
display lower firm markups, more active firms, lower default and entry rates, higher input
costs, and lower productivity compared with markets with a lower zombie prevalence.
   In Table 6, we show that higher zombie prevalence is associated with lower firm markup.
We measure firm markups following De Loecker and Warzynski (2012) and De Loecker and
Eeckhout (2019), i.e. we rely on optimal input demand conditions obtained from standard
cost minimization to determine markups for each firm.11 This approach has the advantage
that it only requires firms' financial statements information and no assumptions on demand
and how firms compete. Following De Loecker and Eeckhout (2019), we aggregate the
firm markups in the respective market using the firms' turnover as weight. The estimated
coefficients document lower markups in markets with a higher zombie share.

   In Table 7, we show that a higher zombie prevalence is associated with more active firms,
fewer firm defaults, and fewer firms entering a market. These variables are obtained from
Eurostat that releases official data at the industry-country level over time.12 The intuition
from our model is that a higher share of zombie firms in a market amounts to a higher
number of firms that would be more likely to default without zombie credit. The resulting
excess productive capacity reduces the product price and firm markups, making the market
less attractive for potential entrants.
   In Table 8, we show that a higher zombie prevalence is associated with higher input costs
and lower productivity. The excessive productive capacity in markets with high zombie
presence leads to a higher demand for labor and materials causing, in turn, higher material
and labor costs. Panel A shows a positive correlation between the presence of zombie firms
and material costs. Panel B shows that the correlation between the presence of zombie
firms and labor costs only exists for markets with a high job vacancy rate, where High
Vacancy is a dummy equal to one for industries with above median job vacancy rate. We use
the annual change in the Eurostat Labour Cost Index to measure the firms' labor costs.13
The insignificant coefficient for Share Zombie suggests that the higher average labor cost
for (some) zombie markets is indeed induced by a higher number of active firms and the
resulting competition for inputs. Panel C shows a negative correlation between the presence
of zombie firms and firms' average productivy, where the latter is measured as log(sales)­
2/3*log(employment)­1/3*log(fixed assets), following Caballero et al. (2008).
   In the macro literature, there is no conclusive evidence of a positive relationship between
cost inflation and price inflation, especially in recent years. In line with our mechanism,
Del Negro et al. (2020) explain the recent disconnect between inflation and real activity with
the recent muted reaction of prices to cost pressures. Taylor (2000) also document that




  12
     We can also calculate firm default rates from Amadeus. In Table 11, we show that we obtain similar
results on firm defaults if we rely on the Amadeus database to classify firms as defaulted.
  13
     This index is designed to capture the labor cost pressure. The job vacancy rate is also calculated from
Eurostat's job vacancy statistics and is defined as the number of job vacancies as a percentage of the sum
of the number of occupied posts and job vacancies. Importantly, the labor cost index is provided at less
granular industry classifications, which leads to a significant reduction in the number of observations.

the cost inflation-price inflation relationship weakened as many countries experienced lower
inflation since the nineties. A growing body of empirical literature documents this weakened
link, mostly focusing on labor costs. In the US, Peneva and Rudd (2017) and Daly and
Hobijn (2014) suggest that the recent relationship between wages and inflation is consistent
with an improved anchoring of inflation expectations and downward wage rigidity in a period
of low inflation, respectively. Bobeica et al. (2018) document this weakened relationship in
Germany, France, Italy, and Spain.
    In sum, consistent with the zombie credit channel, we find that markets that experience
an increase in the share of zombie firms subsequently have lower entry and exit rates, a larger
growth in the number of active firms, higher aggregate sales growth rates, higher average

Table 8: Input Costs and Productivity: Industry-Country Evidence. This table presents estima-
tion results from specification (2). The dependent variables are the industry material cost (material input
cost/turnover, Panel A), the industry labor cost (Eurostat's labor cost index, Panel B), and asset-weighted
productivity (log(sales)­2/3*log(employment)­1/3*log(fixed assets), Panel C). Share Zombies measures the
asset-weighted share of zombie firms in a particular market at t - 1. A firm is classified as zombie if it
is low-quality and paid advantageous interest rates (see Section 4.2 for more details). Standard errors are
clustered at the industry-country level and reported in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1


input costs, lower average productivity, lower average markups, and lower CPI growth.
   The observed negative correlation, across markets, between the zombie share and inflation
is also consistent with a cost channel (Barth III and Ramey, 2001) and a liquidity squeeze
channel (Chevalier and Scharfstein, 1996). The cost channel suggests that the glut of cheap
debt decreased the financial expenses of zombie firms, which gave them more wiggle room to
cut output prices. The liquidity squeeze channel suggests that low-quality zombie firms have
an incentive to raise prices to increase their current cash flows, while zombie firms do not have

the necessity to react this way due to their access to cheap credit. However, the cost channel
and the liquidity squeeze channel cannot explain the negative correlation between the zombie
share and (i) firm default, (ii) firm entry rates, and (iii) firm productivity, nor the positive
correlation with aggregate sales growth and input costs. Moreover, the cost channel cannot
explain the negative correlation between between the zombie share and average markups.
Hence, while these channels might have contributed to the dis-inflationary trend they are
likely not the sole driver for the observed low inflation level in zombie markets.
    The evidence presented in Table 8 suggests that the effect of the zombie credit channel
on inflation likely constitutes a lower bound. In particular, since markets that experienced
a zombie share increase have lower average productivity and higher average input costs,
their production cost level is pushed upwards. Hence, without a change in markups, this
costs push would increase prices. The observed inflation reduction for zombie industries
thus implies that the excess production capacity induced the firms in these markets to lower
markups to such an extent that it overcompensated the production costs increase.



6      Firm-Level Analysis
In this section, we take advantage of our detailed firm-level data to test a unique prediction
of the zombie credit channel, namely the existence of spillover effects on non-zombie firms
active in markets with high zombie prevalence.
    According to the zombie credit channel, a rise of zombie credit leads to a higher number
of active firms and excess productive capacity. This excessive productive capacity leads to a
sales decrease for individual non-zombie firms as more firms have to share a given demand
level.14 Non-zombie firms also face higher input prices due to an increased number of active
firms that compete for a limited amount of resources.
    In sum, for non-zombie firms in zombie markets, the zombie credit channel predicts lower




  14
    Recall that, at the industry-country level, the zombie credit channel predicts a slight increase in aggregate
sales for zombie industries due to the downward adjusted output prices and the resulting slightly higher
aggregate demand. Table 6, Panel B confirms this prediction.

sales growth, lower markups, and higher input costs compared with individual non-zombie
firms in non-zombie markets. Following Caballero et al. (2008), we test this prediction by
estimating the following regression at the firm-year level:


      Yihjt = 1 × N on - Zombieihjt + 2 × N on - Zombieihjt × ShareZombieshjt-1

             + hjt + ihjt ,                                                                                (3)


where i is a firm, h is a country, j is a industry, and t is a year. Our dependent variables
are firm markup, sales growth, material cost, and EBIT/Sales. We include industry-country-
year fixed effects to absorb country-industry specific shocks. Our coefficient of interest is 2 ,
that is, whether non-zombie firms that operate in markets with a high share of zombie firms
perform differently than non-zombie firms in markets with a lower share of zombie firms.
    The first column of Table 9 shows that non-zombie firms in markets with a low zombie
prevalence have higher markups than zombie firms in the same market. However, consistent
with our results at the industry-country level, markups of non-zombie firms tend to be lower
the higher the share of zombie firms active in the same market. In the second column of the

with a large zombie share increase. The results in the third column confirm that non-zombie

firms in non-zombie industries) indeed pay higher material costs.15
    Finally, the results in the last column Table 9 suggests that there might be a zombie
contagion from zombie to non-zombie firms in markets with a strong rise in zombie credit.
That is, good firms in zombie markets not only suffer because they have lower individual
sales growth due to the higher number of firms, but also because their profitability drops
due to the excess capacity-induced fiercer competition in these markets. As a result, initially
good non-zombie firms can turn into zombies over time due to a high prevalence of other
zombies in their markets.



7        Robustness
This section provides several robustness tests. In Section 7.1, we use alternative zombie firm
classifications. In Section 7.2, we redo our default rate tests employing a different data set.
In Section 7.3, we conduct a placebo test for our firm-level analysis.


7.1       Alternative Zombie Classifications

To ensure the robustness of our results with respect to the zombie classification, we use
various alternative zombie definitions and redo our analysis from Table 2.
    First, we calculate median values for leverage and the interest coverage ratio at the
industry-year level instead of the industry-country-year level. Second, we consider solely
the interest coverage ratio criterion instead of both the interest coverage ratio and leverage
to define a firm as low-quality. Third, we use solely the leverage criterion to define a firm
as low-quality. Figure 9 shows that these alternative classifications yield a similar time-
series pattern for the (increasing) share of zombie firms. Table 10 shows that our results
on the effect of a rise in zombie credit on inflation are robust to using alternative zombie
classifications.

       We only observe a very noisy measure of labor costs at the firm level.

The Eurostat data used in Table 7 to analyse the effect on an increase in the share of zombie
firms on exit rates does not distinguish between different types of exit (i.e., insolvency or
dissolved for other reasons).
    Hence, as a robustness check, we redo this analysis using the legal status variable from
Amadeus. In particular, to identify default events for our sample firms we flag firms that

we show that we obtain similar results on the effect of a rise of zombie credit on firm defaults
if we rely on the Amadeus default data.


7.3     Firm-Level Robustness

Finally, we conduct a placebo test for the firm level results presented in Section 5. In
particular, instead of employing the share of zombie firms as the main variable of interest,
we use the share of low-quality firms; thus, muting the advantageous interest rate criterion.
    The results presented in Table 12 show that the spillover effects on non-zombie firms do
not occur per se when the share of low-quality firms increases in a market. This evidence
suggests that the contagion to non-zombie firms is indeed caused by an increase in the share

ments)", "Active (insolvency proceedings)", "Active (rescue plan)", "Bankruptcy", "Dissolved (bankruptcy)",
"Dissolved (liquidation)", or "In liquidation".

of actual zombie firms, that is, low-quality firms receiving subsidized credit.
    Moreover, these results provide further evidence that the negative correlation between
the rise of zombie credit and inflation is not linked per se to a deteriorating average firm
performance in a specific market (e.g., due to a drop in demand). These impaired firms need
to have been kept alive by readily available cheap credit, inducing a drop in default rates, to
cause downward pressure on inflation.



8     Conclusion
The low-growth low-inflation environment that prevails in Europe after its sovereign debt
crisis bears a striking resemblance to Japan's "lost decades" in the aftermath of its crisis in
the early 1990s. Similar to the Bank of Japan's crisis response, the European central banks
followed canonical demand-side theory and lowered interest rates, as well as, implemented
massive quantitative easing programs to encourage more investment and consumption, hop-
ing that this will lead to a surge in inflation. However, despite a significant drop in firm
funding costs, inflation did not pick up as expected, which became known as Europe's "miss-
ing inflation puzzle" (see, e.g., Constâncio, 2015).
    In this paper, we propose a novel supply-side channel that shows that policy measures
that make cheap debt financing readily available to impaired firms have a disinflationary
side effect, thereby providing an explanation for the persistent low inflation rates in Europe.

Accommodative policy measures reduce financial pressure and thereby fuel the survival of
weak firms with unsustainable business models. As these zombie firms proliferate, aggre-
gate supply increases compared to the case where the business cycle runs its normal course.
The resulting excess capacity puts downward pressure on producer prices, and, ultimately,
depresses inflation levels.
    We test this zombie credit channel using a new inflation and firm level data set that covers
1.1 million firms in 12 European countries across 65 industries. We show that industries that
experienced a stronger rise of zombie firms subsequently experienced fewer firm defaults,
lower average firm markups, product prices, and productivity, an increase in aggregate sales,
as well as, material and labor costs, and a lower inflation level.
    These results draw attention to the often-neglected impact of supply-side financial fric-
tions on inflation. Specifically, our findings highlight that while monetary and macropruden-
tial policies are important to achieve macroeconomic and financial stability, closely monitor-
ing their interaction with financial frictions at the micro-level and teasing out their precise
transmission to the real economy are equally important. Otherwise, financial frictions can
lead to unintended macroeconomic consequences of accommodative policies and work pre-
cisely against the policies' stated and assumed objectives of generating inflation and growth.
    For accommodative monetary policy to be effective in times of a weakening financial
sector, it should thus be accompanied by a targeted financial sector recapitalization program.

                                                      32

A prime example for such a targeted recapitalisation was in the United States (US), where
the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the effective stress test of banks in the form
of Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) followed the failure of Lehman Brothers
and coincided with the extraordinary easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. The
targeted recapitalization of the financial sector contributed to a faster recovery of the US
economy. Indeed, after a brief deflationary period, the US inflation rate climbed back to
around 2% in early 2010. Conversely, except for a few brief periods, the inflation rate in
Japan has been close to zero since the mid-1990s. Similarly, the euro area inflation rate has
been declining since the start of the loose monetary policy in 2012 and has remained below
1% in the period from 2014 to 2017.
   Moreover, our results suggest that, at least for European countries that still have free
sovereign debt capacity, a more expansive fiscal policy could potentially be an effective tool
to raise inflation, since the resulting positive demand shock would absorb at least part of
the zombie-induced excess capacity. Studying such interactions of fiscal and monetary policy
tools is an important area for future research.

Appendix A Model
In this appendix, we develop a simple dynamic model to analyze the relationship between
zombie credit and inflation. We define an equilibrium with and without zombie credit and
then compare equilibrium quantities and prices. The model adds imperfect competition
among firms to a framework similar to Caballero et al. (2008). The reader is referred to the
online appendix for formal derivations and proofs.


A.1     Setup

Time is discrete and the economy is populated by a large, but finite number of firms that
produce a single good. Firms are identical in size and can be incumbent or potential entrants.
At each date t, there are mt incumbent firms and e potential entrant firms.
   The problem of firms at each date t is as follows. First, firms (incumbents and potential
entrants) pay a cost I to set up their capacity that allows them to draw their production yit
from a uniform distribution yit  U [0, 1]. Second, incumbent firms simultaneously set prices.
Third, firms learn the realization of their production yit leading to profits (pt - c)yit - I ,
where c is the marginal cost. Depending on the realization of their production, potential
entrant firms might enter the market and incumbent firms might default. A firm that makes
negative profits is forced to default.
   There is an exogenous demand Dt (pt ) = t - pt , where pt is the average price set by
incumbent firms. This aggregate demand is satiated starting with the production of the firm
that sets the lowest price.17


Lemma 1. Firms choose pit = pt , where

                                                        mt
                                            pt = t -                                              (A1)
                                                        2




  17
                 
   Given pt = i pit /mit , this allocation rule resembles a limit order book used in stock exchanges. If
multiple firms set the same lowest price, the demand is split evenly among them.


                                                  36

Proof. Suppose mt identical firms set prices simultaneously at t before the realization of the production
parameter in a single shot game. The marginal cost of production is c. There is only one good and the
demand is D(pt ) = t - pt , where t  2
                                     1
                                       (mt + 1) + c. The expected production is E(yit ) = 2
                                                                                          1
                                                                                            . This problem
is similar to a Bertrand price-setting model with an exogenous capacity constraint equal to the expected
production. We claim that pit = pt = t - 2 . Given the one shot nature of the game, we can ignore the time

                                                                   1
demand given that other firms cannot produce more than             2   in expectation. Firm i optimally deviates from
pi = p-i > p because it can undercut slightly the price and expect to sell its entire expected production.
Firm i optimally deviates from pi < p-i because it can get a higher price on the residual demand.


    Firms set prices knowing that their expected production is 1/2. In the unique equilibrium,
the price pt set by incumbents firms is such that the total expected production equals demand
at the price pt . It is not optimal for firm i to lower its price as it will end up selling at a lower
price its entire expected production. It is also not optimal for firm i to increase its price as
it can increase profit by increasing the expected quantity sold.18 Because of the production
constraint, firms charge a positive markup (pt - c)/c.19
    After the price is set, firms learn the realization of their production. An incumbent firm
that generates negative profits is forced to default. Hence, the mass of defaulting firms Dt
and the mass of surviving incumbent firms St are:

                               I                                             1                 (               )

                                                                            I

  18
      If t is large enough, the marginal revenue is greater than the marginal cost, that is, the firm can increase
its profit by lowering the price and, in turn, increasing the quantity produced.
   19
      The price pt is determined in terms of cost as the numeraire. In our environment, we implicitly assume
a form of rigidity on the cost side.

A.2    Equilibrium

In this section, we define an equilibrium with and an equilibrium without zombie credit.

Definition 1. Given the demand parameter , setup cost I , marginal cost c, an equilibrium
without zombie credit (EqN) is price pt , incumbents mt , production Nt such that the product
price is given by Eq. (A1), total production equals the sum of production by surviving
incumbent and entrant firms according to Eq. (A2), and the number of incumbent follows
mt+1 = Nt .

   The equilibrium without zombie credit (EqN) is governed by three conditions. First, the
price of the good follows Lemma 1. Second, total production is the sum of the production
of firms that enter the market and production of incumbent firms that survive. Third, the
incumbent firms at t + 1 are the sum of entrants and surviving incumbent firms at t.
   In the steady state equilibrium, the number of incumbent firms is constant (mt+1 = Nt =
m) and defaults are exactly offset by entry:
                                          (       )
                                     mI        I
                                        =e 1-
                                    p-c       p-c

   The equilibrium with zombie credit (EqZ) is characterized by an exogenous number of
firms S that survive each period, leading to a total production of
                                         (                 )
                                                     I
                                   Nt = e 1 -                  +S                       (A3)
                                                  pt - c

Following Caballero et al. (2008), the idea is that favourable funding conditions might keep
some firms alive that otherwise would default. Formally, the definition of EqZ is as follows:

Definition 2. Given the demand parameter , setup cost I , marginal cost c, and survivors
S , an equilibrium with zombie credit (EqZ) is price pt , incumbents mt , production Nt such

                                                38

                  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3562737
that the product price is given by Eq. (A1), total production equals the sum of production by
surviving incumbent and entrant firms according to Eq. (A3), defaults are such that surviving
firms are S , and the number of incumbent follow mt+1 = Nt .


   The equilibrium with zombie credit is characterized by four conditions. First, the price
of the good follows Lemma 1. Second, total production is the sum of the production of
firms that enter the market and production of the, now exogenously set, incumbent firms
that survive. Third, defaults are such that surviving firms are constant at S . Fourth, the
incumbent firms at t + 1 are the sum of entrants and surviving incumbent firms at t.


A.3     Macroeconomic Effects of Zombie Credit

We analyze the effects of zombie credit by comparing the equilibrium without zombie credit
and the equilibrium with zombie credit following a negative demand shock, captured by a
permanent decrease in .20 More specifically, we consider the case where EqN and EqZ are,
before the shock, identical in a steady state equilibrium (the number of survivors S in EqZ is
set equal to the number of survivors in EqN). Figure A.1 shows this comparison, where the
solid lines correspond to EqN and the dashed lines correspond to EqZ. In both equilibrium
concepts, the negative demand shock causes a contemporaneous collapse in prices. The
adjustment to the new steady state depends on the type of equilibrium.
   In EqN, the collapse in price leads to a contemporaneous decrease in entries and increase
in defaults. One period after the shock, the lower number of active firms causes the price
to rebound (higher productive capacity), which induces more firms to enter the market and
fewer incumbent firms to default. Two periods after the shock, the now higher number
of incumbent firms leads to a reduction in price and, in turn, an increase in defaults and
a decrease in entries. This adjustment continues until the economy reaches the new EqN
steady state where the price, defaults, and entry are lower and there are fewer incumbent




  20
   In Figure A.2, we show that the intuition of the model holds when we compare the equilibrium without
zombie credit and the equilibrium with zombie credit following a temporary demand shock.

firms compared with the pre-shock steady state.
   In EqZ, the collapse in price also induces a contemporaneous decrease in entries but
defaults are held constant so as to keep the number of surviving firms also constant. This
lack of adjustment through defaults causes the number of incumbent firms to go down less
than in EqN one period after the shock. The price rebound also leads to an increase in
entries, but this adjustment is muted compared to EqN. The lower number of incumbent
firms causes a reduction in defaults in order to keep the number of survivors constant. Two
periods after the shock, the number of incumbent firms is lower than in the previous period
but higher than in EqN. This adjustment continues until the economy reaches the new steady
state. Compared with the EqN steady state, the price, entry, and defaults are lower and
there are more incumbent firms. More formally:


Proposition 1. In the equilibrium with zombie credit, in steady state, fewer firms default,
there are more incumbent firms, the price and markup are lower, and fewer firms enter
compared with the steady state in an equilibrium with no zombie credit.

p( )  p( ), it follows that S  m( ) 1 - p(I
                                           )-c . But it is easy to show that S > m( )
                                                                                      
                                                                                          1 - p(I
                                                                                                 )-c .


Hence, the contradiction. It follows that m( ) < m( ) and p( ) > p( ). It also trivially follows that
entry, defaults, and markups are lower in EqZ compared with EqN.


   In the equilibrium with zombie credit, some firms that would default in the equilibrium
without zombie credit are kept alive preventing a downward adjustment in the number of
active firms and, in turn, causing a reduction in price. Let p(, E (), S ()) be the steady
state price, expressed as a function of . Note that the price functions are different in EqN
and EqZ. Differentiating with respect to  yields:

                              dp   p   p E                         p S
                                 =   +     +
                              d        E                           S 
                                                                  = 0 in EqZ


Demand affects the price in three ways. First, the direct effect: a lower demand reduces the
price in equilibrium. Second, a lower demand reduces firm entry, causing an increase in price.
Third, a lower demand induces more firms to default, which leads to an increase in price.
This third effect disappears in EqZ, where the number of surviving firms is not affected by
the change in demand.


A.4       Effect on Input Costs

In a variation of the baseline model, we show in this section that input costs are higher in
the equilibrium with zombie credit compared with the equilibrium without zombie credit.
   The differences with the baseline model environment are as follows. First, the product
price is now exogenous. Second, there is an exogenous supply of input Lt = ct - µt , where

ct is the price of input and marginal cost for each firm i. Third, after paying the setup cost
I , firms set the price ct of the input, knowing that their expected production is 1/2. In this
environment, the two equilibrium definitions take the product price as given and display the
                                                                    mt

follows the intuition from Lemma 1. Firms set the marginal cost of input ct such that the
total demand for the input equals its supply at the price ct .
   Similar to Section A.3, we can analyze the effect of a permanent decrease in the (now
exogenous) product price on the (now endogenous) marginal cost. In the equilibrium with-
out zombie credit, the negative demand shock reduces total production as the lower price
reduces entry and increases exit. In the next period, the lower number of incumbent firms
reduces the input price, causing an increase in entry and a decrease in exit. The resulting
production increase causes a rebound in the number of incumbent firms in the next period.
This adjustment continues until the economy reaches the new steady state with a lower num-
ber of active firms and lower input costs. Again, this adjustment is muted in the equilibrium
with zombie credit.

Appendix C               Markup Estimation
To obtain firm-level markups, we follow the procedure proposed by De Loecker and Warzynski
(2012), which relies on the insight that the output elasticity of a variable production factor
is only equal to its expenditure share in total revenue when price equals marginal cost of
production. Under any form of imperfect competition, however, the relevant markup drives
a wedge between the input's revenue share and its output elasticity.
   In particular, this approach relies on standard cost minimization conditions for variable
input factors free of adjustment costs. To obtain output elasticities, a production function
has to be estimated. A major challenge is a potential simultaneity bias since the output may
be determined by productivity shocks, which might be correlated with a firm's input choice.
   To correct the markup estimates for unobserved productivity shocks, De Loecker and
Warzynski (2012) follow the control function or proxy approach, developed by Ackerberg
et al. (2006), based on Olley and Pakes (1996) and Levinsohn and Petrin (2003). This
approach requires a production function with a scalar Hicks-neutral productivity term (i.e.,
changes in productivity do not affect the proportion of factor inputs) and that firms can be
pooled together by time-invariant common production technology at the country-industry
level.
   Hence, we consider the case where in each period t, firm i minimizes the contemporaneous
production costs given the following production function:


                                     Qit = Qit (it , Vit , Kit ),                        (C1)


where Qit is the output quantity produced by technology Qit (·), Vit the variable input factor,
Kit the capital stock (treated as a dynamic input in production), and it the firm-specific
Hicks-neutral productivity term. Following De Loecker and Eeckhout (2019), we assume
that within a year the variable input can be adjusted without frictions, while adjusting the
capital stock involves frictions.
   As we assume that producers are cost minimizing, we are thus are left with the following

Lagrangian function:


                  L(Vit , Kit , it ) = Pit
                                         V
                                           + Vit + rit Kit + Fit - it (Q(·) - Qit ),         (C2)


where P V is the price of the variable input, r is the user cost of capital, Fit is the fixed cost,
and it is the Lagrange multiplier. The first order condition with respect to the variable
input V is thus given by:
                                      Lit            Q(·)
                                              V
                                          = Pit - it      = 0.                               (C3)
                                     Vit             Vit
Multiplying all terms by Vit /Qit , and rearranging terms yields an expression for input V 's
output elasticity:
                                          Q(·) Vit       V
                                                     1 Pit Vit
                                    v
                                    it             =           .                             (C4)
                                          Vit Qit    it Qit
As the Lagrange multiplier  is the value of the objective function as we relax the output
constraints, it is a direct measure of the marginal costs. We thus define the markup as
µ = P/, where P is the price for the output good, which depends on the extent of market
power.
   Substituting marginal costs for the markup/price ratio, we obtain a simple expression for
the markup:
                                                 v    Pit Qit
                                           µit = it     V
                                                              .                              (C5)
                                                      Pit Vit
Hence, there are two ingredients needed to estimate the markup of firm i: its expenditure
                                        V
share of the variable input, Pit Qit /Pit Vit , which is readily observable in the date, and its
                                         v
output elasticity of the variable input, it .
   To obtain an estimate of the output elasticity of the variable input of production, we
estimate a parametric production function for each industry (at the two digits NACE level).

   For a given industry h in country j , we consider the translog production function (TLPF):21

                                                     2        2
                         qit = v1 vit + k1 kit + v2 vit + k2 kit + it + it .                        (C6)


where lower cases denote logs.22 In particular, qit is the log of the realized firm's output (i.e.,
deflated turnover), vit the log of the variable input factor (i.e., cost of goods sold and other
operational expenditures), kit the log of the capital stock (i.e., tangible assets), i = ln(i ),
and it is the unanticipated shock to output. Moreover, we follow best practice and deflate
these variables with the relevant industry-country specific deflator.
   We follow the literature and control for the simultaneity and selection bias, inherently
present in the estimation of Eq. (C6), and rely on a control function approach, paired with
a law of motion for productivity, to estimate the output elasticity of the variable input.
   This method relies on a so-called two-stage approach. In the first stage, the estimates of
the expected output (it ) and the unanticipated shocks to output (it ) are purged using a
non-parametric projection of output on the inputs and the control variable:


                                        qit = it (vit , kit ) + it .                                (C7)


The second stage provides estimates for all production function coefficients by relying on the
law of motion for productivity:
                                         it = gt (it-1 ) + it .                                     (C8)

We can compute productivity for any value of  , where  = (v1 , k1 , v2 , k2 ), using it ( ) =
                       2        2

     The TLPF is a common technology specification that includes higher order terms that is more flexible
than, e.g., a Cobb-Douglas production function. The departure from the standard Cobb-Douglas production
function is important for our purpose. If we were to restrict the output elasticities to be independent of
input use intensity when analyzing how markup differs across firms, we would be attributing variation in
technology to variation in markups, and potentially bias our results. (e.g., when comparing zombie vs
non-zombie firms).

     We follow De Loecker and Eeckhout (2019) and do not consider the interaction term between v and
k to minimize the potential impact of measurement error in capital to contaminate the parameter of most
interest, i.e., the output elasticity.

   By nonparametrically regressing it ( ) on its lag, it-1 ( ), we recover the innovation to
productivity given  , it ( ).
   This gives rise to the following moment conditions, which allow us to obtain estimates of
the production function parameters:
                                                     
                                           v

where we use standard GMM techniques to obtain the estimates of the production function
and rely on block bootstrapping for the standard errors. These moment conditions exploit
the fact that the capital stock is assumed to be decided a period ahead and thus should
not be correlated with the innovation in productivity. We rely on the lagged variable input
to identify the coefficients on the current variable input since the current variable input is
expected to react to shocks to productivity.
   The estimated output elasticities are computed using the estimated coefficients of the
production function:
                                      v
                                      it = v1 + 2v2 vit ,                               (C10)

which allows us to calculate the markup of firm i.
