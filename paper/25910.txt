This paper estimates an augmented measure of national output inclusive of environmental
pollution damage in the United States economy over a 60-year period. The paper reports two
primary findings. First, air pollution intensity declined precipitously from the 1950s to the
modern era. Air pollution damage comprised roughly 30 percent of output in the post WWII
economy, declining to under 10 percent in 2016. Second, accounting for pollution damage
significantly affects growth rates. Prior to the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970, GDP
outpaced Environmentally-Adjusted Value Added (EVA), defined as GDP less air pollution
damage. Following passage of the Act, EVA grew more rapidly than GDP. Macroeconomic and
environmental policies, as well as the business cycle, appreciably affect damages and EVA
growth.

   I.      Introduction.

Among the fundamental advances in the field of economics during the 20th century was the

invention and deployment of the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs). Importantly,

for nearly as long as the NIPAs have existed, economists have known that the accounts are

incomplete. Excluded are phenomena beyond the market boundary. Principal among these are

leisure time, home production, and the environment (Nordhaus and Tobin, 1972).


This paper zeros in on the last category of omissions: environmental services. Efforts to

encompass this dimension, often referred to as environmental accounting, augment the NIPAs by

encompassing the value of natural resources in situ and the monetary costs due to environmental

damage (NAS NRC, 1999; Abraham and Mackie, 2006; Nordhaus, 2006; Muller, Mendelsohn,

Nordhaus, 2011). When appropriately coupled with the NIPAs, environmental accounts provide

a more comprehensive measure of the condition of an economic system.


Within the broad environmental accounting context, this analysis focuses on air pollution

damage. Prior research demonstrates that, in the cross-section, or over short time periods,

accounting for pollution damage appreciably affects estimates of the level of output and growth

(Bartelmus, 2009; Muller, Mendelsohn, Nordhaus, 2011; Muller, 2014). In contrast to extant

research, this analysis reports pollution damage from the middle of the 20th century to the present

day. This long run perspective enables an assessment of the implications of relying on market

indices for inferences about the growth and development of the U.S. economy. Further, both

neoclassical economic growth models and macro-environmental impact models implicitly make

the case for long-run analyses. Neoclassical models argue that long run growth depends critically

on the capital stock, population growth, and technological change (Solow, 1956; Baumol, 1986;

Romer, 1990). Macro characterizations of environmental impact tend to emphasize the

                                                 2
importance of population size, income (because this influences the energy intensity of production

and consumption) and technology (Ehrlich and Holdren, 1971; Chertow, 2001). These two

classes of models motivate studying environmental accounts over a long time period in the

following sense. Both income and population in an economic system tend not to change

drastically over short time periods: say, less than five years. Growth in the capital stock (either

widening or deepening) does not occur rapidly. Further, fundamental technological advances

occur in fits and starts. The penetration of fundamental innovations into various economic

sectors and household often takes years (Gordon, 2016). Hence, long time horizons are often

required to study changes in environmental impact and growth. In addition, the data used herein

show that fine particulate matter concentrations fell from an average of over 50 ug/m3 in 1957 to

under 10 ug/m3 in 2016.


Historical data is used herein to develop a 61-year series of Gross External Damage (GED),

(Muller, Mendelsohn, and Nordhaus, 2011; Muller, 2014), a macroeconomic environmental

indicator, encompassing air pollution emissions from all sectors in the United States (U.S.)

economy. This dimension of environmental accounting (as opposed to, say, water pollution)

features excellent data availability and the potential to appreciably affect estimates of

comprehensive consumption (NAS NRC, 1999; Muller, 2013; 2014).


To estimate air pollution damage over this 61-year time horizon, several sources of pollution

data are used. From 1980 to 2016, annual average fine particulate matter (PM2.5) estimates

provided by Meng et al., (2019) are used. These data are resolved at 1o latitude-longitude grid-

cells and they provide universal coverage of the contiguous U.S. In contrast, United States

Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) monitors for PM2.5 have only been operational since

1999. The monitors provide only sparse spatial coverage. The agreement between the satellite

                                                  3
data and monitor readings between 1999 and 2016 is quite strong (see figure A.1). From 1979

back to 1957, the data are drawn from historical monitoring sites (Clay et al., 2019). Specifically,

the early network of monitors measured total suspended particulates (TSP). The analysis uses

regression models to calculate PM2.5 (which is a subset of TSP) levels from the TSP readings.

The spatial extent of this network was quite thin. As such from 1957 to 1980, the paper only

reports national results. When spliced together with the satellite data the analysis obtains a

continuous time series from 1957 to 2016 consisting of national scale, annual average PM2.5.


The prior environmental accounting literature suggests that the total, or gross, damage is the

product of emissions and marginal damage (Nordhaus, 2006; Muller, Mendelsohn, Nordhaus,

2011). This is conceptually consistent with how GDP is measured: prices of products are

multiplied times the quantity produced to compute total value. Because of data and modeling

limitations, this analysis computes damages in a slightly different fashion. Consider ambient

pollution estimates in a given location, say, Pennsylvania, and year, perhaps 1992. The paper

computes consequences from exposure to pollution levels in Pennsylvania in 1992 using

population counts, mortality rates, and estimated PM2.5. Intuitively, PM2.5 levels are the sum of

contributions from a multitude of sources distributed across space, upwind from said locality.

Note that this approach attributes damages to the location of exposure, not the location of

emissions. The parallel with the NIPAs is the following: while GDP values production and

allocates value to the location of output, measures such as personal consumption expenditure

(PCE) ascribe value to where consumption of goods and services occurs. The former tracks with

valuation of pollution emissions. The latter is analogous to valuing damage from exposure.


At an aggregate, national scale, the difference between valuing emissions and valuing

concentrations should be negligible. However, for sub-national accounting (which this analysis

                                                  4
executes for 1980 to 2016) the appropriate treatment of monetary damages computed from

exposure in this way is a deduction from (market) consumption within the jurisdiction where

exposure occurs (Muller, Matthews, Wiltshire-Gordon, 2017; Jha, Matthews, Muller, 2019).

That is, without the ability to attribute concentrations, exposures, and damages spatially to

specific sources, industries, or sectors, the integration with the NIPAs occurs through

consumption expenditures. It would be an inappropriate conflation to deduct exposure-based

GED in a particular jurisdiction from emitting sources in that jurisdiction because of the natural

flows of pollution in the natural environment. Emissions cross geo-political lines.


Given these considerations, pollution costs are deducted from the market accounts (Abraham and

Mackie, 2006; Nordhaus, 2006; Muller, Mendelsohn, Nordhaus, 2011; Muller, 2014).

Nationally, the GED are deducted from GDP for the full 61-year time series. For the state level

analysis (from 1980 to 2016), the GED are subtracted from PCE. Year-over-year growth is

calculated in the GDP-GED measure and this is compared to GDP growth. For the state level

analysis, growth is estimated in PCE-GED and this is benchmarked against PCE growth on an

annual basis.


Prior research has shown that air pollution damage is primarily composed of premature mortality

risk (USEPA, 1999; 2011; Muller and Mendelsohn, 2007; Muller, Mendelsohn, Nordhaus,

2011). Hence, human exposure is a key determinant of damage. Because of this, and recognizing

data limitations due to the historical context 1, the present paper focuses only on mortality risks

due to exposure to PM2.5. Equipped with ambient concentration estimates, the analysis uses

standard damage-function techniques to translate PM2.5 exposure into monetary damage. Peer-

    For example, obtaining incidence rates for illnesses may not be possible for early years in the sample.

reviewed adult mortality concentration-response functions (Krewski et al., 2009) link exposure

to mortality risk. The Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) approach then translates mortality risk

into monetary units (Viscusi and Aldy, 2003).


The application of standard damage function techniques to historic data generates concerns in

two areas. First, utilizing results from epidemiological studies conducted in the modern era to

exposures in the middle of the 20th century introduces considerable uncertainty into the empirical

damage estimates reported herein. However, the earliest cohort from the Harvard Six Cities

study included exposures as early as 1974 (Laden et. al., 2006). Hence, any issues associated

with inappropriate extrapolation of the epidemiological results likely manifests in the earliest

years of the 61-year timeframe explored here; exposure levels were apparently starkly higher

than in the modern era.


Second, most estimates of the VSL are derived from labor market data or contingent valuation

surveys results from the last, say, 40 years. This motivates a search of the literature for VSL

estimates from the middle of the 20th century. Costa and Kahn (2004) provide such estimates.

Specifically, Costa and Kahn (2004) report decadal VSLs derived from labor market data from

1940 to 1980. From 1980 forward to 2016, the paper couples the US Bureau of Economic

Analysis’ real personal income series, with VSL-income elasticities reported in the literature, and

the USEPA’s default VSL (Costa, Kahn, 2004; Hammitt, Robinson, 2011; USEPA, 2011).

Figure A.3 in the appendix displays the VSLs from 1957 to 2016.


Results are organized into three areas: national scale findings spanning the full 1957 to 2016

time series, state results from 1980 to 2016, and output from a series of regression analyses

conducted on the 1980 to 2016 state-level series that explores determinants of growth. The


                                                 6
national analysis indicates that during the late 1950s and early 1960s, pollution damages

comprised a staggering share of national output. The GED amount to between roughly 30 and 40

percent of GDP. The GED-to-GDP ratio falls to just under 10 percent of GDP in 2016. From

1957 to 2016, the GDP-GED metric grew roughly one-half of a percentage point more rapidly

than GDP. Prior to passage of the Clean Air Act and other landmark environmental policies in

the early 1970’s, growth in GDP exceeded that of the augmented measure. From 1970 onward,

the augmented measure outpaced GDP. A series of descriptive regressions argue that the

business cycle is a critical factor in determining the difference in pollution-adjusted versus GDP

growth. Finally, Title I of the Clean Air Act significantly attenuated GED and boosted pollution-

adjusted growth.


The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section II presents a conceptual framework

based on the NIPAs for the deduction of environmental pollution damage from the market

accounts. Section III focuses on methods and data sources. Section IV. reports the results and V.

concludes.


   II.       Conceptual Model.


This section uses a national income accounting framework to explore differences in growth

characterized by the market accounts and accounts augmented with environmental pollution

damage and expenditures on pollution removal. The modeling begins with a pre-policy economy

with zero abatement to reflect the historical focus of the paper. The model then incorporates

investment in pollution control. The key results from the conceptual modeling section are as

follows. First, in the pre-policy economy, mismeasurement of growth depends only on the

trajectory of damage. Falling damages boosts growth, while rising damages dampens growth in


                                                 7
the augmented index. There is no mismeasurement of growth when damages change at the same

rate as market consumption. Second, with pollution policy, the intertemporal changes in

abatement and damage together determine the difference in market and augmented growth. Both

damages and investments in abatement place a drag on consumption growth. As such, the

sensitivity of pollution damage to abatement is the key in determining whether augmented

consumption grows more or less rapidly than the market accounts.


Market output, or GDP, denoted (𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 ) is expressed in terms of the standard accounting identity

as shown in (1).


𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 = 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 + 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 + 𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡 + 𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡                                                                          (1)


where:
           Ct = consumption of market goods during time (t).
           𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 = 𝐾𝐾𝑡𝑡 − 𝜆𝜆𝐾𝐾𝑡𝑡−1 : net investment in physical capital, where λ is the depreciation of
           physical capital.
           Gt = government expenditure.
           Xt = net exports.


Abatement and damage in time period (t) are modeled as a deduction from consumption in

period (t). Let At represent expenditure on abatement of pollution: 𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡 = 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 , where

(0 ≤ 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 ≤ 1). Further, let (𝐷𝐷𝑡𝑡 ) reflect pollution damage, or degradation of natural capital: 𝐷𝐷𝑡𝑡 =

𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 − 𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡 �𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 �. The autonomous 2 pollution-intensity of output is given by (𝛼𝛼), while (𝛽𝛽)

reflects the sensitivity of environmental damage to investment in abatement. As such, damage

falls with increasing abatement effort (𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 ), with greater responsiveness of damage to abatement

(𝛽𝛽), and it rises with more pollution intensive output (Muller, 2019).

    Autonomous pollution intensity is defined as the pollution damage per unit output prior to abatement.

𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡+1 = 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡+1 �1 − 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡+1 − (𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡+1 − 𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡+1 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡+1 )� + 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 + 𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡 + 𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡          (2)


       a. Augmented Accounts in a “Pre-Policy” Economy.


Because this paper’s focus is explicitly historical, and in early stages of development, abatement

of pollution (the provision of environmental public goods) is likely to be at or near zero, the

model begins in a situation with zero abatement. In this “pre-policy” economy, growth in the

augmented index (which, importantly, features an augmentation only consisting of damages) is

shown in (3):

                        𝑚𝑚
   𝑒𝑒
𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡+1 −𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒       𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡+1 −𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 +�𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 (𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 )−𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡+1 (𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡+1 )�
                 =                                                                     (3)
    𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒                                𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒



Expression (3) reveals that the intertemporal change in damage �𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 (𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 ) − 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡+1 (𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡+1 )� is a key

driver in the augmented growth rate. Rising (falling) damages attenuate (enhance) growth.

Consider the following cases. If pollution intensity remains fixed, (𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 ) = (𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡+1 ), damages rise if

consumption rises. If pollution-intensity increases and consumption increases, remains constant,

or falls by less than pollution intensity increases, damages also increase. Hence, falling damages

are most likely to occur during contractionary periods and during periods when autonomous

pollution intensity falls precipitously3. Further, since damage in period (t) lowers (𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒 ), higher

initial levels of damage enhance the growth rate.

 Note that, by construction, these periods do not correspond to more stringent environmental policy. Rather, the
convenience-driven transitions from coal-based home heating to the use of natural gas is an example of a large
change in autonomous pollution-intensity.

                                                                       9
In the pre-policy economy with zero abatement, the difference between growth in the market

index and growth in the augmented accounts reduces to (4):

   𝑒𝑒
𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡+1 −𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒          𝑚𝑚
                     𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡+1 −𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚                       𝑚𝑚
                                          𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 (𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 ) 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡+1      𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡+1 (𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡+1 )
                 −                    =              � 𝑌𝑌 𝑚𝑚 � −                                                                         (4)
    𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒               𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚             𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒      𝑡𝑡               𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒



                                                                                                                                 𝑌𝑌 𝑚𝑚
The difference in growth rates is a simple expression of GDP growth � 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡+1
                                                                          𝑚𝑚 � and the damage
                                                                                                                                   𝑡𝑡


intensity of output. This expression again emphasizes the importance of the intertemporal change

in damage to growth in the augmented metric. Setting (4) to zero and rearranging produces:
   𝑚𝑚
𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡+1       𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡+1 (𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡+1 )
         =                    .   Hence, the rates of growth in GDP and the augmented index equate when
𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚           𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 (𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 )


damages change at the GDP growth rate. The upshot of this result for policymakers is the

following. When damages rise more (less) rapidly than GDP, growth estimates based on GDP

overestimate (underestimate) comprehensive growth.


         b. Augmented Accounts with Pollution Abatement.


Next, abatement is added to the model. Growth in (2) between time periods (t) and (t+1) is

shown in (5).

                        𝑚𝑚
   𝑒𝑒
𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡+1 −𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒       𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡+1 −𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 +�𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 (𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 )−𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡+1 (𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡+1 )+�𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 (𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 −𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 )−𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡+1 (𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡+1 −𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡+1 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡+1 )��
                 =                                                                                                                       (5)
    𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒                                                             𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒



This expression reflects two facets of growth in an extending national accounting identity

previously reported in the literature. First, there is a positive effect on growth when expenditures

on abatement and damages fall through time (Le Kama and Schubert, 2007; Hoel and Sterner,

2007; Heal, 2009; Gollier, 2010; Baumgartner et al., 2014; Six and Wirl, 2015; Muller, 2019).

Second, the net effect on growth of including abatement expenditure and damages from current

period consumption depends on both the trajectories and relative magnitudes of abatement and

                                                                                         10
damage (Muller, 2019). If both are increasing, growth is diminished. If both are falling, growth is

enhanced. If, say, damage falls when abatement expenditures rise, then the impact on growth

depends on which is larger.


Next, (5) is compared to growth in the market index.

   𝑒𝑒
𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡+1 −𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒             𝑚𝑚
                        𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡+1 −𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚                    𝑚𝑚
                                              𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 ∆𝑡𝑡 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡+1       𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡+1 ∆𝑡𝑡+1
                 −                        =                     −                                                    (6)
    𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒                       𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚         𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚           𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒



where: ∆𝑡𝑡 = (𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 − 𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 ), and ∆𝑡𝑡+1 = 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡+1 − 𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡+1 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡+1 + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡+1 . This expression is equivalent

to (4) except that (6) includes both damage and abatement.


With pollution abatement, under what conditions do the growth rates in market output and

augmented output coincide? Setting (6) equal to zero and rearranging yields:

   𝑚𝑚
𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡+1       𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡+1 ∆𝑡𝑡+1
         =                                                                                                           (7)
𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚                𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 ∆𝑡𝑡



This indicates that when growth in the monetary expenditure on abatement plus damage equals

the GDP growth rate, the two indices change at the same rate. Alternatively, when the combined

drag from abatement and damage change at the same rate as GDP, the expansion (or contraction)

of the augmented measure of income and GDP align. To see this more clearly, suppose growth in

the money value of abatement and damage exceeds the rate of growth in GDP by some small

amount (𝜀𝜀). Adding (𝜀𝜀) to the left-hand side of (6) and re-arranging yields: 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡+1 ∆𝑡𝑡+1 =

             𝑌𝑌 𝑚𝑚                                                                 −𝜀𝜀∆𝑡𝑡 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡
𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 ∆𝑡𝑡 � 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡+1
               𝑚𝑚 + 𝜀𝜀�. Then, evaluating (5) results in:                            �𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒 �
                                                                                                 . Thus, incrementally higher growth in
                 𝑡𝑡


abatement and damage exerts a negative effect on the difference in growth rates between the

augmented indicator and GDP.




                                                                                   11
What does one learn from the above exercises? Policymakers charged with assessing economic

performance will mischaracterize growth by ignoring damages and abatement. In a pre-policy

economy, errors in growth accounting depend strictly on damage. The sign of the mistake

depends on the sign of the change in damage. The magnitude of the error also depends on the

initial period pollution intensity. Once an economy adopts environmental policy, the trajectories

of abatement and damage together determine whether market-oriented growth estimates differ

from comprehensive estimates and how.


     III.        Methods.


This section begins with the mechanics of the exposure, mortality, and damage calculation.

Using population by age cohort (a), state (i), and time (t), denoted (Popa,i,t), and baseline

(reported) mortality rates, by (a), (i), and (t), denoted (Ma,i,t), (CDC, various) premature mortality

due to PM2.5 exposure is computed as shown in (8).


𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑎𝑎,𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 = 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑎𝑎,𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 𝑀𝑀𝑎𝑎,𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 �1 − 1�                     �    (8)

The (𝜃𝜃) term is reported in the empirical evidence reported in the epidemiological literature

(Krewski et al., 2009). Recent work in environmental economics explores the exposure-

mortality relationship using causal models (Jha, Muller, 2019; Deryugina et al., 2016; Ebenstein

et al., 2017). Papers that have explored exposure to annual mean levels in an instrumental

variables context (Jha and Muller, 2019) report estimates of (𝜃𝜃) that are in line with the values

from the epidemiological literature. It is difficult to directly compare results from other recent

studies that estimate the effects of daily exposure on daily mortality rates (Deryugina et al.,




                                                                        12
2016). In addition, other studies apply quasi-experimental methods in very different contexts,

rendering meaningful comparisons difficult (Ebenstein et al., 2017).


Aggregating over age groups and locations yields an estimate of national premature mortality.

Monetary damages (D) are calculated by simply multiplying premature mortalities times the

VSL.


𝐷𝐷𝑡𝑡 = 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡 𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡                                                      (9)


Note that the VSL (Vt) varies by year according to the reported per capita income and estimates

of the VSL-income elasticity reported in the literature (Kleckner and Neumann, 1999; Costa,

Kahn, 2004; Hammitt, Robinson, 2011). Hammitt and Robinson (2011) provide evidence that the

VSL-income elasticity itself varies according to income. In particular, studies focusing on higher

income countries in the modern era tend to report lower VSL-income elasticities. In contrast,

analyses probing developing economies, or historical time-periods in what are now developed

economies find higher elasticities. In light of this, the present analysis employs the decadal VSLs

reported in Costa and Kahn (2004) for mortality risk valuations from 1957 to 1980 (which imply

a variable income elasticity). For the 1980 to 2016 period, the paper uses the USEPA’s

recommended VSL of $7.4 million ($2006). This value is adjusted for real income using the

USEPA’s 0.4 income elasticity. VSLs implied by the two different approaches used herein

equate in 1980. Figure A.3 in the appendix shows how the VSL from 1957 to 2016.


Expression (10) demonstrates how VSLs in different time periods are calculated with respect to a

base period VSL (V0). In time period (t), (Vt) is:


              𝐼𝐼   𝜀𝜀𝑣𝑣
𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡 = 𝑉𝑉0 �𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 �                                                          (10)
               0




                                                 13
where: It = real personal income in period (t)


          𝜀𝜀𝑣𝑣 = VSL-income elasticity.


For the 1980 to 2016 period, the concentration data used in (8) are spatially resolved satellite,

modeled, and monitored “readings” of ambient PM2.5. Meng et al., (2019), provide the data in 1o

latitude-longitude coordinates by year from 1980 to 2016. The data are geolocated and then

averaged to the state level, by year. These estimates are then fed into (8) and to compute state

and national damages. Figure A.1 in the appendix demonstrates the close correspondence

between the satellite data and USEPA’s monitor data over the 1999 to 2016 period for which

both datasets are available.


The pre-1980 historical PM2.5 data is derived from USEPA monitoring data for total suspended

particulates (TSP) provided by Clay et al., (2016). PM2.5 is a sub-set of TSP. On this basis, one

hypothesis is that TSP yields useful information regarding PM2.5 levels, though PM2.5 was not

separately monitored prior to 1999. As such, a linear regression model is fitted to the overlapping

series of PM2.5 and TSP monitoring data. (This includes the years 1999 through 2016.) This is

shown in (11).

The (𝛽𝛽0 , 𝛽𝛽1 , 𝛽𝛽2) terms are OLS parameter estimates. The (𝜑𝜑𝑖𝑖 ) term reflects state fixed effects,

and �𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 � is a stochastic error term. Then, using the fitted coefficients, a series is extrapolated

back through 1957 using national average TSP levels. The results of this fitting and extrapolation

exercise are only used from 1980 back to 1957. Further, the series is spliced to the series

provided by Meng et al., (2019) to ensure continuity in 1980. Table A.3 in the appendix reports



                                                                      14
the fitted coefficients from three variants of (11). The first features OLS estimation without state

fixed effects. The second includes state fixed effects. The third specification includes state

specific linear trends. Adopted is the second specification (with state fixed effects). The entire

spliced time series of national, annual average PM2.5 levels along with the monitored TSP series

is shown in figure A.2. Figure A.2 displays the 95 percent confidence intervals on the predicted

PM2.5 levels prior to 1980 (since the 1980 forward values are from satellite data there are no

standard errors).


   a. Integration of the GED into the NIPAs.


The standard approach to augmenting national accounts with pollution damage that manifests

outside of (or external to) markets is to deduct such impacts expressed in monetary terms from

an aggregate measure of output such as GDP or Value-Added (VA) (Abraham and Mackie,

2006). GED is subtracted from national GDP to estimate environmentally adjusted VA (EVA).

The analysis then computes growth in both GDP and the EVA.


State-level GED are debited from PCE. Ambient pollution levels in a location are an

amalgamation of discharges from many sources. Hence, subtracting exposure-based GED from

GDP produced in a particular state would potentially “charge” that state with impacts from

emissions produced elsewhere. In recognition of the asymmetry between geographically resolved

measures of production and exposure to pollution, the state GED is deducted from PCE to

estimate environmentally adjusted PCE or EPCE.


The USBEA reports PCE nationally from 1980 – 2016, and by state from 1997 forward

(USBEA, 2018). State GDP is reported over the full 1980 – 2016 time series. State PCE from

1996 back to 1980 is imputed using the state specific ratio of GDP to PCE from 1997 forward.


                                                 15
   b. Descriptive Regressions on Determinants of Growth and Damage.

In order to characterize how various relevant factors affect the GED and EPCE growth rates, the

empirical analysis includes a set of descriptive regression exercises. The models regress the GED

growth rates (by state) and the spread between the EPCE growth and GDP growth (at the state-

year level) on three groups of covariates. These include a set of macroeconomic controls: the

federal funds target rate (FRED, 2018), state-level unemployment rates (BLS, 2016), housing

starts (Census, 2018), an indicator for years including an NBER recession, and state level

population (CDC Wonder, 2018). The next group of covariates features state level (per capita)

fossil fuel and electricity consumption delineated according to fuel type (petroleum, natural gas,

and coal). These variables are further decomposed according to sector of end use: electric power

generation, transportation, industrial, commercial, and residential (USDOE SEDS, 2018). The

third collection of regressors model environmental policy. This group includes indicators for the

two phases of the Acid Rain Program (interacted with coal and natural gas-fired electricity

consumption), indicators for years in which the PM2.5 or the O3 NAAQS were tightened, counts

of counties (within each state) out of attainment with the NAAQS, an indicator for states having

a renewable portfolio standard (RPS), and whether states featured deregulated electricity

markets. The models also feature state and year fixed effects. Of particular interest are the

controls for environmental policies and their association with both damages and EPCE growth

spreads over PCE growth. Importantly, the analysis does not claim to identify causal policy

effects. Rather, the models are intended to provide provocative results interpreted as associations

between the covariates and the outcome variables. Quasi-experimental designs intended to tease

out causal policy effects are left to future work.

   IV.      Results.


The results section proceeds in three parts. The first sub-section gives an account of mortality

and the national GED estimates from 1957 to 2016. The second sub-section details the GED and

EVA (again in both levels and growth rates) back to 1980. And, the third part discusses the fitted

coefficients from the descriptive regression analyses.


            a. Deaths and Pollution Damage Intensity: 1957 - 2016.


Figure 1 plots the number of PM2.5 induced deaths nationwide from 1957 to 2016. In 1957, about

430,000 deaths were estimated to be associated with PM2.5 exposure. This is roughly four-times

more deaths from PM2.5 than calculated for 2016. The CDC reports that about 1.7 million deaths

occurred in 1957. Thus, PM2.5 associated deaths amounted to about one-quarter of all mortalities.

In an attempt to bound this figure, recent estimates of PM2.5 associated mortalities in China are

compared to the 1957 death estimate for the U.S. Specifically, Rohde and Muller (2015) report

that in 2014, 1.6 million deaths occurred due to exposure to PM2.5. This amounted to 17 percent

of all deaths. Hence, the mortality burden from PM2.5 in the 1950s in the U.S. was quite similar

to that in China in very recent years. How did the PM2.5 levels compare? The annual average

PM2.5 level reported in the Rohde and Muller (2015) study was 52 ug/m3 while that in the U.S. in

1957 was 54 ug/m3. An important contributing factor to the difference in the PM2.5 mortality

burden between the U.S. in 1957 and China in 2014 is that the baseline (population-weighted)

mortality rate in the U.S. in 1957 was about 9.9/1000 whereas that for China in 2014 was

7.2/1000.


Figure 1 indicates that deaths from PM2.5 fell to around 400,000 by 1960, and then, with some

oscillation, dropped to about 350,000 in 1970. Between 1970 and 1980, deaths from PM2.5 fell to


                                                17
250,000. Importantly, 1970 saw the passage of the Clean Air Act. Further, the energy crisis and

associated recession from 1973 to 1975 was concurrent with a significant reduction in deaths.

The sharp recessions from 1980 to 1982 reduced air pollution mortality to close to 200,000.

From 1982 onward, mortalities then roughly linearly decreased to just over 118,000 in 2016. The

CDC reports that 2.7 million deaths occurred in 2016. Hence, PM2.5-associated deaths accounted

for just about four percent of all mortalities in 2016.


Several broad or national level, trends affect the change in deaths from particulate air pollution.

First, from 1957 to 2016, the estimated annual average PM2.5 level dropped by a factor of seven 4.

Additionally, the population-weighted average mortality rate declined from 9.6 per 1,000 to 8.5

per 1,000 (CDC, 1959; CDC, 2018). Countervailing the dramatic reduction in PM2.5 and the

reduction in mortality rates was population growth. In 1957, the U.S. population was about 172

million, whereas in 2016 the U.S. had grown to 323 million.


In addition to the broad changes driving the reductions in deaths, more subtle forces were also at

work. Note, as shown in (8) that deaths from exposure are multiplicatively related to baseline

mortality rates. As such, differences in the distribution of (within-year) baseline mortality rates

are a potentially important driver of both the level and the distribution of damages. Figure A.4

reports the share of total PM2.5 induced deaths among populations over 65 years of age. The

share of deaths among the elderly increased from 60 percent in 1957 to over 75 percent in the

late 1990s. Figure A.5 indicates that this mapped closely to the aging of the U.S. population.

However, after the year 2000, the population continued to age, but the share of PM2.5 deaths

among the elderly fell slightly through 2016. There are likely two explanations for this pattern.


4
 Yet, deaths from PM2.5 fell by a factor of four. This less-than-proportional response ultimately
derives from the mortality dose-response function used herein (Krewski et al., 2009).
                                                  18
First, abatement of PM2.5 occurred in places consisting of relatively older populations (such as

the industrial Midwest). Second, relative growth in the population over 65 tended to occur in

lower PM2.5 locations: the western U.S. for example.


Figure 2 reports the GED-to-GDP ratios from 1957 to 2016. From 1957 to 1960, pollution

intensity fell from 30 percent of output to about 27 percent. Then, during the 1960s, GED-to-

GDP increased to nearly 40 percent. The peak pollution intensity occurred in 1971, one year

after passage of the Clean Air Act. There was then a remarkably steep decline in pollution

intensity until 1980 when GED comprised about 25 percent of GDP. The GED-to-GDP ratio

declined from 0.25 in 1980 down to under 0.10 in 2016.


Figure 2 also includes a plot of the annual average PM2.5 level. Beginning in the late 1950s,

PM2.5 averaged about 55 ug/m3. Ambient concentrations fell rapidly to about 40 ug/m3 by the

mid-1960s. (The steep drop in monitored, ambient TSP corroborates this estimated reduction

over this time period shown in figure A.2.) In 1980, PM2.5 averaged about 25 ug/m3. PM2.5 levels

fell steadily through the 1980s and essentially through the rest of the decades covered herein.


Figure 2 also reveals that from 1970 to the early 2000s, GED/GDP fell more rapidly than

pollution levels. This implies that either pollution fell in high damage locations (like large cities),

or that GDP growth outpaced pollution and damage reductions, or a combination of the two

factors. Both the 1980 through 1982 recessions and the Great Recession were associated with

sharp reductions in GED. Following the year 2000, pollution intensity and ambient PM2.5

declined in lock step.




                                                  19
           b. Comparative Growth Rates in GDP, EVA, and GED: 1957 - 2016.


Table 1 summarizes the annual growth rates in GDP, GED, and EVA by decade. (All growth

rates are expressed in per-capita terms.) Over the entire sample, real GDP growth averaged just

under two percent; damages fell by an average of 0.41 percent, and EVA expanded by 2.45

percent. Hence, EVA outpaced GDP by about one-half of a percentage point. There was, of

course, considerable heterogeneity in this growth rate spread. From 1957 through 1970, GDP

grew more rapidly than EVA did. As the conceptual model suggested, accounting for pollution

damage attenuates growth when pollution intensity rises. From 1957 to 1970, GED grew by 4

percent, annually.


As pollution levels plummeted through the 1970s, GED fell by 1.06 percent per annum, and

EVA exceeded GDP growth by 1.5 percentage points. During the 1980s, real GDP per capita

increased by an average of 2.2 percent while EVA grew by 3.2 percent. GED declined by about

1.4 percent, per year. During this decade, the EVA indicator suggests the American economy

grew by one full percentage points more rapidly than GDP. During the 1990s, the spread

between EVA and GDP growth fell to 0.70 percent. The rate of GED reduction accelerated to

about 1.75 percent. The 2000s featured attenuation of both GDP and EVA growth as the

economy incurred the effects of the Great Recession. EVA outpaced GDP by 0.5 percentage

points. During this decade, GED fell by nearly three full percentage points per year. Although

subsequent sections of this analysis delve more deeply into factors associated with changes in the

GED, it is helpful to note at this point that this decade featured the implementation of Phase II of

the Acid Rain Program, several reductions in the NAAQS, and the significant substitution from

coal to gas in power production. Finally, during the 2010s, the rate differential contracted to



                                                 20
under 0.2 percentage points. Table A.1 in the appendix repeats this exercise using the alternative

VSL assumptions. The patterns are essentially robust to the different VSL assumptions.


Table 2 summarizes growth rates according to the business cycle. During recession years, annual

GDP growth was -0.32 percent on average, whereas EVA growth was 0.39. This is a difference

of 0.7 percentage points. Note that the GED, on average, contracted by 3 percent during

recession years. In contrast, when the U.S. economy was not in recession, EVA outpaced GDP

by about 0.4 percentage points. (GED tended to increase slightly during expansionary periods.)

Hence, whether the economy is in recession or not explains about half of the difference between

EVA and GDP growth over all six decades. It is also interesting to note that the sign of GED

growth hinges on whether the economy is in recession or expansion – irrespective of regulatory

constraints.


Table 2 reports growth summaries for two major macroeconomic shocks: the energy crisis of the

1970s and the Great Recession. During the energy crisis years of 1973 through 1975, GDP

growth was positive but below the sample average. EVA growth, by contrast was nearly 4

percent – significantly above the average of 2.45 percent. The growth rate differential between

EVA and GDP during the energy crisis was 2.20. Further, pollution damage fell abruptly by

nearly 3 percent, annually. During the Great Recession, GDP growth was -1.19, EVA contracted

by 0.73 percentage points and GED fell precipitously at over 5 percent. (Table A.2 in the

appendix repeats this analysis using the alternative VSL assumptions.)


Figure 3 presents indexed values of per-capita GDP (solid line), the EVA (dashed line) and GED

(dashed-dotted line) from 1957 to 2016. (This figure employs the default, time variant VSL-

income elasticity.) First, the GDP index reveals the remarkable growth that has occurred within


                                                21
the market economy since 1957. In real terms, the U.S. economy has grown by nearly three times

in this 60-year period. The shaded areas represent recessions. The early 1980s recessions and the

Great Recession had a large effect on GDP growth. Both the 1990 recession and the downturn

associated with the bursting of the “tech bubble” had mild effects on growth.


The dashed line represents EVA growth. Accounting for air pollution damage suggests that the

U.S. economy has more than tripled in size since 1957. Dividing figure 3 into two time-periods

(before and after the energy crisis of 1973 to 1975) is useful. Prior to 1973, GDP growth

exceeded EVA growth because GED grew more rapidly than GDP. Figure 3 shows that GED

increased by nearly 50 percent during the 1960s. GED then plateaued in 1970. From the

beginning of the energy crisis onwards, real GED per capita fell. Once GED began to fall, the

EVA index caught up to GDP and then for the remainder of the sample period, EVA growth

outpaced GDP (corroborating the results in table 1).


Two factors explain these macroeconomic patterns, both of which were elucidated by the

conceptual model above. First, the U.S. economy, as measured by the EVA index was about 30

percent smaller around the time of the energy crisis than GDP would suggest. Thus, growth in

EVA occurs over a smaller base than GDP. Second, pollution damage fell from 1973 to 2016.

The conceptual model highlights that these two effects increase the differential between EVA

and GDP growth. Figure 3 provides an illustration of how these factors affect the relative

growth rates of EVA and GDP in the U.S. economy.


           c. State Growth: 1980 to 2016.


Do the comparisons between adjusted output and the market indices at the state level resemble

the national scale results? Importantly, when analyzing states, the focus shifts from GDP to


                                               22
personal consumption expenditures (PCE) because of the difficulty attributing damages,

exposures, and concentrations in a given state to the location of emissions. As such, the adjusted

index (EPCE) features the deduction of the GED from PCE in a given state-year.


Figure A.7 in the appendix plots the growth indices for four state economies: Pennsylvania, West

Virginia, Texas, and North Dakota. The top-left panel shows that the Pennsylvania economy (as

measured by PCE) just about doubled between 1980 and 2016. When measured by EPCE, this

state economy expanded by six times. Concomitantly, GED fell by one half. The factors that

contributed to the U.S. EVA growing more rapidly than GDP are at work here as well. In the

base year, GED comprised nearly 50 percent of Pennsylvania PCE. The pollution intensity of

output in Pennsylvania plummeted to just 11 percent in 2016. Not only did the state begin with a

heavy burden of pollution damage, but also the Pennsylvania economy cleaned-up significantly.

Both effects, as explicated by the conceptual model, contribute to the dramatically faster growth

in EPCE relative to PCE.


The top-right panel of figure A.7 displays the growth indices for West Virginia. Real PCE grew

such that the 2016 economy was about twice the size of the 1980 economy. EPCE growth,

however, was much higher. The EVA index suggests West Virginia’s economy expanded by

almost seven times. Damages dropped by about one-quarter. Like the case Pennsylvania, the

stark difference in economic performance suggested by the EPCE and PCE indices in West

Virginia stems from substantial reductions in pollution intensity: from about 50 percent down to

under 20 percent between 1980 and 2016. As this state’s economy mitigated the burden of air

pollution exposure and health risks, it grew far more rapidly. The value of these risk reductions is

not captured by PCE.



                                                23
Pennsylvania and West Virginia are likely integrated and share aspects of the composition of

their economies. An economy such as Texas presents a different case, both in terms of

composition and region. The bottom-left panel of figure A.7 displays the growth indices for

Texas. The first pattern evinced in the figure is the much smaller disparity between EPCE and

PCE than either Pennsylvania or West Virginia. Why does this occur? Texas never had the

grossly high GED/PCE metrics registered in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. In 1980, the

GED/PCE index in Texas was about 0.15. It subsequently fell to 0.06 in 2016.


The bottom-right panel of figure A.7 repeats this exercise for the North Dakota state economy.

Like Texas, the difference between EPCE and PCE is modest throughout the 1980 – 2016 time

period. Further, real PCE and EPCE fell from 1980 until the late 1990s. From that time forward,

PCE increased in real terms. And, as GED remained lower than the 1980 level, EPCE began to

outpace PCE growth. Additionally, figure A.7 detects the oil and gas extraction boom in these

aggregate statistics. The rapid rise in both PCE and EPCE in 2011 coincides with the increase in

extraction in North Dakota’s Bakken Formation.


           d. Descriptive Regressions.


Tables 3 and 4 report the results from the descriptive regression analyses. For each model, the

unit of observation is the state-year. The thrust of these empirical exercises is to provide a sense

of how three sets of factors affect the GED and EPCE growth rates: macroeconomic factors,

energy consumption, and environmental policies. Importantly, tables 3 and 4 only present results

for those covariates that display significant relationships to the dependent variables. Table 3

begins with the regressions of GED growth rates. Whether or not the economy is in recession has

a large and robustly significant effect on GED growth (p < 0.01). In column (1), the model only


                                                 24
includes state fixed effects. In this context, being in a recession year deducts two percentage

points from the GED growth rate. However, upon inclusion of year fixed effects (column 2), the

effect of a recession rises considerably; being in a recession year is associated with a 25

percentage point reduction in GED growth. The top income tax rate is negatively associated with

damage growth. Unemployment rates, housing starts, and population do not exhibit robust or

significant influences on the GED growth rate.


Table 3 also includes the controls intended to characterize how environmental policy affected the

GED. Specifically, table 3 includes contemporaneous measures and up to two year lags of years

when the NAAQS for PM2.5 and O3 were tightened. When controlling for year fixed effects, the

two-year lag measure of the PM2.5 NAAQS is significantly associated with a reduction in GED

growth (p < 0.01). The association is also economically significant: about a nine-percentage

point reduction in GED growth. Further, the concurrent measure of O3 NAAQS changes exhibits

a significant, negative effect on the GED (p < 0.01). Although the GED encompasses PM2.5,

emissions of precursors to O3 production (NOx and VOCs) also affect PM2.5 levels. As such, it is

plausible that O3 NAAQS adjustments affect PM2.5 exposures.


Table 4 covers the regressions with the growth rate differential between EPCE and PCE as the

dependent variable 5. Table 4 begins with macroeconomic controls. Whether or not the economy

is in recession has a significant effect on the rate spread. Specifically, controlling for state and

year fixed effects, recession years feature rate spreads that are about five percentage points

greater than non-recession years (p < 0.01). Recall that table 3 reported a large, negative, and

    The EPCE-PCE differential is used since these are state level regressions.

                                                            25
significant effect of recessions on damages. Since EPCE rises when GED falls, this result

supports that in table 3.


The federal funds rate also exhibits a significant association with the EPCE-PCE rate differential.

Without year fixed effects, the federal funds rate is positively associated with the rate spread (p <

0.01). Inclusion of year fixed effects reverses the sign (p < 0.01). The interaction term between

the federal funds rate and the recession indicator is robustly significant and positively associated

with the EPCE - PCE growth rate spread.


The income tax rate on the highest income bracket is strongly associated (p < 0.01) with higher

rate spreads. Recall that table 3 reported a significant negative relationship between damages and

the top tax rate. Income taxes tend to dampen consumption. Consumption yields pollution.

Hence, as tax rates rise, damages fall increasing the differential between EPCE and PCE growth

rates.


While higher levels of housing starts suggest faster market index growth (and lower spreads),

table 4 reports evidence of a positive association between spreads and housing starts (p < 0.05,

inclusive of year fixed effects). One explanation for this is that housing starts have grown more

rapidly in the West and Southeast where pollution damages tend to be lower than in the industrial

Northeast and Midwest.


Table 4 also demonstrates that greater levels of per-capita petroleum use through transportation

significantly attenuates the EPCE-PCE spread (p < 0.01). The magnitude of this effect,

presumably due to emissions from combustion of gasoline, diesel, and oil, is between one and

three percentage points.




                                                 26
Table 4 also explores the links between environmental policy and the EPCE-PCE growth rate

differentials. The findings are largely supportive of those reported for the GED in table 3. For

instance, two years after the PM2.5 NAAQS change, the rate spread is higher by up to four

percentage points. And, a similar effect is observed concurrent to O3 NAAQS amendments:

damages fall and the EPCE-GDP differential widens.


    V.      Conclusions.


This paper conducts the first long run environmental accounting exercise. The analysis focuses

on air pollution both because of rich data availability and in light of the fact that this setting has

the potential to appreciably affect estimates of both levels and growth in national output.

Damage from exposure to fine particulate matter are estimated from 1957 to 2016.


The paper uses standard damage function methods to translate pollution concentrations and

exposures into damage. The article reports dramatic levels of pollution intensity in the American

economy in years past. In 1957, the paper reports about 435,000 premature mortalities from

PM2.5 exposure. The mortality burden implied by this estimate is commensurate with the current

mortality impacts from PM2.5 in China, where ambient levels are approximately on par with the

U.S. in 1957. The GED in 1957 comprised between 30 percent and 40 percent of GDP. Damage

intensity of output fell precipitously to about 20 to 30 percent of GDP in 1980. Since 1980, the

GED/GDP fell to under 10 percent. This reduction was especially rapid prior to 2000, with

GED/GDP declining more rapidly than ambient PM2.5.


The implication of this stunning clean-up has been rapid growth in EVA, defined as GDP less air

pollution damage. Prior to the landmark environmental legislation passed in the early 1970s,




                                                  27
GDP grew more rapidly than EVA, as damage intensity in the U.S. economy increased. Since

then, EVA outpaced GDP growth as GED declined both in levels and relative to GDP.


It is important to note that applying the VSL-income elasticity and epidemiological results to the

damage calculations back to the 1950s and 1960s imparts significant uncertainties into the

calculations. Nonetheless, the upshot of these computations is the following: using GDP as the

barometer to gauge growth, the U.S. economy has slightly more than double in size since 1957.

When EVA (which deducts air pollution damage) is used, the economy has more than tripled in

size from 1957 to 2016.


Macroeconomic conditions play a clear role in the differential growth rates. The spread between

EVA and GDP growth is 0.3 percentage points higher during recessions than during expansions.

During the Great Recession, GED fell by 5 percent annually. Similarly, during the energy crisis

of the 1970s, GED dropped by between 2 and 3 percentage points.


The paper also provides evidence of a relationship between tax policy and monetary policy and

environmental outcomes. Top tax rates are significantly associated with reduced damages and

higher rates of EVA growth, relative to GDP growth. While in depth study of the mechanism is

relegated to future work, the connection appears to work through reduced consumption

associated with higher rates. In the preferred specification, the federal funds rate, during

recessions, is negatively associated with EVA growth, relative to GDP growth.


Regression analysis reveals that the Clean Air Act also played an important role in damage

reduction and EVA growth. Detected herein is an effect of NAAQS adjustments on GED and

EVA growth. Specifically, years during which (and following) the PM2.5 and the O3 NAAQS

were tightened reduced GED, and provided a boost to EVA. Many of the rules governing


                                                 28
vehicles and fuel content are difficult to assess because of their overlapping implementation. For

instance, controlling for state and year fixed effects the analysis finds little effect of policies like

the Acid Rain Program. Additional research is needed to causally parse the effects of the myriad

pollution rules on adjusted growth.


The empirical analyses conducted in this paper should stimulate new research in several areas.

First, delving more deeply into the state and regional accounts may reveal insights into the

relationship between the composition of regional economic systems, policies shaping such

systems, and both GDP and EVA growth. Second, this paper’s macro-focus leaves unanswered

issues related to the distribution of economic resources. Future papers should examine how

measures of adjusted income have changed over this 60-year time period. Third, though this

paper provides provocative evidence of a link between macroeconomic policy and GED and the

EVA-GDP growth rate differentials, more targeted studies of this nexus are warranted. And,

finally, the divergent conclusions drawn from measuring economic performance with either EVA

or GDP suggest that official statistical agencies should track a set of satellite accounts inclusive

of environmental pollution damages.
