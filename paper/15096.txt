Food Prices and the Dynamics of Body Weight

                                             ABSTRACT

A popular policy option for addressing the growth in weight has has been the imposition of a “fat tax”
on selected foods that are deemed to promote obesity. Understanding the public economics of “fat
taxes” requires an understanding of how or even whether individuals respond to changes in food prices
over the long-term. We study the short- and long-run body weight consequences of changing food
prices, in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). We found very modest short-term effects of price
per calorie on body weight, and the magnitudes align with the previous literature. The long-term effect
is much bigger, but it takes a long time for the effect to reach the full scale. Within 30 years, a 10%
permanent reduction in price per calorie would lead to a BMI increase of 1.5 units (or 3.6%). The long
term effect is an increase of 1.9 units of BMI (or 4.2%). From a policy perspective, these results suggest
that policies raising the price of calories will have little effect on weight in the short term, but might
curb the rate of weight growth and achieve weight reduction over a very long period of time.

A. Introduction
Body weight has risen dramatically in the US since 1978. In 2005, for example, over
one-third of the adult population was obese, approximately three times the rate observed
before 1980. The Center for Disease Control declared that obesity is one of its top public
health priorities (2000).
       A great many policy approaches to the obesity epidemic have been proposed. A
popular choice among these has been the imposition of a “fat tax” on selected foods that
are deemed to promote obesity, as a result of high caloric density, low nutritional value,
or high fat content (Jacobson and Brownell 2000; Nestle and Jacobson 2000). In the year
2000, for example, there were 19 states and cities in the United States that imposed taxes
on less nutritious foods, like soft drinks, sweets, or snack foods (Jacobson and Brownell
2000). In the past, policymakers viewed these primarily as “sin taxes” designed to raise
revenue rather than influence health. Most localities use revenues for general purposes.
Others earmark them for specific purposes, like violence prevention (Washington),
Medicaid (Arkansas), or medical schools (West Virginia). Such taxes were strongly
opposed by the soft drink and food industries. Perhaps as a result, 12 localities have
reduced or repealed such taxes in recent years.
       Understanding the public economics of “fat taxes” requires an understanding of
how or even whether individuals respond to changes in food prices. Regardless of
whether municipalities intend to influence health, there may be health effects that need to
be quantified. To meet this public policy need, a literature on food prices and obesity has
emerged in health economics. Chou, Grossman, and Saffer (Chou, Grossman et al. 2004)
found that the real fast-food restaurant price, the real food at home price and the real full-
service restaurant price were negatively associated with weight in an adult population.
Lakdawalla and Philipson (Lakdawalla and Philipson 2002) find qualitatively similar, but
larger, effects on a population of young adults. Another study found that the real price of
fast food is negatively related to body weight among adolescents, while the real price of
fruits and vegetables food is positively associated (Auld and Powell 2008). Among U.S.
children from kindergarten to the third grade, lower real food prices of fruits and




                                                  2
vegetables are significantly associated with lower weight gain (Sturm and Datar 2005;
Sturm and Datar 2008).
         Economic theory suggests that food prices affect food intake. Biology suggests
that food intake affects both the level of current weight, and the rate at which weight
changes.     Therefore, manipulating the price of food has both short- and long-run
consequences for body weight. This effect is reinforced by inertia in body weight (Heo,
Faith et al. 2002).
         Most of the economic literature to date has examined the contemporaneous
relationship between food prices and body weight either in a cross-sectional setting or
panel data setting.1 However, the long-run consequences of food prices may be quite
different.
         To fill this gap in the literature, we study the short- and long-run body weight
consequences of changing food prices. We use the Health and Retirement Study (HRS),
a panel of US adults aged 50 and over. The use of the HRS is motivated both by its panel
features, which facilitate the study of long-run consequences, and by the particular
importance of studying health and health care expenditures in this population.
         The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section B outlines the conceptual
framework. Section C describes the data, and Section D the methods. Section E reports
the results, and Section F concludes.


B. Conceptual framework
We conceptualize the determination of body weight as a dynamic problem, with body
weight as a state variable and food intake as a control variable. Consider an individual
who maximizes lifetime utility by choosing food consumption and non-food
consumption, subject to a budget constraint. Changes in body weight are driven by
current food intake, and current body weight. Current body weight directly affects utility
either by affecting health or body image. This problem is formalized as:

        Exceptions are the studies by Sturm and Datar (2005, 2008).

r is the one-period discount rate. W (t ) is body weight at time t . F (t ) is the amount
of food intake at time t ; pt is the relative price of food. C (t ) is the non-food

consumption at time t. I t is the income. C (t ) can be written as I t − pt F (t ) .

We assume that utility is concave in food intake ( U FF < 0 ), that eating more leads to
weight gain ( g F > 0 ), and that a given level of food intake results in less weight gain for
heavier people ( g W < 0 ).
             The Hamiltonian for this optimal control problem is:
             H (t , W , F , λ ) = e − rtU (W (t ), F (t ), I t − pt F (t )) + λg (W (t ), F (t ))   (2)

If W * (t ) and F * (t ) maximize the objective function, the necessary conditions include:

             H F = e − rt (U W WF + U F − ptU C ) + λg F = 0                                        (3)

The second order condition can be written as:
                        H FF = e − rt (U WF WF + U W WFF + U FF − ptU CF ) + λg FF < 0              (4)

             It is straightforward to show that the demand for food is downward-sloping in this
               ∂F *
model, or that      < 0 .2 Second, since g F > 0 , weight gain will be larger as F * (t )
               ∂pt
increases. Finally, the steady-state body weight will also rise with food consumption.3



       2
           Computing the derivative of equation (3) with respect to pt , we obtain
           ∂F *                                                                            ∂F *
H FF            = e − rtU C . According to (4), H FF < 0 . Since U C > 0 , it implies that      < 0.
           ∂pt                                                                             ∂pt

    Since g W < 0 , body weight will increase at a diminishing rate until it reaches a steady
state. This steady-state body weight Ws will satisfy g (Ws , F * (t )) = 0 . Differentiating this

                                                                   4
        Based on the analysis above, we raise the following two hypotheses that will be
subject to empirical test:
        (1) Increases in the relative price of food lower the rate of body weight gain.
        (2) Increases in the relative price of food lower the steady-state level of body
             weight.


C. Data
C.1 Health and Retirement Study Data

We use the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a biennial survey of the population over
age 50, to carry out the analysis. The original HRS cohort – first interviewed in 1992 –
was a nationally representative sample of approximately 7,600 households (n = 12,654
individuals) with at least one member who was born between 1931 and 1941. In every
interview wave, HRS respondents are asked detailed questions about demographics,
employment, occupation, income and wealth, and health insurance. Questions were also
asked about self-reported general health status, prevalence and incidence of chronic
conditions, functional status and disability, and self-reported body height and weight.
County residence is available also, on a restricted-use basis; this allows us to link
geographical information on food prices, as discussed below.
        Body mass index in HRS is constructed from self-reported weight and height.
Earlier research has identified systematic error in measurement for these variables; to
address this issue, we employ the correction method developed by Cawley (1999). The
Cawley procedure relies on the availability of external data on both actual and self-
reported heights and weights. The relationship between the self-reported and actual
numbers is then used to adjust the self-reported values.
        Objectively measured height and weight data are available for a subsample of the
HRS. In the year 2006, HRS randomly selected half its households and measured their


                                                                                     ∂Ws
expression with respect to F * (t ) yields: g F (Ws , F * (t )) + g w (Ws , F * (t ))          = 0.
                                                                                    ∂F * (t )
                                                                                    ∂Ws
Since g F (Ws , F * (t )) > 0 , and g w (Ws , F * (t )) < 0 , it must be true that           > 0.
                                                                                   ∂F * (t )

                                                         5
weight and height. The self-reported weight and height is also available for these
households. Using these variables, we regress actual weight on reported weight and its
square, age and age squared, separately for the following eight sub-groups: white male
non-Hispanic, white female non-Hispanic, black male non-Hispanic, black female non-
Hispanic, Hispanic male, Hispanic female, other male, and other female. Figure A- 1 to
Figure A- 4 shows the relationship between predicted weight and height versus self-
reported weight and height. Non-Hispanic white (male and female) and black female tend
to under-report weight when self-reported weight is high. There is s slight over-report of
height across all race-gender groups, especially among “other male”.

C.2 Food Price Data

We obtain prices for food and other goods from the ACCRA Cost of Living data,
published quarterly by the American Chamber of Commerce Researchers Association
(ACCRA), for more than 200 cities. We use data from 1992 to 2003.
        ACCRA collects prices for 59 distinct but standardized items, which are all listed
in Table B - 1 to Table B - 3. Some examples include: 5 lb bag of sugar, cane or beet; 3
lb can of Crisco brand shortening; 12 oz can of Minute Maid brand frozen concentrated
orange juice. For each city, ACCRA collects mean prices for each of the 59 items. It
also reports the expenditure weight of each item in the budget of a nationally
representative household with a “middle-management” lifestyle.
        Since the ACCRA data are reported quarterly, we average prices over the
available quarters to obtain annual prices. ACCRA reports prices at the level of
metropolitan areas, but the HRS data codes residence at the county-level. Therefore, we
use the population-weighted averages of city prices to construct prices at the county-
level. We calculate “real” prices by deflating using the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
consumer price index for all goods.
        Using the ACCRA data, we calculate the following prices: price per calorie, price
of cigarettes, and price of gasoline.

C.2.1   Individual Item Prices
        We use the price of cigarettes and of gasoline, as collected by ACCRA. The price
of gasoline is the cash price at a self-service pump, if available, for one gallon of regular


                                                  6
unleaded, national brand gasoline, inclusive of all taxes. The price of cigarettes is
calculated as the price of a carton of Winston king-size (85mm) cigarettes.

C.2.2  Price Indices
There are two basic types of food price indices. Laspeyres index measures the changes in
the cost of a fixed basket of goods from a base period. It presumes that consumers do not
substitute one good within the basket for another, as a result of relative price changes. As
a result of substitution behavior, it overestimates the true growth in the price of
composite consumption. An alternative is the Paasche index, which weights prices by
current consumption patterns. This index likely overstates substitution and thus
underestimates the true growth in the price of composite consumption. The two indices
can be viewed as the “upper bound” and “lower bound” of the price change.
         There is also a “blended” choice between the Laspeyres and Paasche indices.
These are called “superlative” indices (Hill 2006). A detailed description of the three
superlative indices is in Appendix C. In this study we construct both Laspeyres-type price
indices and Paasche-type price indices. Estimates for the two sets of price indices will
provide upper and lower bounds for the true price effects.
         A composite food price index like the price of food at home does not take into
account differential impacts on body weight of consuming various foods. For example,
using this price index the impact of a 10% price increase in vegetables on body weight
would be equal to that of a 10% increase in the price of butter, if the expenditure shares
of the two goods are the same. A better alternative is to put more weight on foods that are
more calorie-dense than others. Therefore we construct a measure of the price per calorie.
Increases in this index we interpret as relative increases in the price of high-calorie foods.
         To construct this index, we need information on calories per unit of food
purchased. We obtain these data from the USDA website of “What's In The Foods You
Eat Search Tool.”4 For each item j , we obtain calories per purchase unit, unit prices
across areas and years, and its share in expenditure. Based on these variables, our price
per calorie measure is constructed as:

Price per calories in area a and time t is a calorie- and expenditure-weighted average of
food prices in area a and time t .

C.3 Analytic Sample

We begin with 9,733 HRS respondents born between 1931 and 1941, first interviewed in
1992 and with positive HRS sampling weight. Those who did not die or drop out of the
sample were followed biennially until 2004. Due to the nature of the analysis, we exclude
several segments of the sample. First, we exclude individuals residing in counties for
which ACCRA collects no data. Second, we exclude individuals with missing values for
any of the variables used in the regression analysis. Third, we exclude observations with
non-adjacent waves of data. For example, if an individual was interviewed in wave 1,
wave 3, and wave 4, we exclude the wave 1 data, but retain the data from waves 3 and 4.
Finally, we exclude individuals who moved from one county to another. These
individuals moved at some point between interviews, which are spaced 24 months apart.
Given the substantial between-city variation in food prices, this induces considerable
error in measuring the “true” price that the individual faces over the relevant time-frame.
The detailed sample selection process is shown in Figure 1. 3,111 individuals are
included in the final analytic sample. Below, we investigate the possibility of sample
selection bias.

D. Methods
D.1 Econometric analysis

The conceptual framework implies that current body weight is a function of past body
weight, and factors that affect energy intake and energy expenditure. A reduced-form
equation is the following dynamic linear panel model:
                       t −1
        Wigt = β 0 + ∑ γ k Wig ,k +Pgt β1 + Z gt β 2 + X igt β 3 + α i + τ t + ε igt         (6 )
                       k =0



Wigt is the weight for individual i in geographic region g at time t . Wig ,k are body

weight in previous periods; more than one previous period could affect current body
weight. But including too many periods will greatly reduce the sample size. We minimize
the number of periods to include, while ensuring there is no serial correlation in the error
term ε igt , which is a necessary assumption for the model estimation we will use. Pgt

represents food prices; Z gt stands for other regional variables; α i is individual fixed-

effect; while τ t are year fixed-effects.
        To estimate equation (9), we use system generalized method of moments (GMM)
(Arellano and Bond 1991; Arellano and Bover 1995; Blundell and Bond 1998), which
combines the moment conditions of the differenced equation with moment conditions for
the model in levels. The following moment conditions are jointly estimated using the
“xtabond2” command in Stata 10:
        E (Wig ,k Δε igt ) = 0, k = 1,2, ... t - 2 , t = 1, …T

        E (ΔWig ,q (α i + ε igt )) = 0, q = 1,2, ... t - 1

        E (ΔPgt Δε igt ) = 0

        E (ΔZ gt Δε igt ) = 0

        E (ΔX i gt Δε igt ) = 0                                                    (7)




                                                             9
D.1.1  County Characteristics
Apart from the food price vectors, we include the following county-level characteristics
in the regressions: log of price of cigarettes, log of price of gasoline, and log of price of
non-food goods (excluding cigarettes and gasoline).
        Following Chou, Grossman, and Saffer (2004), we include cigarette prices in the
weight equation, since cigarettes may serve a weight-control function. If smoking
reduces weight, cheaper cigarettes might contribute to weight-reduction, holding food
prices constant.
        The effects of gasoline prices are more complex. On the one hand, it affects the
cost of transportation and the incentives for exercise. For instance, in areas where
gasoline is expensive, people may choose to live closer to work, and take public
transportation, both of which involves more exercise than driving. The price of gasoline
is also correlated with the cost of agricultural output. In principle, this could also absorb
some of the cost-driven variation in the price of food: increases in the price of gasoline
may increase the cost of producing and transporting food; this may have different effects
in different parts of the country. In practice, however, including the price of gasoline had
little impact on the estimated effects of food price variation.
        Finally, the price of non-food goods captures the substitution and income effects
that occur when the overall cost of living rises.

D.1.2  Individual Characteristics
We include the following time-varying individual characteristics in our regression
models: age, self-reported diagnosis of chronic conditions (cancer, diabetes, heart
disease, hypertension, lung disease, stroke, arthritis, mental problems), whether self-rated
health is fair or poor; marital status, whether the respondent is working for pay, total
household income, total household wealth, and health insurance status.

D.2 Correction for sample attrition bias

Since we include only 32.0% of the initial sample (3,111 out of 9,733) in our analysis,
sample selection bias may be an issue, in the sense that our analytic sample may no
longer be representative of the study population. In particular, the question is whether
our sample selection criteria are correlated with food price and weight changes.


                                                    10
       To address sample selection bias, we adjust the sampling weights to account for
our secondary selection criteria. We first estimate a probit model of whether an
individual in the study sample will appear in the analytic sample. Regressors include
demographics, health, and economic status at the 1992 interview. We then predict the
probability of sample inclusion for those in the analytic sample, and multiply the
sampling weight by the inverse of the predicted probability. All descriptive and
regression analyses are carried out using the modified sampling weight. This procedure
addresses selection bias on the basis of observables, but we may still suffer from
selection on the basis of unobservables (Wooldridge 2002).
       The selection model is presented in Table 1. It shows that residing in rural areas
greatly decreases the probability of being included in the analytic sample. This is because
the ACCRA price data is only collected in cities. Even though we aggregate data at the
county level, those in rural counties are excluded. Individuals with diabetes at the
baseline interview are also less likely to appear in the analytic sample. In addition, non-
Hispanic blacks, Hispanic, and those with less than high school education are more likely
to be included. Finally, those with higher household wealth are also more likely to appear
in the analytic sample.
       The original sampling weight has a mean of 2,340, standard deviation of 1,048, a
minimum of 563 and a maximum of 7,710. After multiplying by the inverse of the
probability, the mean is raised to 5,813, the standard deviation 3,560, the minimum 921,
and the maximum is 26,687. Descriptive statistics of the analytic sample is shown in
Table 2.


E. Results
The key outcome variable is either BMI, or the natural logarithm of BMI. When the
outcome variable is BMI, BMI in the previous two periods are included as right-hand
side variables in equation (6). Including two periods is the minimum necessary for an
error term without autocorrelation. When the outcome is the natural log of BMI, the
natural log of BMI in the previous two periods are included. All regressions also include
the following variables: log of price of cigarettes, log of price of gasoline, log of price of
non-food goods excluding cigarettes and gasoline, self-reported diagnosis of chronic


                                                  11
conditions, self-rated health, marital status, whether working for pay, total household
income, total household wealth, health insurance status, and time dummies. We estimated
food price effects based on both Laspeyres and Paasche type of price indices. The results
are very similar. Below we only present results based on Laspeyres type of price indices.
        We are also interested in examining whether there will be heterogeneous food
price effects across demographic and socioeconomic sub-groups. First, we examine
whether individuals who are obese (BMI >= 30 kg/m2) at baseline are more or less
responsive to price change. If they are more responsive then a food tax policy would be
more effective in address the obesity problem. We add interactions of being obese at
baseline with price variables to re-estimate equation (6). We are also concerned that the
poor may be more price-elastic. We thus include the interaction terms of being at the
bottom tercile of household wealth at baseline with food price variables to re-estimate
equation (6).

E.1 Price per calorie and BMI

First we examine the effect of price per calorie on BMI or log BMI. Table 3 analyzes the
impact of price per calorie on BMI. The first column shows model estimation without
any interaction effects. BMI during the past two periods are both highly significant,
demonstrating the persistence of BMI. The coefficient of log of price per calorie is
negative and statistically significant at the 5% level. A 10% reduction in price per calorie
would lead to a BMI increase of approximately 0.22 units within two years. Coefficients
for the other price variables are insignificant.
        The second column of Table 3 shows estimation results with interaction terms
between being obese at baseline and price variables. Both the main and the interaction
term of log of price per calorie become insignificant and suggest the absence of
differential effects of food price by baseline obesity status. Estimation in the last column
of Table 3 includes interaction terms between being poor at baseline – defined as being at
the bottom tercile of the household distribution – and price variables. Both the main and
interaction term of log of per calorie are negative, but insignificant.
        Table 4 shows the effect of price per calorie on log BMI. Since the food price
variables are also in log form, the coefficients can be interpreted as elasticities. The first


                                                   12
column shows the estimation without any interaction terms. The coefficient on the log of
price per calorie is negatively and statistically significant at 1% level. Quantitatively, a
10% reduction in price per calorie would lead to a 0.6% reduction in BMI within two
years. The next two columns confirm the results in Table 4 that the food price effect does
not differ by either baseline BMI status or baseline household wealth.
          The short-term effect of price per calorie on BMI is relatively small. A 10% price
reduction would lead to a BMI increase of 0.22 units, or 0.6%. By way of comparison,
clinical guidelines suggest 10% reductions as the minimum necessary for clinically
meaningful health benefits to overweight individuals. However, the long-run effect of
price per calorie is much larger. Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the simulated change in
BMI, both in levels and in percentages, due to a permanent 10% reduction in price per
calorie. After 30 years, the price reduction will lead to a BMI increase of 1.5 units (or
3.6%). The long-term effect is an increase of 1.9 units of BMI (or 4.2%).

E.2 Comparisons to the Previous Literature

          The majority of the previous literature has examined the short-term effects of food
prices on body weight. Our results for the short-term impact of prices on BMI appear to
be roughly in line with the literature that focuses on other subpopulations. We estimate
that the short-term elasticity between the price of calories and body weight is -0.063. For
at-home food, Chou, Grossman, and Saffer (Chou, Grossman et al. 2004) estimated a
price elasticity of -0.04. Gelbach et al (Gelbach, Klick et al. 2007) find that doubling the
price of “unhealthy” food is associated with about 1 percent less BMI.
          We found that the effect of food prices on weight grow over time. Sturm and
Datar (2008) also found that the effect of food prices on body weight gain among
children became larger during a 5-year period, relative to the effect during a 3-year
period.

E.3 Identification

Our models are identified by local trends in food prices. The data reveal substantial
variation across regions in local price trends. It is natural to inquire into the sources of
these, but quite difficult to pinpoint an exact origin. We investigated several hypotheses.


                                                  13
       Several studies have found that store formats are important in explaining cross-
sectional regional price variations. One study found that food sold at Wal-Mart are on
average about 15%-25% cheaper than traditional supermarkets (Hausman and Leibtag
2004). Another study examined the effects of Wal-Mart entry on the city-level prices of
several non-food retail items, including aspirin, cigarettes, coke, detergent, and others.
The author found negative price effects of Wal-Mart entrance (Basker 2005). Motivated
by this result, we assessed whether geographic variation in the appearance of Wal-Mart
entry generated significant differences in local price trends. This failed to provide much
if any explanatory power.
       Second, we tested the hypothesis that some areas were more exposed to increases
in transportation costs for food. To test this, we tested for systematic price trend
differences across states with large and small shares of agricultural land. To be sure, this
is a fairly crude measure of local transportation costs. Perhaps due to this error in
measurement, we failed to find systematic differences in price trends across areas with
more or less agricultural land and agricultural output.
       A third option, related to transportation costs, exploits variation in the price of
gasoline (Gelbach, Klick and Stratmann, 2007). The Gelbach et al study has found that
census-region level price variation in gasoline influence the relative price of healthy food.
Moreover, while gasoline can affect incentives to exercise, its effects on the cost of
transporting goods should vary systematically across the country, depending on how far
retailers are from production sites. This serves as a source of identification that “nets
out” the common impact on exercise, and isolates the impact on transportation costs.
       Following this reasoning, we used the interactions of gasoline price and
approximate measures of per capita food production (proportion of population employed
in food manufacturing, and per capita farm area, proportion of land arable) as the
instruments for food prices. First-stage results were roughly consistent with our
assumptions – the interactions of gasoline price and per capita food output measures have
significant and negative effects on price per calorie. However, including the interactions
as instruments in the system GMM estimation raised the standard error substantially and
the effect of price per calorie becomes positive and statistically insignificant. One
interpretation is that the gasoline instrument introduces too much noise to be useful.


                                                 14
         The failure to identify a clean source of variation begs the question of whether
price trends are correlated with other economic or social factors that also influence
weight. As a partial test of this, we assessed the impact of including observable health
and economic factors on the price coefficients of interest. We re-estimated models for
the effect of price per calorie on BMI by dropping all health and economic factors. The
results are shown in Table D - 1. They are very similar to those in Table 3. The effect of
price per calorie on log BMI is also very robust to inclusion or exclusion of health and
economic factors (results not shown).

E.4 Limitations


         There are a number of limitations imposed by the data and the nature of the
problem.     First, as discussed above, local variation in food prices might not be
exogenous. If the supply of food is upward-sloping (i.e., if food prices are not primarily
cost-driven), the resulting simultaneity between supply and demand would create
downward bias in our estimated price effects. Testing this possibility would require a
plausibly valid instrument, but these are in short supply here. We explored several
candidates. First, fuel prices may influence the supply of food and ultimately body
weight. However, they may also influence incentives for exercise, and thus the demand
for weight. Moreover, the first-stage relationships between local trends in fuel prices and
local trends in food prices are – perhaps not surprisingly – quite weak. A second
candidate is local weather variation, particularly extreme weather events. These may
affect the costs of distribution and transportation of food. However, such major events
also have a variety of additional causal effects that can impact exercise, metabolism, and
economic status. In the absence of an instrument, we have presented evidence that
observed variation in economic and demographic factors are unrelated to local trends in
price. It remains possible that unobserved variation in these factors is still correlated with
price.

         As is typically the case with the analysis of price effects, measurement error is
another important issue. ACCRA price data are based on sampling a number of local
stores, but intra-city price variation may not be adequately captured. More generally, it is


                                                  15
quite difficult to measure the basket of prices faced by a particular individual who lives in
a particular part of a city. This also results in downward bias.
        Finally, we have the common problem of measurement error in weight. Our
approach was to correct for self-reporting bias using a subsample of HRS respondents for
whom data are available on measured weight and self-reported weight. Following
Cawley (2004), we impute the expected measurement error in self-reported weight for the
rest of the sample. Naturally, this strategy does not purge the measurement error; it
merely mitigates it, to the extent that our imputation contains some relevant information.
This would be a problem if error in reporting were correlated with price trends.
Unfortunately, we cannot test this directly, because we do not have a panel of data on
reporting error, which is only measured in one wave of the HRS data.


F. Conclusions
We examined both the short-term and long-term relationship between food prices of
various kinds and body weight. We found very modest short-term effects of price per
calorie on body weight, and the magnitudes align with the previous literature. We do not
find differential effects of price per calorie by baseline obesity or baseline household
wealth. Empirically, our results are best viewed as lower bounds on the true effects, due
to the possibility of measurement error and simultaneity bias.
        The long-term effect is much bigger, but it takes a long time for the effect to reach
the full scale. Within 30 years, a 10% permanent reduction in price per calorie would lead
to a BMI increase of 1.5 units (or 3.6%). The long term effect is an increase of 1.9 units
of BMI (or 4.2%).
        From a policy perspective, these results suggest that policies raising the price of
calories will have little effect on weight in the short term, but might curb the rate of
weight growth and achieve weight reduction over a very long period of time. From 1980
to 2000 the average BMI of American adults increased by about 2.7 BMI units (Chou,
Grossman, Saffer, 2004). Based on our estimates, a 10% increase in the price per calorie
would have the potential of reducing average BMI among 51 years and older by 1.2 BMI
units within 20 years, which is about 45% of the average BMI increase from 1980 to
2000.


                                                  16
          At a minimum, policymakers interested in reducing body weight will not find a
“fat tax” to be a quickly effective solution. Indeed, significant weight-reductions are
likely to post-date the decisionmaking horizon of an elected official. However, from a
positive point of view, our results suggests the importance of treating weight as a
dynamic process, and emphasize the cumulative effects of economic incentives on body
weight.

         Superlative price indices:
         People also use one of three price indexes that stands in-between the Laspeyres
index and the Paasche index. These are called superlative indices and there is no
conclusion about which one is better5.
         The three price indices are:
          (1) Fisher Ideal index: the geometric mean of the Laspeyres and Paasche indexes
(the square root of their product)
          (2) The Tornqvist index6: Tornqvist index is a discrete approximation to a
continuous Divisia index. A Divisia index is a weighted sum of the growth rates of the
various components, where the weights are the component's shares in total value. When a
Tornqvist index is used as an approximation to the continuous Divisia index, the growth
rates are defined as the difference in natural logarithms of successive observations of the
components and the weights are equal to the mean of the factor shares of the components
in the corresponding pair of years. Dt is the price index in year t, and Dt −1 is the price

index in year t-1; si ,t and pi ,t are budget share and price for component i at year t.

         log( Dt ) − log( Dt −1 ) = ∑ [ s i ,t + si ,t −1 ][log( pi ,t ) − log( pi ,t −1 )],
