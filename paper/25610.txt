                                        ABSTRACT

E-Commerce represents a rapidly growing share of consumer spending in the U.S. We use
transactions-level data on credit and debit cards from Visa, Inc. between 2007 and 2017 to
quantify the resulting consumer surplus. We estimate that E-Commerce spending reached 8% of
consumption by 2017, yielding consumers the equivalent of a 1% permanent boost to their
consumption, or over $1,000 per household. While some of the gains arose from saving travel
costs of buying from local merchants, most of the gains stemmed from substituting to online
merchants. Higher income cardholders gained more, as did consumers in more densely populated
counties.

1.        Introduction

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, E-Commerce spending doubled as a share
of retail sales from 2007 to 2017, reaching 10% of overall retail sales. In addition
to large online-only megastores, many traditional brick-and-mortar retailers
have launched online entities that sell the same products available in the re-
tailers’ physical stores.
        For consumers, shopping online differs in important ways from visiting a
brick-and-mortar store. Because online retailers are less constrained by physi-
cal space, they can offer a wider variety of products.1 E-Commerce also enables
consumers to access stores that do not have a physical location near them. Fi-
nally, consumers can purchase a product online that they may have previously
purchased at a brick-and-mortar store without making a physical trip. We refer
to these as variety gains and convenience gains, respectively.
        In this paper we attempt to quantify the benefits for consumers from the
rise of online shopping by leveraging a large and detailed dataset of consumer
purchases: the universe of Visa credit and debit card transactions between 2007
and 2017. In 2017, roughly 22% of consumption flowed through Visa. Our data
include detailed information on each transaction. We begin by describing the
features of this unique dataset and presenting some descriptive facts on the
growth of E-Commerce.
        To quantify the convenience gains from E-Commerce, we posit a simple
binary choice model of consumer behavior in which consumers decide whether
to make a purchase at a given merchant’s online or offline channel. We show
that a consumer located farther away from a given merchant’s brick-and-mortar
store is more likely to buy online. We use this distance gradient, estimates of
the cost of travel, and information on the distribution of distances of each mer-
chant’s customers to estimate the convenience value of shopping online. Using

    1
    Brynjolfsson et al. (2003) found that the number of book titles available at Amazon was
23 times larger than those available at a typical Barnes & Noble. Quan and Williams (2018)
document a related pattern in the context of shoes.
                    ASSESSING THE GAINS FROM E-COMMERCE                        3


this within-merchant substitution, we estimate that gains from convenience
reached no more than 0.4% of consumer spending by 2017.
   To quantify the variety gains from E-Commerce, we write down a model in
which variety-loving consumers can adjust the number of merchants they visit
online and offline. The gains here are increasing in the share of spending on-
line, and decreasing in the substitutability between online and offline spending.
We estimate substitutability by exploiting how spending at online vs. offline
merchants varies as a function of consumer distance to each offline merchant,
again converting travel distance into dollars. We also use variation across cards
to estimate how much consumers are willing to trade off shopping at a greater
variety of merchants vs. spending more at each merchant. Within this frame-
work, we estimate consumer gains from increased spending online to be about
1.1% of all consumption by 2017. This is tantamount to $1,150 per household
in 2017. The gains are twice as large — even as a percent of consumption —
for richer households (annual income above $50,000) than poorer households
(below $50,000), and are higher in more densely populated counties.
   Our work is related to several papers that attempt to quantify the benefit
to consumers from the internet. Goolsbee and Klenow (2006) develop an ap-
proach based on the time spent using the internet at home. Using estimates of
the opportunity cost of time, they estimate surplus for the median consumer of
2-3% of consumption. Brynjolfsson and Oh (2012) use a similar approach that
also considers data on internet speed and the share of time spent on different
websites. They estimate the value from free digital services alone to be roughly
1% of consumption. Varian (2013) estimates the value of time savings from
internet search engines. Syverson (2017) looks at the question of whether the
observed slowdown in labor productivity can be explained by mismeasurement
of digital goods and ICT more generally. He concludes that surplus from ICT is
not large enough to explain much of the productivity slowdown, which exceeds
1% per year for over a decade. Couture et al. (2018) study a program that in-
creased internet access in Chinese villages and find more modest gains.

        Our paper also contributes to a broader literature that tackles the question
of how to measure consumer surplus from new products. Broda and Weinstein
(2010) and Redding and Weinstein (2018) estimate the value of variety using
scanner data. Broda and Weinstein (2006) quantify the value of rising import
variety. Brynjolfsson et al. (2003) look at the gains to consumers from accessing
additional book titles at online booksellers.2
        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the data
and how we construct some of the key variables. Section 3 presents summary
statistics and initial facts. Sections 4 and 5 estimate, respectively, the conve-
nience and variety gains from E-Commerce. Section 6 briefly concludes. An
Online Appendix provides details about samples, measurement of E-Commerce,
the figures and tables, and solving the variety model.3



2.        Data and Variable Construction
Our primary dataset is the universe of all credit and debit card transactions in
the United States that were cleared through the Visa network between January
2007 and December 2017.4 We complement the Visa data with data from a
major credit reporting bureau, as well as publicly available information at the
county level from the U.S. Census and the Internal Revenue Service.
        Online Appendix A provides a detailed description of the data construction,
and we attempt to summarize it here. The unit of observation in the raw data
is a signature-based (not PIN-based) transaction between a cardholder and a
merchant. We observe the transaction amount, the date of the transaction, a
unique card identifier, the type of card (credit or debit), and a merchant identi-
fier and ZIP code (as well street address in the most recent years). The merchant
    2
     Quan and Williams (2018) make and illustrate the important point that, if demand is
location-specific, then representative consumer frameworks can overstate variety gains.

     The Visa network is the largest network in the market. It accounted for 40 to 50% of credit
card transaction volume and over 70% of debit card volume over this period, with Mastercard,
American Express, and Discover sharing the rest of the volume; see, e.g., https://WalletHub.

identifier is linked by Visa to the merchant’s name and industry classification
(NAICS). In contrast, cards used by the same person or household are not linked
to each other, and information about the cardholder is limited to what one
could infer from the card’s transactions (with the exception of approximately
half of the 2016 and 2017, which is matched to credit bureau data.)
       The 2007–2017 Visa data contain an annual average of 380 million cards, 35.9
billion transactions, and $1.93 trillion in sales. Of these sales, 55% were credit
transactions and 45% were debit transactions. Figure 1 presents Visa spending
as a share of U.S. consumption and nominal GDP, respectively. Visa volume has
been steadily increasing over time, from approximately 14% of consumption
in 2007 to almost 22% of consumption in 2017.5 In Section 4 below, where we
focus on substitution between online and offline channels within a merchant,
we further limit the analysis to the five retail NAICS categories where the online
transaction share was between 10% and 90%.6
       Key variables. Each transaction indicates whether it occurred in person
(“CP” for Card Present, meaning that the card was physically swiped) or not
(“CNP” for Card Not Present). Roughly half of CNP transactions are broken fur-
ther into E-Commerce, mail order, phone order, and recurring transactions. We
treat phone, mail, and recurring transactions as offline. For CNP transactions
with missing breakdowns, we assume the E-Commerce fraction is the same
as the fraction of non-missing CNP values that is classified as E-Commerce.

Indicator within CNP transactions, i as the 3-digit NAICS category, and t as the

     Our analysis sample uses all transactions between 2007 and 2017 that pass standard filters
used by the Visa analytics team. We exclude transactions at merchants not located in the U.S.,
those not classified as sales drafts, and those that did not occur on the Visa credit/signature
debit network (transactions not involving sales drafts include chargebacks, credit voucher fees,
and other miscellaneous charges.) We also drop cards that transact with fewer than 5 merchants
over the card’s lifetime, as many of the dropped cards are specialized gift cards.

     Census Bureau NAICS codes 44 and 45 cover Retail Trade. Based on their online
transaction share in the Visa data, we use merchants in the following five categories to estimate
convenience gains: furniture and home furnishings stores; electronics and appliance stores;
clothing and clothing accessories stores; sporting goods, hobby, musical instruments and book
stores; miscellaneous store retailers.

    Table 1 lists the NAICS categories that contain a nontrivial share of spend-
ing with the ECI flag. This includes many retail and some non-retail NAICS
categories. It excludes NAICS categories such as Communication, which con-
tains ample CNP spending on cell phone bills but which occurs predominantly
through recurring payments. The non-retail NAICS categories with a signifi-
cant ECI presence are all related to travel and transportation. We include these
NAICS categories in our analysis on the grounds that they provide convenience
and variety benefits akin to online options in retail NAICS categories (e.g. book-
ing travel online rather than visiting or calling travel agent).

        Two other important variables in our analysis are card location and income.
We infer a card’s preferred shopping location from its transaction history. Recall
that we observe the 5-digit ZIP code of the merchant for each offline transac-
tion. We use this to define a card’s location as a longitude-latitude pair given by
the transaction-weighted average ZIP centroid.7 Using this card location vari-
able, we then construct a distance variable for each offline transaction, which
is given by the straight-line distance between the longitude-latitude pair of the
card and the longitude-latitude pair of the merchant’s ZIP centroid (recall that
we do not observe the merchant’s street address).
        For about 50% of the credit cards in 2016 and 2017, we have more precise
information about the cardholder residential address as well as income from
a large credit rating agency. We use this location as a robustness check on
our estimates with shopping centroid. We use income to break down online
spending shares and the gains from E-Commerce by affluence.



3.        Summary Statistics and Initial Facts

The growth of online spending. We start by documenting the increasing im-
portance of online spending during our sample. Table 2 documents the rising
share of online spending within Visa in selected NAICS categories. The online
share was already quite high in 2007 in some categories, such as air transport.
And in some categories, such as food, the online share remained low in 2017.8
        To estimate the share of online spending in all U.S. consumption, we first
scale up Visa online spending by the inverse of Visa’s share in national credit
and debit card spending. This assumes Visa spending is representative of all
card spending in terms of its online share, and that all spending online occurs
through debit and credit cards. Finally, we divide by overall U.S. consumption

    7
      We limit attention to ZIP codes in which the card transacted 20 or more times over the card’s
lifetime in order to omit transactions that were not part of the card’s primary purchasing area.
This means that less active cards are excluded from our analysis that uses card location.
    8
      NAICS categories such as gasoline had essentially no online spending in either year.

      Figure 2 shows our estimates of the share of online spending in all consump-
tion from 2007 and 2017, growing from about 5% of spending in 2007 to almost
8% in 2017. Defined more narrowly using retail NAICS categories, the online
share rose from about 3.5% in 2007 to 5% in 2017.

Heterogeneity by income and population density. There are two primary chan-
nels by which consumers likely benefit from the increased availability of the
online channel: convenience and availability. From a convenience perspective,
E-Commerce allows consumers to avoid the trip to the offline store, and the po-
tential time and hassle costs associated with parking, transacting, and carrying
home the purchased items. It seems plausible that these convenience benefits
are largest for more affluent consumers.
      The availability benefits might be particularly important for consumers who

credit and debit card spending at WalletHub.com (https://WalletHub.com/edu/

         Note: We estimate E-Commerce spending on the Visa network and extrapolate
         it to the the U.S. economy assuming: 1) that Visa is representative of all card
         spending in terms of online share, and 2) all online spending is done using
         credit or debit cards. ‘All online’ refers to our baseline estimate of E-Commerce
         spending in all consumer categories. ‘Retail online only’ refers to our alternative
         estimate which only counts online spending in retail industries as E-Commerce.

live in more rural areas and smaller cities, where there are fewer offline mer-
chants.10 E-Commerce is essentially available to everyone everywhere, thus
making many more merchants available to consumers.
      Even though we observe (estimated) income for about one-half of Visa credit
cards in 2016 and 2017 through a credit bureau, not all households have credit
or debit cards. To adjust for the card-less, we scale down the Visa online spend-
ing share in a given county-income pair by the ratio of Visa cards to the number
of IRS tax return filers and dependents in that county-income pair:


                                      Visa online spendingcy
                              scy =                          · αcy
                                       Total Visa spendingcy

      See Handbury and Weinstein (2014) for evidence that variety is greater in larger cities.

where scy is our estimate of the online share of all consumption for income
group y in county c, and αcy is our estimate of the share of households with
cards in that group:

                                      # of Visa Cardscy
                              αcy =
                                         Tax Filerscy

Again, we are assuming online spending only occurs through credit and debit
cards, so the cardless are not online at all. See Online Appendix C for details. In
the final step we scale down all scy values so that they aggregate to our estimated
total U.S. E-Commerce share.
     We estimate an online share of 3.4% of consumption for households with in-
comes of $50k and below in 2017, and 9.7% of consumption for households with
incomes above $50k. If we sort counties by 2010 Census population per square
mile, counties with above-median population density have a population-weighted
average online share of 9.1% of consumption, whereas below-median counties
have an average online share of 6.4%. This is perhaps surprising because the
density of brick-and-mortar retailers is increasing in population density.
     Figure 3 displays our online share estimates for all U.S. counties in 2017.
Online penetration is distinctly higher in the Northeast and in the West and
Mountain regions than in the South or Midwest.



4.     Estimates of Convenience Surplus

In this section we focus on a specific gain from E-Commerce: avoiding travel
to a physical store by buying the same basket of goods from the merchant’s E-
Commerce channel. Given E-Commerce provides a wider set of merchants than
what would otherwise be available to consumers, this direct convenience gain
is surely be smaller than the overall gain, which accounts for merchant substi-
tution. Yet, it seems natural to begin by assessing the gain from convenience
given that doing so is simpler and requires fewer modeling assumptions.

                      Figure 3: Online shares by county in 2017




     Note: This figure displays the online share in each county calculated from the Visa
     data and adjusted by the propensity of county residents to use a credit card. Each
     card is placed in a county-income bin according to their home billing ZIP code
     and estimated household income. We compute the online share for each county-
     income bin from their Visa credit card spending and multiply it by the ratio of credit
     card accounts to population in that county income bin, normalized to match our
     estimate of the aggregate online share of spending. As a measure of population in
     each county-income bin, we use IRS data on the number of tax filers. The plot shows
     the online share (aggregated across cardholders of different incomes) within each
     county. See Online Appendix C for more details.

Specification. To quantify these convenience gains, we estimate a simple bi-
nary choice between online and offline transaction. We assume consumers
know the prices and items they will buy from which merchants. We make the
strong assumption that prices are the same online and offline for a given mer-
chant, consistent with evidence in Cavallo (2017). The only remaining choice is
thus whether to transact online or offline.
       We assume utility for consumer i of buying online at merchant j is


                                        uoij = γjo + oij ,                                  (1)


where γjo is the average merchant-specific utility from the online channel and oij
is an online consumer-merchant component, which we assume is drawn from
a type I extreme value distribution, iid across merchants and consumers.
       We assume utility for consumer i of buying offline at merchant j is


                                 ubij = γjb − β · distij + bij ,                            (2)


where γjb is the average merchant-specific utility from the offline channel, and
distij is the straight-line distance between the location of consumer i and the
nearest store of merchant j.11 bij is an offline consumer-merchant component,
which we assume is similarly drawn from a type I extreme value distribution,
iid across merchants and consumers.
       Equations (1) and (2) give rise to a simple logit regression of an indicator
variable that is equal to 1 for an online purchase (and 0 for an offline purchase)
on distance distij and merchant fixed effects.

Estimation and results. We estimate this logit specification on a random sam-
ple of 1% of all cards in 2017 for which we observe the home ZIP code. To
capture merchants where the choice of online and offline is meaningful, we
use transactions in the five mixed-channel retail categories (described in the

consumer is based on the centroid of the ZIP+4 billing ZIP code.

previous section) where the consumer was within 50 miles of the offline store.
      Table 3 presents summary statistics for this sample. Online transactions ac-
count for 15-30% of the overall number of transactions and for 25-40% of the to-
tal dollar amount, except for electronics where the online share of transactions
is much greater (47% of transactions). The most robust pattern in Table 3 is the
distance of the consumer to the nearest offline store, which is systematically
shorter for offline transactions than for online ones. This is the key variation
which we rely on in the analysis below.

 The table shows summary statistics for the transactions used in the convenience analysis. The ticket size panel gives the average
 dollars per transaction for each NAICS and channel (online or offline). Distance to the nearest store is calculated as the as-the-
 crow-flies distance between a consumer's location and the nearest offline branch of the merchant where the transaction was
 made. The first row in each of the bottom two panels contains the average ticket size or distance. The numbers below, in
 parentheses, are the 10th and 90th percentiles.




      Figure 4 pools across the five retail categories, and relates the online share
to distance in the raw data, as well as the estimated relationship using the logit
specification. As expected, the online share increases with distance. That is, as
the nearest brick-and-mortar store is further away, the online channel becomes
relatively more attractive, and the online share increases. Comparing cases
where the offline store is nearby to cases where the offline store is 30-50 miles
away, the online share roughly triples, from approximately 14% to 45%.

              Figure 4: Online share vs. distance to merchant store




    Note: The figure shows the share of transactions that occur online as a function of
    the distance between the card and the nearest outlet of the merchant. The sample
    includes transactions made by 1% of cards in 2017 at merchants in the five mixed-
    channel NAICS categories listed in the data section. We include transactions at
    merchants that had a location within 50 miles of the card’s billing ZIP code. The
    black line shows a bin scatter of the share of these transactions that occurred online
    in the raw data. Each point gives the average share of transactions that were online
    for cards in a bin of size one mile. For example, the leftmost point on the black
    line shows that cards that were between zero and one mile away from an outlet
    of a merchant conducted about 12% of their transactions with that merchant in
    the online channel. The grey line shows the predicted share of online transactions
    from a logit regression of an indicator for whether the transaction was online on the
    distance between the card and merchant and a set of merchant fixed effects.




   Using our logit specification, we estimate a β coefficient of 0.023 (with a
standard error less than 0.00001), which implies that moving a consumer from
10 to 20 miles away from a physical store increases the share of purchases made
online by approximately 3 percentage points. Estimates of convenience gains.
This simple model allows us to estimate the value of E-Commerce in a straight-
forward way. We can evaluate the consumer surplus from E-Commerce using
the difference between consumer surplus when both online and offline options
16                   DOLFEN, EINAV, KLENOW, KLOPACK, LEVIN2 & BEST



are available and when only the offline option is available. Applying the well-
known properties of the extreme value distribution, the convenience gain of
each transaction by consumer i at merchant j is

                      ln[exp(γjb − β · distij ) + exp(γjo )] − (γjb − β · distij )
              ∆CSij =                                                              .        (3)

       We do not observe and therefore do not use prices in our analysis. Instead,
we use travel distance as a determinant of the full price. To monetize miles, we
assume that each mile costs $0.80 in time costs and $0.79 in direct costs, for a
total of $1.59 for each one-way mile and $3.18 for each round-trip mile between
the consumer and the store.12
       Applying equation (3) to all the transactions in our data, we obtain an aver-
age convenience gain (across all transactions in the sample) of 11.3 mile equiv-
alents. Using the conversion factor above ($3.18 per round trip mile), the con-
venience gain per transaction comes to $36 dollars.
       The average ticket size in our sample is $88 and the average distance be-
tween consumer and store is 7 miles. Thus convenience gains from the online
option are on the order of 32% for purchases in the five NAICS categories used
in the estimation. Together, transactions in these five categories made by con-
sumers who were closer than 50 miles to an offline outlet of the same merchant
make up about 7% of all dollars, implying that the total convenience gains as a
share of Visa spending of about 2.2%, or roughly 0.4% of all consumption.




  12
    To obtain the monetary cost of a mile, we use estimates from Einav et al. (2016), who report
summary statistics for a large number of short-distance trips of breast cancer patients. They
report that an average trip takes 10.9 minutes to travel 5.3 straight-line miles, with an actual
driving distance of 7.9 miles. The BLS reports that the average hourly wage from 2007–2017
was $23 per hour after tax. As an estimate for the driving cost, we use the average of the IRS
reimbursement rate from 2007–2017 of $0.535 per mile, which considers the cost of fuel and
depreciation of the car. Thus, the time cost of driving one mile is given by $23/60 · 10.9/5.3 =
$0.80 and the driving cost of of one mile is $0.535 · 7.9/5.3 = $0.79.

  Each cell in the table gives the share of total online spending in 2014 by the amount of offline and online dollars spent at a given
  merchant by a card. Each observation in the underlying data is a card-merchant combination with an entry for offline and online
  spending. For example, the cell in the first row and third column contains the share of online dollars corresponding to card-
  merchant combinations where a card spent $0 offline at a merchant and between $10 and $100 online at that same merchant.
  The "total" row (column) gives the sum of the cells across all columns (rows) in that row (column). All cells (excluding the total
  row and column) sum to 1.




5.        Estimates of variety surplus

While the model in the previous section allows us to place some quantitative
bounds on an important benefit from E-Commerce, it does not allow for sub-
stitution across merchants, thereby ignoring potential consumer gains from
access to a wider variety of shopping options.
     This channel may be first order. The set of merchants that consumers visit
online and offline are largely different. To illustrate this, in Table 4 we show the
proportion of online spending that occurred at merchants where a given card
also shopped offline. Each entry in the table gives the share of online spending
by the amount the same card spent offline at that merchant. For example, the
entry in the first row, third column shows that 10% of total online sales were
made at merchants for which cards spent $0 offline and between $10 and $100
online. The table shows that 88% of online spending occurred at merchants that
were not visited offline, suggesting that cross-merchant substitution may be a
predominant source of consumer surplus.

5.1.      Model Setup


To capture these gains from variety, we write down a stylized model that allows
substitution across merchants and calibrate it using moments calculated from
the Visa data.

Consumer problem. Consumers allocate spending across a set of M merchants
in both online and offline channels, and must pay fixed costs that are increasing
in the number of merchants visited. Consumers maximize:

them, Mb (Mo ) is the number of merchants shopped at in-store (online), Fb (Fo )
are the fixed costs of shopping in-store (online), and w is the consumer’s wage
income (the same as the nominal wage given a fixed unit of labor supply per
consumers).
       The parameter σ is the elasticity of substitution across merchants. Values of
σ < ∞ imply a “love of variety.” The parameter φ governs how fast fixed costs to
visiting merchants increase with the number of merchants visited. We assume
that φ > 1 to get an interior solution.13




  13
    This convex cost specification can be thought of as a reduced-form for a menu of merchants
with rising fixed costs of shopping at them.

                               Mj,market

where ym denotes the total units sold across all consumers, Lm is the labor
employed by the merchant, Kj is overhead labor, L is the total number of con-
sumers, and Zm is productivity for merchant m. Here j = o or b, so overhead
labor is allowed to differ for online versus offline merchants.
       We make the simplifying assumption that each brick-and-mortar (online)
seller is entertained by a random subset of the L consumers. For example,
suppose Mj ≤ Mj,market is 90%. Then each consumer entertains a random 90%
of the merchants. The consumer then decides how much to buy from each
merchant they visit based on their CES preferences in (4) above. Merchants
are monopolistic competitors who face an elasticity of demand σ from the cus-
tomers who visit them. Merchants price to sell to the customers who visit them,
but do not price to entice more customers to visit them because of the random
assignment. We make this assumption to simplify the pricing problem and
because we cannot see merchant prices in the Visa data.14

Shopping technology. Firms in transportation/internet sectors hire labor Lb
to produce transportation services to help consumers access brick-and-mortar
retailers, and hire labor Lo to provide internet/computer services to help con-
sumers access online retailers:


                                  L · Mbφ = Yb = Ab Lb


                                  L · Moφ = Yo = Ao Lo

    Cavallo (2018) presents evidence that online competition has changed pricing patterns (e.g.
the frequency of price changes) and inflation dynamics (such as exchange rate pass-through.
See Goolsbee and Klenow (2018) for evidence that inflation is lower online than offline.

     This sector is perfectly competitive so that its firms price at marginal cost:

                                     w           w
                              Fb =      and Fo =
                                     Ab          Ao

The transportation/internet technologies therefore pin down the “intercept”
of the convex costs of accessing merchants offline (picture driving longer dis-
tances to access more) and online (imagine some retailers provide more con-
venient account sign-up) given above. The share of consumer spending online
may have risen, in part, because it has become easier to access online mer-
chants due to rising Ao and therefore falling Fo .

Free entry and market clearing. We allow free entry because we want to cap-
ture the possibility that the rise of online spending has come at the expense of
offline merchants. This could take the form of a shrinking number of brick-and-
mortar merchants, ceteris paribus, cutting into the gains consumers enjoy from
online spending.
     For each market j, we assume that expected profits across merchants offline
(online) are zero:
                                     Ej [πm ] = 0

     Thus the number of online and offline merchants is determined endoge-
nously so that any variable profits just offset the cost of overhead labor. This
follows the well-known Hopenhayn (1992) structure wherein firms pay the over-
head cost before observing their productivity draw Zm . They enter to the point
where expected profits is zero.
     Meanwhile, labor market clearing requires

                     X
              L =        Lm + Mb,market Kb + Mo,market Ko + Lb + Lo
                     m


as economy-wide labor is allocated to merchant production of consumer goods,
merchant overhead, and transportation and internet services.

5.2.       Model Solution

Symmetric technologies and outcomes. To focus on the online versus offline
dimension, we now assume symmetry in many places. In particular, we assume
all merchants have the same process efficiency:


                                             Zm = Z


       We assume all offline (online) merchants have the same quality, though we
do allow quality to differ offline and online:


                                  qm = qb for m ∈ Mb,market

                                  qm = qo for m ∈ Mo,market

       Because all merchants face the same wage, have the same process efficiency,
and are monopolistic competitors facing the common elasticity of demand σ,
they price at a common markup over their common marginal cost:

                                                     σ   w
                                      pm = p =         ·
                                                    σ−1 Z

       With prices the same, consumers will spend the same amount (pm xm ) at
each offline and online merchant. Denote these spending levels o online and
b offline. Spending per merchant online versus offline satisfies15
                                                       σ−1
                                         o         qo

                                         b         qb

The higher is quality online relative to offline, the higher the spending per mer-
chant online relative to offline.
       In turn, merchant profits online and offline are

                                              . The number of online merchants relative to
offline merchants – both available and visited – increases in their relative quality
(qo /qb ) and ease of access (Ao /Ab ).
       The utility-maximizing share of spending online is

                                                oMo        k

                                              oMo + bMb   k+1

The online share so rises with qo /qb and Ao /Ab . Consumers gain from rising so
if it is due to a combination of online options becoming better (rising qo ) and
easier access to online merchants (rising Ao ).
       Consumption-equivalent welfare is proportional to16

Welfare is increasing in process efficiency (Z) and the variety (M ) and quality
(q̄) of merchants visited. In terms of exogenous driving forces, consumption-
equivalent welfare is proportional to

Consumers are better off if process efficiency rises (higher A), the quality of
products available improves (higher qb and qo ), and if shopping becomes easier
offline (higher Ab ) and/or online (higher Ao ).
   For given Z, qb , Ab , consumer gains from rising qo and Ao can be quantified
from so , the share of spending online, and the values for parameters σ and φ:

Welfare gains are increasing in so , which itself is increasing in the quality and
accessibility of online options. For given so , the gains are falling with σ. Con-
sumers can more easily substitute from offline to online options when σ is higher,
so online offerings do not need to improve as much (in quality or accessibility)
to explain a given rise in online share. Also for given so , the gains are increasing
in φ. The harder it is to add merchants visited online or offline, the bigger the
improvement in the online option needed to explain a given rise in online share.



5.3.   Calibration of φ and σ

We first estimate φ, the parameter that governs the convexity of fixed costs with
respect to the number of merchants visited. To do this, we exploit how φ affects
the relationship between total expenditure (oMo + bMb ), spending per merchant
(o and b), and the number of merchants visited (Mo and Mb ) across consumers.
A higher value of φ gives rise to a steeper Engel curve on the intensive margin,
with an elasticity of 1 − 1/φ for spending per merchant, and a flatter Engel curve
on the extensive margin, with an elasticity of 1/φ for the number of merchants
24                   DOLFEN, EINAV, KLENOW, KLOPACK, LEVIN2 & BEST



visited. We obtain an estimate for φ using empirical Engel curves.
       Specifically, we exploit the following decomposition of spending into the
extensive and intensive margins:

                                                1
                                  ln M = α +      · ln(oMo + bMb )                              (7)
                                                φ

                                          
                               oMo + bMb             φ−1
                      ln                       =η+       · ln(oMo + bMb )                       (8)
                                  M                   φ


where M = Mo + Mb . To consistently estimate the parameter φ from (7) and
(8) via OLS, we must assume that any idiosyncratic fixed shopping costs are
uncorrelated with total spending across consumers.17
       In Table 5, we present our estimates for φ. We perform the estimation sepa-
rately for 2007 and 2017. Across the two years the average point estimate is 1.74.
The standard errors are too small to mention given the hundreds of millions
of cards in each regression. A φ of 2 would imply that 50% of additional card
spending is on the extensive margin and 50% is on the intensive margin. Our
estimate is modestly below 2, implying the extensive margin accounts for 57%
of and the intensive margin accounts for 43% of variation across high and low
spending cards.18
       To calibrate σ, the elasticity of substitution across merchants, we use varia-
tion in online spending induced by physical distance between each card i and
each brick-and-mortar merchant j. We assume a cardholder’s distance to phys-
ical stores is uncorrelated with individual shopping costs online versus at phys-
ical stores (conditional on chain fixed effects).
  17
      Since the decomposition is exact, the estimate of φ will be identical regardless of which of
the two equations is used.
   18
      We are concerned that high income individuals have a high opportunity cost of time, and
hence high fixed shopping costs. This could bias φ upward, leading us to overstate the gains
from e-commerce. To gauge how big a problem this might be, we used the credit reporting
agency data to control for household income for Visa credit cards in 2017. As expected, for
given card spending, richer households purchased from fewer merchants. But the implied φ
fell very little, from 1.69 to 1.68, once controlling for income. See the notes on Table 5 in Online
Appendix C.

      Note: Each column represents a separate regression. The estimates of φ are from
      the OLS regression ln M = α + φ1 · ln (oMo + bMb ) + , where M denotes distinct
      merchants visited and oMo + bMb . One observation is a card-year. We run this
      regression separately for 2007 and 2017.




   We estimate the elasticity of substitution using purchases for the 1% sample
of cards in 2017 described in Section 4. For each card i, we look at online
purchases as well as offline purchases made within 20 miles of i’s location. We
construct, for each individual i and NAICS category, all pairs of physical stores
j and online merchants k such that i buys from at least one of these. We then
calculate the share of combined trips for each pair that were made online, and
average across cards for each NAICS category. In Figure 5, we show this frac-
tion of combined purchases made online as a function of card distance to each
physical store.
   For comparison, We also generate an offline substitution estimate by con-
structing all pairs of physical stores j and k such that i buys in at least one
of these stores and compute |distij − distik |. We then calculate the share of
combined trips for each pair that were made to the farther store, and average
across cards for each NAICS category. See Figure A1 in Online Appendix C.
   As in the convenience analysis, we convert distance into effective price vari-
ation. We estimate a roundtrip mile involves $3.18 in direct and indirect travel

       Note: This graph is based on a 1% random sample of cards in 2017. The underlying
       observations are card-store-merchant triples such that the card transacted either
       offline at the store or online at the merchant (or both), the store is within 20 miles of
       the cards, and the store and the merchant are in the same 3-digit retail E-Commerce

costs. We add these travel costs to the average ticket size of Visa transactions
in the pair of merchants. This gives us the relative price of the total bundle —
Visa ticket size plus travel costs — for going to the closer store (or shopping
online) vs. the farther store (or the brick-and-mortar store). We then regress
the log relative number of trips on log relative prices inclusive of travel costs,
controlling for merchant fixed effects:19


  19
   The number of trips corresponds to the quantities xm in our model if we assume a fixed
basket of items bought at the same prices across competing outlets.

pair observations, so the standard errors are tiny. The high R2 of 0.97 indicates
that merchant fixed effects plus distance account for almost all variation in rel-
ative trips to merchants. Still, there could be endogeneity bias if people locate
closer to merchants they prefer. This would bias our estimate of σ upward.
   For comparison, Table 6 also reports our estimate of the elasticity of substi-
tution across offline merchants. This is higher at σ = 6.1. Although our model
preferences feature a common σ, we think the σ for online-offline competition
is the relevant one for evaluating the gains to consumers from switching from
offline to online spending. We will report robustness of our welfare calculation
to using the higher σ across physical stores.
   In Online Appendix C we check robustness of our σ estimates to using card
and merchant longitude-latitude, rather than ZIP-centroid. We only have card
location for the 50% of credit cards for which we have credit bureau data. In
Appendix Table A.1 we report these σ estimates. Using ZIP-centroids to locate
cards, the narrower credit bureau sample yields a higher σ of 5.8, compared to
our baseline estimate of σ = 4.3 with debit cards and all credit cards. When we
use card and merchant addresses, σ rises modestly from 5.8 to 6.3. We do not
make this the baseline since the sample is restricted. Also, since cardholders
can make multi-destination shopping trips, it is not clear whether the card ad-
dress or shopping ZIP-centroid is a better yardstick for shopping distance. Still,
we report robustness below to using a value of σ in excess of 6.

5.4.    Consumer surplus

Using our estimates of φ and σ and the online share so calculated from the
Visa data, we can calculate consumption-equivalent changes in consumer wel-
fare from the rise of E-Commerce. We present our estimates for these wel-
fare gains in Table 7. Using our baseline estimates of φ and σ, we calculate
an increase in consumer surplus equivalent to 0.38% between 2007 and 2017.
Relative to a counterfactual where the online channel is completely unavailable,
E-Commerce in 2017 resulted in gains for consumers of 1.06% overall. These
counterfactuals assume fixed levels of quality and accessibility offline (qb and
Ab ) and fixed efficiency in producing goods (Z). Thus, they involve increasing
quality and accessibility of online merchants (qo and Ao ) to account for the rise
in the spending share of online merchants (so ).

         denotes the U.S. online share in that year (holding Z, Ab and qb constant). The
         results are obtained by substituting in the respective values of s, φ and σ.



       Table 7 also illustrates how the gains change with the parameter values. If
we use the lower φ estimated from spending on offline merchantes only (1.58
versus the baseline value of 1.74), the welfare gains fall from 1.06% to 0.91% of
consumption. If we use the higher, offline σ of 6.1 (rather than 4.3) the gains fall
to 0.68% of consumption. These sensitivity checks go in the expected direction.
       As we highlighted in Section 3, the online share is not uniform across the
U.S. population. Households with incomes above $50k and in more densely
populated counties exhibited higher online shares. In Tables 8 we show welfare
gains by splits of income and county population density.20
       Cardholders with income of $50k or less enjoyed gains equivalent to 0.45%
of their consumption from online shopping. Richer households enjoyed more
twice the gains at 1.3% of their consumption. The gains were also increasing in
population density, rising from 0.85% for the sparsest counties to 1.2% for the
most densely populated counties.
  20
    We use the same φ and σ values of 1.74 and 4.3 for every group, but use group-specific
online spending shares so .

                      Above-median density                1.24%




       We have framed these gains as a percentage of all consumption, but it is
also interesting to express consumption-equivalent surplus as a share of online
spending. Since E-Commerce ends up at around 8% of consumption, by our
estimate, surplus is equivalent to about 14% of E-Commerce spending.21
       We have assumed the online share of Visa spending is representative of all
credit and debit card spending. If we assume, further, that Visa is representative
within each NAICS category, then we can entertain a nested CES structure as a
robustness check. Substitutability is surely higher within than across NAICS
categories, whereas our CES utility in equation (4) assumes the same elasticity
within and across NAICS categories.22
       By moving to a nested CES structure, we can allow σ to vary by NAICS cate-
gory. We implement this for ten 3-digit NAICS categories with a physical store
component along with online spending. For five 3-digit NAICS categories which
are big online but have little offline spending (such as Air Transportation), we

  21
     This is modest compared to the Cohen, Hahn, Hall, Levitt and Metcalfe (2016) estimate of
consumer surplus equal to 160% of spending on Uber.
  22
     We did estimate σ across merchants within NAICS categories, above, keeping in mind that
such substitutability was sure to be higher.

        Note: Estimates are across offline versus online merchants within each listed
        NAICS category. For other E-Commerce NAICS categories (Air Transportation,
        Ground Transportation, Rental and Leasing Services, Administrative and Support
        Services, Accommodation) the offline component was sufficiently limited that
        we used the overall offline-online estimate of σ = 4.3. See Online Appendix C for
        more details



use the overall estimate of σ = 4.3. We do the same for a 16th catch-all category
containing all NAICS sectors dominated by offline spending (such as Gasoline).
Table 9 provides the σ estimates for the 10 overlapping online-offline categories,
ranked from most to least substitutability. The elasticity ranges from a high of
7.7 for building maetrials and garden supplies to a low of 3.4 for electronics and
appliance stores. We assume the upper nest, which aggregates our 16 lower CES
nests, is simply Cobb-Douglas.
      An ambiguity that arises with the nests is how to treat the nonstore retailer
NAICS category, which contains online-only retailers such as Amazon. We allo-
cate nonstore retail spending based on estimates of Amazon’s sales by NAICS.23
That is, we allocate nonstore retailer spending into electronics and appliances,
clothing, etc. based on estimates of the distribution of Amazon’s sales.

         results are obtained by substituting in the sector specific online shares sm and
         elasticities of substitution σm . The outer nest Cobb-Douglas elasticities αm are
         calibrated using spending shares.



       In Table 10 we report the welfare gain under nested CES. Whereas the gain
is 1.06% of consumption with a single nest, the gain is 1.62% of consumption
with 16 nests. The 16 nests are aggregated via Cobb-Douglas, which implies
more limited substitutability across NAICS categories than in our baseline sin-
gle CES formulation. We hesitate to make this nested approach our baseline,
however, because of the uncertainty in allocating nonstore retail spending to
other NAICS categories, and in extrapolating Visa spending to all card spending
within NAICS categories.
       Our stylized model features free entry for both offline and online merchants.
As a result, the shift in consumer spending has no impact on producer surplus.
Still, within the model we can ask what the rise of E-Commerce did to brick-
and-mortar merchants. Table 11 indicates the effect of rising qo and Ao , holding
fixed Z, L, qb and Ab . Interestingly, the effects are rather modest: a 3.7% decline
in spending at brick and mortar stores, with a 1.6% decline in spending per
surviving physical store and 2.1% decline in the number of physical stores. The
effect on the profits of brick-and-mortar retailers is zero by construction.24
  24
     Farrell et al. (2018) document the lackluster growth in offline retail spending amid rapidly
rising retail spending. Relihan (2017) estimates that online grocery shopping crowds out offline
grocery shopping, but crowds in spending at coffee shops.

6.     Conclusion
We take advantage of a unique data source — all credit and debit card transac-
tions in the U.S. running through the Visa network — and attempt to quantify
the consumer gains associated with the rise of E-Commerce.
     We report two estimates. The first is the pure convenience gain, which we
think of as the ability to purchase online instead of offline exactly the same
set of items from the same merchant at the same prices. We estimate a binary
consumer choice of online vs. offline transactions, and find convenience gains
equivalent to at most 0.4% of consumption. We then write down a representa-
tive consumer model which allows for substitution across merchants and vari-
ety gains. Our main estimate using this model is a welfare gain equivalent to
over 1% of consumption in 2017, or over $1,000 per household.
     Obviously, any single number that attempts to summarize such a dramatic
change in purchasing behavior should be taken with great caution. First, sur-
plus is likely to be even more heterogeneous than we have characterized – e.g.,
across product categories and consumer locations. Second, it relies on highly
stylized modeling assumptions. Decomposing this estimate across products
and consumers is a promising agenda for future work, as would be assessing
the sensitivity of these estimates to alternative assumptions.
     The Visa data is unique in its granularity and coverage, and as such allows us
to obtain an estimate that covers multiple consumer sectors. At the same time, a
primary limitation of the Visa data is that we only observe spending, not prices,
and our primary strategy in this paper is to use variation in travel distance and
monetize it. This type of analysis is complementary to existing work that uses
more detailed data on transactions, albeit in a narrower context of data, such as
books, shoes, or airlines.
