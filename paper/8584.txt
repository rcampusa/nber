                                               ABSTRACT


         In this paper we focus on the different historical regime experiences of the core and the periphery.
Before 1914 advanced countries adhered to gold while periphery countries either emulated the advanced
countries or floated. Some peripheral countries were especially vulnerable to financial crises and debt
default in large part because of their extensive external debt obligations denominated in core country
currencies. This left them with the difficult choice of floating but restricting external borrowing or
devoting considerable resources to maintaining an extra hard peg. Today while advanced countries can
successfully float, emergers who are less financially mature and must borrow abroad in terms of advanced
country currencies, are afraid to float for the same reason as their nineteenth century forbearers. To obtain
access to foreign capital they may need a hard peg to the core country currencies. Thus the key distinction
between core and periphery countries both then and now that we emphasize in this paper is financial
maturity, evidenced in the ability to issue international securities denominated in domestic currency.
Evidence in Section 2 from Feldstein-Horioka tests 1880-1997 agrees with the ‘Folk” wisdom that
financial integration was as high before 1914 as it is today. But the evidence suggests that it was not the
exchange rate regime followed that mattered but the presence of capital controls. Moreover the financial
integration observed for the recent period is largely an advanced country phenomenon Section 3 lays out
the financial maturity hypothesis, presents narrative evidence for the pre-1914 period of the different
experiences of the core and peripheral countries in adhering to the gold standard, and documents that for
the emerging countries, plus ca change. Finally, Section 4 presents empirical evidence for core and
peripheral countries 1880-1913 and today based on traditional money demand regressions suggesting a
strong link between financial depth and the exchange rate regime.

    and Globalization

    Section 1. Introduction



    Historians know the crucial importance played by the boundary that separated the core

of the Roman Empire from its periphery – a boundary known as the Limes. On top of

being a line of military defense, it was a locus of cross influences. While the “core”

contributed to shaping the ‘barbarous’ lands located beyond its walls, the “periphery”

shaped the inner areas, since protection from the dangers of military conflict involved

providing for such outcomes. And for reasons that are hard to understand, the long

survival of this frontier extended long after the fall of the Roman Empire: more than 10

centuries after its collapse, the former Limes surprisingly coincided with the line that

separated Christians during the religious wars, between Protestants and Roman Catholics.

    In comparison with this very long run phenomenon, the experience of the international

monetary system is that of a toddler. And yet the recent turmoil in international financial

markets has forced economists and policy makers to come to grips with something

similar. The recent discussions on the exchange rate regimes that are advisable in order to

cope with financial instability rest on the observation that the challenges of globalization

are not quite the same depending on whether we focus on developing countries and

emerging markets or developed ones. While the latter are free to go their exchange rate

way, the former are said to face the dilemma of either anchoring themselves to core

countries with extra strong glue, or remaining out of the Limes of modern integration

with a volatile exchange rate.

   As a recent literature has argued, there is a certain “fear of floating” among modern

developing countries. But this is obviously nihil novi sub sole for economic historians

familiar with that other major experience of globalization, namely that of the late

nineteenth century. For then, already, there was a “core” that followed the high road of

more or less complete gold convertibility, and an infamous “periphery” that had trouble

pegging but resented floating. And it is striking that the list of “peripheral” nations has

not changed that much over the course of the century: today like yesterday it includes

Latin American countries, Central Europe, Russia, and to some extent Asia –among the

latter, Japan was already standing out as an exception2.

   This persistence nonetheless conceals a profound transformation of the international

monetary system – a transformation that has occurred at the core of the global exchange

rate system. Today, flexible exchange rates have superseded, in advanced countries (with

the notable exception of Europe) the 19th century system of fixed exchange rates known

   2
       We use the distinction core versus periphery for the pre 1914 period following a well-established
tradition in economic history. For the recent period we use the terminology advanced versus emerging
countries. The difference between the two demarcations is largely geographical (the core pre 1914 meant
Western Europe and after 1900 the U.S., while the periphery was everyone else). Today advanced countries
are in every region. The key unifying theme for both demarcations as pointed out by our discussant Anna




                                                   3
as the “gold standard”. In other words, “globalization” appears to mean surprisingly

consistent things in the periphery, but radically opposite things in the core. This may in

fact sound somewhat paradoxical: in the late nineteenth century globalization was in the

popular mind associated with the gold standard, and most academics concurred

(Kemmerer 1916). Yet after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s

the heart of the global monetary system is based on floating exchange rates. How do we

interpret this? On the surface, this would seem to suggest that the exchange rate system is

quite irrelevant to the process of globalization: nature finds its ways. At the same time,

how do we make sense of the serious concerns that academics and policymakers have

over the problem of the appropriate exchange rate system for the emerging countries?

Why should there be different recipes for the advanced and the emergers?

   The theoretical literature pertaining to the links between integration and exchange rate

regimes generally overlooks this problem. Two opposite views may be identified. Both

assume some kind of market imperfection since in a perfectly rational and frictionless

world, fixed and flexible systems should deliver identical outcomes and the question of

the links between exchange rate regimes and integration would be irrelevant (Helpman

1981).

   The “transaction costs” view on the one hand assumes that floating exchange rates are

a risk that cannot be diversified away and thus tantamount to a distortion preventing full

specialization. From this perspective a fixed exchange rate may deliver both a higher

level of integration and superior economic performance. This view is very old and

originates in 19th century classical economics.


Schwartz, is that (core) advanced countries are generally capital rich and the (periphery) emerging
countries are generally capital poor.



                                                4
  On the other hand, the “policy view” rests on the notion that, due to the existence of

nominal rigidities and factor immobility, flexible exchange rates might be advisable to

smooth out the international adjustment process: exchange rate flexibility, from this

perspective, is not an enemy to international integration. This view is traditionally

associated with Robert Mundell, and Padoa-Schioppa’s Trilemma. It has been put to

work by Barry Eichengreen to explain the (according to the recent literature, partial)

trend towards fluctuating exchange rates. The expansion of democracy, by calling for an

increase in income smoothing, has led more and more countries to float their way into

globalization – again with the notable exception of Europe.

  None of these views, however, takes seriously into account the dichotomy between

core and peripheral countries. And yet the quite distinct dynamics of exchange rate

regimes depending on whether we focus on the center or on the periphery suggests that

different stories may have to be told for each. At the same time, as the comparison with

the Roman Empire suggests, the record of the center cannot be understood without

reference to the periphery and vice versa. Systems are tested on their margins.

  In this paper we seek to provide an interpretation of both the presence of ‘fear of

floating’ in the periphery and the transition to flexible exchange rates in the center. Our

argument rests on the role of technological progress in money and finance. In the

nineteenth century, adherence to gold provided a stable environment that contributed to

the development of deep and liquid money markets. At the same time, gold convertibility

was a constraint on monetary policies since it implied currency bands within which core

nations sought to obtain as much room to maneuver as they could. By the 1970s,

financial maturity allowed the core countries to float. In a sense in the current floating




                                             5
regime countries, by learning to follow a domestic nominal anchor, have been able to

eliminate the credibility bands of the classical gold standard, which in its time granted the

core countries only a modicum of the policy independence they have today.

    By contrast to the core, many peripheral countries pre-1914 lacked what we suggest to

call the “financial maturity” to successfully adhere to gold. The alternative of floating

was fraught with danger because they were forced to obtain the foreign capital crucial to

their development by borrowing in terms of sterling (or other core country currencies) or

else having gold clauses.

    In times of financial crises, then as now devaluations led to debt crises. Thus we argue

that peripheral countries then, as now, were forced to adopt super hard fixed exchange

rates (currency boards or close to 100% gold reserves then, currency boards or

dollarization now) because they had not developed the financial maturity to float, or else

they had to restrict foreign borrowing. Thus the link between globalization and the

exchange rate regime turns out to depend on financial maturity:3 i.e. ‘Tell us how

financially mature you are, and we will tell you under what exchange rate regime

globalization shall have you end up with’.

    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we set the stage by

considering the evidence on global financial integration from 1880-1997, using the well-

known Feldstein-Horioka approach. The contribution of our work is that it combines both


3
  The main focus of our study is on the exchange rate arrangements of the two periods of globalization i.e.
of open capital markets and relatively open trade. We do not take a stand on why the global system
collapsed after 1918 (or more correctly after 1931) and was not re-attained until the 1980s. We are
sympathetic to the view that the deglobalization of the middle two quarters of the twentieth century had a
lot to do with the disruptive ‘second thirty year wars’ that began in 1914 and only really ended with the end
of the cold war. We are agnostic on the views of those who see the breakdown of the global system as
related to flaws of the gold standard and to those who see it as a backlash to the excesses of the earlier age
of globalization.

cross-section and time series dimensions with an extended sample of emerging countries

to show a number of disturbing facts that suggest that financial globalization varies a lot

depending on the type of country core (advanced), periphery (emerging)) and the type of

regime (floating, fixed) we consider.       This leads to the conclusion that financial

integration today is primarily an advanced country phenomenon, while the link with the

exchange rate regime is a complex one.

   Section 3 lays out the “financial maturity” hypothesis and presents narrative evidence

for the pre 1914 period of the different experiences of the core and peripheral countries in

adhering to the gold standard.

   Section 4 presents some empirical evidence on the link between financial depth and

the exchange rate regime for core (advanced) and peripheral (emerging) countries 1880-

1913 and today.

   Section 5 summarizes our findings and suggests some lessons from history.



   Section 2. Financial integration, exchange rate regimes and hollowing out

   In this section, we use saving-investment correlation tests (Feldstein and Horioka

[1980]). S-I tests seek to measure the degree of financial integration by examining the

relationship between saving and investment. Integration is high if the correlation of a

regression of investment on savings is low and vice versa: in the latter case investment is

constrained by domestic savings while it is not in the former case. Feldstein-Horioka’s

analysis sparked a considerable research effort. One important area of research was the

analysis of the historical behavior of correlation coefficients in order to document the

historical progress of international financial integration. Standard references in this field

outline the now famous inverted u-shaped pattern of financial integration, which is

obtained when one plots the results from a series of annual cross section regressions for

the period 1880-1995 (Figure 1)5. The message seems to be that, after the interruption of

the interwar years, the world is heading towards re-globalization that recalls nineteenth

century patterns. We refer to this as the Folk’s view.

  2.1 Taking panel econometrics seriously

  We seek to show that this wisdom is too simple and conceals a number of finer

phenomena. This is done by extending existing analyses in two critical directions. First,

we supplement the traditional cross section regressions by panel estimates. Second, when

this can be done (i.e. for the post-1973 period) we supplement the traditional group, of

primarily advanced countries that researchers have been looking at, by a large sample of

emerging countries.

  The importance of panel econometrics for analyzing saving investment correlation

was emphasized by Krol (1996), Coiteux and Simon (2000) and Flandreau and Rivière

(1999). Panel data such as the ones used in FH regressions have two dimensions.

Research on the long run behavior of saving investment regressions has focused on the

inter-individual dimension, computing cross section regressions either on annual data on

or individual averages for given periods. These latter estimates are known as “between”

estimates. They may be thought of as generalizations of point wise cross section

regressions.

  One problem with “between” estimates, though, is that they introduce a number of

biases in the estimation technique. For instance, they tend to overestimate “true”

disintegration when current accounts experience frequent reversals since averaging wipes

out those reversals. This is why ‘within’ estimates are in our view a much sounder

measure since they highlight an essential dynamic dimension of financial integration by

focusing on the ability of countries to finance changes in their current account position.

Indeed, within estimates measure whether increases in investment above average can




                                            9
occur without running into an investment constraint. A third possible estimate, known as

‘pooling’ gives equal weight to the time and individual dimensions.

    Figure 2 shows the results of computing triplets of estimates (pooling, within,

between) for the standard sub-periods people have focused on and for the typical group of

countries for which such estimates have been computed before. As can be seen, while the

popular inverted u-shaped pattern is discernible, the precise picture depends on the

estimator used.

    While the three estimates give a similar picture for the pre-1914 period, “within”

estimates suggest that the interwar was less “closed” than has been assumed, probably

because the frequency of current account reversals during those years tends to average

out the countries’ short term ability to use foreign capital. Moreover, we observe huge

discrepancies among the various estimates for the period after 1973. This suggests that

while some countries have dramatically increased their ability to use the foreign capital

market, the sample’s ability at financing current account imbalances has increased much

less. In what follows we shall give accordingly special weight to the “within” estimates

which might sound as a better measure6, although for the sake of completeness, we will

report all three measures.

    2.2 Regimes of financial integration

    Having emphasized the importance of panel estimates, our strategy is the following:

using a sample similar to the one previous scholars have worked with, we replicate

benchmark estimates of saving-investment correlation by sub periods and compare these




6
  As will be seen, the standard errors of between estimates are always larger than those of the two other
alternative estimators.


                                                     10
with the estimates one obtains for sub-groupings which we think may be relevant,

because they were characterized by arrangements implying exchange rate stability.7

    In this fashion, we identify (a) gold countries before 1914, (b) gold countries, gold

bloc members and sterling area members in the interwar, (c) countries that pegged to the

dollar under the fixed Bretton Woods era8, and finally (d) members of the European

exchange rate mechanism (ERM) after 1979.9 Our goal is to see whether these groupings

succeeded in achieving significantly higher levels of integration than the sample at large.

The intuition is that, if exchange rate stability is an instrument meant to unlock

participating countries’ current account constraints, then we should observe lower betas

for sub-groupings than for the sample at large.




7
  Our sample only differs from the existing one in that some corrections were made. For instance, the
sample used by Eichengreen, Taylor and others has France importing capital before 1914 while Levy-
Leboyer shows that it was exporting.
8
  We identified the arrangements using data from Bordo and Schwartz (1996), Bordo (1993) and Ghosh et
al (1995)
9
  We compute this restriction rather than a restriction to fixed exchange rate regimes because of problems
with identifying these regimes to which we return to below.

   Table 3 displays the results. They show that for the pre-WWI period, countries that

strictly adhered to gold do not seem to have been able to achieve a significantly greater

degree of financial openness than those who did not. The estimated beta for both the

entire population and the restricted sample shows figures that are very close to each other

so that it is impossible to reject the null that they are the same.

   The inter-war years reveal an interesting pattern: we see that countries that adhered to

gold, as well as members of the sterling zone, actually achieved less integration than the

international average reported in Table 3. The straightforward interpretation of this is

probably that members of the interwar gold standard could only retain membership

through capital controls thus actually achieving less integration than the sample at large.

A similar result is in fact obtained for the Bretton Woods period, probably for the very

same reason.

reducing the beta parameters compared to the entire sample.10 At the same time, since we

know that the making of the euro was accompanied by a companion capital movement

liberalization within European countries, it is not clear whether the greater integration is

due to exchange rate stability or to lower controls.

     At this stage, one forceful conclusion that emerges is that fixed exchange rate regimes

were not in the nineteenth century an instrument for financial integration. Financial

integration has been directly related to the presence or absence of capital controls, and

these controls have been used in both periods of fixed and flexible exchange rates. The

pre 1914 period stands out as one that was exceptionally free from these controls rather

than one whose globalization was related to exchange rate stability since, as observed, the

restriction of the integration coefficient to those countries that did not float is not higher

than the one obtained by the entire sample. In fact, it is quite striking to see that even with

fixed exchange rates, even with no capital controls at all, the degree of integration

achieved was not perfect. We think that these findings are consistent with the notion that

globalization in the nineteenth century caused the adoption of the gold standard, rather

than the other way round, and the remainder of the paper shall seek to develop this

intuition.

  . In this part, we use the Folk’s sample. The very low pooling and between estimates come from the
inclusion of Luxembourg. Results without Luxembourg are respectively P :0.700, W : 0.521, B : 0.819 and
for the restriction to Europe P :0.551, W : 0.502, B : 0.664. As can be seen the within estimates are much
more robust than the between and pooling.

     2.3.   Expanding the horizon: developed and emerging integration since 1973



     In order to go beyond these findings, we extend existing analyses in a second

direction. We seek to expand the “Folk” sample used in the literature (essentially

developed countries plus Argentina) to include for the more recent period a large number

of emerging countries in Asia and Latin America. While data availability limits the

number of “emerging” countries that can be identified during the late nineteenth century

(and thus the significance of tests conducted on more limited samples), such is not the

case for the more recent period. This enables us to make systematic comparisons between

performances in the core (advanced) and in the periphery (emerging).12 For this purpose

we constructed an expanded database comprising 46 countries and spanning the period

1973-1998. The Folks’ database is embedded in this broader set13. To document the

properties of the expanded sample, we run cross section regressions for the period after

1973. As can be seen, the trend towards greater financial integration after 1973 captured

by estimates based on the Folk’s sample (the right part of the inverted U)




12
   . Earlier exercises in Flandreau and Rivière (1999) based on the folk’s sample plus five emergers
suggested that the record of peripheral countries might be different from that of developed ones.

   . The additional countries are: Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Egypt, Hong Kong, Hungary, India,
Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Czech Rep, Russia, Singapore, South
Africa, South Korea, Thailand, Turkey, Uruguay, Venezuela. For data sources see data appendix to

mostly reflects the properties of the sample itself. In other words, it shows that there was            19


indeed a process of financial integration, but this process varied a lot along the individual

dimension as illustrated by the increase in the cross section correlation for emerging

countries in the second half of the 1980s. Moreover, extracting from the sample countries

belonging to the European Union shows that the trend towards greater integration that

many authors have emphasized is truly a story about European integration. The

disproportionate share of European nations in the sample has led scholars – unknowingly

– to eurocentric conclusions.

   In line with the previous discussion however, it is obvious that one cannot restrict

one’s attention to these cross section estimates, as telling as they are. In a second stage,


                                                        16
we thus use our new sample to compute benchmark estimates and test in a second stage

whether restrictions to given exchange rate regimes are associated with higher or lower

levels of integration.

     The identification of exchange rate regimes is more complex today than it was one

century ago when the choice was between paper and gold. We decided to rely on the

Masson and Levy-Yeyati & Sturznegger (LYS) classifications of countries by type of

exchange rate regime (Masson 2001, LYS 2001). Both provide country classifications

that recognize that modern exchange rate regimes can be of the fixed, floating, or

intermediary category. Since one needs to cross the information available in our sample

and that available in either the Masson or LYS databases, one is bound to lose some

countries/observations in the process. We end up with two restricted databases of 42

(Masson) or 35 (LYS) countries, whose properties, when one considers both samples in

their entirety, are almost identical.14

     The Masson classification works with the IMF categories but follows an earlier IMF

study by Ghosh et al (1995) which demarcated the IMF’s 26 categories into just 3

(flexible, Intermediate and Floating).15 Masson rearranges the Ghosh categories by

defining flexible as strictly independent floats, fixed as hard pegs (currency boards and

announced pegs with no change in parity), with the remainder classified as intermediate.

As a result Masson has a much smaller number of truly fixed or truly flexible regimes,

with the bulk of the sample being made of intermediate regimes.




14
   . We checked this by running pooling, within and between estimates. Results (available upon request) are
virtually identical, a result of the broad overlap between the two samples.
15
   Flexible arrangements included crawling pegs, target zones, managed floats and independent floats.
Pegged arrangements include single currencies, SDR pegs, other official basket pegs, and secret pegs.


                                                    17
     The LYS indicators use measures of the volatility of exchange rates and international

reserves and cluster analysis to classify countries into 4 groups (floating, dirty floating,

crawling pegs and fixed).16 The classification is based on the theoretical prior that

countries which really float should have greater exchange rate volatility and smaller

international reserve movements than those which do not. We further classified the LYS

classification into three by combining dirty floats and crawling arrangements into an

intermediate category. Thus our re-arrangement of the LYS classification gives much

weight to the tails.




16
 They also have another category called inconclusive that results from the statistical technique employed,
which we omit in our classification scheme.

   The results which we get from these exercises are documented in Table 4 a and b.

First, it appears that there are several ‘patterns’ of financial integration. We find

important distinctions among emergers, and also among regimes. In practice, while Asian



                                                       20
countries are less financially open than the average, Latin American nations are more

open for both the Masson and LYS databases.

  The effects of alternative exchange rate regimes on financial integration is also

interesting. Developed countries are more integrated when they fix, but to a certain extent

also when they float, at least according to LYS. This is interesting because floating

developed countries are typically made of large mature economies with sophisticated

financial systems such as Britain or the United States, while fixing developed countries

typically include small open economies such as Austria.

  We take these results as illustrating how financially deep economies, while floating,

can nonetheless achieve high levels of financial integration that can compare with 19th

century gold standard records. On the other hand, smaller countries may find themselves

opting for a fixed exchange rate regime because they are very open rather than open

because they have a fixed exchange rate system.

  Emerging countries face varied experiences: as can be seen from the Masson data

base, emerging Latin countries are highly integrated at both ends of the exchange rate

regime spectrum with intermediate regimes being less integrated. Something similar is

also perceptible in the LYS database, especially if we recall the greater significance we

attach to the within estimates. For Asian countries, by contrast the opposite is obtained:

there, intermediary regimes correspond to comparatively higher, not lower levels of

integration than extreme floats or fixed regimes. However, even for the intermediate

category the degree of integration achieved is very low.

  This certainly gives support to Fischer’s view that developing countries, which are not

very exposed to international capital flows, have the opportunity to adopt intermediate




                                            21
exchange rate options (Fischer (2001)). These results, to us clearly support the notion that

more open countries will end up either in a fixed exchange rate system or in a flexible

one.

   To sum up, we found that a large part of the extensive integration which the advanced

countries have achieved has to do with European integration that has been able to drive

Europe over and beyond what has been achieved elsewhere under both fixed and flexible

exchange rates. We think that this should be seen as a result of the liberalization of

financial services, which Europe has implemented, rather than as a result of the exchange

rate regime per se. A number of advanced floaters have in effect been quite good at

implementing financial openness: while a fixed exchange rate regime in advanced

countries often goes with higher integration, a flexible one might do quite well too.

   Moreover, our results support the hollowing out hypothesis for emerging countries,

since they show that the trend towards greater integration has split Latin America into

two groups where financial integration has in turn forced the adoption of either floating

or fixed exchange rate regimes. By contrast, Asia has been able to retain intermediate and

both fixed and floating exchange rate regimes because it has remained on average more

financially closed than the rest of the world.

   In other words, the exchange rate regime is a product of globalization, and

globalization has caused a polarization between floating and fixed exchange rates – a

process known as hollowing out. Only those who have maintained a degree of financial

insulation have been able to postpone the choice. Again, globalization appears to have

been the driving force.

     Section 3. Brave New World: Is Financial Vulnerability a Discovery of the 1990s?

     The previous section has suggested that causality goes from globalization to the

exchange rate regime17. In this section, we carry on with this line of analysis. We survey

the recent literature on exchange rate regimes and financial crises and argue that it has a

lot to say about 19th century macroeconomic problems.

     3.1 Exchange rate regimes and financial crises: the modern literature.

     The experience of both advanced and emerging countries on financial crises teaches us

that pegged exchange rates invariably succumb to speculative attacks. From a theoretical

point of view, this can be explained as a result of growing tensions between the peg and

domestic economic conditions (Krugman 1979, Obstfeld 1984). The general lesson seems

to be that the only alternatives in the face of mobile capital are floating or a hard fix such

as a currency board, dollarization, or membership in a monetary union.

     Thus, the “corner solutions” literature has developed on the notion that emerging

countries (and to a certain extent developed ones as well) must choose between fixed and

floating regimes, but cannot durably remain in any intermediary system. More

fundamentally, the flexible “corner” has come under further attack in the “fear of

floating” literature – according to which seemingly “flexible” countries do not truly float,

because in effect, such a policy is for them both inefficient and dangerous. The argument

runs as follows: in principle, a country that experiences a shock can adjust by lowering

the exchange rate. This is supposed to enable that country to enjoy transitorily lower

interest rates so that output may recover. But according to Hausmann, Gavin, Pages and

17
  In a previous draft of this paper we used gravity equations to analyze the relationship between trade
integration and the exchange rate regime. Our results for the 1880-1939 period complement those presented
above for financial integration and the exchange rate regime. We found , amongst other things, that




                                                   23
Stein (1999), this aspirin, while it may have been good medicine for European nations in

the 1990s, in effect gives headaches to Latin American countries. According to this view,

the record for Latin American countries is that letting the exchange rate go, forces an

increase in interest rates and causes a major decline of output.

   This is because exchange rate depreciation in turn triggers a capital flight, perhaps

because that country relies heavily on foreign capital (so that exchange rate depreciation

signals serious problems ahead). Another mechanism goes through the share of external

debt that is denominated in a foreign currency. Today, only a very limited number of

about 25 countries can issue debt in their own currency. As a result exchange crises may

cause a debt crisis. In such a setting, emerging markets would be better off to peg, even if

rampant “peso” problems imply for them that pegging, whatever the amount of glue they

use, does not automatically buy lower interest rates. At least, the argument goes,

countries doing so would be protected from short-term external disturbances, which they

would not have to shore up against.



   3.2. Credibility, interest rates, and monetary policy

   For students of the gold standard, it is striking how familiar the “modern” view

sounds, if only we look carefully at the record. The European aspirin, on the one hand,

closely resembles what a large body of literature has described as the normal state of

affairs for “core” members of the gold standard. Because exchange depreciation (be it the

result of suspended convertibility or a widening of the gold bands through the well




exchange rate volatility did not significantly hinder bilateral trade and, while adhering to gold was
associated with greater trade, it seems as if this is explained by deeper institutional forces at work.

known “gold devices”) was not expected to last18, these nations, often also being the

more developed ones, enjoyed a measure of short-term policy flexibility that enabled

them to buffer transitory shocks, very much in the same fashion modern developed

floaters can do: exchange rate depreciation did not induce capital flight.

      Recent tests have suggested that in effect, support was provided by the market itself

which took bets on the eventual re-appreciation of the currency thus enabling monetary

authorities to lower interest rates and thus compensate for declining output, in other

words that the gold points served as a credible target zone (Hallwood, MacDonald and

Marsh 1996, Bordo and MacDonald 1997). Working with data from the Vienna forward

market Flandreau and Komlos (2001) have shown that “modern” target zone theory was

in fact invented and successfully applied in the Austria-Hungary of the early twentieth

century, once it had stabilized its currency. In the case of large foreign shocks (such as

during the crisis of 1907) Austria-Hungary would let its exchange rate go. This triggered

stabilizing expectations that enabled the monetary authorities to keep a lower interest rate

than abroad, with speculators taking bets on an eventual re-appreciation.

      Thus to a certain extent, the current trend towards floating in advanced countries has

some resemblance to a classical gold standard in which the fluctuation margins have

been, in line with Keynes (1931) proposal19, widened to give more flexibility. The key

difference between then and now is that the nominal anchor -- gold parity, around which

the target zone operated, has been jettisoned and a domestic nominal anchor has been

substituted in its place, which allows exchange rate flexibility without the constraints of a

target zone. Thus if the degree of flexibility compared to the gold standard is greater, the

spirit is the same, a point to which we will come back later.20

   This possibility for the core countries of the classical gold standard era, to actually

“manage” the money supply despite the gold constraints, is in sharp contrast with what

countries in the European periphery, in Asia, or in Latin and Central America could do.

   On the one hand, floating did not create much room for them to conduct active

monetary policies. Exchange depreciation often triggered expectations of further

depreciation rather than expectations of eventual stabilization. For instance, Flandreau

and Komlos (2001) show that intriguingly enough, it was the stabilization of the Austro-

Hungarian currency that opened the door to active monetary policies. During the

infamous period of exchange rate gyrations that extended until the mid-1890s, exchange

depreciation was not usually followed by expectations of an eventual recovery – unlike

what would happen when the country regained credibility after joining the gold standard

in 1896.

   On the other hand, going onto gold did not buy immediate credibility as illustrated by

the levels of short-term interest rates in a number of typical members of the periphery.

Figures 4a to 4e show that the weaker members of the gold club faced higher short term

interest rates even when on gold than is consistent with their actual exchange rate record.

This suggests some kind of “peso” problem. The high short-term rates faced by Chile,

Greece, Portugal, Italy, or Russia, during their more or less extended flirt with gold



20 . Thus we are not arguing that monetary authorities are following a target zone approach as advocated
by e.g., Bergsten and Williamson (1983). But rather that the credibility of adhering to gold convertibility
gave the core countries pre 1914 the flexibility to conduct discretionary policy within the gold points as if
they were operating in a target zone a la Krugman (1991) and Svennson (1994), whereas today the
credibility attached to following monetary rules such as inflation targeting, gives the monetary authorities
the freedom to operate with much greater flexibility without the bands of a target zone.

suggest that the problems that the “modern” periphery has with pegging have nineteenth

century precedents. The fact that even when on gold, these countries could face high

short term interest rates, might explain why some of them ended up floating. An

interesting case from that perspective is Chile whose attempt at returning onto gold in

1895-98, involved both a sharp increase in interest rates – because that decision was not

credible – and a substantial fall in the rate of inflation: with the result that the

stabilization was associated with huge real interest rates, recession, and a quick reversal

to floating exchange rates (Subercaseaux 1926). Plus çà change...

     3.3. Fear of floating, 19th century style: a new view of the gold standard



     If going on gold was so costly for the periphery, one may wonder why a number of

countries nonetheless sought to stick to gold. We argue that this choice rested on

something quite similar to the current “fear of floating” dilemma. If fixing was quite

painful under the gold standard for many of the peripheral countries, floating could be

just as deadly as today. This was due to pervasive problems of currency mismatch arising

from the inability, for underdeveloped borrowing countries, to issue foreign debts in their

own currency.

     It is well known from the works of historians that the financial markets of the less

developed countries were very backward.21 This led governments of the European or

Latin American periphery to issue their debts in the large financial markets of the core

countries, such as London, Amsterdam, Paris or later Berlin, which by contrast had

developed early on (Neal 1990). In effect, the investors in peripheral countries developed

the habit of holding that part of their wealth which they invested in domestic bonds in the

large markets of the core countries (Broder 1975, Levy-Leboyer 1976, De Cecco 1991).

     Borrowing abroad also implied borrowing in foreign currencies. Today, many

emerging countries find it impossible to borrow abroad in their own currency. Ricardo

Haussmann and various co-authors22 refer to these nations as suffering from “original

sin”. Something similar existed one century ago. According to John Francis (1859),

exchange rate guarantees in international bond issues was an innovation that had been

pioneered by the London Rothschilds.23 The guarantees were widely used during the

boom of Latin American bond issues of the 1820s.24 As foreign investment soared, this

practice became widespread. Prior to the advent of the gold standard, countries were

alternatively tied to gold, silver or bimetallic currencies depending on the market they

were tapping. With the spread of the gold standard in Western Europe, gold clauses

generalized.25

     Fully comprehending the logic of these gold clauses is a theoretical challenge which is

beyond the scope of this paper. It is not clear, for instance, why investors should have

preferred a lower exchange rate risk – but with a greater default risk when exchange rate

crises occurred, to a higher exchange rate risk but a lower risk of default.

     One possible answer is that, in a system where instruments to hedge against long run

exchange rate risks were not available, the clauses enabled foreign investors to pass on

the costs of exchange risk to issuing governments or corporations.26 This was one way

contemporaries rationalized this practice, emphasizing that it was motivated by the “risk

aversion” of foreign investors.27 But this would imply that contemporaries were more

willing to run default risk than exchange rate risks.

   . “ Previous to the advent of Mr. Rothschild, foreign loans were somewhat unpopular in England, as the
interest receivable abroad, subject to the rate of exchange, liable to foreign caprice, and payable in foreign
coin. He introduced the payment of the dividends in England, and fixed it in sterling money, one great
cause of the success of these loans in 1825 ” pp. 298-9. See also Ferguson (1998) Vol. 1, pp. 732-3.

   . There were forward exchange markets, but only for a small number of currencies, and only for short
horizons (Einzig 1937). We are not aware of swap contracts that would have involved long term cover
against exchange rate risk. The only kind of protection against exchange rate volatility would have been
diversification, which by definition does not provide full insurance.

Spain, Austria and Hungary see Lévy (1901): “ Chez nous surtout où les rentiers quelque peu timorés et

   Second, this practice might be understood as the solution to a commitment problem.

While local issues could be easily inflated away, foreign issues with gold clauses

provided safeguards, precisely because they in turn induced governments to be on their

guard.28 Figure 5 gives some support to this view as it shows that the share of gold debt

was an increasing function of total indebtedness for a number of peripheral countries. On

the other hand, it is hard to determine the extent to which markets and governments were

in a position to internalize the consequences of gold clauses plus exchange depreciation:

in the politically unstable, revolution driven Latin America, could pre-commitment

actually work? Moreover, while commitment might explain why some debt would have

been issued with gold clauses, it is not clear why all debt issued abroad should have

included such clauses.

   A final possibility rests in the motivations of international bankers whose syndicates

arranged the loans. Because the bankers offered a number of services to cash strapped

government in periods of crises, lending into arrears and helping them to muddle through

financial trouble, they were also in a position to impose a lot of conditionality (Flandreau

2000). This asymmetry was often emphasized by contemporary observers: according to

Lévy (1901) “the creation of debts denominated in the currency of the lending country

can be understood as resulting from the fact that it is the lending country that dictates its

conditions to the borrowing part”.29 It must be that the bankers expected that the bonds

they were prepared to guarantee would face a deeper and more willing demand as a result




                                                         33
of the gold clauses, and they thus persuaded borrowers to issue their securities with fixed

exchange rate clauses that tied the coupon to the unit of the market where the bonds were

sold.30 But then we are back to the question -- why shouldn’t the regular investor be

willing to hold paper debts, provided he gets a return for it?

     In any case, given the situation, the fixed exchange rate clauses drew a sharp line

between those members of the core where there had been a long record of adherence to a

convertible standard and those who did not. As one leading financial economist of the

time explained, robust gold convertibility was an acceptable substitute for the gold

clauses: “when it comes to the bonds of countries where the gold standard prevails, such

as Britain, Sweden, Norway, Denmark or Canada, special clauses are not necessary, since

the obligation to pay in gold results from the fact that bonds are denominated in the

currency of that country”31

This was certainly a reason why a number of countries became quite interested in trying

to find ways to stabilize their currency in terms of gold. Yet the gold standard was

definitely not a perfect substitute for gold clauses, since the club of countries that could

issue abroad debts denominated in their own currency was much more selective than the

gold club, as illustrated in Table 5 which shows the list of “senior” sovereigns in

London32. This data comes from Burdett’s Official Stock Exchange Intelligence. Table 5



29
   Lévy, (1901) page 6.
30
   . The fixed exchange rate clause could come in various ways : either by denominating the currency in the
foreign currency, by denominating it in a gold or silver domestic unit that thus had a fixed exchange rate
with foreign gold or silver units, or by stating the fixed exchange rate at which the coupon would be paid to
foreigners regardless of the actual exchange rate against paper money. From an economic point of view all
these are equivalent.

   The countries that could issue sovereign bonds in terms of their own currencies during the period 1880 –
1914 were: US, UK, France, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Switzerland. Two additional
countries included in the table which listed sovereign debt in their own currency were Austria, Hungary and

and the currency in which the coupon was payable for ten major countries, eight of which

issued bonds in their own currencies without fixed exchange rate clauses.33 Other

countries listed only showed bonds issued in some gold tied unit.34




Italy. However there is ample evidence to suggest that these bonds bore gold clauses. See Tattara (1999)
and Flandreau (2001).
33
   For the U.S., Table 5 shows 3 bonds listed as payable in gold coin for the years 1895, 1898 and 1900.
The previous bonds shown are listed as " payable in the coin standard of the United States.” The changed
status was a response to the silver uncertainty of the 1890s, to remove any ambiguity over which metallic
coin was the standard. See Wilkins (1989) and Laughlin (1903).

     The borderline members of the list – i.e. those for which the currency denomination

was ambiguous provides interesting evidence that the mere stabilization of the currency

in terms of gold was not enough. As can be seen, Austria-Hungary’s position is

ambiguous. And as a matter of fact, we found in separate French sources an interpretation

of this problem: in the early 1890s, this country sought to stabilize its currency and

defined a new unit, the crown, with a fixed gold parity. At first, market participants

understood that since the crown "only exists as gold unit, and there are no paper crowns"

a crown denominated debt had to be understood as a gold debt with an exchange rate

“worth FF 1.05".35 However, once the Austro-Hungarian currency was stabilized, and the

crown became in 1900 the actual unit of account, it was realized that Austria’s and

Hungary’s crowns debts were “without fixed parities in terms of foreign currencies,

[because] Austria's monetary regime is a paper regime. In the event of a crisis, the value

of the Austrian crown might experience depreciation."36 This shows that having a gold

parity that was credible over the short run was not a perfect substitute for a very long-

term commitment to exchange rate stability.

     Having a large gold debt and experiencing an exchange rate crisis could have

devastating consequences. When a country embarked on a spending spree and public debt

increased, the share of gold denominated debt increased in its turn. This created an

explosive mismatch. The crises of the early 1890s – very much like those of the 1990s -

provided evidence of the mechanism at work. Argentina opened the dance: there, the

expansion of the gold debt (cedulas), accompanied by paper money issue, pushed the

level of the debt burden to unsustainable heights.37 The interruption of capital exports that

resulted increased the needs of a number of financially weak peripheral countries whose

currencies depreciated in turn. As argued in Flandreau [2000] the public debt crises in

Portugal and Greece (in 1892 and 1893 respectively) both resulted from the depreciation

of the exchange rate that had brought these countries’ public debts to unsustainable

levels.

     The responses to these problems induced by high debts and financial vulnerability were

also surprisingly modern. Some countries, such as Spain or Portugal, continued to float

but minimized their exposure by limiting their borrowings abroad. Some others, such as

Russia or Greece developed de facto currency boards. They accumulated gold reserves

beyond what was statutorily necessary and in effect adopted stabilization cover ratios that

were consistently above 100%. Yesterday like today, the response to financial

vulnerability has been either a float with reduced exposure to the foreign capital market,

or super-strong pegs. “Hollowing out” is a very old thing.

     This discussion should shed a new light on the abundant quotes which one finds in the

old literature regarding the importance of the gold standard as a way to foster integration

and which have so often been analyzed in the recent literature as evidence of the

“ideology” or “spirit” of the time.38 There might in fact have been a lot more economic

motivations behind these recommendations than is commonly acknowledged. Clearly, in

view of the narrow list of countries that were able to float debts in their own currency,

much of the “emerging world” was bound to face problematic currency mismatches.39

   . See e.g. Gallarotti (1994), Eichengreen and Temin (1998).

   . This was likely to become a serious problem for governments in the periphery, given the role which
government undertakings had in the process of catching up in the late 19th century (Gerschenkron 1960).


                                                    40
     From this point of view, gold adherence became for those willing to protect themselves

against international financial disturbances a second best solution. It is not that a gold

standard immediately bought credibility. Rather, it served as an insurance mechanism and

in this sense fostered globalization. In other words, the spread of the gold standard in the

periphery was an endogenous response to the gold clauses: as soon as the price of this

insurance decreased (as was the case during the gold inflation of 1896-1914), the gold

standard expanded, as more and more countries found it less dangerous to borrow with

gold clauses since the risk of being tipped off gold declined.40



3.4 Exchange rate regimes and the financial maturity hypothesis



      A consequence of the analysis developed here is that logically, pre-1914 core

countries that had developed strong money and financial markets before WWI and were

thus able to issue foreign debts in their own currency, ought to have floated – something

which they did not. At first sight, this seems to be a serious challenge to our view and

may require a word of explanation. However, the evidence reported above, that core

countries pioneered the use of exchange rate adjustments within the gold points in a

Target Zone fashion suggests that core countries were nonetheless exploiting to the

fullest possible extent whatever flexibility they had. In a sense, the seeds of a floating

exchange rate system were sown at the center.

40
  . This explanation is not a mutually exclusive one. An alternative reason why periphery countries may
have favored gold standard adherence is that the gold standard served as a ‘good housekeeping seal of
approval’ – a signal to lenders in the core that peripheral countries followed sound financial policies. See
Bordo and Rockoff (1996) for evidence that sovereign debt spreads on London were lower for emerging
countries that adhered strongly to gold relative to those whose adherence was less conscientious and those
on paper standards. Also see Obstfeld and Taylor (2001). Flandreau, LeCacheux and Zumer (1998) stress



                                                     41
   The question still arises why did advanced countries before 1914 that were financially

mature not float as advanced countries do today. Possible answers include the protection

that gold gave to bond holders against inflation risk and the path dependency of gold as

money.

   Indeed historians have emphasized that the rise of a large and liquid market for

government debt in the 18th and 19th century has been the hallmark of financial

development. But this meant that at the beginning of the process, domestic residents

saving for their retirement had their money mostly in the fixed income portion of the

market and would take a beating if governments inflated away.41 Thus the response, as in

the well-known British case, was to develop powerful parliaments that took the power

over money out of the hands of sovereigns, and linked the domestic unit to a weight of

gold. But once this was done, this created strong constituencies that resisted the

devaluation of the unit in terms of gold.

   This domestic mechanism was supplemented by an international one, since in practice

no single country could easily take the lead and move away from the system and widen

the fluctuation bands, without raising the suspicion that it truly wanted to depreciate. In

the end, core countries were locked onto gold and peripheral countries either had to float

or to lock onto core countries. To give way, the gold standard needed some easily

identifiable external shock such as World War I. It took another six decades for a

universal floating exchange rate system based on a credible domestic nominal anchor to


the role of gold inflation after 1896 as reducing the burdens of public debt for European peripheral
countries and hence making their adherence to the gold standard more sustainable.
41
   In today’s world where price indices are systematically constructed by generally careful institutions, and
are thus fairly consensual, the issue of determining the reasons why governments scarcely issue indexed
bonds might be addressed (see however the mid-1990s controversies on the inflation measurement problem
in presence of rapid technological progress). But at the time the distrust of index numbers was not even a
question.


                                                     42
be established (although earlier successful efforts prevailed in the U.K. and Sweden in

the 1930’s and in Canada in the 1950’s).42

      The history of the international monetary system for the advanced countries in the

twentieth century has been well documented (Bordo and Schwartz 1999, Redish 1996,

Eichengreen 1996). The path dependency of gold seen in adherence to some form of gold

convertibility prevailed until 1971. The golden nominal anchor was stretched with the use

of international reserves in the inter-war exchange standard and even more under the

Bretton Woods system, while monetary policies became increasingly geared towards

domestic goals.43 Ultimately the gold-based system became unworkable and collapsed in

1971. The full shift to a credible domestic nominal anchor and floating exchange rates in

the 1970s and 1980s required the development of deep and mature financial markets

discussed here and in Rousseau and Sylla (2001) as well as the adoption of monetary

rules that in many ways echoed the functions of the gold standard convertibility rule.

     Thus today by contrast, the more financially developed part of the world has finally

been able to exploit to its fullest possible extent its ability to float. As a matter of fact, the

generalization today of floating in the developed countries virtually encompasses the list

of countries that can issue international securities in their own currency as we discuss in

section 4 below.




42
   The case for generalized floating was made clearly by Gottfried Haberler in the 1930s but was rejected
by the consensus view of the time that floating was destabilizing. see Bordo and James ( 2001)
43
   According to Bordo and Eichengreen (1998), had the Great Depression not intervened, the gold
exchange standard would have prevailed until the late 1950s.


                                                    43
   Section 4. Financial Depth and the Exchange Rate Regime

   The interpretation of the seemingly opposite nature of global exchange rate regimes in

the two big eras of globalization (fixed exchange rates back then, floating ones today) has

put at the center of the picture the role of financial vulnerability and financial crises. To

some extent, the Baring crisis yesterday played a role similar to the crises of the late

1990s in reminding floaters about the dangers of an impervious flexible exchange rate.

As a result, while developed countries have always had the temptation and ability to float

(with floating restricted yesterday by path dependency and the difficulty of creating

domestic institutions that could create a domestic nominal anchor) the periphery has

always faced serious difficulties in floating, viewing the gold standard yesterday, and

hard pegs today, as a second best solution.

   The change in the dominant form of regime has implications as to where we should

find greater financial depth: in the pre 1914 era when the gold standard was the dominant

monetary arrangement, we would expect countries adhering to gold to have greater

financial depth than those that did not. In the post 1973 period where floating is the

dominant regime, we would expect by contrast that countries that can successfully

operate pure floats would also be more financially developed than those which could not.

However, those emerging countries which could not, or for other reasons such as

considerable openness or close trading linkages to a large country, choose not to float and

instead adhered to hard pegs e.g. Hong Kong and Singapore, would also have greater

financial depth than countries following intermediate regimes.

   In this section we seek to investigate this prediction by looking at the record of both

the periods 1880-1914 and 1973-1997, by attempting to identify the effects of alternative




                                              44
exchange rate regimes on financial depth, which we proxy before 1914 by the ratio of a

broad monetary aggregate (M2) to GDP, post 1973 by similar variables plus other

broader measures, to be discussed below. These variables can in turn be viewed as

indicators of a set of factors which come under the rubric of financial maturity.44



4.1. The Classical Gold Standard, 1880-1913

     Because of its biblical simplicity, the 1880-1913 period is an ideal testing ground for

our hypothesis that the “dominant” exchange rate regime, by which we mean the more

technically advanced, is associated with greater financial sophistication. Case studies of

financial development in the nineteenth century have emphasized that those countries

which adhered to gold in the 1880s, 1890’s and 1900’s such as France, Britain, and

Germany were also the more financially developed. This cross section evidence is

supplemented by time series analysis such as in Gregory (1995) and Komlos (1987)

according to whom, the Russian, Austro-Hungarian stabilizations in the 1890s were both

associated with a considerable expansion of the monetary base. In line with these earlier

studies, we believe that the expansion of real broad money would be a good proxy for

financial depth before 1914 because this was an era in which monetization (the spread of

the money economy) proliferated across the world, as did the growth of banking systems

(Bordo and Jonung 1987).




44
   Rousseau and Sylla (2001) list five attributes of a good financial system which overlaps our meaning of
financial maturity; sound public finance and debt management; stable money; a sound banking system; a
central bank to act as a lender of last resort and to manage international financial arrangements; a well
functioning securities market. They employ the same measure of financial depth we do as both a
determinant of economic growth and as a determinant of international financial integration.


                                                     45
     To test systematically for the link between the exchange rate regime and financial

development, we assembled a panel of data for 23 countries 1880-1913.45 The panel

includes both advanced (core) and less developed (periphery) countries.46 The strategy

followed is to run panel regressions of the log of M/Y (money to income ratio) on a

number of controls to see whether a dummy capturing the years in which a country

adhered to gold or did not, and another one capturing whether a country had international

sovereign bonds listed in terms of its own currency on the London Stock Exchange in

1913 had positive and significant effects.47          48
                                                           Other things equal we would expect that

our measures of financial depth would be higher under the gold standard than under paper

money, and for a country that can issue foreign bonds denominated in its own currency

than for another that cannot.

     To test this, it is necessary to control for other effects. The first is per capita real

income. From the literature on money demand, other things equal, we would expect the

elasticity of M/Y with respect to real per capita income to be zero (Friedman 1959).49

However in the situation where money balances are a luxury good and the income

elasticity of money demand is greater than one as evidenced in Friedman (1959) and

Bordo and Jonung (1987) for a number of our countries for the pre 1914 period, then real

46
   The advanced countries, demarcated both by income and by the fact that they were capital exporters
(with the principal exception of the U.S. before 1900) were: Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands,
United Kingdom, United States and Switzerland. The emergers were: Argentina, Australia, Austria –
Hungary, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Chile, Finland, Greece, Italy, Japan, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Spain
and Sweden.
47
   Gold Standard adherence dates come from Bordo and Schwartz (1996), Eichengreen and Flandreau
(1996). We did not distinguish between countries that left and returned to gold at the same parities and
those that altered their parities. The domestic currency bond dummy is derived from information in Table
5.
48
   We also ran the regressions using the log of real per capita money balances as our measure of financial
depth. This of course is the traditional measure of demand for money. The results are very similar to the
ones we report below.




                                                    46
income per capita would be positively associated with our measure of financial depth.

Thus we would expect countries with high per capita income pre 1914 to have greater

financial depth. Such countries would also more likely be on the gold standard and would

be able to issue bonds in terms of their own currencies.

     Figure 6 presents a scatter plot of M/Y and real per capita income showing this

relationship nicely.50 In the left-hand corner we see mainly paper currency countries with

low financial depth who borrowed abroad in sterling or who had gold clauses. In the

upper right hand corner we observe high income countries with high M/Y who were on

gold and could issue bonds in their own currency, with the anomalies being easily

explained.51 Similar figures for 1880-1896 and 1897-1914 (not shown) nicely trace out

the transition from paper to gold by a large number of emerging countries as their

incomes and financial development progressed.52

   . Real per capita income was expressed in 1913 US dollars. The PPP adjusted data is from Maddison
(1995). We also tried the unadjusted data in the regressions below.

   A similar pattern is observed comparing real per capita cash balances and real per capita income.

broad money data is unavailable for these countries before 1913 and we had to use M1.

  As controls in the regression we used the traditional determinants of the demand for

money: real per capita income (discussed above) and a short-term interest rate. We would

expect the short term interest rate, representing the opportunity cost of holding money

balances, as well as the presence and spread of financial assets as substitutes for money,

to be negative.53 Other controls tried in the regressions (but not presented in the results

below) were: the (log of the) CPI inflation rate, to measure the opportunity cost of




                                                                       48
holding money relative to goods, the fiscal balance since a tendency to run a deficit might

signal eventual attempts to predate the financial sector, thus causing, in line with our

earlier discussion, a persistence of domestic financial underdevelopment as people

continue to hold their balances abroad.

     Table 6 shows log linear panel regressions for 23 countries for M2/GDP including

country (fixed effects) and a time trend. In column 1 the gold adherence dummy is

significantly associated with a higher M2/GDP. Going from paper to gold is associated

with a 21% higher M2/GDP (the response indicated in brackets)54. Countries that could

issue sovereign debt in terms of their own currencies also had higher ratios of M2/GDP

by 26% (column 2). The addition of real per capita income and short term interest rates to

the regression with the gold dummy (column 3) shows significant coefficients for all

regressors with signs suggested by theory, the positive and greater than one coefficient on

real per capita income agrees with earlier evidence in Bordo and Jonung (1987). Finally,

and quite importantly, the addition of the Bond dummy is also significant (column 4).




53
   For the short term interest rate in most countries we used the official discount rate. For the core countries
(US, UK, France, Germany and Netherlands) we used open market rates. For several countries where data
on short-term interest rates is unavailable we used long-term interest rates.

     In sum, these results suggest that countries that could adhere to gold were financially

more developed. Also financially developed countries were those that could issue

sovereign debt in terms of their own currency55.



4.2. 1973-1997

      In this section, we conduct similar exercises for the current regime of open capital

markets and generalized floating. Our assumption is that today, as in the previous era of


55
   As a sensitivity test, we ran a panel probit regression taking the choice of exchange rate (adherence to
gold or not) as the dependent variable and M2/GDP and the other controls from Table 6 as the independent
variables. In the regressions the M2/GDP ratio was positive and significant but the bond dummy was
insignificant. The coefficient on M2/GDP suggests that a one percent increase in financial depth would
increase the probability of a country adhering to gold by 6.5 %. This result compared to the coefficient of
the exchange rate variable shown in the regressions in Table 6, raises the tricky issue of causality between
financial depth and the exchange rate regime.
   On the one hand Rousseau and Sylla’s (2001) evidence that financial development is a key determinant
of the earlier growth of today’s advanced countries and Eichengreen and Flandreau’s (1996) findings that
growth is a determinant of gold standard adherence pre 1914 suggests that financial development may
explain the ability to adhere to gold. On the other hand, adherence to the specie standard in Europe long
predated modern growth and England’s switch to gold de facto in 1717 also preceded both modern
economic growth and much of England’s financial development. Thus arguments for causality between the
exchange rate regime and financial depth can go both ways.


                                                                   50
globalized financial markets, we would expect that advanced countries would have

greater financial depth than emerging ones and (ceteris paribus) would float. Moreover,

as emerging countries moved toward advanced country status they would adopt the

monetary regime of the advanced countries. Thus we would expect to find that, across

both advanced and emerging countries, financial depth would be positively associated

with adherence to freely floating regimes relative to adherence to other regimes.

     A number of reasons however suggest that the clean results we reported in the

previous section might not be so easy to replicate in today’s world. And since these affect

the regression strategy it seems necessary to spend a while discussing them. One is that

the expansion of the real broad money supply might not be as good a measure for today

as it was for the late 19th century. Especially for the advanced countries because of the

development of other financial assets as substitutes for money balances, as well as

technological innovation which economizes on cash balances.56

     A second is that the simple menu of alternatives to floating that prevailed in the late

19th century (peg to gold) has been replaced by a more complex one: peg to the dollar,

peg to the mark, peg to the euro, peg to a basket, not to mention various intermediate

arrangements ranging from dirty floats, adjustable pegs to crawling pegs. These latter

arrangements purport to maintain some of the advantages of floating – monetary

independence and insulation from external shocks—with the advantages of pegging.

     A third one is, that as a number of recent papers have argued, that the IMF

classification of exchange rate regimes, which is based on information provided by the

member countries may not reflect the true underlying regime. Thus Calvo and Reinhart


56
  Thus velocity (the inverse of M2/GDP) displays a U-shaped pattern over the past century and across
countries by levels of development. Bordo and Jonung (1987).


                                                   51
(2000a, 2000b) present evidence to the effect that countries which say they are floating

show little variation in their exchange rates but substantial variation in their international

reserves and interest rates and hence act more like peggers.

     What we argue here is that the dose of “19th centurism” which according to us has

survived in the periphery, implies that for those emerging countries which are unable to

successfully float because a substantial portion of their outstanding financial obligations

are denominated in dollars or other advanced countries currencies, pegging would mean

financial deepening – in a 19th century fashion. This follows because the alternative of

volatile exchange rates could have serious consequences for the private sector’s balance

sheet and hence for the real economy—manifest by their inability to sell their debt

denominated in their own currency in international markets— these countries would be

better off, it is argued if they dollarized.

     For these emerging markets, especially those of Latin America, Haussmann, Panizza

and Stein (2000) argue that greater financial depth would be associated with fixed

exchange rate arrangements (i.e. to peg as second best)57. Thus we may expect to see a

bi-polar pattern where advanced countries and some emergers that can emulate them have

greater financial depth associated with floating and others who can not float, or because

of their greater openness choose not to, have greater depth associated with fixing.

     In our empirical work, we use a panel of 44 countries with data from Bordo,

Eichengreen, Klingebiel and Martinez-Peria (2001): 22 advanced countries and 22

emerging countries58. Exchange rate regimes are identified with dummies constructed


57
  Also see Eichengreen and Haussman (1999).
58
  The 22 advanced countries are: Australia, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland,
France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, USA. The 22 emerging countries are: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China,


                                                  52
using the two exchange rate definitions discussed in section 2 (Masson (2001) and LYS

(2001)). To measure financial depth, as we did for the 1880-1913 period, we used the

M2/GDP ratio. However as argued above we might expect that this measure may not be

as good a proxy for financial depth today as it was a century ago. As alternative measures

of financial depth we use 3 measures developed for the World Bank by Beck, Demirguc-

Kunt and Levine (1999): FD1, defined as the ratio of private credit to GDP; FD2 defined

as private credit plus stock market valuation to GDP; and FD3 defined as FD2 plus

private and public bond market capitalization as a share of GDP.59

        To account for the domestic currency denomination of international bonds we

used two databases. The first is the BIS data used by Haussmann, Pannizza and Stein

(2000) which contains all international securities and bank loans by currency and issuer

but only for the period 1993-1997. Countries that issued international securities in terms

of their own currency consisted of most of the OECD countries and in our sample only 4

emergers: Hong Kong, Singapore, South Africa and Taiwan. . The second measure is all

international bonds from data supplied by the IMF. This data covers the period 1980-

1997 and again consists mostly of OECD countries plus 7 emergers: Argentina, China,

Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea, Philippines and South Africa. We defined a dummy as

equal to one if a country could issue such securities60.

        Finally, as in the 1880-1913 period, we used as controls in the regression: per

capita real GDP in U.S. dollars, short-term interest rates (open market rates where




Colombia, Ecuador, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines,
Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

            available, otherwise deposit rates), the fiscal deficit to GDP ratio and the log of the CPI

            inflation rate. All this data comes from IFS.



            4.3. Results: All Advanced and Emerging Countries

                 We present tables similar to those for the pre 1914 period. Table 7 shows the

            coefficients of regressions of the log of M2/GDP on the Masson and LYS floating

            exchange rate dummies, a dummy for the IMF indicator of the issue of international

            bonds in domestic currency and as a control, the short term interest rate.61 62

                 (a) we used the BIS bond dummy.




            61
               We also used the BIS measure of Bonds issued in domestic currency. The results were usually similar so
            because the data for these bonds only covers 5 years we do not report them unless otherwise indicated.
            62
               As an alternative to the log of short-term interest rates we use the log of the inflation rate. The results
            using this variable were almost identical to those using the log of interest rates, so we do not report them
            here. We also do not report results for regressions including the fiscal deficit to GDP ratio. That ratio was
            often insignificant.


                                                                                54
     As in the 1880-1913 regressions we include country fixed effects and a time trend. We

exclude real per capita income from the regressions shown because the estimated income

elasticity was close to zero (the income elasticity with respect to real cash balances close

to one). Indeed the specification of the M2/GDP ratio we present is similar to the one first

used by Latane (1954) and by Lucas (1988).

     In Table 7 we present the results for all countries and then separately for advanced and

emerging countries. As can be seen in column (1) and (2) for all countries, all three

independent variables are significant. Financial depth increases on average when

countries float according to the Masson definition by 24%, for the LYS by 5%. When

they can issue bonds in terms of their own currencies financial depth increases by slightly

over 20% 63.

     For the advanced countries, (see columns (3) and (4)) as in the case of all countries,

both floating exchange rate indicators are positive and significant as is the bond variable

in column (4).64 For the emerging countries (see columns (5) and (6)), the Masson

dummy is positive and significant at conventional levels whereas the LYS dummy is

barely significant at the 10% level. Also the bond variable is significant and positive in

both specifications.

         We then ran similar regressions to those in the above tables but we substituted the

Masson and LYS fixed exchange rate dummies instead of the floats used in Table 7. See

Table 8. For all countries both fixed exchange rate dummies were significant and

negative in a regression including the bond dummy and the interest rate.

 In the regressions in column 2 we used the BIS measure of local currency bonds because the IMF
measure was not significant

                          The same result obtained for the advanced countries using the Masson dummy,

               with the LYS exchange rate indicator insignificant. Finally for the emerging countries,

               the Masson fixed exchange rate dummy was negative and significant in all the

               was the dominant exchange rate regime, seem to be consistent with those of the pre 1914

               era in Table 6, when gold was the dominant regime. For advanced countries and to a

               found that M2/GDP was generally positive and significant for all the country classifications using both the
               Masson and LYS indicators. Similar results obtained for the bond dummies. Taking the fixed exchange rate
               regime as dependent variable, M2/GDP was generally negative and the bond dummy was insignificant. As
               was the case for the pre 1914 period gold standard, the question of causality between financial depth and
               the exchange rate regime is difficult to sort out. A deeper analysis of the circumstances of each country is
               likely required.



                                                                                 56
and the ability to issue international bonds in domestic currency is associated with

floating.



4.4. Latin America and Asia

       The results from Table 8 for a sample of emergers across the world suggest that

hard fixers on average had lower financial depth than others. These results seems to

contradict evidence presented in Haussmann, Panizza and Stein (2000) for Latin America

suggesting that fixers had greater financial depth. However they may also be explained

by the fact that emergers who could float were less financially integrated than the

advanced countries as seen in section 2, and by the aggregation of very different

categories of emerging countries

   To correct for this, in Table 9 we split the emerging sample of countries into Latin

America and Asia, presenting only the significant results. For Latin America we find that

the Masson float dummy is positive and significant when introduced alone (but is

insignificant with the addition of the interest rate control), whereas the LYS floating

dummy is negative and significant in the regressions with controls. At the same time the

Masson fixed exchange rate dummy is negative and significant. Both bond dummies for

Latin America are always insignificant.

          The LYS results that Latin American countries that float do not have greater

financial depth may be consistent with the evidence from the Feldstein-Horioka




                                                                 58
regressions in section 2 that Latin America is relatively financially open. The LYS

results, which are based on the economic characteristics of the regime, rather than on

information supplied by the reporting countries that lie behind the Masson dummies, may

be more telling.

       For Asia, we find both floating indicators to be associated with greater financial

depth, as is the domestic currency bond indicator, evidence that some Asian countries

may be able to emulate the advanced countries. However the evidence from section 2 that

financial integration in Asia is less than in Latin America may also explain why some

Asian countries could successfully float. At the same time the LYS fixed exchange rate

dummy is also positive and significant in column 9. This last result seems consistent with

the ‘hollowing out’ hypothesis.

  In sum, for the emergers, the case is mixed. Although there is some evidence for the

group as a whole that floating was associated with greater financial depth and the ability

to issue bonds denominated in domestic currency, we also find that when we disaggregate

the emerging countries into Latin America and Asia that, although some Latin American

countries may have had deeper financial markets associated with floating, there was quite

strong evidence that Asian countries with floating exchange rates had greater financial

depth than other countries, and moreover they seem to be more mature than their Latin

counterparts in terms of the ability to issue international bonds denominated in their own

currency (although again they may have been able to achieve this because they were less

open than other countries). The evidence at the same time that some Asian countries with

fixed rates had greater financial depth is consistent with both the ‘hollowing out’ and

‘original sin’ hypotheses.

4.5. An Alternative Measure of Financial Development

       Finally, we experimented with regressions similar to those displayed in sections 4.3

and 4.4 but taking as dependent variable the alternative measures of financial

development produced by the World Bank: FD1 (Private Credit to GDP); FD2 (Private

Credit plus Stock Market Valuation to GDP) and FD3 (FD2 plus bond market

capitalization to GDP).

         The most significant results were for FD2 and FD3, which were quite similar. We

show selected results taking the log of FD3 as dependent variable for advanced,

emerging, Latin America and Asia in Table 10. The results for the advanced countries are

almost identical to those in Table 7. For advanced countries greater financial depth is

associated positively and significantly with floating and the ability to issue securities in

domestic currency. This evidence may be important since these measures of financial

development, unlike M2/GDP, account for the substitution away from money once an

economy becomes fully monetized66.




66
  This substitution process may also explain the positive coefficient on the short-term interest rate for the
advanced countries.

                           For the emerging countries the evidence unequivocally suggests that greater

               financial depth is associated with fixed exchange rates. In addition to the fixed exchange

               rate results presented here, the various floating exchange rate indicators are negative.

               Similar evidence obtains for both Latin America and Asia. Also of interest, the bond

               dummy is insignificant in most of the regressions except for Asia, where it is negative




                                                                                      61
and insignificant67. These results seem much more in accord with Haussmann’s original

sin hypothesis.

         The question then arises which measure of financial depth should we pay more

attention to: M2/GDP or FD3? For the advanced countries the broader measure should

surely be superior to M2/GDP but this may not be the case for the emergers because the

stock and bond markets in these countries may still be in a nascent state at least compared

to the advanced countries.

         4.6. Summary

     In conclusion, the evidence presented in this section for the two eras of globalization

suggests some remarkable similarities. In general countries with greater financial

development followed the dominant regime—gold pre 1914,floating post 1973. Also

countries that issued international bonds in terms of their own currencies could

successfully follow the dominant regime. The exchange rate experience of the advanced

countries exactly fits this pattern.

     The case of the emerging countries is however less clear. Before 1914 emergers went

to great lengths to join the gold standard and the financial performance of those who

couldn’t adhere was clearly worse. Today the incidence of emergers who float and who

have greater financial depth is less than the pre 1914 incidence of emergers who adhered

to gold. Those who can not float but need access to international capital according to the

‘original sin’ theory must adhere to hard fixes.

     The evidence for the recent period is mixed on who has greater financial depth.

According to the M2 /GDP results, it is floaters based on the Masson exchange rate

67
  Panel probit regression of the exchange rate regime dummies on FD3 revealed a pattern of coefficients
similar to that in Table 10, again raising the issue of causality.



                                                   62
indicator, although this is not evident from the LYS results which may be the more

economically meaningful. But the FD3 (and FD2) results see hard fixers (especially those

in Asia) as more financially developed. In addition the evidence for Asia which

associates some countries floating experience with greater financial depth may also be

reflecting the fact that Asia is less financially open than Latin America so that it may be

capital controls (hidden or otherwise) that allows these regimes to be viable.

   Thus we conclude that our empirical results for the emerging countries today are in

general consistent with both the ‘hollowing out’ and ‘original sin’ hypothesis. More

research is clearly needed.

   Finally an important fact that emerges from the evidence in this section is that the

number of countries who could issue bonds in terms of their own currencies has not

increased all that much over the past century. Before 1914, it was 8. Today, it is about 25.

Virtually all of the expansion is by countries like Canada, Italy and Sweden who

graduated to advanced status after World War I. There are very few emerging countries

today in either of the lists of bonds that we had access to and most of them only entered

in late in the past decade. The question as to how countries graduate from junior to senior

country status in the bond markets is also a subject for further research.



   Section 5. Conclusion: Financial Maturity: The Holy Grail

   The traditional view is that fixed exchange rate regimes are best for the globalization

of financial markets. This is based on the stellar performance of the classical gold

standard. Yet today we are in another era of globalization as pervasive as the earlier one

and now the dominant regime is floating. This paradox at first glance suggests that rather




                                             63
than the exchange rate regime determining the pace of globalization, it occurs

independent of the exchange rate regime. However as we argue in this paper, although

this may be the case for advanced countries, it is not for emergers whose regime choice is

in large measure driven by international financial integration.

   In this paper we focus on the different historical regime experiences of the core and

the periphery. Before 1914 advanced countries adhered to gold while periphery countries

tried to emulate the core, especially when they were concerned with attracting foreign

capital. Because of their extensive external debt obligations denominated in core country

currencies, peripheral countries were especially vulnerable to financial crises and debt

default. This made devaluations difficult for them, leaving them with the difficult choice

of floating but restricting external borrowing or devoting considerable resources to

maintaining an extra hard peg. Today while advanced countries can successfully float,

emergers must also borrow abroad in terms of advanced country currencies, are afraid to

float for the same reason as their twentieth century forbearers. To maintain access to

foreign capital they may need a hard peg to the core country currencies.

   Thus the key distinction between core and periphery countries, both “then” and

“now”, that we emphasize in this paper is financial maturity. It is evidenced in the ability

to issue international securities denominated in domestic currency or what Ricardo

Haussmann refers to as to as the absence of ‘original sin’. Indeed our hypothesis is that

countries that are financially developed, in a world of open capital markets, should be

able to float as advanced countries do today. Evidence for the core countries that the

classical gold standard operated as a target zone with the gold points serving as bands in

which credible floating could occur and external shocks be buffered is a presage of the




                                             64
regime followed today. Today’s floating is a product of financial maturity and the

development of the technological and institutional structures and constraints that allow

policy makers to follow stable money and fiscal policy without adhering to an external

nominal anchor.

   We present several strands of evidence for our hypothesis that globalization is largely

independent of the regime for advanced countries but drives the exchange rate regime for

the periphery. First, evidence from Feldstein-Horioka tests over the period since 1880

agrees with the ‘Folk’ wisdom that financial integration was high before 1914 as it is

today. But the evidence suggests that it was not the exchange rate regime followed that

mattered but the presence of capital controls. Moreover a comparison between advanced

and emerging countries today suggests that while there is considerable financial

integration among the advanced countries, most of whom can float, this is not the case for

the emergers and indeed those that float may do so because they are not financially open.

  Second in section 3 we elaborate on the financial vulnerability hypothesis which is

related to the recent literature on “original sin”. Descriptive material from the pre 1914

history of the periphery paints a very familiar picture of financially “backward” countries

required to borrow abroad in sterling, franc, marks, or with gold clauses, being hammered

by the crises of the 1890s, forced to devalue and default and then devoting considerable

resources to obtain the gold reserves needed to adhere to gold as if on a currency board

(Russia, Greece) or floating but restricting foreign borrowing (Spain, Portugal) - -

‘hollowing out’ déjà vu. Future research will have to explain the reasons for the inability

which many countries have faced, and most probably will continue to face, when

borrowing abroad.




                                            65
   Finally in section 4 we present some empirical findings for the pre 1914 period

showing a clear connection between the ability to borrow abroad in domestic currency,

gold adherence and financial depth. Extending our methodology to the post 1973 era led

to identical results for the advanced countries whose dominant exchange rate regime is

now floating (with the exception of the European experiment with a monetary union).

   For the emerging countries however it appears as if those that are financially open,

especially the Latin American countries, have difficulty floating because they do suffer

from “original sin” as evidenced in their inability to borrow abroad in domestic

currencies. They tend to have greater financial depth when they have fixed rates. For

Asia, floating exchange rates are associated with one measure of greater financial depth

but this may be because they are less financially open. For another measure fixed rates

and financial depth go hand in hand similar to the experiences of Latin America.

   In conclusion the dynamics of the international monetary system and the evolution of

the exchange rate regime can be understood as a complex involving both the financial

development of countries and international financial integration. Financial crises such as

those in the 1890s and the 1990s are the defining moments that reveal the regime fault

lines between advanced and emerging countries. The evolution from the gold standard to

floating by the advanced countries required achieving financial maturity, the same will

ultimately be required for the rest of the world. In the interim the panoply of intermediate

arrangements with varying forms of government intervention including impediments to

the free flow of capital will prevail. Financial crises as occurred in the 1890s and the

1990s will also continue to be an important part of the process of regime evolution as an

ultimate structuring force.
