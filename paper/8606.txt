                                            ABSTRACT


       We examine the link between increases in housing wealth, financial wealth, and consumer
spending. We rely upon a panel of 14 countries observed annually for various periods during the past 25
years and a panel of U.S. states observed quarterly during the 1980s and 1990s. We impute the aggregate
value of owner-occupied housing, the value of financial assets, and measures of aggregate consumption
for each of the geographic units over time. We estimate regressions relating consumption to income and
wealth measures, finding a statistically significant and rather large effect of housing wealth upon
household consumption.

I.     Introduction

       The dramatic increase in stock values during the recent economic expansion in the U.S.

has led to renewed policy and scientific interest in the effects of household wealth upon

consumption levels. To the extent that the inflation of stock prices increased consumption

pressures during the decade-long boom, there are well known reasons to fear that constant or

declining share prices may exacerbate a slowdown in the economy by depressing the

consumption spending of households.

       There is every reason to expect that changes in housing wealth exert analogous effects

upon household behavior, and institutional innovations (such as second mortgages in the form of

secured lines of credit) have made it as simple to extract cash from housing equity as it is to sell

shares or to borrow on margin.1

       More generally, it has been widely observed in the U.S. and elsewhere that changes in

national wealth are associated with changes in national consumption. In regression models

relating changes in log consumption to changes in log wealth, the estimated relationship is

generally positive and statistically significant. Under a standard interpretation of these results,

from a suitably specified regression, the coefficient measures the “wealth effect” — the causal

effect of exogenous changes in wealth upon consumption behavior. These simple regressions do

admit other interpretations which may be hard to disentangle. Nevertheless, the interpretation of



1
  Indeed, in a speech to the Mortgage bankers Association, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
has ruminated: “One might expect that a significant portion of the unencumbered cash received by
[house] sellers and refinancers was used to purchase goods and services… However, in models of
consumer spending, we have not been able to find much incremental explanatory power of such
extraction. Perhaps this is because sellers’ extraction [of home equity] is sufficiently correlated with
other variables in the model, such as stock-market wealth, that the model has difficulty disentangling
these influences” (Greenspan, 1999).



                                                                                                      1
these results as a “wealth effect,” even as an approximation, justifies careful examination of

these statistical relationships.

        Wealth may take many forms, and as noted below, there is ample reason to think that the

tendency to consume out of stock market wealth is different from the tendency to consume out of

housing wealth.

        In this paper, we provide empirical evidence on the issue by relying upon two bodies of

data: a panel of annual observations on 14 countries measuring aggregate consumption, the

capitalization of stock market wealth, and aggregate housing wealth; and an analogous panel of

quarterly observations on U.S. states estimating consumption, stock ownership, and aggregate

housing wealth. These data exploit the geographical distribution of stock market and housing

market wealth among the U.S. states and the substantial variations in the timing and intensity of

economic activity across developed countries.

        Section II below provides a brief theoretical motivation for the distinction between

housing and financial wealth and a review of the limited evidence on the effects of housing

wealth on consumption and savings behavior.           Section III describes the data sources,

imputations, and computations used to create the two panels. Section IV presents our statistical

results; Section V is a brief conclusion.



II.     Differential Wealth Effects: Theories and Evidence

        A simple formulation of the life cycle savings hypothesis suggests that consumers will

distribute increases in anticipated wealth over time and that the marginal propensity to consume

out of all wealth, whether from stocks, real estate, or any other source, should be the same small

number, something just over the real interest rate. Clearly, such a proportional effect must exist




                                                                                                2
in the long run. However, a number of concerns have been raised about the identification of the

short-run effects of changes in wealth on household spending.

       There are, in fact, many reasons why consumption may be differently affected by the

form in which wealth is held. First, increases in measured wealth of different kinds may be

viewed by households as temporary or uncertain. Second, households may have a bequest motive

which is strengthened by tax laws that favor holding appreciated assets until death. Third,

households may view the accumulation of some kinds of wealth as an end in and of itself.

Fourth, households may not find it easy to measure their wealth, and may not even know what it

is from time to time. The unrealized capital gains held by a household in asset markets may be

transitory, but they can be measured with far more precision in thick markets with many active

traders. Fifth, people may segregate different kinds of wealth into separate “mental accounts,”

which are framed quite differently. The psychology of framing may dictate that certain assets

are more appropriate to use for current expenditures while others are earmarked for long-term

savings (Shefrin and Thaler, 1988).

       Each of these concerns suggests a distinction between the impact of housing wealth and

stock market wealth on consumption. The extent to which people view their currently-measured

wealth as temporary or uncertain may differ between the two forms of wealth. People may have

quite different motives about bequeathing their stock portfolios and bequeathing their

homesteads to heirs. The emotional impact of accumulating stock market wealth may be quite

different from that of real estate wealth. People are likely to be less aware of the short-run

changes in real estate wealth since they do not receive regular updates on its value. Stock market

wealth can be tracked daily in the newspaper.




                                                                                                3
       Differential impacts of various forms of wealth on consumption have already been

demonstrated in a quasi-experimental setting. For example, increases in unexpected wealth in

the form of lottery winnings lead to large effects on consumption. Responses to surveys about

the uses put to different forms of wealth imply strikingly different “wealth effects.” By analogy,

it is entirely reasonable to expect that there should be a different impact of real estate wealth, as

compared with stock market wealth, on consumption.

       The effect of housing wealth on consumption has not been widely explored. An early

study by Elliott (1980) relied upon aggregate data on consumer spending, financial wealth, and

nonfinancial wealth, finding that variations in the latter had no effect upon consumption.

Elliott’s analysis suggested that “houses, automobiles, furniture, and appliances may be treated

more as part of the environment by households than as a part of realizable purchasing power.

(1980:528).” These results were challenged by Peek (1983) and by Bhatia (1987) who

questioned the methods used to estimate real non-financial wealth. More recently, Case (1992)

found evidence of a substantial consumption effect during the real estate price boom in the late

1980’s using aggregate data for New England.

       Using data on individual households from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID),

Skinner (1989) found a small but significant effect of housing wealth upon consumption.

Sheiner (1995) explored the possibility that home price increases may actually increase the

savings of renters who then face higher down payment requirements to purchase houses. Her

statistical results, however, were quite inconclusive. Engelhardt (1996) provided a direct test of

the link between house price appreciation and consumption, also using the PSID. He estimated

that the marginal propensity to consume out of real capital gains in owner-occupied housing is

about 0.3, but this arose from an asymmetry in behavioral response. Households experiencing




                                                                                                   4
real gains did not change their savings and consumption behavior appreciably, while those

experiencing capital losses did reduce their consumption behavior.

       Much of the limited evidence on the behavioral response to changes in housing wealth

has arisen from consideration of the “savings puzzle.” During the late 1990’s, personal savings

as measured in the National Income and Product Accounts fell sharply to practically zero in

2000. But it was shown that if unrealized capital gains in housing were included in both the

income and savings of the household sector (as suggested by the Haig-Simons criteria), then the

aggregate personal savings rates computed were much higher (Gale and Sabelhaus, 1999).

       Similarly, Hoynes and McFadden (1997) used micro (PSID) data to investigate the

correlation between individual savings rates and rates of capital gains in housing. Consistent

with the perspective of Thaler (1990), the authors found little evidence that households were

changing their savings in non-housing assets in response to expectations about capital gains in

owner-occupied housing.

       The only other study of the “wealth effect” which has disaggregated housing and stock

market components of wealth is an analysis of the Retirement History Survey by Levin (1998).

Levin found essentially no effect of housing wealth on consumption.

       All of these micro studies of consumer behavior rely upon owners’ estimates of housing

values. Evidence does suggest that the bias in owners’ estimates is small (see below), but these

estimates typically have high sampling variances (Kain and Quigley, 1972; Goodman and Ittner,

1992). This leaves much ambiguity in the interpretation of statistical results.




                                                                                              5
III.   The Data

       We address the linkage between stock market wealth, housing wealth, and household

consumption using two distinct bodies of panel data that have been assembled in parallel for this

purpose. The data sets have different strengths and weaknesses, which generally complement

each other for the study of these relationships.

       The first data set consists of a panel of quarterly data constructed for U.S. states from

1982 through 1999. This panel exploits the fact that the distribution of increases in housing

values has been anything but uniform across regions in the U.S., and the increases in stock

market wealth have been quite unequally distributed across households geographically. This

panel offers the advantage that data definitions and institutions are uniform across geographical

units. In addition, the sample size is large. One disadvantage of this data set arises because one

key variable must be imputed to the various states on the basis of other data measured at the state

level. Another disadvantage of these data is that the U.S. stock market has trended upwards

during the entire sample period, and the period may have been unusual (Shiller, 2000).

       The second body of data consists of a panel of annual observations on 14 developed

countries for various years during the period of 1975-1999.            This data set relies upon

consumption measures derived from national income accounts, not our imputations, but we

suspect that housing prices and housing wealth in this panel are measured less accurately. In

addition, the sample of countries with consistent data is small. Finally, there are substantial

institutional differences among countries, for example, variations in the taxation of wealth and

capital gains and in institutional constraints affecting borrowing and saving.

       Both data sets contain substantial time series and cross sectional variation in cyclical

activity and exhibit substantial variation in consumption and wealth accumulation.




                                                                                                 6
       A. U.S. State Data

       We estimate stock market wealth, housing market wealth and consumption for each U.S.

state, quarterly, for the period 1982-1999.

       Estimates of aggregate financial wealth were obtained annually from the Federal Reserve

Flow of Funds (FOF) accounts and compared to the aggregate capitalization of the three major

U.S. stock markets. From the FOF accounts, we computed the sum of corporate equities held by

the household sector, pension fund reserves, and mutual funds. The FOF series has risen in

nominal terms from under $2 trillion dollars in 1982 to $18 trillion in 1999. It is worth noting

that more than half of the gross increase between 1982 and 1999 occurred during the four years

between 1995 and 1999. The total nominal increase for the 13 years between 1982 and 1995 was

$7.5 trillion; the total nominal increase during the 4 years between 1995 and 1999 was an

astonishing $8.4 trillion. Nearly all variation in the FOF aggregate arises from variation in the

capitalization of the stock market. Figure 1 summarizes the course of U.S. stock market wealth

during the period 1982-1999.

       To distribute household financial assets geographically, we exploit the correlation

between holdings of mutual funds and other financial assets. We obtained mutual fund holdings

by state from the Investment Company Institute (ICI). The ICI data are available for the years

1986, 1987, 1989, 1991 and 1993. We assumed that for 1982:I through 1986:IV, the distribution

was the same as it was in 1986; similarly we assumed that the 1993 distribution held for the

period 1993-99. We further assumed that direct household holdings of stocks and pension fund

reserves were distributed in the same geographical pattern as mutual funds. These are clearly

strong assumptions, but there are no alternative data.




                                                                                               7
          Estimates of housing market wealth were constructed from repeat sales price indexes

applied to the base values reported in the 1990 Census of Population and Housing by state.

Weighted repeat sales (WRS) indexes (See Case and Shiller, 1987, 1989) constructed by Case

Shiller Weiss Inc. are available for this entire period for only 16 states. However, the Office of

Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) publishes state level repeat value indexes

quarterly. These indexes are produced by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and are available for all

states.

          The Case-Shiller indexes are the best available for our purposes and wherever possible

we use them.2 The WRS and the OFHEO indexes are highly correlated, however, and we use the

OFHEO indexes where WRS indexes are not available.

          Equation (1) indicates how the panel on aggregate housing wealth was constructed for

each state:

(1)       Vit = R it N it I it Vio ,

where,

          Vit = aggregate value of owner occupied housing in state i in quarter t,

          Rit = homeownership rate in state i in quarter t,

          Nit = number of households in state i in quarter t,

          Iit = weighted repeat sales price index, WRS or OFHEO, for state i in quarter t (Ii1 = 1,
                for 1990:I),

          Vio = mean home price for state i in the base year, 1990.




2
  While OFHEO uses a similar index construction methodology (the WRS method of Case and Shiller,
1987), their indexes are in part based on appraisals at the time of refinancing rather than on arms-length
transactions. The Case-Shiller indexes use various devices to filter out non-arms-length sales data.



                                                                                                        8
       The total number of households N as well as the homeownership rates R were obtained

from the Current Population Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau annually and

interpolated for quarterly intervals. Aggregate wealth varies as a result of price appreciation of

the existing stock as well as additions to the number of owner-occupied dwellings.

       The baseline figures for state level mean home prices Vio are derived from estimates of

house values reported in the 1990 Census of Population and Housing. As noted, several studies

have attempted to measure the bias in owner estimates of house values. The estimates range

from minus 2 percent (Kain and Quigley, 1972, and Follain and Malpezzi, 1981) to plus 6

percent (Goodman and Ittner, 1992). However, Goodman and Ittner point out that for many

purposes, owners’ estimates may indeed be the appropriate measures of housing wealth;

household consumption and savings behavior is likely to be based upon perceived home value.

The aggregate nominal value of the owner-occupied stock in the U.S. grew from $2.8 trillion in

1982 to $7.2 trillion in 1999. Figure 1 also summarizes the course of aggregate wealth in owner-

occupied housing during the 1982-1999 period.

       Unfortunately, there are no measures of consumption spending by households recorded at

the state level. However a panel of retail sales has been constructed by Regional Financial

Associates (RFA, see Zandi, 1997). Retail sales account for roughly half of total consumer

expenditures.3

       The RFA estimates were constructed from county level sales tax data, the Census of

Retail Trade published by the U.S. Census Bureau, and the Census Bureau’s monthly national

retail sales estimates. For states with no retail sales tax or where data were insufficient to

support imputations, RFA based its estimates on the historical relationship between retail sales


3
 In 1997, for example, gross domestic product was $8.08 trillion, household consumption spending was
$5.49 trillion, and retail sales amounted to $2.63 trillion.



                                                                                                  9
and retail employment. Data on retail employment by state are available from the Bureau of

Labor Statistics. Regression estimates relating sales to employment were benchmarked to the

Census of Retail Trade available at five-year intervals. Estimates for all states were within five

percent of the benchmarks.

       Retail sales can be expected to differ systematically from consumption spending for

several reasons. Clearly, in states with relatively large tourist industries recorded retail sales per

resident are high. Nevada, for example, with 26 percent of its labor force employed in tourism,

had per capita retail sales of $3,022 in 1997:I, third highest among the 50 states. In addition,

states with low or no sales tax can be expected to have high retail sales per resident. For

example, New Hampshire with no sales tax had per capita retail sales of $3,200 in 1997:I,

highest among the 50 states. Most states, however, were tightly clustered around the mean of

$2,385 in 1997:I.

       While there are systematic differences between retail sales and consumption, to the extent

that differences are state specific, this can be accounted for in multivariate statistical analysis.

Data on retail sales, house values, and stock market valuation, by state and quarter, were

expressed per capita in real terms using the Current Population Survey and the GDP deflator.

       B. International Data

       It was possible to obtain roughly comparable data for a panel of 14 developed countries

during the period 1975-1996.4 In an analogous manner, we estimate stock market wealth,

housing market wealth, and consumption for each country for each year.




4
  The countries include: Belgium (1978-1996), Canada (1978-1993), Denmark (1978-1996), Finland
(1978-1996), France (1982-1996), Germany (1991-1995), Ireland (1982-1987, 1994-1995), Netherlands
(1978-1996), Norway (1980-1996), Spain (1975-1996), Sweden (1975-1996), Switzerland (1991-1996),
the United Kingdom (1978-1996), and the United States (1975-1997).




                                                                                                   10
          Estimates of aggregate stock market wealth for each country were obtained from the

Global Financial Database which reports domestic stock market capitalization annually for each

country. To the extent that the fraction of the stock market wealth owned domestically varies

among countries, this can be accounted for in the statistical analysis reported below by

permitting fixed effects to vary across countries. Figure 2 reports the evolution of stock market

wealth in each country, relative to its aggregate value in 1994. (The entry for Ireland is not an

error.)

          Estimates of housing market wealth were constructed in a manner parallel to those used

for the panel of U.S. states which are summarized in equation (1). Indexes of annual housing

prices Iit were obtained from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) which consolidated

housing prices reported for some 15 industrialized countries (See Kennedy and Andersen, 1994

or Englund and Ionnides, 1997). The BIS series for the United States was quite short, so the

national OFHEO-Freddie Mac series described earlier is used for the U.S.

          Consistent data on housing prices for a benchmark year, Vio, were not available for the

panel of countries. This means that regression estimates without fixed effects for each country

(which control for country-specific benchmarks) are meaningful only under very restrictive

assumptions.

          Data on the number of owner-occupied housing units was obtained from various issues of

the Annual Bulletin of Housing and Building Statistics for Europe and North America published

by the United Nations.       The series describing the owner-occupied housing stock was not

complete for some years in all the countries. More complete data existed for the total housing

stock of each country. Where missing, the owner-occupied housing stock was estimated from

the total housing stock reported for that year and the ratio of the owner-occupied housing stock




                                                                                              11
to the total housing stock for an adjacent year. Missing data points were estimated by linear

interpolation.5

       Figure 3 reports the evolution of housing market wealth in the 14 countries relative to its

aggregate value in 1990. The variations over time in housing market wealth are striking.

       Consumption data were collected from the International Financial Statistics database.

“Household Consumption Expenditure including Nonprofit-Institution-Serving Households” is

used for in the European Union countries that rely upon the European System of Accounts

(ESA1995). “Private Consumption” is used for other countries, according to the System of

National Accounts (SNA93). Data on aggregate consumption, housing values and stock market

valuations, by country and year, were expressed per capita in real terms using UN population

data and the consumer price index.

       The simple correlations among these variables: consumption, housing wealth, and

financial wealth are reported in Appendix Table A.



IV.    Statistical Results

       Table 1 presents basic statistical relationships between per capita consumption, income,

and the two measures of wealth. The first three columns present regression results for the panel

of countries (228 observations on 14 countries), while the next three columns report the results

for the panel of states (3498 observations on 50 states and the District of Columbia).6




5
  In addition, we are grateful for unpublished estimates of the stock of owner-occupied housing supplied
by Paloma Taltavull de La Paz (for Spain) and the value of owner-occupied housing by Barot Bharot (for
Sweden).
6
  The state panel is not quite balanced. The series includes quarterly observations from 1982:I through
1999:IV for all states but Arizona. The time series for Arizona begins in 1987:I.




                                                                                                     12
          The tables report three specifications of the relationship. All include fixed effects, i.e., a

set of dummy variables for each country and state. Model II also includes state and country

specific time trends. Model III includes year-specific fixed effects as well as fixed effects for

countries. For states, Model III also includes seasonal fixed effects, i.e., one for each quarter.

          As the table indicates, in the simplest formulation, the estimated effect of housing market

wealth on consumption is significant and large. In the international comparison, the elasticity

ranges from 0.11 to 0.17. In the cross state comparison, the estimated elasticity is between 0.05

and 0.09. In contrast, the estimated effects of financial wealth upon consumption are smaller. In

the simplest model, the estimate from the country panel is 0.02. In the other two regressions, the

estimated coefficient is insignificantly different from zero, perhaps reflecting the more restricted

ownership of non-financial wealth in Western European countries.

          The table also reports the t-ratio for the hypothesis that the difference between the

coefficient estimates measuring housing and financial market effects is zero. A formal test of the

hypothesis that the coefficient on housing market wealth is equal to that of stock market wealth

(against the alternative hypothesis that the two coefficients differ) is presented, as well as a test

of the hypothesis that the coefficient on housing market wealth exceeds the coefficient on

financial wealth. The evidence suggests that housing market wealth has a more important effect

on consumption than does financial wealth.

          Table 2 reports the results when the effects of first order serial correlation are also

estimated.7      The estimated serial correlation coefficient is highly significant and large in

magnitude. The coefficients of housing market wealth change only a little. For the panel of

    These models rely on sequential estimation using the Prais-Winsten technique.




                                                                                                     13
countries, the estimated elasticity ranges from 0.11 to 0.14; for the panel of states, the estimate is

0.62.

        In five of the six regressions reported, the hypothesis that the effects of housing market

wealth are larger than those of financial wealth is accepted by a wide margin.

        Table 3 presents results with all variables expressed as first differences.            In this

formulation the coefficient on housing market wealth is significant in all specifications, while the

coefficient of financial wealth is essentially zero.

        Table 4 presents tests for the presence of unit roots in the time series data we analyze.

For most, but not all, of the state series we can reject the hypothesis of unit roots in the data. The

table also presents a test for the presence of a common unit root in the four country data series

and in the four data series for U.S. states (Madalla and Wu, 1999). The presence of a common

unit root is rejected by a wide margin for each of the series for both panels.8

        Despite this, Table 5 presents the model in first differences including lagged

consumption, the widely-adopted (“standard”) correction for the presence of unit roots. Again,

the results support the highly significant effect of housing market wealth upon consumption,

especially large relative to financial wealth.



V.      Conclusion

        We have examined the wealth effect with a cross-sectional time-series data sets that are

more comprehensive than any applied to the wealth effect before and with a number of different

econometric specifications.     The statistical results are variable depending on econometric


8
  The specific test we report in Table 4 uses a model with no intercept and no trend in conducting the
augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests. The table also relies upon a four-quarter lag for the state panel,
and a one-year lag for the country panel. The conclusions presented in the table are unchanged if the
ADF model includes an intercept and/or a trend; they are also insensitive to the lag structure.



                                                                                                    14
specification, and so any conclusion must be tentative. Nevertheless, the evidence of a stock

market wealth effect is weak; the common presumption that there is strong evidence for the

wealth effect is not supported in our results. However, we do find strong evidence that variations

in housing market wealth have important effects upon consumption.           This evidence arises

consistently using panels of U.S. states and individual countries and is robust to differences in

model specification. The housing market appears to be more important than the stock market in

influencing consumption in developed countries.
