                                                ABSTRACT

Aggregate citation behavior plays a key role in scientific knowledge diffusion, as citations document
the collective and cumulative nature of knowledge production. Additionally, citations are commonly
taken as input for several influential evaluative metrics used to assess researchers’ performance. Nevertheless,
little effort has been devoted to understanding and quantifying how article citations evolve over the
years following an article’s publication and how these trends vary across fields of research. By collecting
and analyzing a dataset consisting of more than five million citations to 59,707 research articles from
12 dissimilar fields of research, we quantify how citations evolve across fields of research as articles
grow older. Analyzing raw citation data spanning different periods poses several methodological challenges;
to tackle them, we employ quantile regression, a technique that makes it possible to control for citation
inflation (the fact that citations have become more common nowadays) and to take into consideration
the well-known asymmetry in the distribution of citations. We find that citations follow a life-cycle
pattern. In the first years after publication, articles generally receive a small but growing number of
citations until, eventually, they reach a peak from which they then decline. Importantly, the shape
of these life cycles varies greatly from one field to the next. Given that several influential metrics restrict
their input to a certain range in terms of the number of years since publication, these differences are
by no means neutral and should be taken into account when evaluating researchers or their institutions.

Life-cycle of scholarly articles across
fields of research
Annual citations are presumed to have a life-cycle:            where ci,t stands for citations of paper i at age t
after publication, articles begin to be read and cited;        (years since publication, which range from -2 to 15).
eventually, the number of citations reaches a peak, af-        The set S contains integers ranging from -2 to 15

 The sample consists of 2,584 research articles published from 1985 to 2000. The base category
for the age of the paper is 0 and, for the year of citation, the base is 1985. All columns include
controls for year-of-citation fixed effects (γy (τ )). Absolute values of stratified bootstrapped t
statistics are given in parentheses (1,000 iterations). Stratification is detailed in Materials and
Methods.
