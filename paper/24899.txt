The Effect of Disenrollment from Medicaid on Employment, Insurance Coverage, Health
and Health Care Utilization

                                              ABSTRACT

This study examines the effect of a Medicaid disenrollment on employment, sources of health insurance
coverage, health, and health care utilization of childless adults using longitudinal data from the 2004
Panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation. From July through September 2005, TennCare,
the Tennessee Medicaid program, disenrolled approximately 170,000 adults following a change in
eligibility rules. Following this eligibility change, the fraction of adults in Tennessee covered by Medicaid
fell by over 5 percentage points while uninsured rates increased by almost 5 percentage points relative
to adults in other Southern states. There is no evidence of an increase in employment rates in Tennessee
following the disenrollment. Self-reported health and access to medical care worsened as hospitalization
rates, doctor visits, and dentist visits all declined while the use of free or public clinics increased.
The Tennessee experience suggests that undoing the expansion of Medicaid eligibility to adults that
occurred under the Affordable Care Act likely would reduce health insurance coverage, reduce health
care access, and worsen health but would not lead to increases in employment.

I.     Introduction

       The 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) led to substantial increases in the
percentage of Americans with health insurance coverage. In large part, this
increase was the result of an increase in Medicaid coverage (Frean et al. 2017).
The ACA gave states the option of increasing Medicaid eligibility to all
individuals up to 133% of the Federal Poverty Line (FPL) and states that
expanded eligibility received an increased level of Federal funding for their
“expansion” populations. The expansion in Medicaid eligibility under the ACA
primarily affected adults and in particular adults without dependent children as
these individuals were typically only eligible at low levels of income prior to the
ACA.
       As of July 2017, Medicaid and CHIP covered more than 74 million low-
income adults and children, an increase of over 17 million since implementation
of the ACA (CMS 2017) with most of this increase coming from adults.
However, the Medicaid expansion under the ACA has been controversial. In
2017, several bills were debated in Congress that would have eliminated the
enhanced Federal funding for expansion populations, changed the Federal funding
formula to one in which states were given a per-capita allotment, and reduced the
growth rate in Federal Medicaid contributions to one below the expected growth
in medical spending. The combination of these changes led the Congressional
Budget Office (CBO) to predict Medicaid enrollment to be reduced and eligibility
among adults to be eliminated or scaled back (CBO 2017).
       In this paper, I examine the effects of a contraction in adult Medicaid
eligibility that occurred prior to the ACA when Tennessee discontinued its adult
expansion of its Medicaid program, called TennCare, in the middle of 2005. In
particular, I use the 2004 Panel of the Survey of Income and Program
Participation (SIPP) to compare changes in sources of health insurance,



                                         2
employment outcomes, and measures of health and health care utilization among
adult residents of Tennessee relative to adult residents of other Southern states
over a time period spanning the TennCare disenrollment.
        I find that, following the change in rules that reduced adult Medicaid
eligibility in Tennessee in 2005, the fraction of adults in Tennessee covered by
Medicaid fell by over 5 percentage points and uninsured rates increased by almost
5 percentage points. The difference between these two changes is due to an
increase in Medicare coverage in Tennessee (as “duals”, individuals eligible for
both Medicare and Medicaid, lost their Medicaid coverage); there was no change
in rates of private health insurance coverage. There is no evidence of an increase
in employment rates following the TennCare disenrollment, though there was a
small increase in reported work-preventing disabilities and a small shift from full-
time to part-time work in the initial months of disenrollment. Self-reported health
and access to medical care worsened as hospitalization rates, doctor visits, and
dentist visits all declined while, at the same time, there were increases in the use
of free or public health clinics.
        In terms of sources of health insurance coverage, the experience in
Tennessee following TennCare disenrollment is broadly consistent with that of
other states following Medicaid expansion or contraction, with a notable
exception of Garthwaite et al. (2014) which reports an increase in private
insurance coverage following the TennCare disenrollment. Similarly, the results
showing reduced access to health care and worse self-reported health is consistent
with both the previous literature on Medicaid expansion and with that reported in
Tello-Trillo (2016) for the TennCare disenrollment specifically. While the
previous literature of the effect of Medicaid eligibility on labor supply has been
mixed, my results are in stark contrast with the very large labor supply effects
found by Garthwaite et al. (2014).



                                          3
         The divergent results for employment across studies using different
Census surveys suggests a substantial amount of uncertainty over what the impact
of the TennCare disenrollment was on employment and other labor market
outcomes. In my view, since the results in this study based on the SIPP more
closely align with the relatively modest labor supply effects found in the previous
literature (e.g., Dague et al. 2017 and Baicker et al. 2014), it seems likely that the
TennCare disenrollment led to, at most, modestly sized increases in employment.


II.      Background

         In 1994, Tennessee implemented a novel public health insurance
expansion that offered subsidized Medicaid coverage to individuals up to 400% of
the Federal Poverty Line who were either “uninsured” or “uninsurable.” The
TennCare expansion covered both parents and childless adults, with childless
adults comprising 60% of the expansion group (Moreno and Hoag 2001).1 By
comparison, most states at this time did not cover childless adults at income levels
near or above the Federal Poverty Level (Kaiser Family Foundation 2005).
         In response to a looming fiscal crisis, following the election of a new
Governor, and after substantial debate, in 2005 TennCare stopped covering adults
who didn’t qualify for traditional Medicaid, effectively disenrolling the expansion
group. This disenrollment led to a reduction in program rolls of over 170,000
individuals including adults in the “uninsured” and “uninsurable” categories and
roughly 30,000 individuals who were dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare,
though these individuals continued to be eligible for Medicare (for details, see

1 Moreno and Hoag (2001) conducted a survey of TennCare enrollees and reported that 27.7% of
the adult expansion group was married adults with children. The fraction of the expansion group
that was childless adults was collected in the survey, but not reported in the original study. The
study authors graciously retrieved the archived data from this survey and provided this calculation
to me in an email on May 8, 2018.



                                                 4
Farrar et al. 2007). Disenrollment began in July 2005 and continued through
September 2005. Both parents and childless adults who were enrolled in program
were disenrolled (Kaiser Family Foundation 2005; Families USA 2007). In
addition, benefit caps, including caps on the numbers of physician visits,
outpatient visits, inpatient hospital stays, and pharmacy prescriptions, were
imposed on individuals remaining on TennCare (Kaiser Family Foundation 2005;
Emerson et al. 2012).


III.   Previous Literature
       Previous studies of the effects of expanded Medicaid coverage for adults
have been primarily concerned with three questions. First, the extent to which
expansions in Medicaid eligibility lead to expansions in health insurance coverage
as opposed to crowding-out private coverage. Second, whether Medicaid
expansions lead to improvements in health care access and health. And third,
whether Medicaid expansions lead to reduced labor supply. A recent and
comprehensive review of this literature is in Buchmueller et al. (2016).
       A substantial body of research has shown that adult Medicaid expansions
have led to reductions in the fractions of adults who are uninsured and
improvements in access to health care. However, a large literature also exists
examining the potential displacement, or “crowd-out” of private insurance
coverage by expansions in Medicaid eligibility. Excellent reviews of the crowd-
out literature are in Gruber (2003); Davidson et al. (2004); Blewett and Call
(2007); and Gruber and Simon (2008). While the range of crowd-out rates found
in the existing literature both is large and remains the subject of debate, two
important estimates are frequently cited: the (approximate) 50% crowd-out rate
found in the seminal Cutler and Gruber (1996) paper covering the Medicaid
expansions of the late 1980s and early 1990s and the 25% - 50% range arrived at
in an influential review by the CBO (2007).


                                          5
       Interestingly, the few papers using panel data to estimate the crowd-out
rate tend to find lower estimates than those using repeated cross-sectional data.
For example, using the 1990 SIPP, Blumberg et al. (2000) estimates that 4% of
newly eligible children lost private coverage and, using administrative panel data,
Dague et al. (2014) found that between 4% and 18% of newly eligible adults lost
private coverage.
       Uninsured adults have been found to forgo care and, in particular for
uninsured adults with chronic conditions, to have poor health outcomes (Institute
of Medicine 2009). Correspondingly, there is substantial research showing that
adult expansions in Medicaid eligibility can improve access to health care (e.g.,
Finkelstein et al. 2012; Sommers et al. 2017; DeLeire et al. 2013; Burns et al.
2014) and also evidence that Medicaid expansion can improve health (e.g.,
Finkelstein et al. 2012) and reduce mortality (Sommers et al. 2012; Currie and
Gruber 1996). However, not all studies find improvements in health and
mortality (Baicker et al. 2013; Kaestner 2016; Black et al. 2017).
       A number of previous studies have examined the impacts of the TennCare
contraction in 2005 on health and on access to health care. Both Tello-Trillo
(2016) and Tarazi (2017) use data from the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance
System and the National Health Interview System to examine the impact of the
Medicaid disenrollment on access to care and self-reported health and both find
that the disenrollment worsened access to medical care, decreased primary care
physician visits, worsened self-reported health, and led to a shift of care from
primary care towards emergency department visits. Emerson et al. (2012) found
that the disenrollment led to an increase in the number of uninsured ambulatory-
care sensitive ER visits. Similarly, Ghosh and Simon (2015) used the state-
impatient databases and found that the TennCare contraction decreased the share
of hospitalizations covered by Medicaid, increased the share of hospitalizations
for which the patient was uninsured, and increased uninsured hospitalizations


                                          6
originating from emergency room visits. While the payor-mix of ER visits
changed, Heavrin et al. (2011) showed that the TennCare disenrollment did not
lead to an overall increase in ER visits.
       Because Medicaid is a means-tested program, it can provide a disincentive
to work, or to increase hours, if these additional earnings would make an
individual ineligible for the program. Economic theory predicts that means-tested
cash and in-kind transfer programs generally should reduce labor supply, and
extensive empirical research typically has shown that such programs do indeed
have the hypothesized effect (e.g., Moffitt 2002). However, the literature on
Medicaid’s effect on the labor supply of low-income adults is mixed. While some
work finds strong work disincentives (Ellwood and Adams 1990; Moffitt and
Wolfe 1992; Dave et al. 2015; Kim 2016; Dague et al. 2017), other papers find
weaker disincentives or even positive incentives (Yelowitz 1995; Montgomery
and Navin 2000; Ham and Shore-Sheppard 2005; Hamersma and Kim 2009;
Hamersma 2013; Strumpf 2011; Baicker et al. 2014). The wide range of
estimates arising from the existing literature suggests effects may depend upon
populations studied or on the sources of data used in the analysis.
       Two recent papers have focused on the labor supply responses of the 2005
TennCare disenrollment. Garthwaite et al. (2014) use data from the Annual Social
and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey (March CPS) and
find both large reductions in Medicaid coverage and large increases in the
employment rates of childless adults relative to parents in Tennessee following
this change in eligibility rules. These results are very large and consistent with a
60-percentage point reduction in employment stemming from the availability of
public insurance. Ham and Ueda (2017) replicate the Garthwaite et al. (2014)
estimate of the labor supply response to the TennCare disenrollment, but find that
the large labor supply responses are found only in the March CPS. When they use
either all the months of the CPS or the American Community Survey, they find


                                            7
much smaller, and sometimes negative, estimates of the labor supply response to
the TennCare disenrollment. In a related paper, Argys et al. (2017) uses data
from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Consumer Credit Panel and finds
that the TennCare disenrollment led to a large decline in credit risk scores, which
is inconsistent with an increase in employment. These findings suggest that even
estimates of the labor supply response to a specific policy change and population
can be heterogeneous with respect to the data set used.
        A number of studies have examined the interaction between adult
Medicaid expansions and enrollment in the Supplemental Security Income
Program (SSI), a disability program that is also means tested. In addition to
providing a cash benefit, adults in SSI are eligible for Medicaid. Being eligible
for Medicaid without having to go through the difficult process of applying for
disability should reduce the benefit SSI and reduce applications and enrollment.
These studies, including Yelowitz (1998, 2000), Baicker et al. (2014), Maestas et
al. (2014), Garthwaite et al. (2014), Burns and Dague (2017), and Soni et al.
(2017), have generally found that expanded Medicaid eligibility for adults has led
to reduced SSI caseloads.
        This study contributes to the literatures on the effects of Medicaid
disenrollment on employment, insurance coverage, and health and health care
utilization in three ways. First, I use a single data set, the SIPP, to study all three
sets of outcomes. Second, this study is the first to use a panel survey to study the
Tennessee disenrollment, which enables me to follow individuals over time as
they are disenrolled from Medicaid and to control for unobserved and time-
invariant characteristics of individuals that might be associated both with
Medicaid disenrollment and with employment and health outcomes. Finally, as
the existing literature is comprised of a wide range of estimates of the effect of
Medicaid on labor supply, additional estimates from new data sources are needed.

III.   Data and Measures

       The data for this study come from the 2004 panel of the SIPP, a product of
the U.S. Census Bureau. The 2004 SIPP collects monthly data on sources of
income, employment, and sources of insurance coverage for a representative
sample of U.S. households in 12 interviews, or “waves.” Waves are spaced at
four-month intervals and, in each interview, households are asked about the
current (interview) month and for each of the three preceding months. Interviews
are staggered over households so that approximately one-fourth of households in
the sample are interviewed each month. Because of budget cuts, the 2004 SIPP
severely reduced its sample size beginning in wave 9 (Killion 2009). For this
reason, I restrict my analysis to waves 1-8. Because of the well-known issues
related to seam bias (see Burkhead and Coder 1985; Coder et al. 1987; Moore
2008), I restrict my main analyses to responses in the interview month. Thus, the
period I consider is January 2004 through August 2006. I also restrict the sample
to households who responded to each of the wave 1 through wave 8 interviews.
       The sample is further limited to adults between the ages of 18 and 64 who
resided in Tennessee or in other states in the Southern Census region (Delaware,
Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, District of
Columbia, West Virginia, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana,
Oklahoma, and Texas) as of the fourth interview (which occurred between
January and April 2004).
       In addition to data collected in the “core survey” which is administered
every wave, additional data is collected periodically in topical module surveys. I
use data from the topical modules administered during waves 3 and 6, which



                                         9
collected data on self-reported health and health care utilization. These two
topical modules were administered from July 2004 through December 2004 and
from July 2005 through December 2005 respectively.
        In total, the study sample includes 18,269 individuals with responses to
the core surveys (representing 136,388 observations) and 18,187 individuals with
responses to the topical module surveys (representing 36,374 observations).
        The main outcomes used in the analysis include measures of (a) sources of
health insurance coverage, (b) employment, and (c) health and health care
utilization. Sources of health insurance coverage are asked about for each
household member in each reference month in the core survey. Sources include
Medicare, Medicaid, and private health insurance.2 Individuals for whom no
source of health insurance coverage is reported are consider uninsured.
Individuals can report more than one source of coverage in a month. I force the
measures to be mutually exclusive and exhaustive using the following ordering:
Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurance. For example, individuals with both
Medicaid and Medicare coverage in a month are coded as having Medicaid
coverage.
        Employment status is also asked of each individual in each month in the
core survey. I code individuals as employed if they report having a job for at least
one week in the reference month. Employed individuals are coded as full-time if
they worked 35 hours in each week that they worked at a job, and are otherwise
coded as part-time. Individuals are coded as having a work-preventing disability if



2 The survey also asks for the source of private health insurance including a current employer, a
former employer, union, Tricare/Champus, ChampVA, Military/VA, privately purchased (non-
group), or other. I do not separate analyze these sources of private health insurance coverage,
though in unreported analyses I did separate private health insurance into group policies owned by
the individual, group policies owned by someone else, and non-group policies. Trends in these
categories did not differ from the overall trends in private coverage.



                                               10
they report having a health or condition preventing them from working at a job or
business.
        Health and health care utilization measures are taken from the topical
modules administered in waves 3 and 6. Self reported health is reported for each
individual on a 5-point Likert scale. I recode these responses into a binary
variable that equals one if self-reported health is “excellent” or “very good” and
equals zero otherwise. Health care utilization measures refer to 12 months prior
to the interview and respondents are asked whether they had any hospital stays of
at least one night, the number of nights spent in hospitals, the number of doctors
visits, the number of dentists visits, whether used any prescription medication,
whether they had any visits to the emergency room, and whether they had any
visits to a free clinic or a public health department.
        Table 1 reports summary statistics on the health insurance and
employment measures and Table 2 reports summary statistics on the health and
health care utilization measures. These statistics are reported for the sample
overall and separately for Tennessee versus other Southern states and separately
for the January 2004 – June 2005 period and the July 2005 – August 2006 period.3


IV. Methods

        As discussed above, TennCare disenrolled its expansion group between
July and September 2005. I therefore consider July 2005 through August 2006 to
be the “post-disenrollment” period, though in some specifications I separately
consider July through September 2005 to be an “implementation” period. In all
specifications, January 2004 through June 2005 is the “pre-disenrollment” period.


3Summary statistics are further broken out between parents and childless adults in Appendix
Tables 1 and 2.



                                               11
           I estimate individual-level fixed effects models of the following form in
order to capture the effect of the TennCare disenrollment on health insurance
coverage, employment, and health and health care access outcomes:4
(1)        𝑌𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽2 (𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 × 𝑇𝑁)𝑖𝑡 + 𝜑𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡

      where:

      Yit is the outcome (source of health insurance coverage, employment, health, or
      medical care access) for individual i in month t,
      Postit is an indicator for months between July 2005 and August 2006,
      TNi is a time-invariant indicator for whether the individual resided in
      Tennessee (as opposed to in another Southern state) in wave 4, and
      φi is an individual fixed effect.


      I also estimate a slightly more flexible model in which I allow for a different
effect in the implementation period, July 2005 through September 2005:
(2)        𝑌𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝐼𝑚𝑝𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽3 (𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 × 𝑇𝑁)𝑖𝑡
                                    +𝛽4 (𝐼𝑚𝑝 × 𝑇𝑁)𝑖𝑡 + 𝜑𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡
where:
      Impit is an indicator for months between July 2005 and September 2005, and
      Postit is an indicator for months between October 2005 and August 2006.


Finally, I also estimate a flexible model in which I allow for a full set of month
indicators and Tennessee by month interactions.
(3)        𝑌𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽0 + ∑ 𝛽𝑗 𝑀𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑡 + ∑ 𝛾𝑗 (𝑀𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ × 𝑇𝑁)𝑖𝑡 + 𝜑𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡
where:



4   In all models, I cluster standard errors at the state level.



                                                      12
    Monthit is a set of binary month variables for months between February 2004
and June 2006.5
    Because of the timing of the topical module surveys, I slightly redefine the
definitions of the pre- and post-disenrollment periods when estimating the models
for outcomes that come from the wave 3 and wave 6 topical modules. In
particular, in these models the observations from wave 6 (July 2005 – December
2005) are in the post-disenrollment period and the observations from wave 3 (July
2004 – December 2004) are in the pre-disenrollment period.

         The TennCare enrollment statistics do not break-out enrollment of adults
by parental status (e.g., Bureau of TennCare 2005, 2006), so it is unknown what
fraction of the disenrollment affected childless adults as opposed to parents from
administrative data. However, as discussed above, surveys show that
approximately 60 percent of the adult TennCare expansion group in the years
preceding disenrollment was comprised of childless adults and the remaining 40
percent were parents (Moreno and Hoag 2001). In addition, discussions in the
contemporaneous policy literature (Kaiser Family Foundation 2005, Families
USA 2007) strongly suggest that the disenrollment affected parents as well as
childless adults. Thus, it is reasonable to suspect that approximately 60 percent of
the disenrolled population was childless adults and the remainder was parents.
For this reason, I also estimate equation (1) stratifying adults by parental status
(where parents are defined as adults living with a dependent child under the age of
18) because it is possible that childless adults were affected to a relatively greater
degree. I also test for differences between parents and childless adults by

5 When estimating equation (3), I do not restrict the sample to survey responses in the interview
month only. I do not make this restriction in this case because the SIPP sample is not necessarily
balanced across groups stratified by interview month within wave. Imposing the restriction, while
accounting for seam bias, yields noisy monthly estimates. This issue also requires me to shorten
the post-disenrollment period to June 2006 when estimating equation (3).



                                                13
estimating a version of equation (1) with an additional interaction term for the
individual being a childless adult:

(4)      𝑌𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽2 (𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 × 𝑇𝑁)𝑖𝑡
                     +𝛽3 (𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑠 × 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 × 𝑇𝑁)𝑖𝑡 + 𝜑𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡
where:
         Childlessi is a time-invariant indicator for the individual not living with a
dependent child under the age of 18 in wave 4.

         Given that the TennCare disenrollment affected both parents and childless
adults and because other contemporaneous TennCare reforms, such as benefit
caps, affected all groups, I cannot reasonably assume that only childless adults
were affected by the reforms. Thus, I am not using parents as a control group for
childless adults in this analysis, but rather am comparing effect sizes across these
two potentially affected groups of adults.

         I use residents of other Southern states as controls for residents of
Tennessee. The validity of these models requires assuming that the error terms
are uncorrelated with the interaction term between the post-disenrollment period
indicator and the indicator for Tennessee. While this “common trends”
assumption is not testable, following common practice I assess whether there are
common trends in the outcomes between Tennessee and other southern states in
the pre-disenrollment period. I find no evidence of differential trends in the pre-
period and report the results of these tests for the outcomes covered by Medicaid,
uninsured, and employed, in Appendix Table 3.




V.       Results




                                           14
       In this section, I report the results of the individual fixed effects models of
the effect of the TennCare disenrollment on health insurance coverage,
employment, health, and healthcare utilization outcomes.


A.     Health Insurance Coverage Outcomes


       I consider four health insurance outcomes: Medicaid, Uninsured, Private
Insurance, and Medicare. I report estimates of both equations (1) and (2) in Table
3 and report the results of equation (3) graphically in Figures 1 through 4.
       The results show that changes in TennCare eligibility rules led to a large
decline in Medicaid enrollment among adults in Tennessee relative to adults in
other Southern states and that this disenrollment resulted in an almost as large loss
of insurance coverage. A small fraction of dual eligible individuals transitioned
into being solely covered by Medicare and there was no net migration into private
coverage, implying that there was no crowd-out of private insurance from the
TennCare expansion
       For each outcome reported in Table 3, the first column considers the post-
period to be July 2005 – August 2006 while the second column allows for a
different effect in the implementation period (July 2005 – September 2005).
Following the TennCare disenrollment, the share of adults covered by Medicaid
fell by 5.4 to 5.9 percentage points, and the share uninsured increased by 4.7 to
5.1 percentage points. The difference between the size of these two effects is
mostly explained by a small, 0.6 to 0.8 percentage point, increase in Medicare
coverage. There was no economically of statistically meaningful change in the
share of adults covered by private insurance following disenrollment.
       The implied number of adults affected by the TennCare disenrollment,
based on these estimates, is very close to that reported around the time of the
disenrollment in the policy literature (Farrar et al. 2007). Using the survey


                                         15
weights, the coefficient on Medicaid from Column (1) of Table 3 implies that
approximately 200,000 adults were disenrolled from TennCare. The coefficient
on Medicare from Column (7) suggests that approximately 30,000 adults moved
from Medicaid to Medicare (presumably because they were dual eligibles). These
implied numbers are very close to the numbers reported in the literature. For
example (Farrar et al. 2007) reports that 170,000 thousand adults in the
“uninsured” and “uninsurable” expansion category and 38,000 dual-eligible adults
were disenrolled from TennCare in 2005.6
        Figure 1 displays the estimated shares of adults, aged 18 to 64, in
Tennessee and in other Southern states enrolled in Medicaid in each month from
January 2004 through June 2006 based on estimates of equation (3). The two
vertical lines in the figure indicate the months July and September 2005, the
beginning and end of the implementation period in the main models. As evident
in the figure, there was a large, roughly 6-percentage point decline in Medicaid
enrollment among adults in Tennessee beginning in July 2005 and no visible
decline in other Southern states.
        Figure 2 displays the estimated shares of adults without any source of
health insurance coverage in Tennessee and in other Southern states. The share of
adults who were uninsured in Tennessee increased roughly 5 percentage points
beginning in July 2005. As with Medicaid, there was no decline in the share that
was uninsured in other Southern states.




6 Summing the survey weights for adults between the ages of 18 and 64 in Tennessee in wave 1,
reference month 4, of the 2004 SIPP yields a population estimate of 3,662,348. According to the
2003 Tennessee Statistical Abstract, the population of Tennessee in that year was 5,989,309 and
63% of the Tennessee Population was between 18 and 64, yielding a population estimate of
3,773,265. Multiplying 3,662,348 by the coefficient on Medicaid from Table 3, Column 1 of
0.0537 yields 199,668. Multiplying 3,662,348 by the coefficient on Medicare from Table 3,
Column 7 of 0.0083 yields 30,397.



                                               16
       Figures 3 and 4 show the estimated shares of adults in Tennessee and in
other Southern states with any form of private health insurance and with
Medicare, respectively. Adults in Tennessee did not see an increase in private
insurance following July 2005. By contrast, the share of adults covered by
Medicare increased by a small amount beginning in July 2005.




B.     Employment Outcomes


       I consider four binary employment outcomes: an indicator for whether the
individual had a job for at least one week during the month, whether the
individual worked full-time (worked 35 hours or more per week), whether the
individual worked part-time (worked less than 35 hours), and whether the
individual reports that health or a condition prevents work (a work-preventing
disability). I report estimates of both equations (1) and (2) for these outcomes in
Table 4 and report the results of equation (3) graphically in Figures 5 through 8.
       The results show that changes in TennCare eligibility rules did not lead to
any economically or statistically meaningful increase in employment among
adults in Tennessee relative to adults in other Southern states. However, during
the implementation period, but not thereafter, there was a small shift from full-
time to part-time employment. There also was a small increase in the share of
adults reporting a work-preventing disability following the TennCare
disenrollment.
       As reported in Table 4, following the TennCare disenrollment the share of
adults in Tennessee who were employed increased by at most a statistically
insignificant 0.2 percentage points. The results also suggest that the share
working full-time decreased 0.6 to 0.8 percentage points while the share working
part-time increased by a similar amount. However, the estimates also indicate


                                         17
that the shift from full-time to part-time occurred during the “implementation”
period. There is a small, but statistically meaningful, increase in the share of
adults in Tennessee reporting a work-preventing disability of 0.2 to 0.25
percentage points.
        The zero or very small (and statistically insignificant) employment effects
are substantially smaller than those found by Dague et al. (2017) and by
Garthwaite et al. (2014). The effects on disability are broadly consistent with the
evidence on SSI and DI found by Garthwaite et al. (2014), Maestas et al. (2014),
and Burns and Dague (2017).
       Figure 5 displays the estimated shares of adults that were employed in
each month from January 2004 through June 2006 in Tennessee and in other
Southern states. The employment rate in Tennessee is consistently about 3
percentage points lower that the employment rate in other Southern states. Other
than the level difference, both employment rates track each other closely and
there is no noticeable change in the employment rate of adults in Tennessee
following July 2005.
       Figures 6 and 7 display the estimated shares of adults in Tennessee and in
other Southern states that were employed full-time and that were employed part-
time, respectively. As with employment, there is little evidence that these shares
changed following July 2005.
       Figure 8 displays the estimated shares of adults in Tennessee and in other
Southern states that report having a work-preventing disability. The fraction of
adults in Tennessee reporting a work-preventing disability is higher than in other
Southern states both before and following the TennCare disenrollment. However,
there is a small increase in this share in Tennessee following July 2005. This
results is consistent with those reported in the previous literature.


C.     Health and Health Care Access


                                          18
       As discussed above, measures of self-reported health and health care
utilization come from topical module surveys, which are administered in wave 3
(July 2004 through December 2004) and wave 6 (July 2005 through December
2005). The outcomes I examine include: a binary indicator of whether the
individual self-reports their health to be “excellent or very good,” an indicator of
having had a hospitalization in the past 12 months, hospital days over the past 12
months, number of doctor visits, number of dentist visits, an indicator for having
used any prescription medication, an indicator for any visits to a free clinic or
public health department, and an indicator for any emergency room visits.
       Table 5 reports the estimates of the impact of the TennCare disenrollment
on health and health care utilization. The results suggest that the self-reported
health of adults worsened and that they experienced a changing pattern of
healthcare utilization following the TennCare disenrollment. These changes may
not be solely due to disenrollment, however, as there were other TennCare benefit
changes implemented at the same time as the disenrollment. These included caps
on the number of physician visits, the number of outpatient visits, and the number
of prescriptions (Kaiser Family Foundation 2005, Emerson et al. 2012).
       The results show that the fraction of adults in Tennessee reporting that
their health was excellent or very good fell 1.8 percentage points following the
TennCare disenrollment, suggesting that the actual or perceived health of adults
worsened following Medicaid disenrollment. The fraction with any
hospitalization decreased fell 1.2 percentage points though total reported hospital
days did not change. The number of visits to the doctor decreased by 0.74 visits
(or by 14 percent) and the number of visits to the dentist decreased by 0.19 visits
(also by 14 percent). The fraction reporting any use of prescription medication
did not change. These results, taken together, are consistent with much of the
previous literature indicating that Medicaid coverage increases access to medical


                                         19
care including preventive care such as dentist visits. However, as there is little
evidence of a change in hospital days, it also suggests that individuals with major
acute illnesses may have been less affected.
       There is also evidence that the decline in access to medical care among
adults in Tennessee were partially offset by an increase in the share of adults that
received care in a free clinic or public health facility (a 1.4 percentage point
increase). However, similar to the findings of Heavrin et al. (2011), there is no
evidence that the share that received care in an emergency room changed
following the TennCare disenrollment.




D.     Childless Adults versus Parents


       As discussed above, about 60 percent of the TennCare expansion group
was comprised of childless adults and the remainder was parents (Morano and
Hoag 2001). In this section, I report results that stratified between parents and
childless adults. Two previous studies of the 2005 TennCare disenrollment used
parents as a control group for childless adults in a “triple difference design”
(Garthwaite et al. 2014; Tello-Trillo 2016). I do not do this both because of the
strong suggestion from the contemporaneous policy literature that parents as well
as childless adults were disenrolled from TennCare, and because the other
program reforms such as benefit caps would have effected those adults remaining
in TennCare.
       Table 6 reports estimates of the impact of the TennCare disenrollment on
sources of health insurance coverage, based on equation (1), separately for
childless adults and parents. It also reports difference in these impacts using
estimates from the fully-interacted model, equation (4).



                                          20
       Both the share of childless adults and the share of parents in Tennessee
with Medicaid coverage fell in the post-disenrollment period, though the share of
childless adults fell by a larger amount (a 6.0 percentage point decline among
childless adults versus a 4.7 percentage point decline among parents). These
estimates imply that 65 percent of the individuals disenrolled from TennCare
were childless adults and 35 percent were parents – percentages that are
reasonably close to the pre-disenrollment distributions reported in Moreno and
Hoag (2001).
       Similarly, the both the share of childless adults and the share of parents in
Tennessee who were uninsured increased in the post-disenrollment period, though
again the increase was slightly larger among childless adults. There was a 4.8
percentage point increase in the uninsured rate among childless adults versus a 4.6
percentage point increase among parents. The shares on Medicare increased by
small amounts for both childless adults (a 0.7 percentage point increase) and
parents (a 0.3 percentage point increase), while the shares privately insured did
not change for either childless adults or parents.
       The declines in fractions of parents and childless adults on Medicaid and
the increases in the fractions uninsured can be seen in Figures 9 and 10, which
show the estimated trends in Tennessee and in other Southern states. The shares
among both parents and childless adults were fairly stable over the entire time
period in other Southern states, while both childless adults and parents in
Tennessee had roughly similar percentage point decreases in the shares covered
by Medicaid and similar percentage point increases in the shares uninsured.
       Table 7 reports estimates, based on equation (1), of the impact of the
TennCare disenrollment on employment outcomes separately for childless adults
and parents. Neither childless adults nor parents had increases in their
employment rates in Tennessee in the post-disenrollment period. However,
among parents there was a small shift from full-time work to part-time work as


                                         21
the share working full-time decreased 0.7 percentage points and the share working
part-time increased 0.8 percentage points. The difference between childless
adults and parents in the changes in these shares is not statistically significant,
however. By contrast, the increase in work-preventing disability in Tennessee in
the post-disenrollment period occurred only among childless adults, who saw a
0.5 percentage point increase in this share.
       Table 8 reports estimates of the impact of the TennCare disenrollment on
health and health care utilization outcomes separately for childless adults and
parents. Looking across all health and health care utilization outcomes, there is
no consistent pattern of results by parental status. For some outcomes we observe
changes for childless adults but not parents, for other outcomes we observe
changes for parents but not for childless adults. Other outcomes have similar
changes for both parents and childless adults.
       The results show that fewer childless adults in Tennessee reported that
their health was excellent or very good (a decline of 4.1 percentage points
following the TennCare disenrollment), and there was no change among parents.
The fraction with any hospitalizations decreased among parents (and fell 2.8
percentage points) but not among childless adults. Total reported hospital days
and the fraction using prescription drugs did not change for either childless adults
or for parents. Doctor visits and dentist visits declined for both childless adults
and parents by roughly a similar amount. The use of free clinics or public health
facilities increased for both groups, but increased by more among childless adults
(1.8 percentage points) than among parents (0.8 percentage points). Use of the
ER increased among childless adults but decreased among parents.



E.     Sensitivity Checks




                                          22
        In this section I discuss the results of a number of sensitivity checks on the
main analysis. First, I vary the set of control states used in the analysis. As
discussed above, the main analysis uses all states in the U.S. Census Southern
region (Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina,
Virginia, District of Columbia, West Virginia, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi,
Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas) as controls for Tennessee. As a
sensitivity check, I first remove Texas and Florida (the two largest Southern states
in terms of population) and second remove Washington D.C., Delaware, and
Maryland. I report the results based on these alternative samples for my main
outcomes of interest (Medicaid, Uninsured, and Employment) in the first two
columns for each outcome in Table 9. The results show that there is very little
change in the estimated effect of the TennCare disenrollment on sources of health
insurance coverage or employment when I alter the set of states used as controls.
        In a second sensitivity check, I restrict the sample to individuals who did
not move across states in the first four waves of the survey. Since I measure state
residency in the fourth wave, this ensures that residents of Tennessee receive the
full treatment effect of being potentially eligible for TennCare in the pre-
disenrollment period. As reported in the third column for each outcome in Table
9, this restriction does not affect the estimates.
        Finally, sample attrition and moving across states is commonplace in the
SIPP. The survey is designed to follow individuals and household if they move
and reweights observations to deal with non-random attrition (U.S. Census
Bureau 2008). However, in this analysis, differential attrition or moving between
residents of Tennessee and of other Southern states could be an issue, especially if
these differences were the result of the changes to the TennCare program.

        To explore this possibility, I examine differential attrition and differential
rates of moving across state lines between Tennessee and other Southern states



                                           23
(see Appendix Table 4). Tennessee had higher rates of attrition than other
Southern states between wave 1 and wave 2. However, thereafter, Tennessee had
slightly lower rates of attrition so that by wave 3 there was no statistically
differences in cumulative attrition rates between Tennessee and other Southern
states and by wave 8 there was no difference at all in cumulative attrition rates.
There is no evidence that in the SIPP residents of Tennessee move at greater rates
than residents of other Southern states.




VII.    Discussion and Conclusion

        In this paper, I examine the effects of an eligibility contraction that
occurred when Tennessee discontinued its expansion of TennCare in 2005. I find
that following the change in rules that reduced Medicaid eligibility in Tennessee
over the period July to September 2005, the fraction of adults in Tennessee
covered by Medicaid fell by 5 percentage points while uninsured rates increased
by almost 5 percentage points. There is no evidence of an increase in employment
rates following disenrollment though there is evidence that disenrollment led to a
small increase in reported work-preventing disabilities and a shift from full-time
to part-time work. Self-reported health and access to medical care worsened as
hospitalization rates, doctor visits, and dentist visits all declined. At the same
time, there were increases in the use of free clinics public health facilities.
        In terms of the effects of the TennCare disenrollment on health insurance
coverage, my results are consistent with those found in the previous literature on
the effects of Medicaid expansions generally (e.g., Sommers et al. 2017) but
differs from Garthwaite et al. 2014 in that I find no offsetting increases in private
health insurance coverage. Similarly, the results showing reduced access to
health care and worse self-reported health are both consistent with the previous



                                           24
literature generally and with that found in Farrar et al. (2007), Families USA
(2007), Tello-Trillo (2016), and Ghosh and Simon (2015). While the previous
literature of the effect of Medicaid on labor supply has been mixed, my results are
in stark contrast with those found by Garthwaite et al. (2014) in that I find no
evidence that the TennCare disenrollment led to an increase in employment.
       Recent policy discussions in Congress have involved changes to the
Federal financing of Medicaid that likely would have resulted in substantial
numbers of individuals, in particular childless adults, losing Medicaid coverage
(CBO 2017). This findings of this study suggest that such a disenrollment would
likely lead to a substantial increase in the uninsured rate, worsening health and
access to health care, and no increased in employment.
       The divergent results for employment across studies using different
Census surveys suggests that the reliability of the estimates of the effect of
TennCare on employment in either study could be questioned. However, as noted
above, Ham and Ueda (2017) also find that the estimates of the employment
effects following TennCare disenrollment are highly sensitive to the choice of
data set. It may not only be differences in data that matter. This study uses panel
data methods that can control for compositional changes in sample, while the
repeated cross-sectional methods employed in previously studies cannot. At a
minimum, the results presented in this paper indicate that there is a substantial
amount of uncertainty over what the impact of the TennCare disenrollment was
on employment outcomes. However, in my view, since the results in this study
more closely align with the modest labor supply effects found in Dague et al.
(2017) and in Baicker et al. (2014), it seems likely that the TennCare
disenrollment led to either no change in employment of childless adults or, at
most, modestly sized increases in employment.
