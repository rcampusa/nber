Roughing it Up: Including Jump Components in the Measurement, Modeling and Forecasting of
Return Volatility

                                           ABSTRACT

A rapidly growing literature has documented important improvements in financial return volatility
measurement and forecasting via use of realized variation measures constructed from high-frequency

returns coupled with simple modeling procedures. Building on recent theoretical results in

Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2004a, 2005) for related bi-power variation measures, the present

paper provides a practical and robust framework for non-parametrically measuring the jump

component in asset return volatility. In an application to the DM/$ exchange rate, the S&P500

market index, and the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yield, we find that jumps are both highly prevalent

and distinctly less persistent than the continuous sample path variation process. Moreover, many

jumps appear directly associated with specific macroeconomic news announcements. Separating

jump from non-jump movements in a simple but sophisticated volatility forecasting model, we find

that almost all of the predictability in daily, weekly, and monthly return volatilities comes from the

non-jump component. Our results thus set the stage for a number of interesting future econometric

developments and important financial applications by separately modeling, forecasting, and pricing

the continuous and jump components of the total return variation process.

I. Introduction
          Volatility is central to asset pricing, asset allocation, and risk management. In contrast to the
estimation of expected returns, which generally requires long time spans of data, the results of Merton (1980)
and Nelson (1992) suggest that volatility may be estimated arbitrarily well through the use of sufficiently finely
sampled high-frequency returns over any fixed time interval. However, the assumption of a continuous sample
path diffusion underlying the theoretical results is invariably violated in practice. Thus, despite the increased
availability of high-frequency data for a host of different financial instruments, practical complications have
hampered the implementation of direct high-frequency volatility modeling and filtering procedures.1
          In response, Andersen and Bollerslev (1998), Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold and Labys (2001)
(henceforth ABDL), Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2002a,b), and Meddahi (2002), among others, have
recently advocated the use of non-parametric realized volatility, or variation, measures to conveniently
circumvent the data complications while retaining most of the relevant information in the intraday data for
measuring, modeling and forecasting volatilities over daily and longer horizons. Indeed, the empirical results
in ABDL (2003) strongly suggest that simple models of realized volatility outperform the popular GARCH and
related stochastic volatility models in out-of-sample forecasting.2
          At the same time, recent parametric studies have suggested the importance of explicitly allowing for
jumps, or discontinuities, in the estimation of specific stochastic volatility models and in the pricing of options
and other derivatives.3 In particular, it appears that many (log) price processes are best described by a
combination of a smooth and very slowly mean-reverting continuous sample path process and a much less
persistent jump component.4 Thus far, however, the non-parametric realized volatility literature has paid
comparatively little attention to jumps, and related, to distinguishing jump from non-jump movements.
          Set against this backdrop, in the present paper we seek to further advance the nonparametric realized
volatility approach through the development of a practical non-parametric procedure for separately measuring
the continuous sample path variation and the discontinuous jump part of the quadratic variation process. Our
approach builds directly on the new theoretical results in Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2004a, 2005)

          4
            Earlier influential work on homoskedastic jump-diffusions includes Merton (1976), Ball and Torous (1983), Beckers
(1981), and Jarrow and Rosenfeld (1984). More recently, Jorion (1988) and Vlaar and Palm (1993) incorporated jumps in the
estimation of discrete-time ARCH and GARCH models. See also the discussion in Das (2002).
involving so-called bi-power variation measures constructed from the summation of appropriately scaled cross-
products of adjacent high-frequency absolute returns.5 Implementing these ideas empirically with more than a
decade of five-minute high-frequency returns for the DM/$ foreign exchange market, the S&P500 market
index, and the 30-year U.S. Treasury yield, we shed new light on the dynamics and comparative magnitudes of
jumps across the different markets. We also demonstrate important gains in terms of volatility forecast
accuracy by explicitly differentiating the jump and continuous sample path components. These gains obtain at
daily, weekly, and even monthly forecast horizons. Our new HAR-RV-CJ forecasting model incorporating the
jumps builds directly on the heterogenous AR model for the realized volatility, or HAR-RV model, due to
Müller et al. (1997) and Corsi (2003), in which the realized volatility is parameterized as a linear function of
the lagged realized volatilities over different horizons.
          The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section we briefly review the relevant bi-power variation
theory. In Section III we describe our high-frequency data, extract a preliminary measure of jumps, and
describe their features. In Section IV we describe the HAR-RV volatility forecasting model, modify it to allow
and control for jumps (producing our HAR-RV-J model), and assess its empirical performance. In Section V
we significantly refine the jump estimator by shrinking it toward zero in a fashion motivated by recently-
developed powerful asymptotic theory, and by robustifying it to market microstructure noise (as motivated by
the extensive simulation evidence in Huang and Tauchen, 2005). We then illustrate that many of the jumps so
identified are associated with macroeconomic news. In Section VI we build a more refined model that makes
full use our refined jump estimates by incorporating jump and non-jump components separately. The new
model (HAR-RV-CJ) includes the earlier HAR-RV-J as a special and potentially restrictive case and produces
additional forecast enhancements. We conclude in Section VII with several suggestions for future research.


II. Theoretical Framework
          Let p(t) denote a logarithmic asset price at time t. The continuous-time jump diffusion process
traditionally used in asset pricing is conveniently expressed in stochastic differential equation (sde) form as


          dp(t) = µ(t) dt + F(t) dW(t) + 6(t) dq(t) ,                   0#t#T,                                                         (1)


where µ(t) is a continuous and locally bounded variation process, F(t) is a strictly positive stochastic volatility
process with a sample path that is right continuous and has well defined left limits (allowing for occasional


          5
             This approach is distinctly different from the recent work of Aït-Sahalia (2002), who relies on direct estimates of the
transition density function.

                                                                    -2-
jumps in volatility), W(t) is a standard Brownian motion, and q(t) is a counting process with (possibly) time-
varying intensity 8(t). That is, P[dq(t)=1] = 8(t)dt, where 6(t)/p(t)-p(t-) refers to the size of the corresponding
discrete jumps in the logarithmic price process. The quadratic variation for the cumulative return process, r(t)
/ p(t) - p(0), is then

                             t
                                 σ2(s) ds % j κ2(s) ,
                             m
              [ r , r ]t '                                                                                                      (2)
                                             0<s#t
                             0




where by definition the summation consists of the q(t) squared jumps that occurred between time 0 and time t.
Of course, in the absence of jumps, or q(t)/0, the summation vanishes and the quadratic variation simply
equals the integrated volatility of the continuous sample path component.
          Several recent studies concerned with the direct estimation of continuous time stochastic volatility
models have highlighted the importance of explicitly incorporating jumps in the price process along the lines of
equation (1).6 Moreover, the specific parametric model estimates reported in this literature have generally
suggested that any dynamic dependence in the size or occurrence of the jumps is much less persistent than the
dependence in the continuous sample path volatility process. Here we take a complementary non-parametric
approach, squarely in the tradition of the realized volatility literature but specifically distinguishing jump from
non-jump movements, relying on both the recent emergence of high-frequency data and powerful asymptotic
theory.


A. High-Frequency Data, Bi-Power Variation, and Jumps
          Let the discretely sampled )-period returns be denoted by, rt,) / p(t) - p(t-)). For ease of notation we
normalize the daily time interval to unity and label the corresponding discretely sampled daily returns by a
single time subscript, rt+1 / rt+1,1. Also, we define the daily realized volatility, or variation, by the summation
of the corresponding 1/) high-frequency intradaily squared returns,7
                                   1/∆
          RVt%1( ∆ ) / j rt% j@∆, ∆ ,

                                   j'1



where for notational simplicity and without loss of generality 1/) is assumed to be an integer. Then, as
emphasized in Andersen and Bollerslev (1998), ABDL (2001), Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2002a,b), and

          6
            See, among others, Andersen, Benzoni and Lund (2002), Eraker, Johannes and Polson (2003), Eraker (2004), Johannes
(2004), and Johannes, Kumar and Polson (1999).

          7
              We will use the terms realized volatility and realized variation interchangeably.

                                                                     -3-
Comte and Renault (1998), among others, it follows directly by the theory of quadratic variation that the
realized variation converges uniformly in probability to the increment of the quadratic variation process as the
sampling frequency of the underlying returns increases. That is,
                                t%1

                                 m

                                                           2
          RVt%1( ∆ ) 6                                                                                                                  (4)
                                                       t<s#t%1
                                  t



for )60. Thus, in the absence of jumps the realized variation is consistent for the integrated volatility that
figures prominently in the stochastic volatility option pricing literature. This result, in part, motivates the
modeling and forecasting procedures for realized volatilities advocated in ABDL (2003). It is clear, however,
that in general the realized volatility will inherit the dynamics of both the continuous sample path process and
the jump process. Although this does not impinge upon the theoretical justification for directly modeling and
forecasting RVt+1()) through simple procedures that do not distinguish jump and non-jump contributions to
volatility, it does suggest that superior forecasting models may be constructed by separately measuring and
modeling the two components in equation (4).
          Building on this intuition, the present paper seeks to improve on the predictive models developed in
ABDL (2003) through the use of new and powerful asymptotic results (for )60) of Barndorff-Nielsen and
Shephard (2004a, 2005) that allow for separate (non-parametric) identification of the two components of the
quadratic variation process. Specifically, define the standardized realized bi-power variation as
                                           1/∆
          BVt%1( ∆ ) / µ 1 j * rt% j@∆, ∆ * * rt% (j&1)@∆, ∆ * ,

                                           j'2



where µ 1 / %(2/π) = E(|Z|) denotes the mean of the absolute value of standard normally distributed random
variable, Z. It is then possible to show that for )60,8

             Corresponding general asymptotic results for so-called realized power variation measures have recently been
established by Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2003, 2004a); see also Barndorff-Nielsen, Graversen and Shephard (2004) for a
survey of related results. In particular, it follows that in general for 0<p<2 and )60,
                                                 1/∆             t%1

                                                                       σ p(s)ds,
                                                 j'1
                                                                  t


where µ p / 2p/2Γ(½(p+1))/Γ(½) = E(|Z|p). Hence, the impact of the discontinuous jump process disappears in the limit for the
power variation measures with 0<p<2. In contrast, RPVt+1(),p) diverges to infinity for p>2, while RPVt+1(),2) / RVt+1())
converges to the integrated volatility plus the sum of the squared jumps, as in equation (4). Related expressions for the conditional
moments of different powers of absolute returns have also been utilized by Aït-Sahalia (2004) in the formulation of a GMM-type
estimator for specific parametric homoskedastic jump-diffusion models.

                                                                               -4-
Hence, as first noted by Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2004a), combining the results in equations (4) and
(6), the contribution to the quadratic variation process due to the discontinuities (jumps) in the underlying price
process may be consistently estimated (for )60) by


                                      j κ (s).
                                         2
        RVt%1( ∆ ) & BVt%1( ∆ ) 6                                                                            (7)
                                    t<s#t%1


This is the central insight on which the theoretical and empirical results of this paper build.
        Of course, nothing prevents the estimates of the squared jumps defined by the right hand-side of (7)
from becoming negative in a given finite ()>0) sample. Thus, following the suggestion of Barndorff-Nielsen
and Shephard (2004a), we truncate the actual empirical measurements at zero,


        Jt%1( ∆ ) / max [ RVt%1( ∆ ) & BVt%1( ∆ ) , 0 ] ,                                                    (8)



to ensure that all of the daily estimates are non-negative.


III. Data and Summary Statistics
        To highlight the generality of our empirical results related to the improved forecasting performance
obtained by separately measuring the contribution to the overall variation coming from the discontinuous price
movements, we present the results for three different markets. We begin this section with a brief discussion of
the data sources, followed by a summary of the most salient features of the resulting realized volatility and
jump series for each of three markets.


A Data Description
        We present the results for three markets: the foreign exchange spot market (DM/$), the equity futures
market (U.S. S&P 500 index), and the interest rate futures market (30-year U.S. Treasury yield). The DM/$
volatilities range from December 1986 through June 1999, for a total of 3,045 daily observations. The
underlying high-frequency spot quotations were kindly provided by Olsen & Associates in Zurich, Switzerland.
This same series has been previously analyzed in ABDL (2001, 2003). The S&P500 volatility measurements
are based on tick-by-tick transactions prices from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) augmented with
overnight prices from the GLOBEX automated trade execution system, from January 1990 through December
2002. The T-bond volatilities are similarly constructed from tick-by-tick transactions prices for the 30 year
U.S. Treasury Bond futures contract traded on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), again from January 1990


                                                        -5-
through December 2002. After removing holidays and other inactive trading days, we have a total of 3,213
observations for each of the two futures markets.9 A more detailed description of the S&P and T-bond data is
available in Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold and Vega (2005), where the same high-frequency data are analyzed
from a very different perspective. All of the volatility measures are based on linearly interpolated logarithmic
five-minute returns, as in Müller et al. (1990) and Dacorogna et al. (1993).10 For the foreign exchange market
this results in a total of 1/) = 288 high-frequency return observations per day, while the two futures contracts
are actively traded for 1/) = 97 five-minute intervals per day. For notational simplicity, we omit the explicit
reference to ) in the following, referring to the five-minute realized volatility and jump measures defined by
equations (3) and (8) as RVt and Jt , respectively.


B. Realized Volatilities and Jumps
          The first panels in Figures 1A-C show the resulting three daily realized volatility series in standard
deviation form, or RVt1/2 . Each of the three series clearly exhibits a high degree of own serial correlation. This
is confirmed by the Ljung-Box statistics for up to tenth order serial correlation reported in Tables 1A-C equal
to 5,714, 12,184, and 1,718, respectively. Similar results obtain for the realized variances and logarithmic
transformations reported in the first and third columns in the tables. Comparing the volatility across the three
markets, the S&P500 returns are the most volatile, followed by the exchange rate returns. Also, consistent with
earlier evidence for the foreign exchange market in ABDL (2001), and related findings for individual stocks in
Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold and Ebens (2002) and the S&P500 in Deo, Hurvich and Lu (2005) and Martens,
van Dijk and Pooter (2004), the logarithmic standard deviations are generally much closer to being normally
distributed than are the raw realized volatility series. Hence, from a modeling perspective, the logarithmic
realized volatilities are more amenable to the use of standard time series procedures.11
          The second panels in Figures 1A-C display the separate measurements of the jump components (again

            We explicitly exclude all days with sequences of more than twenty consecutive five-minute intervals of no new prices
for the S&P500, and forty consecutive five-minute intervals of no new prices for the T-bond market.

          10
               To mitigate the impact of market microstructure frictions in the construction of unbiased and efficient realized
volatility measurements, a number of recent studies have proposed ways of “optimally” choosing ) (e.g., Aït-Sahalia, Mykland
and Zhang, 2005; Bandi and Russell, 2004a,b), sub-sampling schemes (e.g., Zhang, Aït-Sahalia and Mykland, 2005; Zhang, 2004),
pre-filtering (e.g., Andreou and Ghysels, 2002; Areal and Taylor, 2002; Bollen and Inder, 2002; Corsi, Zumbach, Müller and
Dacorogna, 2001; Oomen 2002, 2004), Fourier methods (Barucci and Reno, 2002; and Malliavin and Mancino, 2002), or other
kernel type estimators (e.g., Barndorff-Nielsen, Hansen, Lunde and Shephard, 2004; Hansen and Lunde 2006; and Zhou, 1996).
For now we simply follow ABDL (2002, 2001), along with most of the existing empirical literature, in the use of unweighted five-
minute returns for each of the three actively traded markets analyzed here. However, we will return to a more detailed discussion
of the market microstructure issue and pertinent jump measurements in Section V below.

          11
             Modeling and forecasting log volatility also has the virtue of automatically imposing non-negativity of fitted and
forecasted volatilities.

                                                                    -6-
in standard deviation form) based on the truncated estimator in equation (8).12 As is evident from the figures,
many of the largest realized volatilities are directly associated with jumps in the underlying price process.
Some of the largest jumps in the DM/$ market occurred during the earlier 1986-88 part of the sample, while the
size of the jumps for the S&P500 has increased significantly over the most recent 2001-02 period. In contrast,
the size of the jumps in the T-Bond market seem to be much more evenly distributed throughout the sample.
Overall, both the size and occurrence of jumps appear to be much more predictable for the S&P500 than for the
other two markets.
          These visual observations are readily confirmed by the standard Ljung-Box portmanteau statistics for
up to tenth order serial correlation in the Jt , Jt1/2, and log(Jt +1) series reported in the last three columns in
Tables 1A-C. It is noteworthy that although the Ljung-Box statistics for the jumps are generally significant at
conventional significance levels (especially for the jumps expressed in standard deviation or logarithmic form),
the actual values are markedly lower than the corresponding test statistics for the realized volatility series
reported in the first three columns. This indicates decidedly less own dynamic dependence in the portion of the
overall quadratic variation originating from the discontinuous sample path price process compared to the
dynamic dependence in the continuous sample path price movements. The numbers in the table also indicate
that the jumps are relatively least important for the DM/$ market, with the mean of the Jt series accounting for
0.072 of the mean of RVt , while the same ratios for the S&P500 and T-bond markets equal 0.144 and 0.126,
respectively.
          Motivated by these observations, we now put the idea of separately measuring the jump component to
work in the construction of new and simple-to-implement realized volatility forecasting models. More
specifically, we follow ABDL (2003) in directly estimating a set of time series models for each of the different
realized volatility measures in Tables 1A-C; i.e., RVt , RVt1/2, and log(RVt ). Then, in order to assess the added
value of separately measuring the jump component in forecasting the realized volatilities, we simply include
the raw Jt , Jt1/2, and log(Jt + 1) jump series as additional explanatory variables in the various forecasting
regressions.


IV. Accounting for Jumps in Realized Volatility Modeling and Forecasting
          A number of empirical studies have argued for the importance of long-memory dependence in financial
market volatility. Several different parametric ARCH and stochastic volatility formulations have also been



          12
             The difference between the daily realized variation and bi-power variation measures result in negative estimates for
the squared daily jumps on 30.6, 27.9 and 18.3 percent of the days for each of the three markets, respectively. As discussed below,
in the absence of jumps, the difference should be negative asymptotically ()60) for half of the days in the sample.

                                                                   -7-
proposed in the literature for capturing this phenomenon (e.g., Andersen and Bollerslev, 1997; Baillie,
Bollerslev, and Mikkelsen, 1996; Breidt, Crato and de Lima, 1998; Dacorogna et al., 2001; Ding, Granger and
Engle, 1993; Robinson, 1991). These same empirical observations have similarly motivated the estimation of
long-memory type ARFIMA models for realized volatilities in ABDL (2003), Areal and Taylor (2002), Deo,
Hurvich and Lu (2005), Koopman, Jungbacker and Hol (2005), Martens, van Dijk, and Pooter (2004), Oomen
(2002), Pong, Shackleton, Taylor and Xu (2004), and Thomakos and Wang (2003), among others.
          Here we eschew such complicated fractionally integrated long-memory formulations and rely instead
on the simple-to-estimate HAR-RV class of volatility models proposed by Corsi (2003). The HAR-RV
formulation is based on a straightforward extension of the so-called Heterogeneous ARCH, or HARCH, class
of models analyzed by Müller et al. (1997), in which the conditional variance of the discretely sampled returns
is parameterized as a linear function of the lagged squared returns over the identical return horizon together
with the squared returns over longer and/or shorter return horizons.13 Although the HAR structure does not
formally possess long-memory, the mixing of relatively few volatility components is capable of reproducing a
remarkably slow volatility autocorrelation decay that is almost indistinguishable from that of a hyperbolic
(long-memory) pattern over most empirically relevant forecast horizons.14


A. The HAR-RV-J Model
          To define the HAR-RV model, let the multi-period normalized realized variation, defined by the sum
of the corresponding one-period measures, be denoted by,


          RVt,t+h = h-1[ RVt+1 + RVt+2 + ... + RVt+h ] ,                                                                             (9)


where h = 1, 2, ... . Note that, by definition RVt,t+1 / RVt+1. Also, provided that the expectations exist,
E(RVt,t+h)/ E(RVt+1 ) for all h. For ease of reference, we will refer to these normalized measures for h=5 and
h=22 as the weekly and monthly volatilities, respectively. The daily HAR-RV model of Corsi (2003) may then




          13
              Müller et al. (1997) heuristically motivate the HARCH model through the existence of distinct groups of traders with
different investment horizons.

          14
              Mixtures of low-order ARMA models have similarly been used in approximating and forecasting long-memory
dependence in the conditional mean by Basak, Chan and Palma (2001), Cox (1991), Hsu and Breidt (2003), Man (2003),
O’Connell (1971) and Tiao and Tsay (1994), among others. The component GARCH model in Engle and Lee (1999) and the
multi-factor continuous time stochastic volatility model in Gallant, Hsu and Tauchen (1999) are both motivated by similar
considerations; see also the discussion of the related multifractal regime switching models in Calvet and Fisher (2001, 2002).

                                                                   -8-
be expressed as,15


          RVt+1 = $0 + $D RVt + $W RVt-5,t + $M RVt-22,t + ,t+1 ,                                                                            (10)


where t = 1, 2, ..., T. Of course, realized volatilities over other horizons could easily be included as additional
explanatory variables on the right-hand-side of the regression equation, but the daily, weekly and monthly
measures employed here afford a natural economic interpretation.16
          This HAR-RV model for one-day volatilities extends straightforwardly to longer horizons, RVt,t+h.
Moreover, given the separate non-parametric measurements of the jump component discussed above, the
corresponding time series is readily included as an additional explanatory variable, resulting in the new HAR-
RV-J model,


          RVt,t+h = $0 + $D RVt + $W RVt-5,t + $M RVt-22,t + $J Jt + ,t,t+h .                                                                (11)


With observations every period and longer forecast horizons, or h>1, the error term will generally be serially
correlated up to (at least) order h-1. This will not affect the consistency of the regression coefficient estimates,
but the corresponding standard errors of the estimates obviously need to be adjusted. In the results discussed
below, we rely on the Bartlett/Newey-West heteroskedasticity consistent covariance matrix estimator with 5,
10, and 44 lags for the daily (h=1), weekly (h=5), and monthly (h=22) regression estimates, respectively.
          Turning to the results reported in the first three columns in Tables 2A-C, the estimates for $D, $W, and
$M confirm the existence of highly persistent volatility dependence. Interestingly, the relative importance of
the daily volatility component decreases from the daily to the weekly to the monthly regressions, whereas the
monthly volatility component tends to be relatively more important for the longer-run monthly regressions.
Importantly, the estimates of the jump component, $J , are systematically negative across all models and
markets, and with few exceptions, overwhelmingly significant.17 Thus, whereas the realized volatilities are


          15
              The time series of realized volatilities in this and all of the subsequent HAR-RV regressions are implicitly assumed to
be stationary. Formal tests for a unit root in RVt,+1 easily reject the null hypothesis of non-stationarity for each of the three markets.
Also, the standard log-periodogram estimates of the degree of fractional integration in RVt,+1 equal 0.347, 0.383, and 0.437,
respectively, with a theoretical asymptotic standard error of 0.087.

          16
             Related mixed data sampling, or MIDAS in the terminology of Ghysels, Santa-Clara and Valkanov (2004),
regressions have recently been estimated by Ghysels, Santa-Clara and Valkanov (2005).

          17
             Note, that nothing prevents the forecasts of the realized volatilities from the HAR-RV-J model with βJ<0 from
becoming negative. We did not find this to be a problem for any of our in-sample model estimates, however. A more complicated
multiplicative error structure, along the lines of Engle (2002) and Engle and Gallo (2005), could be employed to ensure positivity

                                                                      -9-
generally highly persistent, the impact of the lagged realized volatility is significantly reduced by the jump
component. For instance, for the daily DM/$ realized volatility a unit increase in the daily realized volatility
implies an average increase in the volatility on the following day of 0.430 + 0.196/5 + 0.244/22 = 0.480 for
days where Jt =0, whereas for days in which part of the realized volatility comes from the jump component the
increase in the volatility on the following day is reduced by -0.486 times the jump component. In other words,
if the realized volatility is entirely attributable to jumps, it carries no predictive power for the following day’s
realized volatility. Similarly for the other two markets: the combined impact of a jump for forecasting the next
day’s realized volatility equals 0.341 + 0.485/5 + 0.165/22 - 0.472 = -0.027 and 0.074 + 0.317/5 + 0.358/22 -
0.152 = -0.002, respectively.
          Comparing the R2 ’s of the HAR-RV-J models to the R2 ’s of the “standard” HAR model reported in the
last row in which the jump component is absent and the realized volatilities on the right-hand-side but not the
left-hand-side of equation (11) are replaced by the corresponding lagged squared daily, weekly, and monthly
returns clearly highlights the added value of the high-frequency data. Although the coefficient estimates of the
$D, $W, and $M coefficients in the “standard” HAR models (available upon request) generally align fairly
closely with those of the HAR-RV-J models reported in the tables, the explained variation is systematically
lower.18 Importantly, the gains afforded by the use of the high-frequency based realized volatilities are not
restricted to the daily and weekly horizons. In fact, the longer-run monthly forecasts result in the largest
relative increases in the R2 ’s, with those for the S&P500 and T-Bonds tripling for the HAR-RV-J models
relative to those from the HAR models based on the coarser daily, weekly, and monthly squared returns. These
large gains in forecast accuracy through the use of realized volatilities are, of course, entirely consistent with
the earlier empirical evidence in ABDL (2003), Bollerslev and Wright (2001) and Martens (2002), among
others, and further corroborated by the analytical results of Andersen, Bollerslev and Meddahi (2004).


B. Non-Linear HAR-RV-J Models
          Practical use of volatility models and forecasts often involves standard deviations as opposed to
variances. The second set of columns in Tables 2A-C thus reports the parameter estimates and R2 ’s of the
corresponding HAR-RV-J model cast in standard deviation form,



of the conditional expectations.

            18
               Note that although the relative magnitudes of the R2’s for a given volatility series are directly comparable across the
two models, as discussed in Andersen, Bollerslev and Meddahi (2005), the measurement errors in the left-hand-side realized
volatility invariably result in a systematic downward bias in the reported R2’s vis-a-vis the inherent predictability in the true latent
quadratic variation process.

                                                                     - 10 -
          (RVt,t+h)1/2 = $0 + $D RVt1/2 + $W (RVt-5,t)1/2 + $M (RVt-22,t)1/2 + $J Jt1/2 + ,t,t+h .                                     (12)


The qualitative features and ordering of the different parameter estimates are generally the same as for the
variance formulation in equation (11). In particular, the estimates for $J are systematically negative. Similarly,
the R2 ’s indicate quite dramatic gains for the high-frequency based HAR-RV-J model relative to the standard
HAR model. The more robust volatility measurements provided by the standard deviations also result in higher
R2 ’s than for the variance-based models reported in the first three columns.19
          As noted in Table 1 above, the logarithmic daily realized volatilities are approximately unconditionally
normally distributed for each of the three markets. This empirical regularity motivated ABDL (2003) to model
the logarithmic realized volatilities, in turn allowing for the use of standard normal distribution theory and
related mixture models.20 Guided by this same idea, we report in the last three columns of Tables 2A-C the
estimates of the logarithmic HAR-RV-J model,


          log(RVt,t+h) = β0 + βD log(RVt) + βW log(RVt,t-5) + βM log(RVt,t-22)
                                                                                   + βJ log(Jt+1) + ,t,t+h .                           (13)


The estimates are again directly in line with those of the HAR-RV-J models for RVt,t+h and (RVt,t+h)1/2 discussed
earlier. In particular, the $D coefficients are generally the largest in the daily models, the $W ’s are the most
important in the weekly models, and the $M ’s in the monthly models. At the same time, the negative estimates
of the $J coefficients temper the persistency in the forecasts, suggesting that jumps in the price processes tend
to be associated with short-lived bursts in volatility.


V. Shrinkage Estimation and Microstructure Noise Correction
          The empirical results discussed thus far rely on the simple non-parametric jump estimates defined by
the difference between the realized volatility and the bi-power variation. As discussed in Section II, the
theoretical justification for those measurements is based on the notion of increasingly finer sampled returns, or


          19
            The R2 = 0.431 for the daily HAR-RV-J model for the DM/$ realized volatility series in the fourth column in Table
2A also exceeds the comparable in-sample one-day-ahead R2 = 0.355 for the long-memory VAR model reported in ABDL (2003).

           20
              This same transformation has subsequently been used for other markets by Deo, Hurvich and Lu (2005), Koopman,
Jungbacker and Hol (2005), Martens, van Dijk and Pooter (2004), and Oomen (2002) among others. Of course, the log-normal
distribution isn’t closed under temporal aggregation. Thus, if the daily logarithmic realized volatilities are normally distributed,
the weekly and monthly volatilities can not also be log-normally distributed. However, as argued by Barndorff-Nielsen and
Shephard (2002a) and Forsberg and Bollerslev (2002), the log-normal volatility distributions may be closely approximated by
Inverse Gaussian distributions, which are formally closed under temporal aggregation.

                                                                    - 11 -
)60. Of course, any practical implementation with a fixed sampling frequency, or )>0, is invariably subject
to measurement error. The non-negativity truncation in equation (8) alleviates part of this finite-sample
problem by eliminating theoretically infesible negative estimates for the squared jumps. However, the resulting
Jt1/2 series depicted in Figures 1A-C arguably also exhibit an unreasonably large number of non-zero small
positive values. It may be desirable to treat these small jumps as measurement errors, or part of the continuous
sample path variation process, associating only large values of RVt())-BVt()) with the jump component. The
next sub-section provides a theoretical framework for doing so.


A. Asymptotic Distribution Theory
        The distributional results developed in Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2004a, 2005) and extended in
Barndorff-Nielsen, Graversen, Jacod, Podolskij and Shephard (2005) imply that, under sufficient regularity,
frictionless market conditions and in the absence of jumps in the price path,

for )60. Hence, an abnormally large value of this standardized difference between RVt+1()) and BVt+1()) is
naturally interpreted as evidence in favor of a “significant” jump over the [t,t+1] time interval. Of course, the
integrated quarticity that appears in the denominator needs to be estimated in order to actually implement this
statistic. In parallel to the arguments underlying the robust estimation of the integrated volatility by the
realized bi-power variation, it is possible to show that even in the presence of jumps, the integrated quarticity
may be consistently estimated by the normalized sum of the product of n$3 adjacent absolute returns raised to
the power of 4/n. In particular, on defining the standardized realized tri-power quarticity measure,

Combining the results in equations (14)-(16), the “significant” jumps may therefore be identified by comparing
realizations of the feasible test statistics,21

to a standard normal distribution.
          The extensive simulation-based evidence for specific parametric continuous time diffusions reported in
Huang and Tauchen (2005) suggests that the Wt+1(∆) statistic defined in (17) tends to over-reject the null
hypothesis of no jumps for large critical values. At the same time, following the approach advocated by
Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2004b), different variance stabilizing transforms for the joint asymptotic
distribution of the realized volatility and bi-power variation measures generally produce test statistics with
improved finite-sample performance. In particular, on applying the delta-rule to the joint bivariate distribution,
Huang and Tauchen (2005) find that the ratio-statistic,

where the max adjustment follows by a Jensen’s inequality argument as in Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard
(2004b), is very closely approximated by a standard normal distribution throughout its entire support in
samples of the size relevant here.22 Moreover, they find that the ratio-statistic in (18) also has reasonable

             Similar results were obtained by using the robust realized quad-power quarticity measure advocated in Barndorff-
Nielsen and Shephard (2004a, 2005),

used in estimating the integrated quarticity by Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2002a) and Andersen, Bollerslev and Meddahi
(2005) is not consistent in the presence of jumps, which in turn would result in a complete loss of power for the corresponding test
statistic obtained by replacing TQt+1(∆) in equation (17) with RQt+1(∆).

          22
                In an earlier version of this paper, we relied on the log-based statistic,

                                          log(RVt%1(∆ )) & log(BVt%1(∆ ))

          Hence we naturally identify the “significant” jumps by the realizations of Zt+1()) in excess of some
critical value, say M" ,


          Jt%1,α( ∆ ) / I [ Zt%1( ∆ ) > Φα ] @ [ RVt%1( ∆ ) & BVt%1( ∆ ) ] ,                                                           (19)



where I [ @ ] denotes the indicator function.23 To ensure that the estimated continuous sample path component
variation and jump variation sum to the total realized variation, we estimate the former component as the
residual,


          Ct%1,α( ∆ ) / I [ Zt%1( ∆ ) # Φα ] @ RVt%1( ∆ ) % I [ Zt%1( ∆ ) > Φα ] @ BVt%1( ∆ ) .                                        (20)



Note that for M">0, the definitions in equations (19) and (20) automatically guarantee that both Jt+1," ()) and
Ct+1," ()) are positive.24 Of course, the non-negativity truncation imposed in equation (8) underlying the
empirical jump measurements employed in the preceding two sections corresponds directly to α = 0.5, or Jt,0.5 .


B. Market Microstructure Noise
          As already discussed in Section III.A, a host of practical market microstrucure frictions, including the
use of discrete price grid points and bid-ask spreads, invariably renders fictitious the assumption of a
continuously observed logarithmic price process following a semimartigale. Hence, following Aït-Sahalia,
Mykland and Zhang (2005), Bandi and Russell (2004b), and Zhang, Mykland and Aït-Sahalia (2005), among
others, assume that the observed price process is “contaminated” by a market microstructure noise component,
say p(t)=p*(t)+<(t), where p*(t) refers to the true (latent) semimartingale logarithmic price process that would
obtain in the absence of any frictions, while <(t) denotes an i.i.d. white noise component.25 The discretely



which produced qualitatively very similar results.

          23
              As noted in personal communication with Neil Shephard, this may alternatively be interpreted as a shrinkage
estimator for the jump component.

          24
             It is possible that, by specifying α(∆)61 as an explicit function of )60, this approach may formally be shown to result
in period-by-period consistent (as )60) estimates of the jump component. Of course, data limitations restrict the sampling
frequency ()>0), rendering such a result of limited practical use.

          25
             More complicated non-i.i.d. market microstructure noise components have been analyzed in the realized volatility
setting by Bandi and Russell (2004a) and Hansen and Lunde (2006), among others.

                                                                   - 14 -
sampled )-period observed returns,


                                                                    (
         rt,∆ / p ((t) & p ((t&∆) % ν(t) & ν(t&∆) / rt,∆ % ηt,∆ ,                                                     (21)



then equal the true (latent) returns plus the first-order moving average process, ηt,∆ . Assuming that the

variance of ν(t) does not depend upon ∆, the noise term will eventually (for )60) dominate the contribution to
the overall realized variation in (3) coming from the squared true (latent) high-frequency returns, formally
rendering RVt%1( ∆ ) inconsistent as a measure of the quadratic variation of p ((t) . In practice, the impact of the

market microstructure noise is most easily controlled through the choice of ∆. Our choice of a five-minute
sampling frequency for the very active markets analyzed here is motivated by this bias-variance tradeoff as the
bias in the realized variation measure in equation (3) appears to largely vanish at this frequency.
        By analogous arguments, the noise term will generally result in an upward bias in the new bi-power
                                                                        (       (
variation measure in equation (5) for ∆ “too small,” as E( * rt,∆ * ) < E( * rt,∆ % ηt,∆ * ) . The first-order serial

correlation in ηt,∆ further implies that any two adjacent observed returns, say rt% j@∆, ∆ and rt% (j&1)@∆, ∆ , will be

serially correlated. In comparison to the realized variation measure based on the sum of the squared high-
frequency returns, this spuriously induced first-order serial correlation will therefore result in an additional
source of bias in the BVt%1( ∆ ) measure. Of course, similar arguments apply to the tri-power quarticity measure

in equation (15). As discussed at length in Huang and Tauchen (2005), this in turn implies that in the presence
of market microstructure noise, the jump test statistics discussed in the previous section will generally be
biased against finding jumps. In particular, it is possible to show that in the absence of jumps,
lim∆6 4 [ RVt%1( ∆ ) & BVt%1( ∆ ) ] ' κ < 0 , so that the Wt+1(∆) test statistic defined in (17) will be negatively

biased. Although comparable analytical results are not available for the ratio-statistic in equation (18), the
numerical calculations and extensive simulation evidence reported in Huang and Tauchen (2005) confirm that
for small values of ∆, the test tends to be under-sized, and this tendency to under-reject further deteriorates with
the magnitude of the variance of the ν(t) noise component.
        The spurious serial correlation in the observed returns defined in equation (21) is, however, readily
broken through the use of staggered, or skip-one, returns. Specifically, replacing the sum of the absolute
adjacent returns in equation (5) with the corresponding staggered absolute returns, a modified realized bi-
power variation measure may be defined by



                                                           - 15 -

where the normalization factor in front of the sum reflects the loss of two observations due to the staggering.
Of course, higher order serial dependence could be broken in an analogous fashion by further increasing the lag
length. Similarly, the integrated quarticity may alternatively be estimated by the staggered realized tri-power
quarticity,
                                                         1/∆

                                                         j'5



Importantly, as shown by Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2004a), in the absence of the noise component,
these staggered realized variation measures remain consistent for the corresponding integrated variation
measures. Consequently, the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic obtained by replacing BVt%1( ∆ ) and

TQt%1( ∆ ) in equation (18) with their staggered counterparts, BV1 , t%1( ∆ ) and TQ1 , t%1( ∆ ) , respectively, say

Z1 , t%1( ∆ ) , will also be asymptotically (for )60) standard normally distributed. However, following the

discussion above, the staggering should help alleviate the confounding influences of the market microstructure
noise, resulting in empirically more accurate finite sample approximations. This conjecture is indeed confirmed
by the comprehensive simulation results reported in Huang and Tauchen (2005), which show that the ratio-
statistic calculated with the staggered realized bi-power and tri-power variation measures performs admirably
for a wide range of market microstructure contaminants. component.26
          Hence, in the empirical results reported below we rely on the Jt,"()) and Ct,"()) measures previously
defined in equations (19) and (20) calculated on the basis of the staggered Z1 , t( ∆ ) statistic. To facilitate the

notation, we will again omit the explicit reference to the sampling frequency, ), simply referring to the jump
and continuous sample path variability measures calculated from the five-minute returns as Jt," and Ct," ,
respectively. Subsequently we shall summarize various features of these jump measurements for values of α
ranging from 0.5 to 0.9999, or M" ranging from 0.0 to 3.719.


C. Jumps Measurements and Macroeconomic News
          Before summarizing the full sample time series evidence, it is instructive to look at a few specific days
to illustrate the working of the jump statistic. To this end, Figure 2 displays the five-minute increments in the


          26
             Quoting from the conclusion of Huang and Tauchen (2005): “The Monte Carlo evidence suggests that, under the
arguable realistic scenarios considered here, the recently developed tests for jumps perform impressively and are not easily fooled.”

                                                                   - 16 -
logarithmic prices for a highly significant jump day and a day with a large continuous price move for each of
the three markets. For ease of comparison, the logarithmic price has been normalized to zero at the beginning
of each day, so that a unit increment corresponds to a one-percent return in all of the graphs.
         The first panel shows the movements in the DM/$ exchange rate on December 10, 1987. The Z1 , t

statistics for this day equals 10.315, thus indicating a highly significant jump. The timing of the jump, as
evidenced by the apparent discontinuity at 13:30 GMT, corresponds exactly to the 8:30 EST release of the U.S.
trade deficit for the month of October.27 Quoting from the Wall Street Journal: “The trade gap swelled to a
record $17.63 billion in October, sending the dollar and bonds plunging.” The second panel in the first row
depicts a similar large daily decline in the value of the dollar on September 17, 1992. In fact, this is the day in
the entire sample with the highest value of BV1,t = 4.037. At the same time, the Z1 , t statistic for this day equals

-0.326, and thus in spite of the overall large daily move, does not signify any jump(s). This particular day
succeeds the day following the temporary withdrawal of the British Pound from the European Monetary
System, and it has previously been highlighted in the study by Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2005). Again,
quoting from the Wall Street Journal: “The dollar and the pound each sank more than 2% against the mark as
nervousness persisted in the currency market.” Of course, without the benefit of the intraday high-frequency
data, the day-to-day price moves in the first two panels would look almost identical.
         Turning to the second row in the figure, the first panel shows the five-minute movements in the
S&P500 on June 30, 1999. As suggested by visual inspection of the plot, the Z1 , t = 7.659 statistic is again

highly significant. Moreover, the apparent timing of the jump at 13:15 CST, or 14:15 EST, corresponds
exactly to the time of the 1/4% increase in the FED funds rate on that day. That rate hike was accompanied by
a statement by the FED that it “might not raise rates again in the near term due to conflicting forces in the
economy,” which apparently was viewed as a positive sign by the market. In contrast, on July 24, 2002, as
depicted in the panel on the right, Z1 , t = -0.704, while BV1,t achieves its maximum value of 29.247. The

abnormally large daily return of 7.157 is also the largest over the whole sample. Yet, this “rough” daily move
is made up of the sum of many “smooth” intraday price moves, with no apparent jump(s) in the process.
Interestingly, the NYSE also saw a record trading volume of 2.77 billion shares on that day.
         The last row in the figure refers to the T-Bond market. The apparent timing of the highly significant
jump, Z1 , t = 6.877, on August 1, 1996, corresponds directly to the release of the National Association of



           27
              The systematic news announcement analysis in Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold and Vega (2003, 2005) also points to
the U.S. trade balance as one of the most important regularly scheduled macroeconomic news releases for the foreign exchange
market.

                                                                - 17 -
Purchasing Manager’s (NAPM) index at 9:00 CST, or 10:00 EST.28 In contrast, the second T-Bond panel for
December 7, 2002 again depicts a large daily, but generally “smooth” intraday, price move. Interestingly, most
of the movements occurred in the morning following news of higher than expected joblessness. While this did
not result in an immediate jump in the T-Bond price, it reassured most economist’s that the FED would cut its
rate at the next Board meeting the following business day, which in fact it did. According to Wall Street
Journal: “Economists said the jobs report removed any lingering doubts that the Federal Reserve will reduce
interest rates for the 11th time in the past 12 months when it meets tomorrow.”
         The direct association of the highly significant jump days in Figure 2 with readily identifiable
macroeconomic news affirms earlier case studies for the DM/$ foreign exchange market in Barndorff-Nielsen
and Shephard (2005) and is directly in line with the aforementioned evidence in Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold
and Vega (2003, 2005) among others, documenting significant intra-daily price moves in response to a host of
macroeconomic news announcements. Similarly, Johannes (2004) readily associates the majority of the
estimated jumps in a parametric jump-diffusion model for daily interest rates with specific macroeconomic
news events. At the same time, informal inspection suggests that not all of the jump days identified by large
values of the non-parametric high-frequency Z1 , t statistic are as easily linked to specific “news” arrivals.

Indeed, it would be interesting, but beyond the scope of the present paper, to attempt a more systematic
characterization of the types of events that cause the different markets to jump. Instead, we turn to a discussion
of various summary statistics related to the time series of significant jumps employed in our subsequent
volatility forecasting models.


D. Jump Dynamics
         To begin, the first row in Tables 3A-C reports the proportion of days with significant jumps for each of
the three markets based on the Z1 , t statistic as a function of the significance level, α. Although the use of α’s in

excess of 0.5 has the intended effect of reducing the number of days with jumps, the procedure still identifies
many more significant jumps than would be expected if the underlying price process was continuous.
Comparing the jump intensities across the three markets, the foreign exchange and the T-Bond markets
generally exhibit the highest proportion of jumps, whereas the stock market has the lowest.29 For instance,


         28
           The results in Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold and Vega (2005) again indicate that, for the T-Bond market, news about
the NAPM index results in the overall highest five-minute return regression R2 among all of the regularly scheduled
macroeconomic announcements.

         29
            This ordering among the three markets is again consistent with the evidence in Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold and
Vega (2005), showing that equity markets generally respond the least to macroeconomic news announcements.

                                                                 - 18 -
employing a cutoff of " =0.999, or M" =3.090, results in 417, 244, and 424 significant jumps for each of the
three markets respectively, all of which far exceed the expected three jumps for a continuous price process
(0.001 times 3,045 and 3,213, respectively). Indeed, all of the daily jump proportions are much higher than the
jump intensities estimated with specific parametric jump diffusion models applied to daily or coarser frequency
returns, which typically suggest only a few jumps a year; see, e.g., the estimates for the S&P500 in Andersen,
Benzoni and Lund (2002). Intuitively, just as the stock market crash of 1987 and the corresponding large
negative daily return on October 17 is not visible in the time series of annual equity returns, many of the jumps
identified by the high-frequency based realized variation measures employed here will invariably be hidden in
the coarser daily or lower frequency returns.
          Turning to the second and third rows in the table, it is noteworthy that although the proportion of
jumps depend importantly on the particular choice of ", the sample means and standard deviations of the
resulting jump time series are not nearly as sensitive to the significance level. This observation is further
corroborated by the time series plots for each of the three markets in the third and fourth panels in Figures 1A-
1C, which show the Z1 , t statistics and a horizontal line at 3.090, along with the resulting significant jumps,

    1/2
or Jt, 0.999 . It is evident that the test statistic generally picks out the largest values of Jt1/2 as being significant, so

that the sample means and standard deviations of the time series depicted in the second and the fourth panels
are all fairly close.
          The Ljung-Box statistics for up to tenth order serial correlation in the Jt," series for the S&P500
reported in the fourth row in Table 3B are all highly significant, regardless of the choice of ". This contrasts
with most of the parametric jump-diffusion model estimates reported in the recent literature, which as
previously noted suggest very little, or no, predictable variation in the jump process. Still, it is noteworthy that
the values of the Ljung-Box statistics for the significant S&P500 jumps are all much less than the
corresponding statistics for the realized variation series reported in Table 1B. The corresponding Ljung-Box
tests for the DM/$ and T-Bond jump series are not nearly as large, and generally insignificant for the jumps
defined by "’s in excess of 0.990.
          These findings are further corroborated by Christoffersen’s (1998) Likelihood Ratio test for the null of
i.i.d. jumps against a first-order Markov alternative reported in the fifth row. Under the null of no dependence
this test statistic should be asymptotically chi-square distributed with one degree of freedom. None of the test
statistics for α equal to 0.999 or 0.9999 for the DM/$ and T-Bond markets exceed the corresponding 95-percent
critical value of 3.84, while the tests for the S&P500 are highly significant.
          Interestingly, when looking beyond the own linear dependence and the Ljung-Box test for the Jt,"
series, a somewhat different picture emerges. In particular, decomposing the Jt," series into the times between

                                                            - 19 -
jumps and the sizes of the corresponding jumps, there appears to be strong evidence for clustering in the
occurrences of the significant jumps for both the S&P500 and T-Bond markets, as evidenced by the Ljung-Box
test for up to tenth order serial correlation in the durations between the jumps, denoted by LB10, Dt,α in Table 3.
Similarly, the Ljung-Box tests for serial correlation in the time series of only the significant jumps, denoted by
LB10 , Jt,α + in Table 3, strongly suggest that large (small) jumps tend to cluster together in time with other large
(small) jumps for both the DM/$ and S&P500 markets. In contrast, for the T-Bond market and " =0.999, only
the durations but not the sizes of the jumps appear to cluster in time.
          The more complex dynamic dependence in the significant jump time series is further illustrated in
Figure 3, which plots the smoothed jump intensities and jump sizes for each of the three markets. The graphs
are constructed by exponentially smoothing (with a smoothing parameter of 0.94) the average monthly jump
intensities and sizes of the significant jumps based on " =0.999. The jump sizes are again expressed in
                                    1/2
standard deviation form, or Jt, 0.999 . From the very first panel the DM/$ jump intensities are approximately

constant throughout the sample. Similarly, the smoothed jump sizes for the T-Bond market depicted in the last
panel vary very little over the sample period. In contrast, all of the other four panels suggest the existence of
potentially important temporal dependence in the jump arrival processes and jump sizes.30 Of course,
exponential smoothing automatically induces some serial correlation, so that the appearance of dependence
gleaned from the figure should be carefully interpreted. Note also that the common scale enforced on the three
jump size panels tends to hide the subtle, but systematic, decline in the sizes of the jumps for the DM/$ market
over the sample period, as evidenced by the highly significant LB10, Jt,α+ in Table 3; see also the plot for the
raw jump series in Figure 1A.
          Instead, we next turn to a simple extension of the HAR-RV-J volatility forecasting model introduced in
Section IV, in which we incorporate the time series of significant jumps as additional explanatory variables in a
straightforward linear fashion.


VI. Accounting for Jumps in Realized Volatility Modeling and Forecasting, Revisited
          The regression estimates of the HAR-RV-J model reported in Section IV show that inclusion of the
simple consistent daily jump measure corresponding to " =0.5 as an additional explanatory variable over-and-



          30
               It would be interesting, but beyond the scope of the present paper, to further explore the formulation of parametric
jump-diffusion models best designed to capture such non-linear dependence. For instance, following Bates (2000), Pan (2002) and
Eraker (2004), the jump intensity could be specified as a function of the instantaneous diffusion volatility. In the notation of
equation (1), λ(t)=λ0+λ1σ(t). Similarly, the size of the jumps could be allowed to depend on the volatility and/or lagged past jump
sizes, as in, e.g., κ2(t)=κ0+κ1σ(t)+κ2κ2(t-1 ). The recent discrete-time parametric model estimates reported in Chan and Maheu
(2002) and McCurdy and Maheu (2004) also point to the existence of time-varying jump intensities in U.S. equity index returns.

                                                                  - 20 -
above the daily realized volatilities results in highly significant and negative estimates of the jump coefficient.
These results are, of course, entirely consistent with the summary statistics for the jump measurements
discussed above, which indicate markedly less own (linear) serial correlation in the significant jump series in
comparison to the realized volatility series. Building on these results, the present section extends the HAR-
RV-J model by explicitly decomposing the realized volatilities that appear as explanatory variables on the
right-hand-side into the continuous sample path variability and the jump variation utilizing the separate non-
parametric measurements based on the Z1 , t statistic along with equations (19) and (20), respectively. In so

doing, we rely exclusively on " =0.999, and the jump series depicted in the bottom panels of Figures 1A-C.31
To facilitate the exposition, we omit the 0.999 subscript on the Jt,0.999 and Ct,0.999 series in what follows.


A. The HAR-RV-CJ Model
          Defining the normalized multi-period jump and continuous sample path variability measures,


          Jt,t+h = h-1[ Jt+1 + Jt+2 + ... + Jt+h ] ,                                                                                    (24)
and,
          Ct,t+h = h-1[ Ct+1 + Ct+2 + ... + Ct+h ] ,                                                                                    (25)


respectively, the new HAR-RV-CJ model may be expressed as


          RVt,t+h = β0 + βCD Ct + βCW Ct-5,t + βCM Ct-22,t +
                                                                                                                                        (26)
                               + βJD Jt + βJW Jt-5,t + βJM Jt-22,t + εt,t+h .


The model obviously nests the HAR-RV-J model in (11) for $D =$CD +$JD , $W =$CW +$JW , $M =$CM +$JM , and $J
=$JD , but in general it allows for a more flexible dynamic lag structure.32
          Turning to the empirical estimates in the first three columns in Tables 4A-C, most of the jump
coefficient estimates are insignificant. In other words, the predictability in the HAR-RV realized volatility
regressions is almost exclusively due to the continuous sample path components. For the DM/$ and the
S&P500 the HAR-RV-CJ models typically result in relatively modest increases in the R2 of less than 0.01 in


          31
            By “optimally” choosing ", it may be possible to further improve upon the empirical results reported below.
However, for simplicity and to guard against obvious data snooping biases, we simply restrict "=0.999.

          32
              For the two models to be nested the (implicit) choice of α employed in the measurements of Jt,t+h and Ct,t+h should, of
course, be the same across models.

                                                                   - 21 -
absolute value compared to the HAR-RV-J models in Tables 2A-B, whereas for the T-Bond market the
improvements are closer to 0.02, or about 4-5 percent in a relative sense. The tests for first, sixth, and twenty-
third order serial correlation in the residuals from the estimated daily (h=1), weekly (h=5), and monthly (h=22)
regressions also indicate that the HAR-RV-CJ models have eliminated most of the strong serial correlation in
the RVt,t+h series.33 Still, some statistically significant autocorrelations remain at higher lags for some of the
models, suggesting that further refinements might be possible.
          These same qualitative results carry over to the non-linear HAR-RV-CJ models cast in standard
deviation and logarithmic form; i.e.,


          (RVt,t+h)1/2 = β0 + βCD Ct1/2 + βCW (Ct-5,t)1/2 + βCM (Ct-22,t)1/2
                                                                                                                                      (27)
                              + βJD Jt1/2 + βJW (Jt-5,t)1/2 + βJM (Jt-22,t)1/2 + εt,t+h ,
and,


          log(RVt,t+h) = β0 + βCD log(Ct) + βCW log(Ct-5,t) + βCM log(Ct-22,t)
                                                                                                                                      (28)
                               + βJD log(Jt +1) + βJW log(Jt-5,t +1) + βJM log(Ct-22,t +1) + εt,t+h ,


respectively. The jump coefficient estimates, reported in the last six columns in Tables 4A-C, are again
insignificant for most of the markets and forecast horizons. In contrast, the estimates of $CD, $CW , and $CM,
which quantify the impact of the continuous sample path variability on the total future variation, are all
generally highly significant.
          To further illustrate the predictability afforded by the HAR-RV-CJ model, Figures 4A-C plot the daily,
weekly, and monthly realized volatilities (again in standard deviation form) together with the corresponding
forecasts from the model in equation (27). The close coherence between the different pairs of realizations and
forecasts is immediately evident across all of the markets and forecast horizons. Visual inspection of the
graphs also shows that the volatility in the U.S. T-Bond market is the least predictable, followed by the DM/$,
and then the S&P500. Nonetheless, the forecasts of the T-Bond volatilities still track the overall patterns fairly
well, especially for the longer weekly and monthly horizons.
          All told, these results underscore the potential benefit from a volatility forecasting perspective of
separately measuring the individual components of the realized volatility. It is possible that even further


          33
             The lag one, six, and twenty-three autocorrelations of the residuals from the three DM/$ HAR-RV-CJ models are -
0.014, -0.026, and 0.003, respectively. For the S&P500, the same residual autocorrelations are -0.011, 0.007, and -0.081, while for
T-Bonds the autocorrelations are 0.003, -0.006, and -0.060, respectively.

                                                                  - 22 -
improvements may be obtained by a more structured approach in which the jump component, Jt , and the
continuous sample path component, Ct , are each modeled separately. These individual models for Jt and Ct
could then be used in the construction of separate out-of-sample forecasts for each of the components, as well
as combined forecasts of the total realized variation process, RVt,t+h = Ct,t+h + Jt,t+h. We leave further work
along these lines for future research.


VII. Concluding Remarks
        Building on recent theoretical results in Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2004a, 2005) for bi-power
variation measures, we provide a simple and easy-to-implement practical framework for measuring
“significant” jumps in financial asset prices. Applying the theory to more than a decade of high-frequency
prices from the foreign exchange, equity, and fixed income markets, we find that the procedure works well
empirically. Our non-parametric measurements suggest that jumps dynamics are much less persistent (and
predictable) than continuous sample path dynamics. In addition, the high-frequency data underlying our
estimates allow us to identify many more jumps than do the parametric models based on daily or courser
frequency data hitherto reported in the literature. It also appears that many of the most significant jumps are
readily associated with specific macroeconomic news announcements. Finally, when separately including the
continuous sample path and jump variability measures in a simple linear volatility forecasting model, we find
that only the continuous part has predictive power, in turn resulting in significant gains relative to the simple
realized volatility forecasting models advocated in some of the recent literature.
        The ideas and empirical results presented here are suggestive of several interesting extensions. First, it
seems natural that jump risk may be priced differently from easier-to-hedge continuous price variability; see,
e.g., Santa-Clara and Yan (2004). Hence, separately modeling and forecasting the continuous sample path, or
integrated volatility, and jump components of the quadratic variation process, as discussed above, is likely to
result in important improvements in derivatives and other pricing decisions.
        Second, our choice of a five-minute sampling frequency and the new skip-one realized bi-power and
tri-power variation measures to mitigate the market microstructure frictions in the high-frequency data were
based on intuitive but informal considerations. It would be interesting to further investigate the “optimal”
choice of sampling frequency, or the use of optimal sub-sampling schemes in the construction of the bi- and tri-
power variation measures. The related results for the realized variation measures in, e.g., Bandi and Russell
(2004a,b), Hansen and Lunde (2006) and Zhang, Aït-Sahalia and Mykland (2005), should be helpful.
        Third, if interest centers exclusively on volatility forecasting, the use of more traditional robust power
variation measures defined by the sum of absolute high-frequency returns raised to powers less than two might


                                                        - 23 -
afford additional gains over and above the improvements provided by the bi-power variation and significant
jump measures used here; the recent empirical results in Forsberg and Ghysels (2004) are suggestive.
        Fourth, casual empirical observation suggests that very large price moves, or jumps, often occur
simultaneously across different markets. It would be interesting to extend the present analysis to a multivariate
framework explicitly incorporating such commonalities through the use of quadratic covariation and
appropriately defined co-power variation measures; the abstract theoretical results in Barndorff-Nielsen,
Graversen, Jacod, Podolskij and Shephard (2005) are intriguing. In addition to allowing for more accurate
statistical identification of the most important, or significant, jumps, this should also enhance our
understanding of the underlying economic influences that “drive” financial markets and prices.
        Last, and not at all least, additional exploration of variations on the shrinkage estimation undertaken
here would be of great interest. We simply shrink raw jump estimates toward zero by setting all those less than
some arbitrary threshold (motivated by classical asymptotic distribution theory) to zero. This “hard threshold”
contrasts with the “soft thresholds” typical of Bayesian shrinkage, which would involve coaxing, but not
forcing, of raw jump estimates toward zero. A thorough Bayesian analysis must, however, await future work.

Key: The first six rows in each of the panels report the sample mean, standard deviation, skewness, and
kurtosis, along with the sample minimum and maximum. The rows labeled LB10 give the Ljung-Box test
statistic for up to tenth order serial correlation. The daily realized volatilities and jumps for the DM/$ in Panel
A are constructed from five-minute returns spanning the period from December 1986 through June 1999, for a
total of 3,045 daily observations. The daily realized volatilities and jumps for the S&P500 and U.S. T-Bonds
in Panels B and C are based on five-minute returns from January 1990 through December 2002, for a total of
3,213 observations.

Key: The table reports the OLS estimates for daily (h=1) and overlapping weekly (h=5) and monthly (h=22)
HAR-RV-J volatility forecast regressions. The realized volatilities and jumps are constructed from five-minute
returns spanning the period from December 1986 through June 1999, for a total of 3,045 daily observations.
The standard errors reported in parentheses are based on a Newey-West/Bartlett correction allowing for serial
correlation of up to order 5 (h=1), 10 (h=5), and 44 (h=22), respectively. The last two rows labeled R2HAR-RV-J
and R2HAR are for the HAR-RV-J model and a “standard” HAR model with no jumps and with the realized
volatilities on the right-hand-side of the regression replaced with the corresponding lagged daily, weekly, and
monthly squared returns.

Key: The table reports the OLS estimates for daily (h=1) and overlapping weekly (h=5), and monthly (h=22)
HAR-RV-J volatility forecast regressions. The realized volatilities and jumps are constructed from five-minute
returns spanning the period from January 1990 through December 2002, for a total of 3,213 daily observations.
The standard errors reported in parentheses are based on a Newey-West/Bartlett correction allowing for serial
correlation of up to order 5 (h=1), 10 (h=5), and 44 (h=22), respectively. The last two rows labeled R2HAR-RV-J

Key: The significant jumps for each of the three market, Jt," , are determined by equation (19) along with the
staggered bi-power and tri-power variation measures in equations (23) and (23), respectively. The first row in
each of the panels gives the proportion significant jump days for each of the different α’s. The next two rows
report the corresponding mean and standard deviation of the jump series, while the row labeled LB10, Jt," gives
the Ljung-Box tests for up to tenth order serial correlation. LR , I(Jt," >0) denotes the Likelihood Ratio test for
i.i.d. jump occurrences against a first Markov chain, while LB10, Dt,α, and LB10, Jt,α + refer to the Ljung-Box
tests for serial correlation in the corresponding durations, or times between jumps, and the sizes of the
significant jumps, respectively.

Key: The table reports the OLS estimates for daily (h=1) and overlapping weekly (h=5) and monthly (h=22)
HAR-RV-CJ volatility forecast regressions. All of the realized volatility measures are constructed from five-
minute returns spanning the period from December 1986 through June 1999, for a total of 3,045 daily
observations. The weekly and monthly measures are the scaled sums of the corresponding daily measures. The
significant daily jump and continuous sample path variability measures are based on equations (19) and (20),
respectively, along with the staggered power variation measures in equations (22) and (23), using a critical
value of α = 0.999. The standard errors reported in parentheses are based on a Newey-West/Bartlett correction
allowing for serial correlation of up to order 5 (h=1), 10 (h=5), and 44 (h=22), respectively.
