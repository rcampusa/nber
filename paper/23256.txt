                                         ABSTRACT

We present a theory in which the choice set cues a consumer to recall a norm, and surprise
relative to the norm shapes his attention and choice. We model memory based on Kahana (2012),
where past experiences that are more recent or more similar to the cue are recalled and crowd out
others. We model surprise relative to the norm using our salience model of attention and choice.
The model predicts unstable and inconsistent behavior in new contexts, because these are
evaluated relative to past norms. Under some conditions, repeated experience causes norms to
adapt, inducing stable – sometimes rational – behavior across different contexts. We test some of
the model’s predictions using an expanded data set on rental decisions of movers between US
cities first analyzed by Simonsohn and Loewenstein (2006).

1.Introduction


        A hypothetical traveler goes to an airport for the first time, and sees expensive bottled water for sale.

In standard theory, the traveler would buy the water if he is thirsty enough to be willing to pay the airport

price. Introspection however suggests that the traveler might be shocked by the high price at the airport –

which is much higher than the low “normal” price he is used to in stores – and not buy the water even if very

thirsty. Yet the same traveler would, over time, come to find high airport prices to be “normal” (and be

willing to buy water there), while also thinking that low prices are normal at stores.


        A person moves from San Francisco to Pittsburgh, where rents are sharply lower. In standard theory,

the mover’s reservation rent in Pittsburgh does not depend on the rent he paid in San Francisco. This mover,

however, is pleasantly surprised by the great deals in Pittsburgh compared to the high “normal” level he

remembers from San Francisco, and decides to rent a more expensive apartment than he would otherwise.

Yet, over time, the same mover would come to find the low Pittsburgh rents “normal”, and eventually move

to a cheaper apartment. Simonsohn and Loewenstein (SL 2006) offer evidence of precisely such behavior

among movers between US cities.


        These examples suggest that behavior may be influenced by two central mechanisms of perception

and judgment: formation of norms and surprise relative to norms. These mechanisms are analyzed by

Kahneman and Miller (1986) in “Norm Theory.” In their view, norms come from memory: “each event brings

its own frame of reference into being” by “acting as a reminder of similar events in the past”. In turn, surprise

is the cognitive reaction to an event that is very different from the norm it evokes, such as high water prices

at the airport or low rents in Pittsburgh.


        But how exactly are norms formed, and what events do they render surprising? What are the

implications of surprise for observable economic behavior? In this paper, we address these questions by

combining a textbook psychological model of memory from Kahana (2012) with Salience Theory of attention

and choice from Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer (BGS 2012, 2013). Salience Theory holds that, when

evaluating a choice option, our attention focuses on features that are very different from a reference point,

                                                       2
or norm. These “surprising features” are then overweighed in choice. Salience Theory connects Kahneman

and Miller’s notion of surprise, originally applied to judgments of normality, to choice.


        We describe the formation of norms by adapting Kahana’s (2012) model of associative recall. This

model sees episodic memory as a database of past experiences that are spontaneously recalled in response

to a cue. In our setup, the cues are goods in the choice set, each of which evokes memories of past

experiences with the same good. Cued recall follows two fundamental principles. First, it is associative and

driven by similarity. That is, a cue leads to recollection of similar past experiences, where similarity is defined

along hedonic attributes such as the quality and price of a good, as well as along contextual attributes such

as location and time of the experience. Second, recall is subject to interference. This means that experiences

more similar to the cue block recall of other, less similar, experiences. This model yields several basic features

of recall, such as recency effects and positive effects of repetition on subsequent recall.        The memories

evoked by the stimulus are then aggregated into a norm, in line with Kahneman and Miller’s idea that norms

are built by “selectively evoking stored representations” of similar past experiences.


        The fact that recall of past experiences is driven by their similarity to the cue has profound

implications. Because similarity may be strong along contextual attributes such as time or location, recall can

bring to mind norms that have very different hedonic attributes such as price or quality than the current

choice options. Surprising qualities or prices then distort the weight the consumer attaches to these

attributes and thereby his choice. In contrast, when similarity along hedonic attributes such as quality and

price dominates recall, the current options simply bring to mind their own past occurrences. In this case, we

say that the consumer is well adapted to the choice environment.


        Similarity-based recall then implies that personal history frames the consumer’s choice. When facing

an entirely new choice setting, the consumer’s norm – coming from memory – is not adapted. This is the

case with the first-time traveler at the airport, for whom only downtown prices are available in memory.

Similarity here acts through recency, generating a “low price” norm for water. The consumer gasps at the

high airport price, overweighs it in choice, and chooses not to buy. This memory-based mechanism for


                                                        3
surprise accounts for Simonson and Tversky’s (1993) background context effects, where recall of previous

choices shapes the evaluation of current ones.


        Because similarity depends on hedonic attributes, repeated and frequent experience with different

situations also leads to the adaptation of norms. For a traveler frequently visiting airports, seeing a high price

mainly reminds him of past airport experiences. Likewise, frequent experiences at stores causes low prices

to cue previously experienced low prices. Under some conditions, norms fully adapt (ex post) to the reality

the consumer faces. This has two implications. First, consumer behavior looks more rational in that it is

stable in each location, independent of the most recent experience. Second, the higher price norm at the

airport implies that the traveler will eventually be willing to pay more for the same water there than at the

store, even if equally thirsty.     This memory-based mechanism accounts for Thaler’s (1985) famous

experiment, in which willingness to pay for beer on the beach depends on reminders of where the beer is

bought (resort versus store), rather than reflecting a stable reservation price.


        We take the predictions of our model to the data, revisiting the Simonsohn and Loewenstein (SL

2006) evidence on rental expenditures of movers between US cities from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics

(PSID), with twenty additional years of data. SL find that movers to a new city choose housing with rents that

are closer to those in their city of origin, relative to other households with similar incomes and demographic

characteristics. On their subsequent moves within the city, however, the rental choices of movers are no

longer shaped by past prices. Both findings are predicted by our model, and we confirm both in more recent

data. We also test two novel predictions of situation-specific norms. First, movers are better adapted to

their new location, and thus past rents are less important, when they have previously lived in a city with

similar rents. Second, price in the city of origin has a stronger effect on rent paid for movers to cheap cities

than for movers to more expensive ones. There is some support for both implications in the data.


        In our model, price and quality norms effectively act as reference points that shape the decision

maker’s locus of attention. In this sense, our memory-based approach provides a unified way to think about

different types of reference points proposed in the vast literature on this topic. The “status quo” view of


                                                        4
reference points adopted in Prospect Theory (KT 1979) corresponds to the case in which a stable history of

past experiences fully determines the memory-based reference. This “backward looking” view is supported

by a substantial empirical literature (e.g., Genesove and Mayer 2001). However, even backward looking

reference points eventually adapt to new settings (e.g. DellaVigna et al 2017). In our model, both “status

quo” and “slow adaptation” effects are driven by similarity in recall: similar prices and qualities crowd out

dissimilar ones, provided they are recent enough. But our model also predicts how and when reference points

become situation-specific, and independent of recent experiences. This ex-post adaptation is not easily

reconcilable with the standard backward looking view, and generates consistency of references – and

stability of choice – in a well-defined set of circumstances.


        Koszegi and Rabin (2006) develop a purely forward-looking approach to reference points based on

rational expectations, in part to account for the prevalence of well-calibrated reference points. Although

expectations clearly play a role in reference point formation, this approach is difficult to reconcile with the

evidence that normatively irrelevant backward looking anchors influence choice. In our model, reference

points are shaped by both recency and choice similarity. This approach provides a middle ground between

mechanical adaptation and rational expectations. In some cases, the memory based reference point is

influenced by historical anchors; in others it is well adapted, resembling rational expectations. The properties

of associative memory yield predictions for when norms should or should not be fully adapted to the choice

set, depending on the frequency with which the decision maker is exposed to different choice sets.


        In the next section, we summarize the research on memory that motivates our formulation, focusing

on Kahana’s (2012) model. Also in that section, we apply this model to build a theory of norms, and develop

some of the key predictions. In Section 3, we describe how norms generate reference points, and combine

this theory with salience theory to formulate a model of choice. In Section 4, we apply this model to the

Simonsohn and Loewenstein analysis of movers between US cities. Section 5 concludes.

2. The Model


2.1 Similarity-Based Recall in Psychology


        Since the 1880s, a large body of experimental work has described the workings of episodic memory,

or memory of past experiences. Recently, this evidence has led to the development of formal models of recall

based on similarity. In these models, memory is viewed as a storage-and-retrieval facility for

experiences/events. Events are encoded as “memory traces”, which are vectors of attributes. Some

attributes are inherent to the event, others are contextual. For instance, when drinking a glass of milk our

memory records the taste and color of the milk (intrinsic attributes), but also contextual conditions such as

day and location. The memory database can thus be described as an event x attribute matrix. 2


        Recall is a spontaneous and subconscious process in which a current experience stimulates the

retrieval of a trace from memory. As described by Kahana (2012), recall obeys two principles:


    1. Recall is associative, driven by similarity: presenting a stimulus facilitates recall of items from memory

        that are similar to that stimulus.

    2. Recall is subject to interference: recall of items of given similarity to the stimulus is weakened or

        blocked entirely in the presence of more similar items in working memory.


        To illustrate, consider the three prominent experimental paradigms used to study memory. In item

recognition tests, subjects assess whether given words were part of previously shown lists of words. These

tests illustrate the role of similarity because i) the probability of recall is higher for items that belong to the

list, and ii) subjects are more likely to mistakenly recognize words if these are similar to a list member (e.g.

they recognize yoghurt when milk is on the list). In cued recall, subjects retrieve words that are pairwise

associated with a cue, having previously been shown lists of relevant word pairs. These tests illustrate the

role of interference: when a certain cue 𝐴𝐴 becomes associated with more and more words, recall of old


2
 Similarity models focus on episodic memory (i.e. memories of past experiences), while leaving out so-called semantic
memory, a broad term that covers functional associations and rule based thinking (e.g., recalling “glass” after seeing
“milk”). Semantic memory allows humans to create mental models, which may play a role in reference point formation.
However, it raises difficult theoretical issues, and is perhaps orthogonal to the mechanisms of experience-based
reference points that we focus on here.
                                                          6
associations declines (the fan effect). These interference effects are stronger for items that are more similar,

so similarity shapes cued recall as well. Finally, in free recall tests, subjects retrieve as many words as possible

from a long list. Here, previously recalled words act as cues for further recall, and the observed sequences

of recalled words are well accounted for by the forces of similarity.


        What are the defining features of similarity? In the standard model, similarity decreases with

distance in the space of intrinsic and contextual attributes. A key feature of associative memory is that recall

can spontaneously bring to mind experiences that are similar along intrinsic attributes (and potentially

relevant for the current choice), but also experiences similar along contextual, and normatively irrelevant,

attributes. Contextual attributes refer to features of the environment in which the item is presented. These

can be an individual's mood, or information about the physical environment (e.g. location, weather, or time

of day). The “contextual drift hypothesis” views the time of the experience as a key context attribute because

both internal and external aspects of context change slowly over time. This creates recency effects: similarity

to the current experience is higher for more recent events, so their recall is more likely. 3


        The resulting similarity model parsimoniously accounts for the large body of experimental evidence,

as well as for the two most basic observations about memory: the laws of repetition and of recency. The

recency of an experience augments its similarity to any current cue. Furthermore, repetition of an event

creates many similar traces in memory, thus enhancing their ability to crowd out other traces.


        A key contribution of our paper is to incorporate a standard model of memory from psychology into

an economic decision-making setting. Only a few economic models have previously explicitly dealt with

memory. Early papers incorporating memory limitations explored optimal storage of information given

limited capacity (e.g., Dow 1991, Wilson 2014) or analyzed decision problems with exogenous imperfect

recall (Piccione and Rubinstein 1997). Rubinstein (1998) summarizes some of this literature. In case based

decision theory (CBDT, Gilboa Schmeidler 1995), decision makers recall past experiences based on their




3
 This approach has challenged the traditional view that recency effects stem from memory decay, i.e. forgetting (see
also Brown, Chater, and Neath, 2007), and replaces it with interference from more recent experiences.
                                                          7
similarity with the current problem, but similarity is characterized axiomatically, not psychologically. For

example, CBDT does not allow for contextual attributes to influence recall.


         A more recent literature takes a more psychological approach to memory. In Mullainathan (2002),

limited memory distorts Bayesian updating and forecasting of an economic variable. Mullainathan’s model

allows for similarity to influence recall, but his notion of similarity includes neither context nor interference.

Taubinsky (2014) studies optimal reminders in a model where memory is imperfect and mental rehearsal

promotes recall. Ericson (2016) studies the interaction of forgetting and procrastination, drawing

implications for the demand for reminders. These models abstract from both similarity and interference.

The marketing literature also discusses the role of past purchases in current reference price, but the models

of memory used there are centrally focused on recency effects (for a review, see Mazumdar et al 2005).

Finally, Malmendier and Nagel (2011, 2016) document that expectations of stock market performance and

of inflation are disproportionately shaped by past experiences of those variables, suggesting that own

experience plays an outsized role in shaping beliefs.


         A number of recent papers build on Kahneman and Tversky’s (1972) representativeness heuristic to

explore how selective memory shapes beliefs. In this approach, representativeness distorts beliefs by

highlighting the features that are most diagnostic of, or similar to, a group in contrast to a comparison group

(Gennaioli and Shleifer 2010, Bordalo, Coffman, Gennaioli, Shleifer 2016). While such effects could also be at

play in the recall of norms, our approach, like Norm Theory, abstracts from them.




2.2 Memory Database


         In line with Kahana’s model of associative recall, memory is a database of past experiences, which

we restrict to past choice situations. Observing a certain choice option 𝑗𝑗 (e.g., a bottle of beer of brand 𝑗𝑗) at

time 𝑡𝑡 characterized by quality and price attributes (𝑞𝑞𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ) leaves a “memory trace” (𝑞𝑞𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , 𝒄𝒄) in the

agent’s database. In this notation, 𝒄𝒄 is a “context” vector capturing non-hedonic attributes present during

encoding. This vector could parsimoniously be defined by the time 𝑡𝑡 of the experience and its location 𝑠𝑠, 𝒄𝒄 =

                                                              8
(𝑡𝑡, 𝑠𝑠), where location captures the “type of store” (e.g., convenience versus airport) or “city” (e.g., San

Francisco versus Pittsburgh) where the good was observed. Location is a relevant context factor in some of

our applications, but it does not alter the predictions based on the time factor alone. To streamline our

analysis, we make the minimal assumption that context is only defined by the time of the experience, and

write 𝒄𝒄 = 𝑡𝑡. We later return to the role of location as context.


         Denote by 𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗 = {𝑡𝑡1 , 𝑡𝑡2 , … , 𝑡𝑡𝑛𝑛 } the ordered set of all dates at which good 𝑗𝑗 was observed in the past.

A generic memory trace consists of a triplet of real numbers, 𝑞𝑞𝑗𝑗𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 , 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 , 𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 ∈ ℝ, where 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 and 𝑞𝑞𝑗𝑗𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 denote

the price and quality of the 𝑟𝑟th observation of the good, which occurred at time 𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 ∈ 𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗 . After observing the

good 𝑛𝑛 times, the memory database for good 𝑗𝑗 at 𝑡𝑡 > 𝑡𝑡𝑛𝑛 is the matrix:

                                                          𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑡𝑡1 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗2 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑛𝑛
                                                𝑀𝑀𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = � 𝑗𝑗𝑡𝑡1 𝑞𝑞𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗2 … 𝑞𝑞𝑗𝑗𝑡𝑡𝑛𝑛 �,
                                                          𝑞𝑞
                                                            𝑡𝑡1 𝑡𝑡2         𝑡𝑡𝑛𝑛


which lists all past experiences of good 𝑗𝑗. Database 𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡 adds past experiences of all goods 𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡 ≡ �𝑀𝑀𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 �𝑗𝑗∈𝐽𝐽 . 4


         To illustrate, consider a consumer who visited a convenience store 𝑛𝑛 times in the past. At the store,

he considered a bottle of water of constant quality and price 𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝 > 0. Thus, the consumer’s memory

database of good 𝑗𝑗 = water bottles at time 𝑡𝑡 consists of repeated experiences of a single good:

                                                              𝑝𝑝   𝑝𝑝
                                                   𝑀𝑀𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = � 𝑞𝑞 … 𝑞𝑞 �,                                                   (1)
                                                             𝑡𝑡1 𝑡𝑡𝑛𝑛


Suppose now that, at time 𝑡𝑡 > 𝑡𝑡𝑛𝑛 , this consumer has an 𝑛𝑛 + 1th experience in an airport in which the price

of the same water bottle is marked up to 𝑝𝑝′ = 𝑝𝑝 + ∆. This experience is then encoded in the memory

database which, for 𝑡𝑡 ′ > 𝑡𝑡 (and prior to the next experience) is given by:




4
 In principle, the assignment of experiences into categories of goods is a function of experience itself. For example, a
person trying wine for the first time may classify it as a “drink”, but will at some point create a “wine” category, and
eventually “white wine” category, and so on. Here, we take this categorization as given, reflecting our interest in choice
among familiar goods, while varying choice contexts, as illustrated in the water example.
                                                                  9
                                                            𝑝𝑝  𝑝𝑝 𝑝𝑝 + ∆
                                              𝑀𝑀𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗′   = � … 𝑞𝑞
                                                            𝑞𝑞        𝑞𝑞 �.                                                (2)
                                                           𝑡𝑡1 𝑡𝑡𝑛𝑛   𝑡𝑡

As the consumer visits more airports, he keeps adding “airport water” vectors to his database regardless

whether water is bought or not. For the purposes of recall, the “experience of observing a good” is broader

than the mere act of buying it. Considering the good for choice, seeing its price in an advertising campaign,

or being told by a friend about it, all leave memory traces that may be recalled when shopping. Other kinds

of experiences may also leave traces in memory: rehearsal of past experiences, promises, or future goals.

These can also be included in the model, albeit with some modifications. To focus only on the consumer’s

observable history, we restrict 𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡 to comprise past choices involving good 𝑗𝑗.




2.3 Cued Recall


         Observing a stimulus cues spontaneous recall of past experiences similar to that stimulus. In our

setting, stimuli are goods in a choice set 𝑪𝑪. Because recall operates at the level of a single stimulus, in this

section we simplify notation and omit the good’s index 𝑗𝑗, with the understanding that all experiences refer

to the same good. (We reinstate this index in section 3 when we consider choice among several options.)

Denote by 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 = (𝑞𝑞𝑡𝑡 , 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 , 𝑡𝑡) the experience of seeing good 𝑗𝑗 ∈ 𝑪𝑪 at time 𝑡𝑡. This experience sets off a recall

process from that good’s memory database 𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡 that follows two principles: similarity and interference. 5 We

formalize similarity as follows.


Definition 1 (Similarity) The similarity of past experience 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 ≡ (𝑞𝑞𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 , 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 , 𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 ) in 𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡 to the current experience

𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 ≡ (𝑞𝑞𝑡𝑡 , 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 , 𝑡𝑡) of the same good 𝑗𝑗 is measured by


                                            𝑆𝑆�𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 , 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 � ≡ 𝑆𝑆��𝑞𝑞𝑡𝑡 − 𝑞𝑞𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 �, �𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 − 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 �, |𝑡𝑡 − 𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 |�,     (3)


where the function 𝑆𝑆: ℝ3+ → [0,1] decreases in each of its arguments, and 𝑆𝑆(0,0,0) = 1.



5
 The assumption that observing good 𝑗𝑗 cues recall of the same good is a reduced form of capturing semantic memory.
This assumption is also made in Norm Theory, which restricts memory-based norms to elements of the same category,
e.g. “the norm for horses should not include carriages.”
                                                                     10
          Similarity between two experiences increases if they get closer along hedonic or contextual (as

proxied by time) dimensions. The so-called “geometric approach” to similarity in (3) is standard in the

psychology and neuroscience literature on memory. Kahana (2012) proposes the metric 𝑆𝑆�𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 , 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 � =

𝑒𝑒 −𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏�𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 ,𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 � , where 𝑑𝑑�𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 , 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 � is the Euclidean distance between 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 and 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 . 6 Due to similarity along contextual

dimensions, recall can bring to mind experiences that differ from the cue along hedonic attributes. As

stressed above, this is a key feature of associative memory.


          We next describe how norms are formed by cued recall, and the role of interference in that process.

The current experience 𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 activates past experiences in the memory database 𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡 to different degrees,

depending on similarity. As in Kahneman and Miller, the norm aggregates past experiences by attaching a

larger weight to those that have higher degree of activation (i.e. the more available ones). Interference refers

to the phenomenon that past experiences that are similar to the stimulus 𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 reduce the availability of less

similar ones and thus play an outsized role in the norm.


Definition 2. The activation of a past experience 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 in 𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡 by current experience 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 is:


                                                        ℎ𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 = ℎ�𝑆𝑆�𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 , 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 � �,


where ℎ(. ): [0,1] → ℝ+ is increasing. The recalled norm is a similarity-weighted average 𝑒𝑒 𝑚𝑚 (𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 ):


                                                     𝑒𝑒 𝑚𝑚 (𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 ) = �               𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 ∗ 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 .                                (4)
                                                                          𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 ∈𝑇𝑇


                                                                                                           ℎ𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟
where the weight attached to experience 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 is its relative activation 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 = ∑                                      .
                                                                                                         𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠 ∈𝑇𝑇 ℎ𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠




6
  Here 𝜏𝜏 is a constant that maps distance to (log) similarity. This approach follows multidimensional scaling models
(Torgerson 1958). Definition 1 nests also weighted Euclidean models in which similarity decreases in the metric
                 2                   2
�𝜆𝜆𝑞𝑞 �𝑞𝑞𝑡𝑡 − 𝑞𝑞𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 � + 𝜆𝜆𝑝𝑝 �𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 − 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 � + 𝜆𝜆𝑡𝑡 (𝑡𝑡 − 𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 )2 . The weights capture the unequal importance or salience attached to
the different attributes. Tversky (1977) highlights cases in which judgments of similarity do not follow geometric
properties. He proposes a contrast model in which similarity between two experiences may not be symmetric and
depends on other experiences being considered at the same time. Such contextual factors could in principle be captured
in the above through the weights 𝜆𝜆.

                                                                     11
                 The norm 𝑒𝑒 𝑚𝑚 (𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 ) evoked by the current experience 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 satisfies two properties. First, the weight

attached to particular past experiences increases with their similarity to the current experience. Second, by

weight normalization, the weight attached to a particular past experience decreases in the similarity between

other experiences and the cue 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 . This is the interference effect.


                 Definition 2 is sufficient to obtain our results. For concreteness, in the following we consider the

                                                              𝜂𝜂
activation function ℎ �𝑆𝑆�𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 , 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 �� = 𝑆𝑆�𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 , 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 � , with 𝜂𝜂 ≥ 0. It satisfies Definition 2, and it implies that the

weight attached to good 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 is given by:

                                                                                          𝜂𝜂
                                                                         𝑆𝑆�𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 , 𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗 �
                                                         𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 =                              𝜂𝜂 ,
                                                                    ∑𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠 ∈𝑇𝑇 𝑆𝑆�𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠 , 𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗 �


In this specification, interference increases in 𝜂𝜂 in the sense that the elasticity of 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 to a marginal increase

in the similarity of any other experience 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑢𝑢 is equal to −𝜂𝜂𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡𝑢𝑢 . As 𝜂𝜂 → ∞, interference becomes so strong

that 𝑒𝑒 𝑚𝑚 (𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 ) converges to the most similar experience, namely 𝑒𝑒 𝑚𝑚 (𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 ) → argmax 𝑆𝑆�𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 , 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 �. 7


                 In Kahana’s (2012) model of probabilistic recall, past experience 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 is recalled with probability

     𝑆𝑆�𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 ,𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 �
                          , which captures relative similarity to the cue 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 . Our specification nests this model for 𝜂𝜂 = 1,
∑𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠 ∈𝑇𝑇 𝑆𝑆�𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠 ,𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 �


which means that the norm is the average good recalled by a subject sampling his memories.


                 Our approach makes some simplifying assumptions concerning the encoding of memories, and their

subsequent availability for recall. It abstracts from the possibility that events that are distinct or surprising

leave stronger traces in memory and thus can more easily be retrieved, as in the “peak-end” rule of recall

(Kahneman et al. 1993). 8 It also abstracts from mental rehearsal about experiences driving their availability


7
  Definition 1 does not nest the truncation model used by Gennaioli and Shleifer (2010), in which the 𝐾𝐾 ≥ 1 most similar
items are recalled and the |𝑇𝑇| − 𝐾𝐾 least similar experiences are forgotten. This case features a stronger version of
interference, in which the activation of 𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 falls with the similarity of other memory traces to the cue. Under mild further
conditions, our main results also hold under more general activation functions ℎ𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 = ℎ �𝑆𝑆�𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 , 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 �; �𝑆𝑆�𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠 , 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 ��      � that
                                                                                                                                  𝑠𝑠≠𝑟𝑟
nest the truncation model.
8
 It is indeed easier to recall surprising events, but this is probably not a key driving force of memory-based norms. A
meal at an extraordinary restaurant is memorable, but it does not alter our norm for restaurant meals, which is based
on recall of more ordinary restaurants. Still, this aspect can be captured in our model by assuming that activation of a
past experience 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 increases in the distance between 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 and the norm 𝑒𝑒 𝑚𝑚 �𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 � it evoked in the database 𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 available
                                                                           12
(see Mullainathan 2002). Finally, it assumes each experience is a primitive, without allowing for the

possibility that a decision maker may not notice – and thus not encode – certain attributes (Schwartzstein

2014), or that attributes may be encoded separately (Bushong and Gagnon-Bartsch 2016). Future work may

enrich the model along these lines.


          Definition 2 yields two key laws of recall, namely that it is facilitated by an experience’s recency and

by how often it was repeated in the past.


Proposition 1 (Laws of Recency and Repetition). Denote by (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ) a quality price pair experienced in the past

for good 𝑗𝑗, and by 𝑤𝑤(𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ) the total weight on all experiences of (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ). Then, 𝑤𝑤(𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ) weakly increases if:


i) the (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ) pair has been observed more recently.


ii) the (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ) pair has been observed more frequently in the past.


          The law of recency holds because recent events are very similar along the time dimension. When

time 𝑡𝑡’ at which 𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ was observed gets closer to the present, the trace (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ , 𝑡𝑡′) becomes more similar to the

current experience (𝑞𝑞𝑡𝑡 , 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 , 𝑡𝑡) along the time dimension. This facilitates the activation of 𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ , increasing its

weight in the norm. The law of repetition holds because adding multiple experiences of quality-price pair 𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂

to the memory database weakly increases the number of times it enters the norm and thus its total weight.




2.4 Norms


          We have just described how experience 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 = (𝑞𝑞𝑡𝑡 , 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 , 𝑡𝑡) evokes its norm 𝑒𝑒 𝑚𝑚 (𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 ) = �𝑞𝑞𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 , 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 , 𝑡𝑡𝑗𝑗𝑚𝑚 � by

cueing the spontaneous recall of similar experiences. In what follows, we use the expression “norm for good

(𝑞𝑞𝑡𝑡 , 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 )” as the vector of hedonic attributes (𝑞𝑞𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 , 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 ) computed according to Definition 2:


                                   𝑞𝑞𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 = �          𝑞𝑞𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 ∗ 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 ,        𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 = �          𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 ∗ 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 .
                                                𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 ∈𝑇𝑇                                 𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 ∈𝑇𝑇




at time 𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 . Formally, surprising experiences in which �𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 − 𝑒𝑒 𝑚𝑚 �𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 �� is larger would more likely be recalled for any given
subsequent experience 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 (see Bushong and Gagnon-Bartsch 2016 for a related approach).
                                                                           13
We next describe several key properties of memory-based norms.


         Consider first how the features of the consumer’s database shapes norms. Suppose that the choice

environment is stable, in the sense that the same set of goods was previously observed repeatedly. This is

the case of the first-time traveler described in Equation (1), where all experiences are of the form (𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝) and

the memory database is 𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡 ≡ (𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝, 𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 )𝑟𝑟=1,…,𝑛𝑛 . In this case, the norm for any current experience 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 consists

of the “status quo” quality and price, (𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝). When choice experiences are stable, memory-based norms yield

the “status quo” of Kahneman and Tversky (1979).


         In a changing environment, in contrast, the norm adapts. Once a different experience has entered

the database, it becomes available for recall and influences the future norm. This is not a mechanical,

backward looking convergence of norms to the past. Rather, the adaptation of norms is molded by the

current experience 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 , which cues recall of experiences that are similar to itself. Proposition 2 describes this

mechanism.


                                                            �𝑡𝑡 be a memory database at the same date obtained
Proposition 2. Let 𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡 be a memory database at 𝑡𝑡 and let 𝑀𝑀

                                                                     �𝑡𝑡 = 𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡 ∪ {𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡̂ }). For 𝜂𝜂 < ∞, we have:
by adding past experience 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡̂ = (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ , 𝑡𝑡̂) to 𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡 (namely, 𝑀𝑀


                                      �𝑡𝑡 attaches a higher weight to (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ).
i) Relative to 𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡 , the norm under 𝑀𝑀


ii) Adaptation is shaped by hedonic similarity to the cue: the weight attached to (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ) increases in the

similarity between (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ) and the hedonic attributes (𝑞𝑞𝑡𝑡 , 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 ) of the cue.


         Proposition 2 immediately implies that an important source of adaptation is the repetition effect of

Proposition 1. This is point i). The second, key source of adaptation is similarity: experience 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡̂ weighs more

on the current norm the stronger its similarity to the cue 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 . Similarity in the time dimension, which

decreases in |𝑡𝑡̂ − 𝑡𝑡|, gives rise to recency effects as in Proposition 1. Additionally, Proposition 2 highlights

the role of attribute similarity: 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡̂ weighs more on the norm cued by 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 when |𝑞𝑞 − 𝑞𝑞�| and |𝑝𝑝 − 𝑝𝑝̂ | are smaller.


         To illustrate these effects, consider the adaptation of the traveler’s price norm. In the first airport

visit, the price norm was the status quo downtown price 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 = 𝑝𝑝. In the next shopping moment 𝑡𝑡’ property

                                                               14
                                                                𝑚𝑚
i) implies that the consumer’s price norm partially adapts to 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡′ = 𝑝𝑝 + 𝑤𝑤∆. Here, 𝑤𝑤 > 0 is the weight put

on the high airport price, which is now included in memory and available for recall. Crucially, the weight 𝑤𝑤

depends on the similarity between the high airport price and the current price cue (point ii). If at 𝑡𝑡’ the

consumer visits the airport again, the price cue 𝑝𝑝 + ∆ is very similar to the past airport price, so 𝑤𝑤 is large. If

at 𝑡𝑡’ the consumer shops downtown, the price cue 𝑝𝑝 is dissimilar from the past airport price, so 𝑤𝑤 is low. As

a result, similarity triggers recall of high prices at the airport, and the recall of low prices downtown,

generating situation-specific adaptation of norms.


          In fact, selective adaptation may cause reference points to fully adapt to different environments.


Corollary 1. Suppose that after experience 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡̂ = (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ , 𝑡𝑡̂) the consumer experiences 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 = (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ , 𝑡𝑡). The norm

at 𝑡𝑡 is then fully adapted, that is, equal to the currently observed hedonic attributes (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ), provided:


i) Similarity in (𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝) is stronger than recency, 𝑆𝑆(0,0, |𝑡𝑡̂ − 𝑡𝑡|) > max 𝑆𝑆��𝑞𝑞𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 − 𝑞𝑞��, �𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 − 𝑝𝑝̂ �, |𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 − 𝑡𝑡|�, where 𝑡𝑡̂
                                                                                  𝑟𝑟

is the date of the most recent observation of (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ).


ii) Interference is maximal, 𝜂𝜂 → ∞.


          Full adaptation to a quality-price profile is a fixed point of recall whereby observing (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ) only

triggers the recall of (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ) itself. Corollary 1 highlights the conditions under which a consumer fully and

immediately adapts to such a quality-price profile, even if the profile was surprising the first time it was seen.

Two conditions are required for such extreme adaptation. First, price and quality similarity must be stronger

than recency, as in point i). In this case, the next time the consumer encounters (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ), associative recall

favors retrieval of the same past experience (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ) rather than that most recently observed. Second,

interference must be very strong, as in ii), so the most available memory (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ) crowds out all the others.


          The conditions of Corollary 1 are admittedly extreme, but they illustrate how selective adaptation

can account for Kahneman’s observation that “we are surprised only once”. With similarity-based recall,

each situation triggers a different filtering of the memory database, and pushes different memories to the

fore of consciousness. A fully adapted consumer has low prices in mind when downtown, and high prices in


                                                                  15
mind when at the airport. More broadly, even an unlikely event that is surprising the first time may look

“normal” on its second occurrence, because it triggers recall of itself. 9


        The idea that consumers may have situation-specific and well-calibrated norms about prices has

motivated the rational expectations approach to reference points (Koszegi and Rabin 2006). 10 Memory based

norms coincide with rational expectations when the consumer is adapted as in Corollary 1. Such adaptation

is even stronger if location serves as a context attribute because then being at the airport (store) already

primes the consumer to think of high (low) prices, due to location similarity. 11 Still, the stringent conditions

of Corollary 1 suggest that full adaptation is rare. If adaptation is partial, important differences arise relative

to the rational expectations predictions: cues trigger the spontaneous recall of past experiences which can

act as normatively irrelevant anchors for valuation and choice.




3. Norms, Attention and Choice


In line with Norm Theory, choice is a two-step mental process: in the first step, considered in Section 2, the

choice set cues recall of similar goods experienced in the past. In the second step, the evaluation of available

options is shaped by how surprising their attributes are perceived to be relative to the recalled norms. 12 We

model this second step using Salience Theory (BGS 2012, 2013), which describes how the comparison

between a choice option and a reference option generates surprises, shapes valuation, and drives choice.




9
  Kahneman (2003) offers an auto-biographical example of this point. Having once seen a burning car on the side of a
road, he half-expected to see it again when driving by the same spot (and might thus not be surprised if he did).
10
   Other models map reference points to rational expectations. Bell (1985) identifies reference price as the rational
expected price (see also Gul 1991). Barberis and Huang (2001) and Barberis and Xiong (2009) take a related approach
in asset pricing with respect to the expected risk free rate.
11
   With stochastic prices our model predicts that consumers can be too well adapted: faced with a price realization,
consumers recall not the expected price but rather realizations that are similar to that observed. As a result, the
consumer may adapt to each possible realization and be relatively insensitive to the expected price.
12
   While it is in principle possible to elicit memory-based norms, reference points are not directly observable. Existing
work on reference points thus tests for joint hypotheses of a model of reference points and a model of reference
dependent valuation (typically loss aversion). Here we follow the same strategy.

                                                           16
         At time 𝑡𝑡, the consumer must choose one item from a set 𝑪𝑪(𝑡𝑡) = ��𝑞𝑞𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ��                                     of 𝐽𝐽 goods
                                                                                                                      𝑗𝑗=1,...,𝐽𝐽


characterized by their (known) quality and price. We assume that each option �𝑞𝑞𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 � in the choice set acts

                                            𝑚𝑚 𝑚𝑚
as a cue, evoking the corresponding norm �𝑞𝑞𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 � from memory. In line with BGS (2012, 2013), the

consumer evaluates each good in 𝑪𝑪(𝑡𝑡) by overweighting its most salient attribute, namely the one that

                                                     𝑚𝑚 𝑚𝑚
stands out the most relative to the set of norms ��𝑞𝑞𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ��                      that is recalled. 13 Note that in this model
                                                                             𝑗𝑗=1,...,𝐽𝐽


each good is compared to all norms, not only to its own norm. This assumption captures a key feature of the

psychology of attention: attention is directed to features that are salient with respect to the entire choice

context, here captured by the set of recalled goods. Thus, if one good has a much lower price (yet similar

quality) than another, the latter will seem expensive in comparison, shaping attention and valuation. This

mechanism accounts for context effects in choice (e.g. the decoy effect), as well as Simonson and Tversky’s

(1993) “background context” effect in which past choice sets come to mind.


         The set of norms is summarized in terms of the average norm, which we refer to as the memory-

based reference point:


                                                                                   1    𝑚𝑚                     1    𝑚𝑚
                   𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀�𝑪𝑪(𝑡𝑡)� = (𝑞𝑞�𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 , 𝑝𝑝̅𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 ),   𝑤𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒   𝑞𝑞�𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 = � 𝑞𝑞𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ,        𝑝𝑝̅𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 = � 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗
                                                                                   𝐽𝐽                          𝐽𝐽
                                                                                            𝑗𝑗                   𝑗𝑗



The memory-based reference vector (𝑞𝑞�𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 , 𝑝𝑝̅𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 ) consists of the average, or normal, levels of quality and price

across all the experiences that come to mind. (𝑞𝑞�𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 , 𝑝𝑝̅𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 ) yields a ratio of quality to price that is perceived as

normal in the current choice.


         For each good (𝑞𝑞𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑡𝑡 ), the salience of quality is then 𝜎𝜎�𝑞𝑞𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , 𝑞𝑞�𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 � and that of price is 𝜎𝜎�𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , 𝑝𝑝̅𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 �,

where 𝜎𝜎 is a salience function that measures the proportional distance between attributes and their

reference levels.14 Up to normalization, option (𝑞𝑞𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ) is evaluated as:



13
   We depart from BGS (2013), which assumes that salience is defined with respect to the centroid of the union of the
choice set and the set of norms (which we called the evoked set). Our present specification, in which the reference only
consists of the centroid of norms, simplifies the analysis without changing our main results. In settings where choice set
effects matter, such as decoy effects, the original definition is necessary.

   Formally 𝜎𝜎(𝑥𝑥, 𝑦𝑦) is symmetric, homogeneous of degree zero, and increasing in the ratio 𝑥𝑥/𝑦𝑦 for 𝑥𝑥 ≥ 𝑦𝑦. These
properties imply that salience displays ordering, 𝜎𝜎(𝑥𝑥, 𝑦𝑦) > 𝜎𝜎(𝑥𝑥′, 𝑦𝑦′) for any 𝑥𝑥 > 𝑥𝑥 ′ > 𝑦𝑦 ′ > 𝑦𝑦 ≥ 0, and diminishing
                                                                    17

         The consumer chooses the good in the choice set 𝑪𝑪(𝑡𝑡) that maximizes (5). If price and quality are

equally salient for good 𝑗𝑗, 𝜎𝜎�𝑞𝑞𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , 𝑞𝑞�𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 � = 𝜎𝜎�𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , 𝑝𝑝̅𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 �, the consumer’s valuation of good 𝑗𝑗 is proportional to the

rational one, so it rationally trades off the good’s quality and price. If quality is more salient than price,

𝜎𝜎�𝑞𝑞𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , 𝑞𝑞�𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 � > 𝜎𝜎�𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , 𝑝𝑝̅𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 �, the consumer overweighs quality, and conversely if price is salient.


         Equation (5) illustrates how memory shapes valuation and choice. Selective recall, which is a function

both of the choice set and of the consumer’s history, determines the reference quality 𝑞𝑞�𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 and the reference

price 𝑝𝑝̅𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 . These memory-based references then distort valuation: for each option, disproportionate

attention is paid to the attribute that is most different, or salient, relative to the reference. 15


         To build intuition, consider the valuation of a good that presents a quality-price trade-off relative to

the reference (𝑞𝑞�𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 , 𝑝𝑝̅𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 ). The homogeneity of degree zero of the salience function then implies that the

advantage of good 𝑗𝑗 over the reference, higher quality or lower price, is salient provided


                                                                     𝑞𝑞𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 𝑞𝑞�𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚
                                                                           >        ,
                                                                     𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 𝑝𝑝̅𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚


namely, when good 𝑗𝑗 has a higher quality to price ratio then the average good recalled from memory.

Intuitively, in this case the good is perceived as a good deal, providing more quality per unit cost.


         The model generates memory-based context effects. For example, a high quality and expensive

option may look like a better deal to a consumer who has previously experienced relatively high prices. Recall

of such prices inflates the price norm 𝑝𝑝̅𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 , reducing the reference quality to price ratio. This renders the price

of the good less salient and causes the consumer to focus on its high quality. This consumer’s valuation is




sensitivity, 𝜎𝜎(𝑥𝑥, 𝑦𝑦) > 𝜎𝜎(𝑥𝑥 + 𝜖𝜖, 𝑦𝑦 + 𝜖𝜖) for any 𝑥𝑥, 𝑦𝑦, 𝜖𝜖 > 0. Ordering means that a larger price difference makes price
more salient. Diminishing sensitivity means that a given price difference is less salient at a higher price level. These
properties find considerable support in the literature on perception (see BGS 2012).
15
   In particular, because the reference (𝑞𝑞𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 , 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 ) is determined by the entire choice set, salience yields menu effects,
such as the decoy effect, whereby the introduction of a new option can change the utility ranking of two pre-existing
options. See BGS (2013) for details.
                                                                            18
thus inflated relative to that of a consumer with a lower price norm. In the next section we explore in greater

detail the patterns of choice that arise from (5).


          Before moving on, we mention two reasons for choosing salience as a model of reference dependent

choice, as opposed to loss aversion (Kahneman and Tversky 1979). First, Kahneman and Miller’s idea of

surprise does not feature an asymmetry between gains and losses: attributes can be surprising, and thus

over-weighted in judgment, when they are far from their reference in either direction (and conversely, may

not be surprising even if they are below the reference). Second, by shaping valuation through the perception

channel, salience allows for truly irrelevant alternatives to affect choice. In contrast, loss aversion, at least

in its original sense, can only be felt relative to past, expected, or aspired consumption. 16 For instance, in this

approach choice cannot be influenced by past exposure to goods that were not chosen, whereas in our model

such exposure shapes both norms and choices.




3.1. Buying Water Downtown and at the Airport


           We illustrate the model in the simplest setting in which a consumer chooses between buying water

of quality 𝑞𝑞 and the outside option (0,0) of not buying it. Water costs 𝑝𝑝 downtown and 𝑝𝑝 + ∆ at the airport.

At time 𝑡𝑡, the consumer faces the choice set 𝑪𝑪(𝑡𝑡) = {(𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 ), (0,0)}, identified by the current price of water

                                                                                                         𝑞𝑞 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚
𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 . The set of norms at time 𝑡𝑡 is {(𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 ), (0,0)}, so the reference is (𝑞𝑞�𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 , 𝑝𝑝̅𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 ) = � ,       � and,   from Equation
                                                                                                         2 2


(5), the consumer evaluates the option of buying water at time 𝑡𝑡 as:


                                                          𝑞𝑞                  𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚
                                                   𝜎𝜎 �𝑞𝑞, � ∙ 𝑞𝑞 − 𝜎𝜎 �𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 , � ∙ 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 .                                            (6)
                                                          2                    2




16
   Simonson and Tversky (1992) offer a model of the “background context” effect in which consumers are loss-averse
relative to quality-price trade-offs observed in past choices. There are other models of selective attention where the
weight of different attributes depends on the choice menu (Cunningham 2013, Koszegi and Szeidl 2013, Bushong, Rabin
and Schwartzstein 2016). These models do not allow for a role of past choices to influence attention (with the exception
of Cunningham 2013). A related phenomenon is coherent arbitrariness (Ariely, Loewenstein, Prelec 2003), in which
experimental subjects’ valuation for goods seems to be, to some extent, shaped by arbitrary anchors previously
associated with those goods.
                                                                   19
The model’s predictions are then straightforward: price and quality are equally salient if both coincide with

their normal levels (so both are proportionally equally distant from the reference levels). A good with normal

quality 𝑞𝑞 is perceived to be a bad deal, and its price is salient, if it is abnormally expensive, 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 > 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 . The

same good is perceived to be a good deal, and its quality is salient, if 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 < 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 . 17


         Consider the consumer who bought water only downtown 𝑛𝑛 times in the past. The price norm for

water is 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 = 𝑝𝑝, irrespective of the current price. We then have:


Proposition 3 Given the set of norms {(𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝), (0,0)}, the consumer:


i) behaves rationally downtown, buying water if and only if 𝑞𝑞 ≥ 𝑝𝑝.


ii) overweighs price at the airport, and buys water if and only if 𝑞𝑞 ≥ 𝜅𝜅𝑡𝑡𝑎𝑎 ∙ (𝑝𝑝 + ∆), with 𝜅𝜅𝑡𝑡𝑎𝑎 > 1.


         Downtown, the price norm and the actual price of water coincide. The consumer is fully adapted.

Price and quality are equally salient, and behavior is rational. At the airport, in contrast, the price of water is

surprisingly high relative to the price norm. Price is salient and the consumer fails to buy even when a rational

agent would. The low reference price acts as an irrelevant anchor that draws the consumer’s attention to the

current price. Thus, price is overweighed, distorting choice at the airport.


         The prediction that the consumer is reluctant to buy water on the first airport visit is not unique to

our memory based reference points. It could occur under mechanically adaptive reference points, but also

under expectations-based reference points if the consumer has no prior exposure to, or knowledge about,

airport prices (in which case the expected water price is also equal to 𝑝𝑝). Relative to these alternatives,

however, memory based reference points have distinct predictions for the consumer’s behavior after the

first airport visit. This experience changes the consumer’s memory database to the one in Equation (2).




17
    Formally, this results holds when 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 > 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 /4. The quality to price ratio logic obtains under the stronger condition
𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 > 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 /2. These conditions are satisfied whenever the consumer is fully adapted (so that 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 = 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 ), or provided the
price norm is not much higher than the observed price, which holds throughout our analysis. When 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 > 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 /2, the
available water has higher quality and price than the reference (which includes the option of not buying water). Thus,
                                                           𝑞𝑞    𝑞𝑞/2
the good is a bad deal relative to the reference, < 𝑚𝑚 , when 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 > 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 , which implies that the good’s price
                                                         𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡   𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 /2
disadvantage is salient. Conversely, the good is a good deal when 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 < 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 , which implies that its quality is salient.
                                                                20
Proposition 4. After the first airport visit at 𝑡𝑡, the consumer observes price 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡′ ∈ {𝑝𝑝, 𝑝𝑝 + ∆} at 𝑡𝑡 ′ > 𝑡𝑡. The

                     𝑚𝑚
price norm is then 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡′ = 𝑝𝑝 + 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡 (𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 ′ ) ∙ ∆, where 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡′ (𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 ′ ) is the weight placed on the first airport experience.

We then have:


i) observing 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡′ = 𝑝𝑝 + ∆ yields a higher norm than observing 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡′ = 𝑝𝑝, namely 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡′ (𝑝𝑝 + ∆) > 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡′ (𝑝𝑝) ≥ 0.

                                                                      𝑚𝑚
ii) salience of price is lower at 𝑡𝑡’ than at 𝑡𝑡, namely 𝜎𝜎(𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡′ , 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡′ /2) < 𝜎𝜎(𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡′ , 𝑝𝑝/2), for 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡′ ∈ {𝑝𝑝, 𝑝𝑝 + ∆}


The consumer overweighs quality downtown. He still overweighs price at the airport, but less than on the first

                   𝑑𝑑          𝑎𝑎           𝑑𝑑          𝑎𝑎
visit. For 𝑝𝑝 ∈ �𝑘𝑘𝑡𝑡′ ∙ 𝑞𝑞, 𝑘𝑘𝑡𝑡′ ∙ 𝑞𝑞�, 𝑘𝑘𝑡𝑡′ < 1 < 𝑘𝑘𝑡𝑡′ , the consumer buys water downtown but not at the airport.


         Because of partial adaptation, memory based reference points create choice instability. After the

first airport visit, the price norm for water – and thus its reference price – adjusts upward. As in Proposition

2, due to similarity-based recall, it adjusts more at the airport than downtown. The implications for choice

are intuitive. Downtown, the higher price norm acts as a decoy. In comparison to that experience, downtown

water seems a better deal: the reference quality price ratio drops, making the quality of downtown water

salient. At the airport, the higher price norm reduces the salience of the high price, so water seems a better

deal here too. In both locations, then, the valuation of water increases. But since adaptation is partial, price

remains salient at the airport, and the consumer might still not buy even if normatively he should.


         This mechanism of partial adaptation can provide a foundation for instances of “backward looking”

reference points in the literature. Genesove and Mayer (2001) show that home sellers set asking prices that

are tilted towards the purchase price they paid, which they suggest forms a reference price. Memory based

norms would predict something similar: not only is the purchase price very available for recall, it also crowds

out through interference prices recently observed for other houses (due to similarity along intrinsic

characteristics).      DellaVigna et al (2017) offer evidence of adaptation by recipients of unemployment

insurance, who search more intensely for jobs around dates in which UI income predictably drops, yet

eventually reduce search efforts. The authors suggest that UI recipients hold a reference point for

consumption that averages consumption levels in the recent past. This evidence also lines up with our model,



                                                                 21
which predicts that a stable history generates a status quo norm (through both recency and similarity), which

fails to fully adapt to a shock on impact, but eventually adapts when the shock persists.


        Partial adaptation cannot be accounted for when reference points are given by rational expectations.

Suppose that the consumer learns that airport prices are higher during his first visit. His norm for airport

prices would then quickly converge to 𝑝𝑝 + ∆, and his reference point at the airport would become entirely

independent of his own history. This consumer is no longer surprised at either location, and his price

sensitivity should be the same in both locations, contrary to point ii). Likewise, mechanically adaptive

reference points do not account for situation-specific adaptation (point i), because they predict that history

(including the first airport visit) should influence the reference price equally at all locations. This model would

predict that price sensitivity is always higher at the airport. In our model, in contrast, as consumers become

better adapted to both downtown and airport prices, price norms converge to actual prices in both locations.

When this occurs, choice behavior is stable in each location.


        To see this logic, consider the long run behavior of a consumer who spends most of his time

downtown but periodically visits the airport. To capture the relative infrequency of airport trips, suppose

that the consumer visits the airport every 𝜏𝜏𝑎𝑎 periods, while he buys water downtown every 𝜏𝜏𝑑𝑑 periods, with

𝜏𝜏𝑎𝑎 > 𝜏𝜏𝑑𝑑 . We further assume that airport visits occur exactly in between two consecutive downtown shopping

experiences. Adaptation to price in one location is interfered with by memories of the other location, which

are stronger if experienced more recently. Thus, when shopping downtown, memories of airport prices are

most available when the consumer just came back from the airport, with similarity 𝑆𝑆(0, 𝛥𝛥, 𝜏𝜏𝑑𝑑 /2), while

memories of downtown prices have maximum similarity 𝑆𝑆(0,0, 𝜏𝜏𝑑𝑑 ). Conversely, when shopping at the

airport, the most available downtown prices have similarity 𝑆𝑆(0, 𝛥𝛥, 𝜏𝜏𝑑𝑑 /2), while memories of airport prices

have maximum similarity 𝑆𝑆(0,0, 𝜏𝜏𝑎𝑎 ) < 𝑆𝑆(0,0, 𝜏𝜏𝑑𝑑 ).


        The following result shows that the level of adaptation depends on the strength of similarity along

hedonic dimensions relative to that of contextual dimensions (i.e. time).




                                                           22
Proposition 5. Suppose that 𝜂𝜂 → ∞ so that the norm is the experience most similar to the cue. Suppose

further that 𝑆𝑆(0,0, 𝜏𝜏𝑑𝑑 ) > 𝑆𝑆(0, 𝛥𝛥, 𝜏𝜏𝑑𝑑 /2), so that the price norm downtown is 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 (𝑝𝑝) = 𝑝𝑝. Then quality and

price are equally salient downtown, and valuation is proportional to 𝑞𝑞 − 𝑝𝑝 regardless of recent experiences.

Behavior at the airport can be in one of two regimes:


i) If airport visits are frequent enough, 𝑆𝑆(0,0, 𝜏𝜏𝑎𝑎 ) > 𝑆𝑆(0, 𝛥𝛥, 𝜏𝜏𝑑𝑑 /2), the price norm fully adapts 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 (𝑝𝑝 + ∆) =

𝑝𝑝 + ∆. Valuation is proportional to 𝑞𝑞 − 𝑝𝑝 − ∆, with the same price sensitivity as downtown.


ii) If airport visits are infrequent, 𝑆𝑆(0,0, 𝜏𝜏𝑎𝑎 ) < 𝑆𝑆(0, 𝛥𝛥, 𝜏𝜏𝑑𝑑 /2), the price norm does not adapt 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 (𝑝𝑝 + ∆) = 𝑝𝑝.

The consumer is always surprised by the airport price and is more price sensitive there.


         Proposition 5 highlights the conditions for full adaptation of reference points in the long run. If the

consumer shops downtown frequently enough, he has a fully adjusted low reference price there – even if he

just came back from the airport. In this case, valuation downtown is stable and independent of the last

observed price. In this simple choice of whether to buy water, full adaptation means rational choice.


         Full price adaptation to the airport requires that price similarity beats recency effects in recall, and

thus only obtains when airport experiences are frequent enough, i.e. 𝜏𝜏𝑎𝑎 low enough. In this case, the

reference price is 𝑝𝑝 + ∆ at the airport and 𝑝𝑝 downtown, so memory based reference points resemble

expectations-based reference points. 18 Conversely, if airport visits are infrequent, then recency effects are

strong enough that the downtown price enters the price norm at the airport. Even though the consumer has

visited the airport many times, and is perfectly aware that airport prices are high, he is still surprised by them

because downtown price repeatedly acts as an irrelevant anchor.




18
  Under full adaptation, the consumer behaves rationally in both locations in this setting. This strong result is due to
two special assumptions: the choice is between buying water or nothing, and salience is homogeneous of degree zero.
Under more general conditions, salience distortions affect even a fully adapted consumer. To see this, consider a choice
between two goods, say a cheap wine and an expensive wine. The price difference between the two wines is constant,
but their price level is higher at the restaurant than at the store. As we show in BGS (2013), diminishing sensitivity of
salience implies that a fully adapted consumer finds the given price difference less salient at the high restaurant prices.
As a result, he displays lower price sensitivity at the restaurant than at the store. This consumer deviates from rationality
in that his focus on price, and thus his choice, is not consistent across situations. However, even in this case full
adaptation implies strong choice consistency within situation: the price sensitivity of the consumer is the same at the
store and at the restaurant regardless of the consumer’s recent past.
                                                             23
           Thaler (1985) illustrates the role of adaptation of norms in a choice setting. A beachgoer offers his

companion to buy beer from a nearby establishment, and asks for his willingness to pay. In contrast to the

predictions of the rational model, people state higher a willingness to pay for beer that comes from a nearby

resort than for one that comes from a nearby store, even though the final consumption experience, beer on

the beach, is exactly the same. Thaler suggests that the location (resort vs store) acts as a cue that brings to

mind the past prices experienced in similar locations. In this setup, Proposition 5 suggests that, if the

beachgoer rarely visits resorts, the frequently encountered store prices come to mind even when asked

about the resort. His adaptation is only partial and he may refuse to buy beer at the resort price.19 The more

often the beachgoer visits resorts, the more his norm is shaped by resort prices, and the more he is willing

to pay at the resort – while all along having a low price norm (and low willingness to pay) at the store.


           In sum, our model produces stability in preferences (full adaptation) under much broader

circumstances than mechanically adaptive models, but also identifies conditions in which consumers are

systematically surprised by prices, despite being familiar with them (partial adaptation). In this sense, our

predictions provide a middle-ground between those of mechanically adaptive and rational expectations

based reference points. This middle-ground is a direct reflection of the fundamental properties of associative

memory on which our model is based. First, and in contrast to both of the other approaches, reference

points are generated ex post, by a spontaneous recall process. Second, recall is shaped by attribute similarity

and by context (e.g., time) similarity. While the latter fosters adaptation to the recent past, the former fosters

adaptation to the present. By incorporating fundamental mechanisms of memory, our model can shed light

on diverse evidence that motivated several of the previous approaches.




4. An application to the housing rental market


           Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) on U.S. households, Simonsohn and

Loewenstein (2006) present two key findings. First, movers to a given U.S. city pay, on arrival, rent levels


19
     In section 4, we derive the properties of willingness to pay, and show it is increasing in the recalled price norm.
                                                              24
that are closer to those in the city of origin, when compared to otherwise identical households. The rent paid

on arrival increases with rent levels in the city of origin, controlling for income, family size, and other

observables. Second, households that subsequently move again within their destination city make rental

choices that are no longer shaped by prices in the city of origin. SL argue, verbally, that their findings require

a departure from rationality in which choice is anchored to recently experienced price levels.


        The combination of memory based reference points and salience can account for these findings, and

yields two additional predictions. First, city of origin price should exert a smaller effect on rental choice for

movers who have previously lived in a city with housing prices similar to destination city prices (just like past

airport visits help the consumer adapt to airport prices). Second, by diminishing sensitivity of salience, the

influence of city of origin prices should be stronger for households moving to cheaper cities. This last

prediction highlights a distinctive property of the salience model due to the logic of decoy effects. The

expensive rents recalled from the city of origin act as decoys in the cheaper destination city, making even

relatively expensive apartments in the latter look like a good deal. We next formalize this setting in our model

(Section 4.1) and then we take the predictions to the data (Section 4.2).




4.1 Willingness to pay rent


        The cleanest way to measure price salience effects would be to take two otherwise identical movers

to the same city who have previously lived in different cities, and compare the rent they now pay for

apartments of identical quality. This comparison is possible, despite quality being fixed, because prices faced

by different households may differ due to market search or bargaining. Renters coming from expensive cities

would have higher price norms, and be less price elastic. As a consequence, they would end up paying higher

rents for the same quality, generating Simonsohn and Loewenstein’s finding in a very stylized setting.


        To formalize these ideas, we study the willingness to pay rent by a salient thinker with a memory-

based reference rent for an apartment of given quality 𝑞𝑞. The idea is that the salient thinker receives offers

drawn from the city’s price distribution for apartment quality 𝑞𝑞 and accepts rental prices below his

                                                       25
willingness to pay. By shaping willingness to pay, the memory-based reference rent shapes the average rent

paid by the household for quality 𝑞𝑞 (which is the object of our empirical analysis).


        One objection to this approach is that renters do not choose whether a certain price is acceptable

for a given quality 𝑞𝑞. Rather, they face a choice set in which better apartments are more expensive, and they

choose housing by trading off quality and price. To deal with this concern, we control in our regressions for

several proxies for quality. To the extent that these proxies capture a large share of actual quality differences,

our analysis can be viewed as approximating the ideal experiment of eliciting willingness to pay. It is possible

to study a version of the model with a quality-price tradeoff, but that would complicate the analysis without

producing predictions that are substantially different from those that we test.


        Consider then the following setting. Apartments are of given known quality 𝑞𝑞. Faced with the choice

between renting at price 𝑝𝑝 and not renting, 𝑪𝑪 ≡ {(𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝), (0,0)}, the consumer recalls the evoked set 𝑪𝑪𝑒𝑒 =

{(𝑞𝑞 𝑚𝑚 , 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 ), (0,0)}, where 𝑞𝑞 𝑚𝑚 , 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 are the memory-based reference quality and price. All housing has the

same quality 𝑞𝑞, so that 𝑞𝑞 𝑚𝑚 = 𝑞𝑞. The salient thinker’s 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 for an apartment is then defined as:


                                                              𝑞𝑞               𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚
                             𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊(𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 ) = sup𝑝𝑝 𝜎𝜎 �𝑞𝑞, � ∙ 𝑞𝑞 − 𝜎𝜎 �𝑝𝑝, � ∙ 𝑝𝑝 > 0.                      (8)
                                                              2                 2


Going forward, we assume the functional form:

                                                                      |𝑥𝑥−𝑦𝑦|
                                                                (1−𝛿𝛿)
                                              𝜎𝜎(𝑥𝑥, 𝑦𝑦) = 𝑒𝑒          𝑥𝑥+𝑦𝑦 ,



which yields convenient linear-regression expressions for the model’s predictions. For a rational consumer

(𝛿𝛿 = 1), 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊(𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 ) = 𝑞𝑞, which is independent of past rental experience. For salient thinkers, willingness

to pay is generically different from 𝑞𝑞, a result that should be unsurprising given the analysis in Section 3.


        As we show in the Appendix, willingness to pay has two key properties. First, it increases in the

reference price (i.e. 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊(𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 ) increases in 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 ). This follows from the ordering property of salience, and

the associated decoy logic of Proposition 3: a high reference 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 acts as a decoy for the actual rent, rendering




                                                          26
it less salient. This effect increases willingness to pay for 𝑞𝑞. 20 Second, willingness to pay is concave in the

reference price (i.e., 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊(𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 ) − 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊(𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 − ∆) is larger than 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊(𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 + ∆) − 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊(𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 )). This

effect is due to the diminishing sensitivity property of salience. A given price difference is more salient at

lower price levels. Thus, the effect of city of origin prices on WTP should be stronger at lower price levels. 21


           To map the results on willingness to pay 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊(𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 ) to the data on movers, we write a mover’s

reference price 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 in terms of the rent levels in his destination city, 𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 , and in his city of origin, 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 ,


                                                          𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 = 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 + 𝑤𝑤(𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 )(𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 − 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 ),                                               (9)


where 𝑤𝑤(𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 ) is the weight that the norm puts on current prices 𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 relative to city of origin prices 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 . Note

that we take the price cue to be the average price observed in the destination city and memory retrieval to

occur with respect to average price levels observed in other cities in the past. This simplifies the model

without altering its predictions on the behavior of the average mover. Our predictions for movers’ behavior

build on comparative statics of their rent norms, i.e. of 𝑤𝑤(𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 ), as a function of personal histories.


             To derive testable implications, we log-linearize willingness to pay 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊(𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 ) by taking into

account the Equation (9) for the normal price. We find the following result.


Proposition 6. Under a log-linear approximation around the norm 𝑝𝑝0𝑚𝑚 = 𝑞𝑞, 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊(𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 ) satisfies:


                                                     𝜎𝜎                         2𝜎𝜎′                            2𝜎𝜎′

                                                 𝜎𝜎 + 2𝜎𝜎′                   𝜎𝜎 + 2𝜎𝜎′                       𝜎𝜎 + 2𝜎𝜎′

where 𝜎𝜎 = 𝜎𝜎(2,1), 𝜎𝜎 ′ = 𝜎𝜎 ′ (2,1), and 𝜎𝜎 ′ > 0 if and only if 𝛿𝛿 < 1.




                                                                                                                   2𝜎𝜎(2,1)
 This property holds for any 𝜎𝜎(𝑥𝑥, 𝑦𝑦) provided 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 is not much higher than 𝑞𝑞 (i.e, 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 < 𝑞𝑞 ∙

                                                                                                                              ), which ensures that
                                                                                                                    𝜎𝜎(1,1)

  Consider two households which recently experienced a rent level of 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 = $2000 and which move to cities with rents
levels of $1000 and $3000, respectively. The mover to the expensive city finds the higher price salient, but only
moderately so. The mover to the cheap city, on the other hand, perceives a large price decline. The same $1000 rental
difference looms larger in the context of the cheap city price than in the context of the high expensive city price. This
property requires the salience function not to be too concave, 2𝜎𝜎 ′ (𝑥𝑥, 1) + 𝑥𝑥 ∙ 𝜎𝜎 ′′ (𝑥𝑥, 1) > 0 for 𝑥𝑥 > 1, which holds for
the salience function above and for the salience functions considered in BGS (2012 and 2013).
                                                                              27
By inspecting Equation (10), one can gauge the predictions of our model, which we bring to the data. All of

these predictions obtain when holding constant the quality 𝑞𝑞 of the apartment.


Prediction 1: Backward looking reference / Anchoring. On average, the rent paid after moving to the

destination city increases in the rent level in the city of origin.


        For any 𝑤𝑤(𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 ) < 1, WTP increases with rental levels in the city of origin 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 , as documented in SL

(2006). Indeed, higher 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 increases the reference price and willingness to pay.


Prediction 2: Adaptation through recency. On average, if the household moves again in the destination city,

the rent paid after this second move does not depend on city of origin price.


        Because the second time mover has experienced prices 𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 for a while, he is better adapted to the

destination city, i.e. has a larger 𝑤𝑤(𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 ). Under full adaptation, 𝑤𝑤(𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 ) = 1, the mover’s rental expenditure

no longer depends on the price of the city of origin (𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 drops out of Equation (10)).


        Predictions 1 and 2 were both tested in SL (2006). The following predictions are new.


Prediction 3: Adaptation through similarity. Price in city of origin has a smaller effect on rent paid in the

destination city for movers who had previously lived in cities with prices similar to 𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 .


        Recall by price similarity causes movers previously exposed to price 𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 to be better adapted to the

destination city than movers who have never experienced such a price. Formally, they have a larger 𝑤𝑤(𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 ).

As a consequence, their expenditure is less anchored on 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 . Estimating Equation (10) for such movers thus

yields a smaller coefficient on 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 than for the full population of movers (i.e., in Prediction 1).


        The last prediction of our model follows from concavity of 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊(𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 ). This prediction, which is

proved in the Appendix, cannot be directly seen from the linearized Equation (10).


Prediction 4: Asymmetry. Price in city of origin has a stronger effect on rent paid for movers to cheaper cities

than for movers to more expensive cities.




                                                          28
         Formally, the coefficient on city of origin price (i.e., on 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 ), should be higher for movers to cheaper

cities than for movers to more expensive cities. While not a formal test of salience versus loss aversion (which

would predict a strong reaction to price increases), this last prediction highlights a distinctive decoy effect

property of the salience mechanism: raising the reference price makes high observed prices less salient,

raising the good’s valuation.




4.2 Empirical Tests


         We use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), a longitudinal yearly survey on a

representative sample of U.S. families that also collects information on demographics and housing history

over time. PSID data on housing history is now available from 1983 to 2013, roughly tripling the SL sample

(1983-1993). 22 We supplement this data with historical data on median rents at the county level from the

Fair Market Rents Dataset. 23 Like SL, we focus our analysis at the level of Metropolitan Statistical Areas

(MSAs), so we use the terms city and MSA interchangeably. Median rents are aggregated to MSA level using

population weights and all prices are converted to 1999 dollars.


         We now describe the empirical strategy that we use to test predictions 1 to 4. Our analysis follows

closely Simonsohn and Loewenstein’s test of prediction 1. In implementing Equation (10), an observation is

a household 𝑖𝑖 who moves in survey year 𝑡𝑡 and is a renter after the move. We use a household’s post-move

rent at year 𝑡𝑡, denoted 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , as a proxy for their unobserved 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 . 24 We then run regressions of the form:


                                 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽𝑜𝑜 ∙ 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜,𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽𝑑𝑑 ∙ 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑,𝑡𝑡 + 𝜷𝜷𝑿𝑿 ∙ 𝑿𝑿𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡    (11)




22
   The analysis uses data from PSID’s Sensitive Data Files. We obtained access to this data under special contractual
arrangements designed to protect the anonymity of respondents. PSID data is not available from the authors. PSID did
not collect data on rent paid during the years 1988 and 1999, so these years are excluded from the analysis. We further
trim the data in line with SL, and in particular focus on households observed for at least five survey waves and who
move cities at least once. See Appendix B for details, and for differences in our approach and SL.
23
   Fair Market Rents data are available from the U.S. Department Housing and Urban Development (HUD),
https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr.html.
24
   While 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 is a lower bound for 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖 , this discrepancy should not systematically distort the predicted correlation with
past prices (and conversely, it does not generate a spurious correlation with past prices in the rational benchmark).
                                                                        29
Prices 𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜,𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 and 𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑,𝑡𝑡 denote the median rents in the household’s city of origin and in the city of destination,

respectively. Importantly, while rent levels in the current city are measured in the year of the move, 𝑡𝑡, rent

levels in the city of origin are measured the last year the household lived there. Relative to Equation (10),

                                                                                     2𝜎𝜎′                      2𝜎𝜎′
the estimated parameters on rental prices correspond to 𝛽𝛽𝑜𝑜 = �1 − 𝑤𝑤(𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 )� 𝜎𝜎+2𝜎𝜎′ and 𝛽𝛽𝑑𝑑 = 𝑤𝑤(𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 ) 𝜎𝜎+2𝜎𝜎′.


        To estimate equation (11), we need to address two related econometric concerns. First, in our

analysis apartment quality must be held constant.             Second, we must address heterogeneity among

households. Movers may be systematically different from stayers in several ways, including in their taste for

housing, and these differences – not price experience per se – may be responsible for their different behavior.

We address these concerns in the same way SL do. To control for housing quality, as well as for sources of

household heterogeneity, we include in our regressions all standard variables that are used in regressions for

housing demand and that are available in the PSID: household income, family composition, and age and

education of head of household. We further account for unobserved differences across households by using

information on households’ previous choices. In particular, we control for whether the household previously

rented or owned, as well as for a measure of relative taste for housing, namely the ratio 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 /𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜,𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 of their

rent expenditure to the median rent in the city of origin for past renters, and the analogous ratio in terms of

house prices for past owners. Finally, we also include year fixed effects and a Heckman correction to account

for the fact that, when households move, they endogenously select into renting, as opposed to buying. These

controls help mitigate concerns about the selection of movers.


        We test predictions 1 to 4 by estimating the regression (10) in the appropriate samples, which we

now describe in detail. We test prediction 1 on backward looking reference points by using all observations

of households in the year they move across cities. To test prediction 2 on adaptation through recency we

consider households whom we observe moving within a city after having moved across cities. To test

prediction 3 on adaptation through price-similarity, we focus on movers for whom we observe two moves

across three cities. Because our prediction focuses on the second move, we refer to these cities as “earlier

city”, city of origin, and destination city. We measure price similarity between the earlier city and destination

city by the absolute difference in median rent |𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 − 𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 |. We then divide these movers into households
                                                       30
for whom price similarity between destination and earlier cities is higher or lower than the median in this

sample, and run the regression separately for each group. Finally, we test prediction 4 on asymmetry by

dividing the baseline sample (used in Prediction 1) into those households who moved to more expensive

versus cheaper cities.


        Table I presents descriptive statistics of our samples’ demographics, measured the year prior to their

move. The samples are comparable in these dimensions. Households are equally likely to move “up” (to more

expensive cities) as to move “down” (to cheaper cities), and face significant changes in rent levels ($152.6 on

average, with $156.8 if moving up and $148.9 if moving down).

Table II presents the results. The estimates show the expected positive relation between rent paid and

income, family size and local price levels. Intuitively, richer and larger households are likely to rent

apartments of higher quality (e.g., larger ones). Focusing on the regressor of interest, 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 ), the results

support predictions 1 and 2, and quantitatively confirm the results of SL (2006) in our larger dataset. In the

baseline case (column 1), the coefficient 𝛽𝛽𝑜𝑜 on 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 ) is significantly positive and similar in magnitude to

SL’s: two otherwise identical individuals whose 𝑝𝑝0 differs by one standard deviation differ in their rental

expenditures in the same city by 3.4%. Prediction 2 also finds empirical support: when households move

again within the same city (column 2), past city prices are no longer relevant. However, with the smaller

sample size, we cannot conclude that this coefficient is significantly different from the baseline case.

p<0.01, *** p<0.001.



         To test prediction 3, we restrict the sample to households that move twice (columns 3 and 4).

Consistent with our prediction, when movers have experienced price levels in the past that are similar to

current ones (column 4), the influence of city of origin price 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜 ) on rental expenditure in the destination

city is insignificant. When movers have instead not experienced similar prices in the past (column 3), the

effect of past prices is larger, and statistically significant. Again, given the small sample, the coefficients are

not significantly different from each other.


         Finally, in line with prediction 4, the anchoring of rents paid to past prices is driven almost entirely

by households that move to cheaper cities, and rent more expensive apartments than locals do (columns 5

and 6). Past prices matter much less when otherwise similar households move to more expensive cities. The

𝛽𝛽𝑜𝑜 coefficients are different across the two samples at the 5% significance level. 25

  The results of Table II are robust to different choices of specification (not shown). Controlling for endogenous selection
into renting or for taste for housing, or excluding households who move for housing related reasons, plays essentially
no role. Restricting the sample to households who rented before the move has little effect, except for prediction 3:
while the results remain directionally consistent, the effect on households who experienced dissimilar prices is no longer
significant, perhaps due to the much smaller sample size. Simonsohn and Loewenstein (2006) test a version of Prediction
4 to address concerns about learning, and find no asymmetry in their shorter sample.

               The point estimates of Table II allow us to back out the weights in Equation (11). Using the fact that

                            2𝜎𝜎′                          2𝜎𝜎′                           2𝜎𝜎′
𝛽𝛽𝑜𝑜 = �1 − 𝑤𝑤(𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 )�           ,   𝛽𝛽𝑑𝑑 = 𝑤𝑤(𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 )          ,   and 𝛽𝛽𝑜𝑜 + 𝛽𝛽𝑑𝑑 =             we can back out, for each regression
                          𝜎𝜎+2𝜎𝜎′                       𝜎𝜎+2𝜎𝜎′                        𝜎𝜎+2𝜎𝜎′

specification, the weight attached by the memory-based rent norm to city of destination price as 𝑤𝑤(𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 ) =

   𝛽𝛽𝑑𝑑
𝛽𝛽𝑜𝑜 +𝛽𝛽𝑑𝑑
           .   The baseline estimates of column 1 imply 𝑤𝑤(𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 ) = 0.754, which is an average of the memory weight

of different movers across different histories. 26 On the other hand, the point estimates from columns 2 and

4 of Table II allow us to assess the mechanisms for adaptation. These estimates respectively imply 𝑤𝑤(𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 ) =

0.890 and 𝑤𝑤(𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 ) = 0.773. Adaptation to current prices is stronger for movers who have spent time in the

new city, or who have lived in similar cities in the past. The fact that the weight attached to city of destination

price is higher for the former type of movers suggests that in our sample recency effects are stronger than

price similarity effects. On the other hand, price similarity effects are sufficiently strong to generate

significant patterns in the data. From column 3, movers who spent time in dissimilar cities are less adapted

𝑤𝑤(𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 )𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = 0.739 < 𝑤𝑤(𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 ) = 0.890.


                To conclude, the evidence is consistent with the predictions of the model. Memory-based reference

points provide a rationale for anchoring to recent rent levels (predictions 1 and 2), which were documented

by SL, and also in Simonsohn (2006). Adaptation based on price similarity (Prediction 3) is a more nuanced

prediction, and the evidence is statistically weaker but consistent with this prediction as well. Prediction 4

allows for a test of reference-dependent valuation, and again we find some support. The broader message is

that our model generates novel predictions that can be tested using heterogeneous consumer experiences.




5. Conclusion

               In this paper, we tried to make four contributions. First, we showed that one can incorporate a

biologically founded, textbook model of memory (Kahana 2012) into an economic model of choice. The




26                                                                                     2𝜎𝜎′
     We could also try to estimate 𝛿𝛿 through the equality 𝛽𝛽𝑜𝑜 + 𝛽𝛽𝑑𝑑 =                      . However, the different average rental prices
                                                                                   𝜎𝜎+2𝜎𝜎′
                                                                         2𝜎𝜎′
in different subsamples generates variation of salience         across these subsample, making it more difficult to back
                                                        𝜎𝜎+2𝜎𝜎′
up parameter 𝛿𝛿 > 0 without adjusting for these different price levels.
                                                                          33
critical feature of this model – recall through similarity – yields many predictions on what comes to mind

when decision makers face a stimulus, which have been extensively tested and confirmed in memory

research but which also have multiple implications for economic analysis.


        Second, we showed that this standard theory of recall naturally leads to a theory of memory based

reference points. Due to the central role of similarity in recall, these reference points can often incorporate

normatively irrelevant features, and through this channel lead to unstable and apparently irrational choice.

But we showed that the same standard features of memory that explain irrelevant anchors lead to eventual

adaptation of reference points that makes them situation-specific, and thereby creates the stability (and even

rationality) of choice that is often observed. This approach to reference points can account both for some of

the evidence on backward looking reference points, and some of the situations where reference points look

like rational expectations.


        Third, we combined the theory of memory based reference points with the salience theory of choice,

which is a natural way to incorporate the notions of surprise, and over-reaction to surprise, into the theory

of choice. Surprise relative to norms is critical to Kahneman and Miller’s theory, and it emerges naturally

from a combination of a textbook model of memory and salience theory.


        Finally, we took the predictions to the data on movers between US cities, extending the work of

Simonsohn and Loewenstein (2006). Our model predicts their basic findings, which we replicate with 20

additional years of data, but also yields additional predictions, for which we also find some support. Critically,

these predictions come in part from our theory of choice, but also from the basic model of memory that we

rely on throughout our analysis.


        Throughout this paper, we have made a number of specific modeling choices for clarity, many of

which can be revisited or relaxed. There are several missing aspects in the basic model of memory, such as

the importance of salient memories, the inattention to some aspects of the initial stimulus that may influence

recall (Schwartzstein 2014), or even the failure of initial encoding of some experiences. In addition, with

some modifications, our model can perhaps also incorporate recall of other types of information from

                                                       34
memory, such as goals or information about future events. In this sense, it may help to think about

expectations as reference points, and in particular when expectations (as opposed to other information) are

top of mind. In fact, we would argue that even the rational inattention approach (Sims 2003, Gabaix 2014)

needs a theory of where the inputs into a decision not to pay attention come from, and recall of past

conditions is likely to shape these inputs. We would also argue that phenomena involving the construction

of preference such as projection bias, attribution bias, or the influence of past experiences on choice are all

centrally related to memory. In this sense, portable textbook models of memory offer an opportunity to

complete many different behavioral models and to improve their empirical testability.

Appendix A. Proofs



Proposition 1. Let 𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗 be the set of time-stamps of all past experiences of good 𝑗𝑗 in the memory database 𝑀𝑀𝑗𝑗 ,

and let 𝑇𝑇(𝑞𝑞�,𝑝𝑝�) = {𝑡𝑡: 𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ , 𝑡𝑡)} ⊂ 𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗 index past experiences of (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ). Then, the weight 𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ) is


                                                                                                     ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗
                                                           𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ) = �
                                                                                               ∑𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠 ∈𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗 ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠
                                                                                𝑡𝑡∈𝑇𝑇(𝑞𝑞�,𝑝𝑝
                                                                                          �)




The weights ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 assigned to individual experiences increase in their recency. It then follows from Property 2

of Definition 1 that 𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ) weakly increases if some or all experiences in 𝑇𝑇(𝑞𝑞�,𝑝𝑝�) become more recent. This

proves point i.


          Consider now changes in frequency of (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ) experiences, i.e. in the cardinality of 𝑇𝑇(𝑞𝑞�,𝑝𝑝�) (point ii).

Suppose an additional experience (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ) occurs at 𝑡𝑡′, so that the new time-index set of such experiences

becomes 𝑇𝑇(𝑞𝑞�,𝑝𝑝�) ∪ {𝑡𝑡′} . Then, the weight on (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ) increases provided


                                              ∑𝑇𝑇(𝑞𝑞�,𝑝𝑝�)∪{𝑡𝑡 ′ } ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗                                     ∑𝑇𝑇(𝑞𝑞�,𝑝𝑝�) ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗
                                                                                         >                                                   .
                                 ∑𝑇𝑇(𝑞𝑞�,𝑝𝑝�) ∪{𝑡𝑡 ′ } ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + ∑𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗/𝑇𝑇(𝑞𝑞�,𝑝𝑝�) ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗       ∑𝑇𝑇(𝑞𝑞�,𝑝𝑝�) ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + ∑𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗 /𝑇𝑇(𝑞𝑞�,𝑝𝑝�) ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗


                                                                                   38
This condition holds because ∑𝑇𝑇(𝑞𝑞�,𝑝𝑝�) ∪{𝑡𝑡 ′ } ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 > ∑𝑇𝑇(𝑞𝑞�,𝑝𝑝�) ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ∎




Proposition 2. As in Proposition 1, the weight on experience (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ) given past experiences 𝑇𝑇(𝑞𝑞�,𝑝𝑝�) is given by


                                                                                                 ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗
                                                       𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ) = �
                                                                                           ∑𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠 ∈𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗 ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠
                                                                            𝑡𝑡∈𝑇𝑇(𝑞𝑞�,𝑝𝑝
                                                                                      �)




From Proposition 1, point ii, the weight 𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ) increases under the operation 𝑇𝑇(𝑞𝑞�,𝑝𝑝�) → 𝑇𝑇�(𝑞𝑞�,𝑝𝑝�) = 𝑇𝑇(𝑞𝑞�,𝑝𝑝�) ∪ {𝑡𝑡̂}.

                                                                                                                    �𝑗𝑗 than by
      �𝑗𝑗 (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ) > 𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ), i.e. more weight is put on (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ) by the norm under memory database 𝑀𝑀
Thus, 𝑤𝑤

the norm under 𝑀𝑀𝑗𝑗 .


                                           �𝑗𝑗 (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ) increases with the similarity between (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ) and the cue
           Point ii states that the weight 𝑤𝑤

(𝑞𝑞𝑡𝑡 , 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 ) is high. We have:


                                                                                  ∑𝑡𝑡∈𝑇𝑇�(𝑞𝑞�,𝑝𝑝�) ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗
                                               �𝑗𝑗 (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ) =
                                               𝑤𝑤
                                                                   ∑𝑡𝑡∈𝑇𝑇�(𝑞𝑞�,𝑝𝑝�) ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + ∑𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠 ∉𝑇𝑇�(𝑞𝑞�,𝑝𝑝�) ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠


which increases both in the frequency of exposure to (𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ) (by Proposition 1, point i) and in the similarity of

(𝑞𝑞�, 𝑝𝑝̂ ) to (𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝) (since the term ∑𝑡𝑡∈𝑇𝑇�(𝑞𝑞�,𝑝𝑝�) ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 increases while ∑𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠 ∉𝑇𝑇�(𝑞𝑞�,𝑝𝑝�) ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠 stays fixed). ∎

𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 = 0 otherwise. To see this, recall that under the ratio model the weights equal 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 =                                                        𝜂𝜂   , and

we have 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡′ = 1. ∎

Proposition 4. Note first that, if 𝜂𝜂 < ∞, then at time 𝑡𝑡’ > 𝑡𝑡 the reference price 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 (𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡′ ) ∈ (𝑝𝑝, 𝑝𝑝 + ∆), for

𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡′ ∈ {𝑝𝑝, 𝑝𝑝 + ∆}. In particular, we have 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡 (𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 ′ ) > 0 and 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡𝑛𝑛 (𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 ′ ) > 0 for either price realization (i.e. some

positive weight is assigned to all past experiences). Moreover, 1 > 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡 (𝑝𝑝 + ∆) > 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡 (𝑝𝑝) because the recent

airport price is more similar along the price dimension (and equally recent) to the current airport price,

proving point i.


         Because 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡 (𝑝𝑝 + ∆) < 1, the salience of price at the airport satisfies:


                                           𝑝𝑝 + 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡 (𝑝𝑝 + ∆)∆                𝑝𝑝 + ∆        1        𝑞𝑞 1
                             𝜎𝜎 �𝑝𝑝 + ∆,                       � = 𝜎𝜎 �                    , � > 𝜎𝜎 � , �

where the inequality follows from the ordering of the salience function. So price is still salient at the airport,

though less so than at time 𝑡𝑡:



                                                                         40
                                                                          𝑝𝑝 + ∆        1        𝑝𝑝 + ∆ 1

Downtown, we have that salience of price satisfies:

a normalization factor of 𝜎𝜎(2,1)). This proves point ii. In particular, valuation is stable in that it does not

depend on the recently observed prices, proving point i. ∎




Proposition 6. We start by documenting some general properties of willingness to pay (WTP) in our model.

Note that 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊(𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 ) is the largest solution 𝑝𝑝 to the following equation:

The right hand side is increasing in 𝑝𝑝 for 𝑝𝑝 >              .   As a consequence, a sufficient condition for the solution to

assume this condition going forward. 27 It then follows that 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊(𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 ) >                             .
                                                                                                         2


              First, 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊(𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 ) = 𝑞𝑞 if and only if the reference price is 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 = 𝑞𝑞 (it follows from the above that

this property is fully generic).

                                                                                                                 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚                         𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚
              Second, 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊(𝑞𝑞, 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 ) is increasing in 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 . Intuitively, for a given price 𝑝𝑝 >               2
                                                                                                                      ,   the term 𝜎𝜎 �𝑝𝑝,     2
                                                                                                                                                   � 𝑝𝑝

                                                                                                   𝑞𝑞            𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚
decreases in 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 , thus raising willingness to pay. Formally, define 𝑞𝑞� = and 𝑝𝑝̅ =                                     , as well as 𝑥𝑥 ≡ 𝑝𝑝/𝑝𝑝̅ .
                                                                           2,                                     2,


Recall that, by assumption, 𝑥𝑥 > 1. Then, we use homogeneity of degree zero, rewrite 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 as the solution

to the equation:


                                                            𝑝𝑝̅ 𝜎𝜎(𝑥𝑥, 1)𝑥𝑥 = 𝑞𝑞�,


where 𝑞𝑞� ≡ 𝜎𝜎(𝑞𝑞, 𝑞𝑞�)𝑞𝑞. From the implicit function theorem, the above defines a function 𝑥𝑥(𝑝𝑝̅ ) that satisfies


                                                      𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑     1 𝜎𝜎𝜎𝜎

Where the inequality follows from the ordering property of salience, namely 𝜎𝜎 ′ > 0 for 𝑥𝑥 > 1. This function

also satisfies:


                                             𝑑𝑑2 𝑥𝑥      1 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑         (2𝜎𝜎 ′ + 𝜎𝜎 ′′ 𝑥𝑥)𝜎𝜎𝜎𝜎
                                                     = −           �2 −                        �
                                             𝑑𝑑𝑝𝑝̅ 2     𝑝𝑝̅ 𝑑𝑑𝑝𝑝̅        (𝜎𝜎 + 𝜎𝜎 ′ 𝑥𝑥)2


We can now derive the comparative statics of reference price on the willingness to pay. Starting from 𝑝𝑝 =

𝑥𝑥𝑝𝑝̅ , we find:


                                                         𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑     𝜎𝜎′𝑥𝑥 2
                                                              =             > 0,
                                                         𝑑𝑑𝑝𝑝̅ 𝜎𝜎 + 𝜎𝜎 ′ 𝑥𝑥




27
     Uniqueness, and monotonicity, would hold for all 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 under suitable conditions on 𝜎𝜎 such that
          𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚
𝜎𝜎 �𝑝𝑝,
           2
               � 𝑝𝑝   is increasing in 𝑝𝑝.
                                                                     42
so that, as advertised, willingness to pay increases in the reference price. Moreover, we find:


                                                             𝑑𝑑2 𝑝𝑝       ′
                                                                            (2𝜎𝜎 ′ + 𝜎𝜎 ′′ )𝜎𝜎𝜎𝜎
                                                                     = 𝑥𝑥                        .
                                                             𝑑𝑑𝑝𝑝̅ 2         (𝜎𝜎 + 𝜎𝜎 ′ 𝑥𝑥)2

                  𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
where 𝑥𝑥 ′ =              < 0. We thus find that WTP is concave in the reference price provided:
                  𝑑𝑑𝑝𝑝̅



                                                           𝑑𝑑2 𝑝𝑝
                                                                   < 0 ⇔ 2𝜎𝜎 ′ + 𝜎𝜎 ′′ > 0.
                                                           𝑑𝑑𝑝𝑝̅ 2


This condition states that the salience function should not be too concave. It is satisfied by our specification,
                             𝑥𝑥−1
                 (1−𝛿𝛿)                                                         2𝑥𝑥
𝜎𝜎(𝑥𝑥, 1) = 𝑒𝑒               𝑥𝑥+1   (where it reduces to 2𝜎𝜎 ′ + 𝜎𝜎 ′′ ∝              + (1 − 𝛿𝛿) > 0) as well as by the specifications we
                                                                               1+𝑥𝑥

                                                             𝑥𝑥−1
considered in previous papers, 𝜎𝜎(𝑥𝑥, 𝑦𝑦) =                      .
                                                             𝑥𝑥+1


         We now derive a log-linear approximation to willingness to pay, around a reference price 𝑝𝑝0𝑚𝑚 that

                     𝑝𝑝0𝑚𝑚           𝜎𝜎(2,1)
satisfies 𝑝𝑝̅ =              < 𝑞𝑞 𝜎𝜎(1,1). Using the notation above, and taking logs we rewrite WTP as:
                      2


                                                                     𝑝𝑝
                                                      ln 𝑝𝑝 + ln 𝜎𝜎 � , 1� = ln 𝑞𝑞 + ln 𝜎𝜎(2,1)
                                                                     𝑝𝑝̅


To first order in an expansion around a generic solution 𝑝𝑝̅0 , 𝑝𝑝0 , the left hand side equals:


                                      𝑝𝑝                     1 𝜎𝜎′(𝑥𝑥, 1)               𝑝𝑝0 𝜎𝜎 ′ (𝑥𝑥, 1)
                           ln 𝑝𝑝0 + � − 1� + ln 𝜎𝜎(𝑥𝑥, 1) +                (𝑝𝑝 − 𝑝𝑝0 ) − 2               (𝑝𝑝̅ − 𝑝𝑝̅0 )
                                     𝑝𝑝0                    𝑝𝑝̅0 𝜎𝜎(𝑥𝑥, 1)              𝑝𝑝̅0 𝜎𝜎(𝑥𝑥, 1)

                 𝑝𝑝0
where 𝑥𝑥 =            .   Because, by assumption, ln 𝑝𝑝0 + ln 𝜎𝜎(𝑥𝑥, 1) = ln 𝑞𝑞 + ln 𝜎𝜎(2,1), these terms cancel out and
                 𝑝𝑝̅0


the equation above becomes:


                                                  𝑝𝑝        𝜎𝜎 ′ (𝑥𝑥, 1) 𝑝𝑝         𝑝𝑝̅
                                                � − 1� + 𝑥𝑥             �� − 1� − � − 1�� = 0
                                                 𝑝𝑝0         𝜎𝜎(𝑥𝑥, 1) 𝑝𝑝0         𝑝𝑝̅0

              𝑝𝑝                        𝑝𝑝                                             𝑝𝑝̅
Rewriting             − 1 ≈ ln               = ln 𝑝𝑝 − ln 𝑝𝑝0 , and similarly                − 1 ≈ ln 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 − ln 𝑝𝑝0𝑚𝑚 , replacing above, and
             𝑝𝑝0                       𝑝𝑝0                                            𝑝𝑝̅0


regrouping, we find:

                                                                                                                𝑥𝑥
                          ln 𝑝𝑝 �𝜎𝜎(𝑘𝑘, 1) + 𝑥𝑥𝜎𝜎 ′ (𝑥𝑥, 1)� = ln 𝑝𝑝0 𝜎𝜎(𝑥𝑥, 1) + ln 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 𝑥𝑥𝜎𝜎 ′ (𝑥𝑥, 1) + 𝑥𝑥 ln 𝜎𝜎 ′ (𝑥𝑥, 1)
                                                                                                                2

                                                                             43
          𝑝𝑝    𝑥𝑥
because 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚0 = 2. Replacing again ln 𝑝𝑝0 for ln 𝑞𝑞 − ln 𝜎𝜎(𝑥𝑥, 1) + ln 𝜎𝜎(2,1), the above becomes:
           0



                                              𝜎𝜎(𝑥𝑥, 1)                  𝑚𝑚
                                                                                   𝑥𝑥𝜎𝜎 ′ (𝑥𝑥, 1)
                      ln 𝑝𝑝 = ln 𝑞𝑞                              + ln 𝑝𝑝                               + Λ(𝑥𝑥)
                                      𝜎𝜎(𝑥𝑥, 1) + 𝑥𝑥𝜎𝜎 ′ (𝑥𝑥, 1)            𝜎𝜎(𝑥𝑥, 1) + 𝑥𝑥𝜎𝜎 ′ (𝑥𝑥, 1)


where

                                         𝑥𝑥
                            Λ(𝑥𝑥) = 𝑥𝑥 ln 𝜎𝜎 ′ (𝑥𝑥, 1) + 𝜎𝜎(𝑥𝑥, 1)[ln 𝜎𝜎(2,1) − ln 𝜎𝜎(𝑥𝑥, 1)]
                                         2

                                                                                          𝑞𝑞
In Proposition 6 we considered the case 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 = 𝑞𝑞 = 𝑝𝑝, which implies 𝑝𝑝̅ =                    and 𝑥𝑥 = 2. In this case, Λ(𝑥𝑥) = 0
                                                                                          2

and we get the expression in the text.


                                                  𝜎𝜎(2,1)                 𝑚𝑚
                                                                                  2𝜎𝜎 ′ (2,1)
                           ln 𝑝𝑝 = ln 𝑞𝑞                          + ln 𝑝𝑝
                                            𝜎𝜎(2,1) + 2𝜎𝜎 ′ (2,1)            𝜎𝜎(2,1) + 2𝜎𝜎 ′ (2,1)

                                            𝑥𝑥𝜎𝜎 ′ (𝑥𝑥,1)
Finally, note that the coefficient 𝜎𝜎(𝑥𝑥,1)+𝑥𝑥𝜎𝜎′ (𝑥𝑥,1) on the reference price is decreasing in 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 if and only if the

concavity condition derived above, 2𝜎𝜎 ′ + 𝜎𝜎 ′′ 𝑥𝑥 > 0, is satisfied (as assumed above). ∎
