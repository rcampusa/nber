     This paper compares and analyzes the growth of productivity in the

manufacturing industries and firms in France and the U.S. based on newly

assembled comparable data sets in both countries. Three explanations of

the recent productivity slowdown are reviewed: shortfall in physical

investment, rise in materials prices, and a decline in the intensity or

fecundity of R&D investment, and found not to bear on the differences in

productivity growth between and within the two countries, either at the

industry or the firm levels.

Introduction

    The United States, France, and many other industrial countries

experienced a significant slowdown in the growth of productivity in

the recent decade. This slowdown exacerbated inflationary pressures

and contributed to the growing pessimism about the prospects for

future economic growth. Its causes are still unclear and controver-

sial. It makes a difference from a policy response point of view

whether it was caused by insufficient investment, by rising energy

and raw materials prices, or by a decline in the fecundity of R&D

and the exhaustion of technological opportunities.'

     In this paper we bring a comparative perspective to the analysis

of some of these issues.   To accomplish this we had to assemble and

construct consistent and comparable data sets for French and United

States manufacturing industries and firms. After a discussion of the

respective data sets and a description of the extent of the slowdown

in productivity growth in the two countries and the great variability

in it, we turn to an analysis of the potential causes of such fluctua-

tions. At the industrial level, we focus on the contribution of capital

and the rise in material prices to an explanation of the observed pro-

ductivity slowdown. At the firm level we look also more closely at

the potential effect of R&D expenditures on productivity growth. A

number of tentative conclusions close the paper.

I. Productivity Growth at the Industry Level

      A. Data and Basic Facts

      In this section we focus on comparing total factor productivity

growth rates in manufacturing industries at the approximate 2—digit

level in both France and the United States. Our industry breakdown

(described in the Appendix, Table Al) is somewhat unorthodox. It is

the result of trying to match the U.S. SIC classification to the

French NAP classification, and was chosen primarily on the basis of

the availability of the French data, and secondarily because of our

interest in R&D (which led us to subdivide several industries). It

differs from the usual 2—digit SIC scheme in the U.S. mainly by the

separation of drugs and "paDachemicals" from the other chemicals,



the        aggregation of several minor industries, and the exclusion

of the petroleum refining industry from manufacturing so defined.

       The French estimates are based on national accounts publications,

augmented by various unpublished data from the "branch" (establishment

level) and "sector" (company level) accounts. The U.S. estimates were

aggregated from the 4—digit SIC level detail data base constructed by

Froinm et al (1979) on the basis of the Census Annual Surveys of Manu-

factures and National Income account based detailed deflators.     Both

data sets yield a gross output measure (shipments adjusted for inventory

changes) in constant (1972) prices and divide inputs into three cate-

gories: labor (man—hours), capital (gross capital stock in constant

prices), and purchased materials (intermediate consumption including

energy inputs). With each input and output measure we associate a set

of price indexes and cost shares. For each of our 15 industries, in

both countries, we compute Tornqruist Divisia total input indexes and use
                               —3—




 them to construct Total Factor Productivity (TFP) indexes for the

12—year period, 1967—78, and for two sub—periods: 1967—73 and 1973—78.

The final results of these rather extensive computations are given in

Table 1 and illustrated in Figure 1.

     For the period as a whole, the rate of growth of total factor

productivity was higher in France than in the U.S. and this was also

true for each industry separately. The median difference was on the

order of one percent per year with larger differences occurring in the

"heavy" industries (primary Metals, Fabricated Metals, Machinery, and

Aircraft and Boats). In both countries productivity slowed signifi-

cantly in the second sub—period, though here the results are much more

variable across industries. For aggregate manufacturing the decelera-

tion was somewhat larger in the U.S. (by about .7 percent).2

     If we divide the periods so that they are equal in length and inde-

pendently constructed, i.e., if we use 1967 to 1972 as our first period,

we can do an analysis of variance on the resulting 60 TFP growth numbers,

using country, period and industry as classification categories. This

yields the following estimates: an average TFP growth rate (in both

countries across all industries) of 0.8, an average French advantage over

the U.S. of 1.5 percent per year, and an average deceleration of 1.0 per-

cent between the two periods. In terms of contribution to the total

variance in TFP growth, the most important factors are country and period,

with computed F statistics of 25 and 11 respectively (the .05 critical

value of the F statistic with 1 and 43 degrees of freedom is about 4).

Surprisingly, industrial differences contribute relatively little (the

computed F = 1 constrasted to a critical F95 (14,43) of about 2), though
                              —4—




individually two industries (electrical equipment and aircraft) have

significantly above average TFP growth rates. This is a rather un-

fortunate finding from our point of view since we had hoped to find

consistent and significant differences in the rate of productivity

growth across industries which might have provided clues to causes

of the productivity slowdown. In fact, no consistent industrial dif-

ferences emerged, either within or across countries.

     If we look at the numbers for the more recent subperiod in Table

1, the biggest difference between the two countries in TFP growth occurs

in the chemicals (excluding drugs) industry, while the smallest are in

textiles, leather, electrical equipment and drugs. It should be noted

here that some of these differences may be spurious, the result of errors

in the basic data. The biggest potential source of error comes from the

price indexes, which could be both erroneous and improperly associated

with the relevant industry output. One becomes suspicious of the numbers

when one notices that in the U.S. chemicals industry capital grew by 5.7

percent per year during 1973—78, materials purchased grew at 9.6 percent,

while output went up by only 3.1 percent per year. The other numbers

could be wrong, but the suspicion falls on the output number and the

associate price index when we note that it had the highest rate of growth
                                                                3
of all the industrial price indexes —— 13.2 percent per year.       At this

moment, however, we have no way of checking what are basically ingredients

of the national Income accounts computations. We do want to warn the

reader not to place too much confidence in the various numbers; there may

still be quite a bit of error left in them.4
                              —5—




     Looking at Table 2, which lists the components of the TFP calcula-

tion for aggregate manufacturing, we observe that output growth in

France was significantly higher in the 1967—73 period (7 vs. 4 percent)

and fell by more in the 1973—78 period than in the U.S., to roughly

equivalent levels (about 2 percent per year). Throughout both period,

fixed capital was growing faster in France than in the U.S., at the

rate of 1 to 2 percent more per year. The big puzzle is in the behavior

of manhours. In the earlier period their growth is small and roughly

parallel but diverges sharply during 1973—78. In France labor use

declines at about —2 percent per year, while in the U.S. it rises at

over 1 percent per year, in the face of a severe output growth slump.5

There is also a divergence in the materials use story. Materials use

is growing much faster in France during the first period and the drop

in the second period is much sharper than in the U.S. (from over 7 to

about 1 percent per year versus a drop from 3.5 to only 2.5 in the

U.S.).

     Looking at the price side, average output price inflation was slightly

higher in France, by about 1 percent per year, but not strikingly so.

This is true also of material prices, which rose slightly faster in France.

The .big discrepancy, however, is again in labor. Wages appear to have

grown much faster in France, accelerating in the second period to a rate

double that in the U.S.. While the real cost of both labor and materials

remained roughly constant in the U.S. in the second period (and rose only

gradually in the first),   in France real labor costs were rising

sharply in both periods (at a rate of 6 to 7 percent per year). This

may provide a "push" tyexplanation for the more rapid productivity growth
                               —6—




                                                                         6
in France than in the U.S. though the causality is far from clear here.



     B. Looking for Causes of the Slowdown: Capital and Materials.

     There are three potential explanations of the productivity slow-

down and the shortfall of the U.S. relative to other countries in this

regard which we can explore with our data: differences in investment,

a differential rise in materials (and energy) prices, and different

R&D policies. Those who claim that part of the productivity slowdown

can be explained by a shortfall in the rate of capital investment, must

have in mind a model in which the contribution of capital to output

growth exceeds its factor share for some reason or other (disequilibrium,

taxation, or the embodiment of technical change).7   While capital stock

was growing somewhat faster in France than in the U.S., the TFP calcula-

tions take this already into account, to a first order of approximation.

One way to check on this is to take apart the TFP calculation and ask

whether output growth was faster (slower) in sectors which experienced

above (below) average growth in capital input.

     Defining the "production function" as


                 q = A   + cQ + c + yin + e


•where q, £, c, m, and A denote rates of growth of output, labor, capi-

tal, materials and disembodied technical change respectively; o, , and

y are the respective input elasticies of output, and e is a disturbance

term. Approximating the relevant elasticities by their corresponding

factor shares, we estimate


                 q =      + b1(s) + b2(sc) + b3(Sm) + e
                              —7-.




where the constants (technical change terms) are allowed to differ

across countries Ci) and periods (t), If the TFP calculations are

roughly right, the estimated b's should

be around unity. If an input is in some sense "more importantt' than

that, it should show up with a coefficient significantly above unity.

     The results reported in Table 3Ado not support the capital (or

materials) story.8 Only the labor coefficient exceeds unity signif i—

cantly and even this result disappears when we exclude the chemicals

industry with its dubious 1973—78 numbers from the U.S. equation. The

capital coefficients are not significantly different from unity, either

in the direct production function estimates, or the partial productivity

versions, where we first treat labor and then both labor and materials

as endogeneous variables, constraining their elasticities to equal their

factor shares, and subtracting them from the left hand side.9 If any-

thing, the coefficient of capital is lower in France than in the U.S.,

which is exactly the opposite of what would have been needed to provide

an explanation for the more rapid productivity growth in France. This

is even more obvious when we try to explain cross—country differences

in sectoral output growth. There, the estimated capital coefficient

actually turns negative, though not significantly so; implying that

output was growing faster in France than in the U.S., in industries

where the relative capital growth was lower.10

     As far as materials are concerned, while the direct coefficients

are sometimes higher than unity, the differences are not statistically

or economically significant. The materials story, suggested especially

by Bruno (1981), is based on the notion that in the short—run their elas-

ticity of substitution is less than unity and that a response to a sharp
                              —8—




rise in their price is more costly to output growth than is implied

by the standard formulae. This can be tested either by looking at the

estimated coefficient of materials in the "product.ion function" frame-

work, or by substituting the real price of materials for the more

endogeneous materials quantity variable.

     Treating materials as a separate input with an elasticity of

substitution a < 1 between itself and the aggregate of other inputs

(value added, consisting of capital and labor) one can write the

equation to be estimated as



                          A
            q -       =       +     c -
                                          i- mq'   + e



where, in addition to the symbols defined above, p and Pq are the

growth rates of materials and output prices respectively.12   When such

an equation is estimated, it yields invariably the wrong sign for the

coefficient of the weighted real price of materils [(5m/(l_Sm)l(PmPq)

implying that productivity improved in industries where real material

prices rose more rapidly. This could be due to errors in the measure-

ment of industrial output prices, since both the construction of the

output variable and the real materials price variable depend on the same

output price deflators. An attempt was made to get around this problem

by treating p — Pq as endogeneous and using p and p (the growth rate

of wage rates) as additional instruments.

This yielded a negative but not statistically significant
                                  —9—



coefficient for the real price of materials, with an estimated 0         of
about .2.

     Actually, it is not all that surprising that we cannot get much
                                                                    13
from the materials story since the basic facts go the wrong way.

The growth in material use fell more sharply in France than in the

U.S. and hence cannot account for the sharper productivity deceleration

in the U.S..     Nor is there any evidence that real materials prices

were rising more rapidly in the U.S. or accelerated more there; if

anything the opposite appears to be the case. Thus, whatever explana-

tion they may provide for the short—term timing of such movements, the

rise in material prices cannot explain the persistent and increasing

difference between French and U.S. productivity growth.14

     Another way of looking at the relationships between our variables

is to look at the dual price side. Treating output price as dependent,

one can write.




                 Pq
                      =   \+      +c+            +


where, in addition to the terms defined above, p, and i         are rates of

growth in labor and capital price indexes and c is a disturbance.

Table 3B presents the results of such regressions where, as before,

factor shares replace ,        , and    y, and the estimated coefficients

should be on the order of one.      Estimates of a "factor price frontier"

equation


                  —
                      Pg
                           =    — (a/s) (P1'q)    —
                                                      1mq)    + c
                                —10—




which endogeneize the price of capital (using the real return to capital

as the dependent variable) are also reported in this table. In the

direct price equations there is a stark contrast between U.S. and

France. In the U.S. labor cost and especially materials price increases

were transmitted to product prices more than proportionally, more than

could have been predicted by their relative importance in total costs.

In France, material price increases appear to have had less than their

predicted impact on product prices. When factor price frontier equations

are estimated, with the real return to capital as the dependent variable,

real material prices invariably come out with the wrong sign. Somehow,

the spuriousness introduced by errors in the output price deflators       -




appears to dominate. This is another manifestation of a problem that
is endemic to such data ——   real   factor price differences are rather

small across industries within any one country, small relative to the

size of transitory and erroneously measured movements in output prices.

    One way of reducing the endogeneity of the right hand terms in the

factor price frontier equation is to solve out both the output price

and the endogeneous capital return measure from the right hand side of

this equation. This leads to the estimation of "partial price equations"

with   Pq —     as the dependent variable, i.e.



               Pq -   c=      +        + m + E



These equations (listed in the middle of Table 3B) also imply an above

average transmission of wage and materials price changes to output prices
                                —11—




in the U.S. relative to France. If factor prices have had a special

role in this story, it has been their differential impact in the two

countries. Thus, they cannot provide a unified explanation for the

events in both countries.



     C. The Role of R&D

     We cannot really analyze the contribution of R&D to productivity

growth in any detail in this section because there are no R&D time

series at the industry level in France. We do have, however, French

data on R&D expenditures and employment by industry for 1975 and we

can use similar U.S. data (see Appendix Table 3) to investigate

whether differences in productivity growth are related to differences

in R&D intensity. An earlier study (Griliches and Lichtenberg, 1981)

found that one can attribute only very little of the productivity

showdown in the U.S. to the retardation that occurred in the growth

of R&D in the late 1960's. This study utilized a more detailed indus-

trial breakdown and showed that the relationship between TFP growth

and the R&D to sales ratio did not deteriorate in the 1970's. More-

over, it indicated that the R&D to sales ratios remained relatively

stable across industries between the 60's and 70's (r2 for the correla-

tion of R/S in 1964—68 and 1969—73 across 27 manufacturing industries

was.97). Assuming a similar stability in France, we may use the 1975

data to proxy also for the unavailable earlier data.

     If we combine all of our data for the two countries, two periods,

and 15 industries (N =   C   x T x I =   60),   and estimate a common R&D

coefficient in the two countries, using a seemingly unrelated regression
                                   —12—




framework, we get the following equation:


     TFP   = .23    DUS1 — 1.02 DUS2 + 1.49 DF1 + .76 DF2 + .28 R/S

            (.31)          (.37)          (.31)      (.29)          (.09)

                                                                    SEE =   1.10

where DUS1 is the U.S. constant term (average rate of TFP Growth)

in the first period, and similarly for the other terms, while R/S

is the ratio of company financed R&D expenditures to total sales in

the respective countries)5 The estimated R&D coefficient implies

a 28 percent excess gross rate of return to R&D investment. It is

excess because much of the R&D input is already counted once in the

construction of labor and capital and it is gross because no allow-

ance has been made for possible depreciation of R&D capital (see

Griliches 1979 and Schankerman 1981 for a more detailed interpretation

of such coefficients).

     When we allow for separate country coefficients we get the fol-

lowing equation instead:


     TFP =    .30 DUS1 — .94 DUS2 + 1.42 DF1 + .68 DF2

             (.33)         (.38)          (.36)          (.33)


                                      + .23 R/S(US)+ .33 R/S(F)
                                          (.12)             (.14)

                                          SEE =   1.11

The difference between the U.S. and French coefficient is substantial

but not statistically significant.

     The estimated R/S coefficient for the U.S. (.23) is comparable to

what we found in the earlier study. If we accept such a rate of return
                                 —13--




or even if it were twice as high, this still would not account for

much of the deceleration of TFP in the U.S., since the decline in

R&D to sales ratio was in fact rather small.16 Nor can our estimates

account for the differences in TFP growth between France and the U.S.,

since the R&D to sales ratios tend to be lower at the industry level

in France than in the U.S.. We re—examine this conclusion, however,

in the next section where the available micro data contain more inforina—

tion on firm R&D expenditures.

II. Productivity Growth at the Firm Level

    A. Data and Basic Facts

     In this section we examine the growth of productivity at the firm level.

Because of our interest in assessing the contribution of R&D to productivity,

we have been assembling data on R&D performing firms in both France and the

U.S.17 Data problems and the desire for compaiable and large enough samples

limited the study period to l973-l978 and to five manufacturing industries

for which we had a sufficient number of firms (at least 30) in each of

the countries: Drugs, Chemicals (excluding Drugs), Electronics, Electrical

Equipment (excluding Computers), and Machinery. The exact definition of these

five industries in terms of the two or three digit French "NAP" or U.S. "SIC"

classifications is indicated in Table 4 in the Appendix. It differs somewhat from

our aggregate industry breakdown. The "parachemical" firms were brought together

with the chemical firms (rather than with the drug firms) and the medical instru-

ment firms were added to the "drug" industry. The electronics and electrical

equipment firms are treated separately, and computer and (nonmedical) instrument

firms have been excluded, since there were too few of them in France.

     Our samples correspond best to the subtotal of the four aggregate industries

(2 + 7 + 8 + 14) given separately in Table 1 of the previous section. The number

of firms is relatively small (N = 185) in the French sample and only somewhat

larger (N = 343) in the U.S. one, but these firms do account for about 25 and 85

percent of the total number of employees in these four aggregate industries in

France and the U.S. respectively. They are not a representative sample from these
                                   —15—



industries, however. First, because we include only R&D doing firms and second,

because our data cleaning efforts result in additional selection. In particular,

firms which grew through major mergers have been excluded.13

     That the use of similar selection procedures in both countries yields a much

lower coverage for the French sample than the U.S. one is rather interesting.

Only about a third of the French firms (in terms of the number of employees)

in these industries have significant levels of R&D expenditures as against
most of the firms in the U.S. This difference in the industrial structure of the

two countries also accounts for the observed discrepancy between the R&D to sales

ratios at the firm and industry levels in the two countries. (See the Data Sources

Appendix for more details.)

     In addition to constructing our samples along the same lines for both coun-

tries, we also defined and measured our main variables as similarly as possible.

Output is defined as deflated sales. The industrial level of the sales deflators

depends on their respective availability in the two countries (11 different price

Indices for the French and 25 for the U.S. data).19 Labor is measured by the total

number of employees and gross physical capital stock by the book value of gross

plant adjusted for inflation (based on a rough estimate of the average age of

the capital stock). An R&D capital stock variable is constructed as a weighted

sum of past R&D expenditures, using a 15 percent rate of depreciation and all

of the pre—1973 information on R&D that we could get for our firms.2° Because

materials purchases and labor costs are not separated for most U.S. firms (they

are lumped together in the cost of goods sold item) it was not possible to treat

materials as a separate factor of production and estimate a TFP index similar

to that computed atthe industry level. We focus, therefore, on labor productivity

 Q/L and on an approximate TFP measure Q/[L75 C25], which assumes the propor-

tionality of materials to value added and uses constant labor and physical capital
                                     —16—


cost shares.21 We also put more emphasis on econometric estimates of the contri-

bution of physical investment and R&D to labor productivity growth, using a

standard Cobb—Douglas production function framework to allow factor elasticities

to diverge from their corresponding cost shares.

       Table 4 presents means and standard deviations of the growth rates of our

main variables between 1973 and 1978 and of their levels as of 1974. It also

reports their weighted growth rates and compares them to the corresponding

aggregate growth rates.22 The standard deviations of the rates of growth of

labor productivity are 4.9 and 3.9 percent per ear in the French and U.S. samples

respectively and the corresponding interquartile ranges are [—.1; 6.0] and

[—1.8; 3.4]. In fact, when one looks at any histogram of individual rates of

growth, or any plot of them, the scatters overlap widely across countries. This

is illustrated in Figures 2 and 3 which show for both samples the histogram of

q—n (labor productivity growth rate) and the plot of q—n against c—n (capital stock

per employee growth rate).

       Another interesting point is that the dispersion of growth rates, even though

quite large in its own terms, is rather small (about a tenth) relative to the dis-

persion of the corresponding levels. Moreover, growth rates and levels are almost

uncorrelated, GIBRAT's law holding also for productivity growth and not just for

the growth in size (number of employees or sales), as it is usually formulated.23

These two features are reflected in the long period stability of firm rankings by

absolute productivity in spite of the great variability in their productivity

growth rates.
                                    —17—




       Looking at the average growth rates of our variables and comparing

unweighted to weighted averages, it appears that smaller firms are growing

faster than larger ones in the U.S., while no such differential tendency is

apparent in France. This is particularly striking when we look at the number of

employees, but is also true for the growth in sales and capital. Some of this

may be explained by differences in the size (and also in the range of sizes) of

French and U.S. firms: the geometric means of the number of employees being 900

in France and 3000 in the U.S.24

       Given all the discrepancies that could have arisen from the selection of

our samples and the measurement of our variables, the agreement between our

"micro" and "macro" numbers is rather surprising. The weighted sample means and

the corresponding four industries aggregates are not that far—off. In France,

the growth of R&D firms has been apparently more rapid than that for the corres-

ponding industries as a whole, which is not surprising. Curiously, the reverse

seems to be the case for the U.S., R&D firms having a somewhat lower growth in

employment (although they invested more) and a lower growth of sales than the

corresponding industries. We have already noted the remarkable difference between

our "micro" and "macro" R&D to sales ratios. French R&D doing firms have been

investing relatively more in research and development than their U.S. counterparts,

but since they constitute a much smaller proportion of the totals the opposite

is true for the corresponding industries taken as a whole. The unweighted and

weighted average R&D to sales ratios are 4.8 and 3.7 percent respectively for the

French sample, 2.6 and 2.9 percent for the U.S. sample, while the corresponding

industry estimates are 2.6 and 3.0 percent respectively.25

       In spite of such differences, comparing the 1973—78 productivity growth in

the two countries yields essentially the same picture as before. Both labor and

total factor productivity (based on our rough calculation with a capital share of
                                   —18—



.25) increased much faster in France than in tile U.S., by 1.5 to 2.0 percent

per year.

     We should, finally, remark on the comparison of productivity levels in the

two countries given in Table 4 using 5 Francs for 1 dollar as an approximate rate

of conversion. Though productivity growth has been more rapid in France, labor

productivity levels are still below those in the U.S. by about as much as 25

percent on the average. Part of this gap may be due to differences in physical

capital intensity and the scale of enterprises between the two countries.

B. Assessing the Contribution of R&D to Productivity Growth

     In an attempt to assess the contribution of R&D as well as that of physical

capital to productivity growth, we find it convenient to pooi the French and U.S.

samples together. This is not unreasonable since the standard deviations of our

variables and the correlations between them are rather similar in both samples.

Among different ways of handling such panel data, we chose to analyze differences

in firm growth rates between 1973 and 1978. This has the advantage that the

general economic situation in these two years was good in both countries, in con-

trast to the 1975—1976 recession years. Compared to using year .to year growth

rates, it also has the advantage of reducing biases due to measurement errors

in the variables (diminishing the ratio of error to true variance). In doing so,

we discard all the cross—sectional information in our data panel, relying only on

its time series components. As we know from the literature on the econometrics

of panel data and from previous work, cross sectional estimates often differ from

time series estimates. In our earlier studies (see Griliches—Mairesse (1981) and

Cuneo—Mairesse (1982)), they actually provide more sensible estimates of the elas-

ticity of output with respect to R&D capital. Despite that, we do not report

here on such cross—sectional estimates to keep the analysis parallel to the first

section.

     Let us denote by q—n ,   c—n     and k—n the annual rate of growth between

1973 and 1978 of labor productivity, physical, and R&D capital—labor ratios

respectively (dropping for simplicity the firm subscripts 1); and by COU, IND,

SIZ the appropriate set of dummy variables indicating whether or not firms belong

to one of the two countries, one of the five industries, or one of four size

groups (which we defined to controlfor the different range in the number of

employees in the French and U.S. samples). The following types of regressions

were estimated:
                                    —20—



                    (q-n) =    (c—n) + 6 (k—n) + DUN   +e
or

                    (q—n) =    COU (c—n) + (S COU(k—n) + DUN   +e
or

                    (q—n) =   •(COUIND (c—n) + 6 C0U.IND(k-n) + DUN   +e


where the slope coefficients are first constrained to be constant across

countries and industries and then free to differ across countries and also

across industries; and where DUN denotes either the set of dummy variables

COU, IND, IND COU, SIZ (13 independent ones) or only the subset COU, SIZ

(5 independent ones). When the full set of dummy variables is included, the

regressions are based only on intracountry and intraindustry growth differences.

When the industry dummies and their interactions are excluded, the regressions

are based also on interindustry growth differences and are therefore more similar

to those computed in the first section. To relate these regressions even more

closely to the previous analysis and because we did not find evidence of a

statistically signif cant contribution of k—n (the growth in R&D capital) to

productivity growth, we used also an R&D intensity variable (R/S74) instead of

the R&D capital measure. We used the R&D to sales ratio as of 1974 instead of

a comparable 1973 ratio, so as to avoid any spurious correlation with the 1973—

78 growth rate in labor productivity q—n. The substitution of R/S for k—n

implies a different specification of the production function, one that assumes

a constant marginal product for R&D rather than a constant elasticity across

firms or industries (see Griliches—Lichtenberg, 1982).
                                  —21—



     Our main results are summarized in Table 5 which gives the estimated

parameters of interest for a number of specifications we tested. Starting

with the simplest analysis of variance which uses only dummy variables, we

find that all the effects are statistically significant. \mong the various

dummy variables, the country andindustry effects are most highly significant

while the size effects are less so, implying a slight tendency for faster

growth of productivity in larger firms. The country—industry interactions

are just on the border of statistical significance.

     In addition to such country and industry effects, physical capital growth

also contributes significantly to the growth in labor productivity, especially

when constrained to have the same average elasticity in all five industries.

The evidence is weaker when different industries are considered separately. But

the discrepancies in the estimated elasticities by industries and countries are

not statistically significant, and we can maintain the hypothesis of a common

elasticity. Given the small size of our industry subsamples, we cannot really

discern differences in elasticities across industries.

     In contrast to physical capital, growth in R&D capital is not significant

at all, even when we impose a constant elasticity across industries. These

negative results may be due to our turbulent sample period (see Griliches—

Mairesse (1981)), and also to problems of measurement. Double counting of R&D

related employees and R&D related capital expenditures in our actual measure of

labor and physical capital stock may obscure the relation between productivity

and R&D investments. In the French sample, where we can correct for some of

these problems, we obtain much more sensible looking estimates, with an estimated

output elasticity of R&D capital 6 of about .1 (see Cuneo—Mairesse (1982)).
                                  —22—



     On the other hand, the R&D to sales ratio does turn out to contribute

significantly to the explanation of the interindustry differences in produc-

tivity growth. When it is restricted, however, to the explanation of intra—

industry differences, the contribution of R/S dwindles to insignificance. In

the interindustry regressions, the estimated coefficient of R/S (p), which can

be interpreted as the marginal product or gross rate of return of R&D, is .28,

while in the intraindustry regressions (those containing industry dummy variables)

it is only .12. Part of the discrepancy might be attributable to externalities,

the fact that R&D performed by a particular firm may benefit other firms in the

same industry. Unfortunately, the evidence of an intraindustry effect becomes

especially weak, when we relax the constraint that the coefficient p be the same in

the different industries. Nonetheless, to end on a positive note, it is quite
encouraging that the contribution of R&D to productivity growth is confirmed by

our analyses at both the industrial and the firm levels. It may even be a bit

of luck that the estimated order of magnitude of the overall gross rate of return

to investment in R&D comes out so close in both cases: about .25, somewhat more

perhaps in France and less in the U.S.

III. Conclusions

       Analyzing the French and U.S. industrial data we confirmed both the fact

of faster productivity growth in France and the pervasiveness of the recent

productivity slowdown. Looking at the individual industry experiences did not

yield any new clues about its sources, but it did reject some old ones. Three

explanations (shortfall In investment, rise in material prices, and a decline

in the intensity of R&D investment) were examined and were found not to bear

on the differences in productivity growth across the two countries. Indus-

tries with above (below) average growth in physical capital did not have an

above (below) average growth rate of total factor productivity. Industries

that experienced above average growth in the price of materials and/or had

been more materials intensive, did not appear to have suffered differentially.

And, while we did find some modest evidence of a positive effect of R&D on

productivity, it could account for only very little of the aggregate cross—

country differences, since the overall R&D investment intensities were not

higher in France than in the U.S.

       Looking at the individual firm data did not change these conclusions.

The major impression that emerged was one of variance. At the firm level,

the estimated output elasticity of physical capital is positive and statis-

tically significant but does not exceed its factor share in either country.

Thus, there is no evidence for the notion that investxnent in fixed assets is

more important in accounting for changes in labor productivity than is already

implied in the usual total factor productivity calculations. Because amuchstnaller
                                  —24—


proportion of firms in an industry do R&D in France than in the U.S., it

turns out that the French sample is more research intensive than our U.S.

one, while the reverse is true at the aggregate level for the corres-

ponding industries. Nevertheless, the estimated R&D effects are statisti-

cally significant and of comparable magnitude at both the micro and macro

levels; they cannot account, however, for much of the observed differences

in productivity growth.

       This is our first look at the comparative performance of manufacturing

industries and firms in France and the U.S. It is obvious that we have still

many unsolved problems and puzzles, both as far as data quality is concerned

and in understanding the substance of what has happened. But we have made a

beginning and hope that others will be encouraged to pursue such comparative

studies further.

     s —   average   (beginning and end period) estimated factor shares of the respective inputs.

Combined equations estimated using generalized least squares, allowing a freely correlated
disturbance matrix (4x4) between countries and time periods across industries. I.e., four
separate equations (2 periods x 2 countries) are estimated, with the relevant coefficients
constrained to be the same across equations.

All equations contain separate unconstrained country and period constant terms.

Combined IV treats [5m/(l_Sm)](PmPq) as endogeneous, using [Sm/(l_Sm)Jpm and
as additional instrumental variables.

 Presented at the Fifth Annual International Seminar on Macroeconomics,
University of Mannheim, June 20—22, 1982. This work is part of the

National Bureau of Economic Research Program on Productivity and Tech-

nical Change Studies. We are indebted to the National Science

Foundation (PRA79—13740, PRA81—068635, and S0C78—004279) and to the

Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (ATP 070199) for finan-

cial support, to Sumanth Addanki, Phillipe Cuneo, Bronwyn H. Hall and

Alan Siu for research assistance and Martin Baily, Michael Bruno, and

Robert J. Gordon for comments on the first draft of this paper.



1. See Denison, 1979 and Nordhaus, 1982, for a more detailed discussion

of some of these issues.


2. This conclusion depends on the exact choice of time periods. If

1972 is chosen to divide the two time periods instead of 1973, the

magnitude of the deceleration is essentially the same in both countries.

The U.S. peaked more in 1973.

3.   See Appendix Table A2 for this detail.

4 While there is agreement on the general outlines of the slowdown,
there remains much disagreement among various sources about its

exact magnitude, especially at the more detailed industrial level.

TFP estimates for manufacturing industries at the 2—digit SIC level

have been computed in the U.S. by Gollup and Jorgenson (1980) through

1973 and by Kendrick and Grossman (1980) and APC, (1981)), through

1979. They vary quite a bit from each other (in the 1967—73 overlap

period the correlations between these estimates and between them and

ours is only on the order of 0.5). Some of the discrepancies could be

explained by the use of different data bases (revised vs. unrevised,

Census vs. NIPA) and some by differences in methodology (value added

vs. gross output, Divisia vs. fixed weight indexes), but the size of

some of them remains a puzzle. Within the confines of this paper we

cannot pursue this further, but we hope to return to it in the sequel.


5. This difference is smaller if we look at employment rather than

manhours.

.     These facts have been noticed before. See, for example, Sachs (1979).

7 .   They may be thinking primarily of the behavior of output per manhour,
a measure that does not take into account the contribution of the other

inputs. Some of the fluctuations in output per manhour are due to differ-

ential movements in capital and/or materials. The concept of total factor

productivity attempts to allow for this by including all the major inputs

in its definition of total input, weighting them in proportion to their

share in total factor costs.
8. To reduce dependence, these regressions are based on a partition

of the data into two non—overlapping periods: 1967—72 and 1973-78. The

results are similar when other partitionings, 1967—73 or 1972—78 are

used instead.

 9•   It makes little sense to think of input changes an exogeneous in

this context of rather aggregate changes over five year periods. The

regressions should be interpreted as a data summary device and not as

structural estimates of the production function.         The partial produc-

tivity regressions try to focus on the contribution of specific inputs

by constraining the other coefficients to reasonable a priori values.

10. These results are robust to the exclusion of the chemicals industry

with its possibly bad U.S. numbers from these regressions and to the

use of slightly different time periods.

11. One should note that our definition of purchased materials includes

also materials purchased from the same and other manufacturing industries

and is not a net "outside" materials concept. The computed materials

price changes understate, therefore, the true magnitude of changes in the

price of "outside" materials. But the computed share of all "materials"

overstates their overall importance, with the product of the two being

essentially unaffected by this distinction. Let the computed p (rate of

growth in materials prices) be      =   (l—d)p   + dp, where         and   are
                                                                Pq
the rates of growth of the industries own price level and of outside

materials prices respectively and       d the share of purchases of

"outside" materials in total expenditures on materials. Then the vari-

able we use            =                =              is the same as if we had
                           5md(1)oq)        S0(P0Pq)
used the "outside" definition of materials. Our conclusions should,
therefore, be robust with respect to the exact definition of "materials"

and the boundaries of the various industries. (We are grateful to

Michael Bruno for this remark.)


12. See Bruno (1981), equation 8.

13. Moreover, our data are not very powerful in this respect. The

real price of materials varies surprising little over 5 year periods.

It appears that most of the materials price changes were passed through

to output prices within this length of time.

14. Most of the evidence presented in Bruno (1981) for the materials

story is based on aggregate annual time series for different countries.

France is not considered explicitly and the results for the U.S. are

not as good as for some of the other countries.

15. The OLS estimates, although less precise, are very similar to the

SUR estimates. When we use total R&D to sales ratio (or R&D employment

to total employment ratio) instead of company R&D to sales ratio, we

obtain rather poor and statistically insignificant estimates for the

U.S. These are due mainly to one outlier, the U.S. Aircraft, boats

and space vehicles industry, which had very low TFP growth rates (the

lowest in the first period) and the highest total R&D to sales ratio

(of which 80 percent is federally funded). When this industry is

left out of the sample all estimates become comparable. Earlier work

has also shown that productivity growth in the U.S. is more closely

related to company R&D expenditures than to the federally financed

components of total R&D.

16. The total R&D to sales ratio in U.S. manufacturing declines from

about 4,4 percent in the mid 60's to 3.1 in the mid 70's. The decline

is much smaller, however, for company financed R&D, from a peak of 2.2

percent in 1969 to a low of 2.0 in the mid 1970's.
17.    See Griliches and Mairesse (1981) and Cuneo and Mairesse (1982) for a descrip-

tion of earlier work and for more detail on these data.


18.    We recognized "major mergers" by large jumps in the data such as the

doubling of gross plant, sales or the number of employees. This eliminated

about 50 firms from the French sample and 80 from the U.S. one.


19.    For the U.S. sample firm specific price indices where also computed as

weighted averages of sectoral indices, the weights being obtained, from the

information on sales by different business segments within a company in 1978.

Using such firm specific price indices did not alter our results in any significant

way.


20.    We were able to use R&D data as far back as 1963 for two—thirds of the

French sample, and at least back to 1968 for practically all the firms of the

French sample and most of the firms in the U.S. sample.   We tried also

alternative measures of R&D capital, retrapolating R&D series on the basis of the

corresponding industry growth rates instead of using all the firm information

whenever possible and adopting a 30 percent rate of depreciation. The means of

such different measures differ of course appreciably (and thus the estimates

exhibited in Table 4 for our main measure are only roughly indicative) but the

estimated regression coefficients (elasticities) are practically unchanged.


21.    Using specific country and industry cost shares of labor and physical capi-

tal (rather than .75 and .25) to compute an alternative TFP variable did not

affect our results significantly.
22.   Table 4 in the Appendix gives similar detail for the five industry

subsaniples.


23.   For example, the correlation between the 1973—78 growth in labor produc-

tivity and its level in 1974 is only —0.05 and —0.07 in the French and U.S.

samples respectively, while the correlation between the growth rate in employ-

ment and its level is only —0.02 and —0.15. For references to GIBRAT's law

and related literature, see Marris (1979).


24.   The arithmetic means of the number of employees are 2100 and 12600 in the

French and U.S. samples respectively. While the growth in employment was about

the same in France for firms with less than 2000 employees and for those with

more than 2000 employees, in the U.S the respective growth rates were 3.6 and

1.7 percent.

25.   The large difference between the unweighted and weighted ratios in France

implies a difference in the R&D intensity of small and large firms: 5.1 percent

in firms with less than 2000 employees, 3.8 percent for those with more than

2000 employees.

Appendix —— Data Sources at the Industry and the Firm Level


     The French industrial data come from the Natidnal Accounts data

bases. Gross output, materials (intermediate consumption) and their

associated price indexes and the total number of employees by indus-

try are taken from'Le comptsde l'Industridt— Les Collections de

l'INSEE no.: C55 (1977), C76 (1979), C92 (1981). Hours of work are

obtained by multiplying the average total number of employees, over

the year, by the average number of hours worked per week by produc-

tion workers in the same years. The latter is taken from the INSEE

national accounts data bank. For a description of the methods used

in constructing capital stock see J. Nairesse, "L'evaluation du

capital fixe productif. Methocset Resultats" — Les Collection de

1'INSEE no.: C18—l9 (1972). The numbers are taken from INSEE national

accounts data bank. The share of labor in gross output is compütdd

from the labor share in value added data, available in "Les comptes d'—

entreprises par secteurs" (see Les Collection de l'INSEE, C78 (1979))

by multiplying them by           where S IS the share of materials

in gross output. The estimates from the "sectoral" national accounts

(based on firm's data) are not quite coherent with the other estimates

from the "branch" national accounts (more or less based on establish-

ments data). But at our level of industrial aggregation and for our

purpose of computing TFP estimates, the possible discrepancies are

negligible.

    The U.S. industrial data are aggregated from the 4—digit SIC leveldata
 base constructed by the Penn—SRI—Census project (Fromm et al, 1979)

and updated and extended at the NBER by Wayne Grey and Frank Lich—

tenberg. The basic data come from the Census Annual Surveys of

Manufactures while the price series are based on the underlying

detailed national income defiators. Labor input (total hours) is

computed by dividing total payrolls in operating establishments by

the average hourly wage rate of production workers. It can be inter-

preted as an estimate of total man—hours in production worker equiva1eit.

units.    The capital stock data were constructed by Fawcett and

Associates for Penn—SRI by perpetual inventory methods from Census

sources. Output and input price indexes are based on unpublished

detailed National Income deflators and tabulations. The price index

of Intermediate consumption was revised at the NBER by using the

1972 1—0 Table and 1—0 sector level price indexes constructed by the

Bureau of Labor Statistics. The total labor costs were revised at

the NBER by adding the payrolls of Central and Auxiliary Offices for

Census years and interpolating in the intercensal years.

     One source of discrepancies between the French and U.S. industrial

data sets is that the latter are based on Census sources and not on NIPA

conventions. In particular, in the U.S. Census, the notion of "materials"

does not include all intermediate consumption, excluding especially

purchased services. Since the capital share (Sc) is computed residually,

it is somewhat too high in the U.S., perhaps by as much as a third (see

the attempt at reconciliation of value added and GNP originating in the

U.S. Census of Manufactures, 1977, Vol. 1, p. XXVII).
       The French firm sample is the result of matching two different

data sources: INSEE provided us with the balance—sheet and current

account numbers (from the SUSE files) while the Ministry of Industry

and Research provided the R&D numbers (from the annual survey on

company R&D expenditures). The U.S. firm sample is built from the

information available in the Standard and Poor's Compustat Industrial

Tape. These samples are larger than the ones actually used in Criliches—

Mairesse (1981) and Cuneo—Mairesse (1982). More details on the construc-

tion and cleaning of the samples, as well as on the definition and

measurement of the variables can be found in these two studies.

                                                                (Documentation francaise 1977)
     Development dans les entreprises industrielles en 1974"
     and from "Who does R&D and who patents?" (Bound et al, 1982). Numbers of employees
     are in thousands, R&D sales ratios in percent. RT/S refers to ratio of total R&D performed
      in the industry (whether company or public financed), while R/S refers only to company
      financed R&D. These estimates are only indicative, and can be misleading for a number of
      reasons .   First, they are not strictly comparable, since computers and nonmedical instru-
     ments are not included in our samples, while they are part of the corresponding industries.
      This explains specifically why CR/S)1 appears to be higher than (R/S)s and (R/S)R in the
       U.S. Second, they are not strictly comparable also due to the conglomerateness and the
       importance of foreign activities of many of our firms, particularly in the U.S., while
       the industry level numbers are establishment based and cover only domestic activities.
       This results in a severe overestimation of the coverage ratios in the U.S., but is not
       enough to change the finding that the proportion of R&D doing firms in the industries
       considered is much less in France than in the U.S. Third, the cutoff point between R&D
       and non#R&D doing firms seems somewhat higher in France than in the U.S. This is not
       enough, however, to account for the finding that R&D doing firms appear to do relatively
       more R&D in proportion to their sales in France than in the U.S. Fourth, the picture
        differs across industries, the coverage and the R&D sales ratios being both much less
      for machinery than for drugs and chemicals or for electronics and electrical equipment.
