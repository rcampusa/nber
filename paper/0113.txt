This paper uses the concept of the triad census first introduced by Holland
and Leinhardt, and describes several distributions on directed graphs.
Methods are presented for calculating the mean and the covariance matrix of
the triad census for the unifonn distribution that conditions on the number
of choices made by each individual in the social network. Several complex
distributions on digraphs are approximated, and an application of these
methods to a sociogram is given.

1. Introduction
     This paper discusses some recently developed methods for the analysis
of social networks. The directed graph, or more briefly "digraph'T, a set
of "nodes" or "paints" and a set of directed "lines" or "edges" connecting
pairs of nodes, is the basic mathematical concept in this paper.
     This paper utilizes concepts of graph theory which have been found
useful in discussing social networks. Recently, many structural models of
social science have adopted the graph theory notation. These concepts will
be introduced as needed in this paper, without going into a full exposition.
Those readers unfamiliar with these ideas will find Harary, Norman, and
Cartwright (1985) a valuable reference.
     In a digraph, node i. and node j are connected with a directed line
running from i to j,   if and only if person i chooses person j according to
the sociometric choice criterion employed. Note that the d.igraph defined
here is a "binary" directed graph. The "strengths" attached to individual
choices are irrelevant. A binary digraph does not allow signed choices
(each line is designated +1 or -1) or multiple choices (each line receives
a value). It is also iortant to note that a directed line from node i to
node j does not rule out the possibility of a directed line from node j to
node i.
     The central analytical tool in this presentation is the triad census,
introduced by Holland E Leinhardt (1970). The main interest in this paper
is the random directed. graph distribution obtained as a result of condition-
ing on the number of choices made by each person. Under this distribution,
all social networks which have exactly the specified number of choices for
each person are equally likely.
                                      —2—




       Sections 3 and L of this paper are devoted to brief discussions of
various random directed graph distributions and the triad census. Section
5 shows how to calculate the first two nnnents of the triad census under
the digraph distribution mentioned above. An example of a social network
is given in section 6, and then analyzed with the distribution.

2. Notation and Definitions
       Let g denote the number of members in the group. Order the individuals
in the group from 1 to g in an arbitrary manner. Define the (gxg) sociomatnix
    as a representation of a labeled binary directed graph. (A different order-
ing of the individuals produces a sociomatrix which differs from ) by a simul-
taneous row-column permutation.) The notation i -* j imples that in the digraph
there is a directed line from node i to node j. Let the (i,j) entry of X be
defined as follows:

                       X   _{lifiJ
                             0, otherwise.

Self-choices   are   not allowed; consequently, the diagonal elements of X,

i     1,2,... ,g,   remain empty, or conveniently are set to zero.

         sets of quantities associated with X are of particular interest to
       R'o

the investigator of the group. The outdegree of node i, written X5, is the
nunber of lines in the digraph originating at node i. The indegree of node j,
written X1, is the number of lines in the digraph tenninating at node 5. The
row sums and column sums, respectively, of the sociomatrix give the outdegree
and indegree of each node. These two sets of quantities {X+} and {X+5} may
be calculated as follows:

                             E N.. ; il, 2, ...,   g

and
                                      —3—




                              E X.. ; jl, 2, ...,    g.

In a group of size g, the rnther of choices made by each person and the
niriber of choices rece:i.ved by each person, the outdegree and inde'ee,
respectively, take a value between 0 and (g-l).
          A mutual relationship between person i and person j exists when i          j
and   j    •i   in the digraph. The mutual bond is denoted by i         j. In the
sociorratrix N, this situation occurs when           l and x..rl. An asyimietnic
relationship occurs if and only if i        j or j        i but there is no mutual
relationship present. A null relationship between i and j           occurs   if there
is neither a mutual nor an asyretric bond between these persons. Let N,
A, and. N, respectively, be the niinber of mutual, asyimietric, and null
relationships in the group.
      It is possible to represent each of these three relationships graphi-
cally. These representations of pairs of nodes are conunonly referred to as
dyads. Each pair of points, and the lines connecting then, are isomorphic
to one of these three representations; consequently, the three dyad types
are often referred to as isorrorphism classes. The classes are named null,
asynirnetric, and mutual to correspond to the sociological concepts. Figure
2-1 illustrates the dyad types.

       Now   consider all possible isorrorphism classes of triples of points,
or    triads. By enuneration, it     is    easy to show that there are 16   classes.
These are illustrated in Figure 2.2. The naming convention employed in
the figure was introduced by Holland and Leinhardt (1970),         and   uses the
nuther of mutual, asy7nnetnic, and null dyads within each triad as its
basis.
     In a digraph with g nodes, there are () triads formed by selecting
each triple of nodes and all lines connecting them. Suppose each of these
tria.ds is examined in turn, and the isomorphism class of each recorded.
Let Tu denote the nuiriber of triads of type u Cu ranges over the 16 triad
types shown in Figure 2-2). The triad census T is the 16 component vector
defined by

                      T z CT003,   T012, ..,     T300).

Adhering to an established convention, the ordering of the components of T
is as follows:

                       003,   012, 102, 021D, O2lU, 0210, 11113, lllU

                       030T, 0300, 201, 12013, l2OlJ, 1200, 210, 300.            (2.1)


The trailing letters U, C, D, and T stand for, respectively, up, cyclic,
down, and transitive. The triad census is discussed in more detail in
section 4.

3. Random Digraph Distributions
       In this section several distributions on digraphs are described.
Simple distributions are presented first, followed by conditional uniform
distributions of increasing complexity. The probability mass functions
                                                                                         .

defined here are. not used in latter sections of this paper; however, a

review     of   the distributions will enable the reader to better understand

the   calculation in section 5 of the first two moments of the triad
census.
       Define Dg as the set of all labeled binary directed graphs on g
nodes. A sociornatrix X will denote the random digraph generated by the
distribution of interest. A possible value of X will be denoted by x,
with elements x1. Most of. the distributions will be described in terms
of X, whose elements are X...

       Some     of the material presented in this section is bon'owed from
Holland (1972).
      A.     Simple Distributions on

       Dg nay be considered a finite set with 2g-uj elements. The uniform

distribution,      U, on Dg with probability mass function

considers all elements of Dg as equally likely. It is perhaps simpler
to describe the    as independent, Bernoulli random variables with
                                         1/2 ; ij
                        P{X..=l}

A digraph is easily simulated under this distribution using      (3.2).

       The   uniform distribution may be generalized to a family of Bernoulli
distributions on Dg Specifically, let

                        P{X..zl}
                                         ij
                                                                             (3.3)

where 0 S          c 1. This distribution permits some directed lines in the
digraph to have greater probabilities of being present than other lines.
If Prl/2 for all if, then U is obtained. After specifying the full set
                                      —7—




of p.., these distributions are also easily simulated using uniform
pseudo-random numbers.
      Several classes of uniform distributions on digraphs can be formed
by conditioning U on certain functions of X fixed at specific values.
Let    r    x., the total number of directed lines in the digraph.

Define the random variable C as the number of lines in the random
sociomatrix X. The simplest conditional uniform distribution conditions
on the random variable C.
      The U C z       is the conditional uniform distribution which gives
equal probability to all digraphs with C lines and zero probability to
the elements of Dg with C             It has probability mass function
                                                if xC

For computer simulation, it is more informative to consider Uf
                                                                           Cx÷÷
as allocating C directed lines at random to the g(g-l) possible edges

without   replacement.
    B. The UJIL4N Distribution
     The U Mm, Ama, N=n distribution is the conditional uniform distribu-
tion which puts equal probability on all digraphs in Dg with Nm mutual,
Ama asymmetric, and Nm null dyads. Note that unless m+a+n(), the
subset   of digraphs of Dg with the given values of N, A, and N will be
empty. The U MAN distribution has been popularized by Holland and Leinhardt.
It provides a large aiicunt of conditioning, and calculations are made more
• easily than under other conditional distributions.
     To find the probability mass function of X under U MAN, number the
•() pairs of nodes in the digraph from 1 to ().              Choose   in of these numbers
                                                                                             .
                                          —8—




at random and without replacement. Mutual dyads are assigned to the m
pairs of nodes corresponding to the chosen numbers. From the remaining
(g)_ numbers, select a nujrfbers also at random and without replacement
as   asymnetnic dyads. The direction of each of these asymneiric dyads

is   decided randomly (e.g., by tossing a fair coin). The remaining pairs
whose numbers have not been chosen, are assigned null dyads. Thus UJ MAN
is   given by                 I

This distribution will   be compared to the irore             complex uniform conditional

distributions   on digraphs in section 3-E.

       The IJ {X. rr. } distribution is the uniform distribution conditional

on   a fixed set of outdegrees. Equal weight: is given to al.l d.igraphs in
Dr with X1=r1, X2rr2,..., Xg          g.      Each   r. may take on all integer
values between 0 arid (g-l). Sociometric interpersonal preference data may
be collected under either a "fixed choice" cr a "free choice" procedure.
In a fixed choice experiinent, the investigator may instruct each member in
the group to "Name your four best friends in the group". If each group
member fully cooperates then the outdegree of each node is fixed at a
specific value. A free choice experhnent places no restrictions on the
number of individuals chosen by each group member. In either situation,
the UI {X.÷} distribution is very useful in calculations because it allows
the investigator to "control' for the outdegree of each node. This outdegree
adjustment removes the effects of the procedure used to gather the data.

       D. The UI{X+.}      distribution
       The   U {X÷.zc.) distribution is identical to the UI {X.}                      distribution

excelit   that the conditioning is on the set of indegrees of X. The probabi-
lity mass    function of                is

This distribution may be simulated in a manner similar to U fX.} by regard-
ing the columns of X as stochastically independent. Conditioning on the set
of indegrees of the digraph is not as useful as conditioning on the outdegrees;
however, using the calculations of the means and variances of the triad
census developed in section 5 of this paper, the UI {X+ }                      distribution    is
helpful in approximating rrore complex conditional uniform distributions.

     E.     Complex Conditional Distributions
     There are several highly important conditional unifom distributions
that are so complex that no simple way exists for generating random digraphs
with these distributions. This section briefly discusses several of these.
     The U{X1},{X÷.} distribution simultaneously conditions on both the
indegrees and the outdegrees of the digraph. All digraphs with the speci-
fied values of {X.} and {X. } are equally J.i]cely. This distribution is
extremely important in sociometric data analysis, since it controls for both
the choices made by each group member and choices received. Ford and
FuTherson (1962) give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence
of at least one element in Dg with the specified outdegrees and indegrees.
Unfortunately, no one has been able to develop a sophisticated technqiue to
simulate this distribution.
     Also worth noting is the U N, {X1} distribution.. Since E           C

and C-.2M = A,   this distribution also controls tile total number of choices
made and the number of asignetric choices. Little is known about
even though it is important.
     Perhaps the most important distribution in sociometric data analysis
is the UM,{X.},{X.} distribution. Its value derives from the fact that
it controls for choices-made, choices-received, and mutuality. As with
UjM,{X+}, and U{X+} {X+} there is no sophisticated way to generate
random    sociomatrices under this distribution.
     To reiterate, there are many possible distributions on Dg• At the
present time, only a few of these distributions are fully understood. The
UIMAN distribution was chosen by Holland and Leinhardt (1970) because it
best approximated the UN,{X+}, fX.} distribution. Unfortunately, it does
                                         -11--


not control for either the set of indegrees or outdegrees in the digraph.
The attitude taken in this paper is that although UI MAN is the most complex
uniform distribution in use at present, sociometric data analysis should
not overlook the information to be gained from considering the
UI{X.} and              distributions.


4.   The Thiad Census
      The triad census has been effectively used in the analysis of socio-
metric   data, reducing the entire socionatrix X to a set of 16 surruary

statistics. In sections B and C, sunmiarizing some of the earlier work of

Holland and Leinhardt, various aspects of the triad census are discussed.

      A. Naming Conventions

      The U MAN distribution has been the only distribution employed for

computing the first and second moments of the triad census. Holland and

Leinhardt (1971), Davis (1970), and Davis and Leinhardt (1972) have used

the first 2 moments of the triad census for testing structural hypothesis

concerning social networks. Consequently, the convention for labeling the

16 components of the triad census utilized in Figure 2.2 is well established

in the literature, but impractical in the discussion of the UI   {X+} distribu-
tion. The labels should corrniunicate the outdegree of each node in the triad,

rather the number of mutual, asyimetric and null dyads. Figure 4.1 illustrates

the 16 isomorphism classes for 3-subgraphs with both the UIMAN   and UI{x+}
designations.    The trailing letters in the figure, N, A, C, and T, respectively,

stand for mutual, asyninetric, cyclic and transitive.

      So as not to confuse the reader familiar with the UI MAN naming convention,

the UI {X1÷} labeling scheme will not be employed in this paper. However, a

Icowledge of this new scheme will aid in the interpretation of the calcula-

tions in section 5.

 Figure 4.1: The 16 isorrorphisin classes for 3-subgraphswithUtX÷} labeling.
 The label directly under each triad is defined by the number of rnutuals,
 asymnetric, and null dyads in the triad (see Figure 2.2). The label in
 parentheses is based on the outdegree of each node in the triad: first
 digit nunber of nodes with outdegree equal to 2; second digit = number
 of nodes with outdeee equal to 1; third digit number of nodes with
 outdegree equal to 0; trailing letters further differentiate triad types.

      B. Linear Combinations of the Thiad Census
      Many quantities can be determined by ta]d.ng linear combinations of
the 16 triad frequencies of T. Suppose 2. is a vector with 16 elements.
A linear combination of T will he denoted

                    9,' T                  I 2. Tu

      Among the quantities calculable from T are g, N, A, N, C and S?, and
S2t the variances of the indegrees and outdegrees of the digraph. To
compute g, recall that there are () triads in a digraph with g nodes.
Therefore,   if i'e(l,l,. .                .,l),         then

       C. Testing Structural Hypothesis
    Perhaps the nrst inportant use of the triad census is testing
propositions about local structure in a sociornatrix. Holland and
Leinhardt originally proposed the triad census to test the proposition
that interpersonal choices tended to transitive; i.e., if person
i chooses person j   and    person j      chooses       person k, then person i should
choose person k. In their 1970 paper, the following triads were classified

as "intransitive": 02lC, 030C, 1llD, 111IJ, 120C, 201, and 210. The

occurrence of any of these 7        triad    types indicated that the group violated

the transitivity hypothesis, since each of these triads had at least one

intransitivity. Holland and Leinhardt developed a ireasure, r(                2i, which
was   used as a "transitivity index".
       They define t(9,) as follows:
                              VT—         Vp
                              -


                                   T                                                 (.5)
where L is the weighting vector that counts the number of intransitive
triads, and T and          are the mean and covariance matrix of T as computed
                                          —16—




using the U NAN distribution. A computer simulation showed that for
large g, r ( i) was approximately distributed as a standard Gaussian random
variable.
     Holland and Leinhardt (1978) generalize this procedure so that any
structural hypothesis may he tested. The triads that will inviolate
the hypothesis in question merely need to be discovered, and the cones-
ponding weighting vector found. Mazur' s (1971) proposition concerning
"close friends disagreeing" is discussed and         TCQ)   for this hypothesis is
computed for 408 sociomatrices.

5. Moments of a Thiad Census

     In this section the means, variances, and covariances of the triad

census       of a random digraph are   given, assuming that the digraph is dis-

tributed       according to the U {X+}    distribution. Also discussed are the

formulas       for the above quantities assuming that the digraph follows the
U (Xi.   }    distribution.   The section concludes with a consideration of the

moments       of a linear combination of the triad census under a general dis-
tribution, and the development of a method useful in approximating the moments
of the triad census under the unifcrm conditional distributions mentioned
in Section 3 as too difficult to work with.
     A. Notation and Few 1rivations
     There are () triads in a digraph with g nodes. Let K and L be sub-
scripts that refer to the () distinct triads of a given digraph. The
letters u and v will refer to two of the 16 isomorphism classes of the
triad census, discussed in Section 4—A. This section concludes with the
formula to be used in section C for calculating the variances and covariarices
of the 16 triad types.

     For a fixed u and v, the four probabilities defined in (5.6) for vary-
ing j provide a decomposition of the joint probability (5.4) as follows:

of the triad census under a general disfribution using the average values

     0. Derivations of Probabilities Under UI 0<.1+}
           _________________________________
     A   random digraph with the UI MAN distribution is characterized by
certain properties that greatly simplify the calculation of the quantities
(5.8)-(5.12). Consider the triad 030T illustrated in Figure 5.la.
     The 3 nodes of this triad have been Labeled, in a clockwise manner
beginning at the lower left vertex, node I., node j, and node Ic. Note
the same triad 03 OT in Figure 5. lb where the nodes j arid Ic have been
interchanged. Under the UI MAN distribution, the only relevant features
of this triad, arid in fact all triads, are the numbers of null, asymmetric,
and mutual dya.ds. Thus, the two triads in Figures 5. la and 5. lb while
distinct by a permutation of the labels attached to the nodes, are considered
identical by the UI MAN distribution. The U MAN distribution on a digraph
is "homogeneous" in the sense that it is invariant under permutations
of the labels given to the nodes.
     Now, consider the outdegree of each node in the two triads shown in
Figure 5.1. The two triads have one node with the same outdegree (node i).
In the top triad, node j has outdegree 0 and node Ic, outdegree 1. In
the bottom triad, node j has outdegree 1 end node Ic has outdegree 0.
These triads, under UI fxi. }, are obviously not invariant under permutations.
In general, the outdegree of each node changes with a rearrangement of the
node labels.
     Due to the lack of homogeneity of a digraph under UI {X+} it is
necessary to examine every triad, and every pair of triads with 0, 1, and
2 nodes in common,   to compute each term of the sums (5.8)   -   (5.11). This
is in stark contrast to the same calculations under UI MAN given by Holland
arid Leinhardt (1974). With the UINAN distribution, the probabilities
defined in (5.3) •and (5.6) do not depend on Kbr L. so that

       To illustrate the calculations of pK(u), p(u,v), p(u,v), and

      (u ,   v) under the U {X.) distribution on digraphs, some additional
notation will be needed. Let the ordered triple (i,j,k) refer to the nodes

in triad K, and the triple (i,m,n) refer to the nodes in triad L.

       First consider the quantities p(u) needed to compute E(T11). Define

the variable 0.0K) as the outdegree of node                             in triad K. Obviously, C.(K)      S
equals either 0, 1, or 2. Let c.(K) equal the actual value of 0(K). The
variables           (K) and Ck(K) are defined in a sinilar way. When no confusion
may arise, the triad in                   parentheses of CJK) and C.(K) will be dropped.

For a fixed (i,j,k), the possible values of [c,c.c1K] form a 3x3x3 array

of probabilities, with one dimension each for                                   and    There are ()

C., C., C, arñC are defined identically as in (5.16), while Ck takes on

the   values 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. (There are five variables within the brackets
in fonnula (5.20) because node k is coimtn to both triads K and L; con-
sequently, there are five nodes, not six, to consider.) There are                g(1)(3)
distinct 5x3x3x3x3 arrays of the                                probabilities. By "suntng"
all of these five dimensional arrays there remain '405 quantities necessary

of    triads K and L with 2 nodes in ccacn. Nodes j and k are the cormcn

probabilities. As before, by summing all of these four dimensional arrays,
the 144 quantities used to calculate E           (u,v) are found. The notation

11 Moments of a Triad Census under

       Once the machinery necessary for finding T and T assuming the
U CX.) distribution has been developed, it is quite simple to determine
the same first two xicments under the U CX. } distribution. Take the set
of indegrees of the digraph which are to be regarded as fixed, and assume
that this set of g numbers is actually a set of outdegrees of the digraph.
       With the above assumption, three pairs of the 16 isonorphism classes
will have to be interchanged. The other 10 triads are invariant under this
forced reversal of all directed lines. The three pairs are

                       O2lD and 021U,
                       111D and lllU,                                            (5.25)

E. Moments of a Linear Combination of a Thiad Census
      After      and T have been computed with either the UMAN, u{x.},
or            random digraph distributions, it is very sinpie to calculate the
moments of any linear combination of T. If. UT and s'T are any two linear

      Holland and Leinhardt (1974) suggest a "partial conditioningt' scheme
using a set of linear combinations as an approximation to one of the more
complex conditional uniform distributions mentioned in Section 3. They
reason that T has an approximate multivariate Gaussian distribution, because
T is a sum of "loosely correlated indicator variables". It is a well known
                                                                                          .

column   2 of Table ('4.1), we obtain an approximation to E arid p            computed under
UjM,   (X÷}. Also, if we apply the above formulas to                and u computed under
ul{x.÷i and let L be the vector B. defined in column S ofTable (14.1), we
obtain   an approximation to UI {X.},
                                   {X+}. Unfortunately, the approximation
nay be poor as we are actually conditioning on the linear combination used
to compute S, and not on the set of indegrees themselves. However, I
believe that calculations with the U {X.) distribution will be quite important
in sociometric data analysis, because of the "handle" that it gives in
approximating    the more complex distributions via          (5.29) and (5.30).

6.   Example
The data analyzed in this section were taken from Mcxinney (1948). Thenty-
nine individuals in a ninth-grade classroom were asked to "Express your)
attitude toward serving in a discussion groUp with the other members of
the class." Each student rated his/her cohorts with an acceptance, indifference,
or rejection. The (10 x 10) sociornatrix in Table 6.1 represents the "acceptances"
made by the subgroup consisting of the first ten students.        I   have chosen to
iore rejections, or negative choices, and treat them as indifferences, or
null   choices.

       In   the table, a mutual relationship between person i   and person j   is
characterized  by a M in the (i,j) and (j,i) cells. M. =      denotes the

number   of mutual relationships involving person i. A. and A . are, respec-
tively, the niriber of asyirunetric choices made by person i and the number of
choices received by person i. Figure 6.1 displays the data in the fort of a
sociograin.
     The    sociogram displays the canplex structure of this group. Persons 1, 2, 7,
and 10 form a pure M-clique. Person 6 receives S unreciprocated choices, while
person 3 makes 5 unreciprocated choices. Person 1 appears to be the individual
with the mast acquaintances in the group. Examining the individual choices
sheds little light on the group structure; however, choices 4±1, 10±9 and
105 seen out of place because of the configuration of the sociogram.
       For this sociomatrix, I found the triad census and computed T and
under UMAN and TJ{X÷}. Using these two pairs of moments and the formulas
(5.29) arid (5.30), I obtained approximations to the conditional distributions
UM, {X.} and UM, {X}, {X.}. By partially conditioning IJI MAN on the
vector gout (column 7 of Table 4.1) and partially conditioning U { Xi.} on the
vector in (column 2 of Table 4.1), I obtained the distributions which I will

are   approximations to UI M,   {      }. I next obtained the approximate distribu-
tions UI MAN,    B. by partially conditioning UI MAN on the vectors pout
and B (columns 6 and 7 of Table 4.1), and UI{X1÷}, B., rn by partially
conditioning uf {X.) on the vectors B. arid rr. UIMAN,         Pout' ! and
uJ{x.}, B., in    are   approximations to the distributions UIM, {X.}, {X.}.
Table6.2 presents the triad census and the expected value of the triad
census under these 6 distributions.
      This triad census has large numbers of 012, 0210, and 111U Priads.
This indicates that the group has a considerable number of asyrrunetric relation-
ships. The lack of 0300 triads is also of interest because the number of 0210
and 111U triads, each with two—thirds of a complete "cycle", would suggest the
opposite. The abundance of asyirmetric choices and 012 and 0210 triads can be
easily seen by examining the sociograsn in Figure 6.1. The small group size
aids in drawing conclusions from this figure. (As g increases, so does the
complexity of the group' s sociograin, and the triad census becomes more import-
ant in understanding group structure.)
      An examination of the expected values reveals that the partial condition-
ing slightly reduces the differences between the census and its expected values.
The distributions based on uJ MAN have expected values which fit the data more
closely, in that the absolute differences between the expected and observed
quantities are smaller than those found using distributions based on Uj {X1÷}.
It also appears that the differences between UI MAN and UI {X+} decrease when
examining T computed under UIMAN,
                                          pout,

changes in        and MO30T over distributions).

     I tested the structural hypotheses of transitivity and intransitivity
by computing r (s.) for th of these hypotheses using the six random digraph
distributions and the & vectors given in Holland and Leinhardt (1976).
Table 6.3 presents these results.
     The T values decrease as I partially condition UI MAN, and increase as

I partially condition UI{X.+}. This may be due to the previously mentioned
fact that T computed under the approxiirate distributions based on UI MAN
provide a better "fit" to the observed triad census.
     The example demonstrates the phenorlEnon that different conditional
distributions may produce differing T and T An investigator using the
triad census to test structural hypotheses should compute the relevant r ( L)
under a variety of distributions, and then seek an explanation for the apparent
differences or similarities of the r values.

Figure 7.1 sunlnarizes the relationships of the random digraph distributions
and the partially conditioned digraph distributions studied in this paper.
With the addition of the UJ IX) distribution, the network becomes quite
intricate. Note that the digraph distribution network is ordered so that
as one moves from the bottom to the top of the figure, the amount of condi-
tioning in each distribution increases. I have purposely left out the dis—
tributions based on UI (X+1 } in order that the network remain comprehensible.
     This paper has introduced two random directed graph distributions and
has given the methods needed to compute the first two moments of these dis-
tributions. Individuals interested in the analysis of social networks now
have powerful mathematical tools at their disposal to aid in their analyses.
The example discussed in Section 8 demonstrates some of these. These methods
show how statistical analyses can be applied to a specific field of study in
the social sciences.
