Income Tax Provisions Affecting Owner-Occupied Housing: Revenue Costs and Incentive
Effects

                                             ABSTRACT

The mortgage interest deduction, the property tax deduction, the unique treatment of capital gains
on owner-occupied homes, and the absence of taxation on imputed rent from owner-occupied homes
all influence the effective cost of housing services. They also affect federal income tax revenues and
the distribution of income tax liabilities. We draw on household-level data from the 2004 Survey of
Consumer Finances to analyze how several potential reforms would affect incentives for housing consumption
as well as the distribution of income tax burdens. Our analysis recognizes that changing the mortgage
interest deduction would induce changes in household financial behavior. We estimate that repealing
the mortgage interest deduction in 2003 would have raised income tax revenues by $72.4 billion in
the absence of any portfolio adjustments, but by only $61.9 billion if homeowners responded by drawing
down a limited set of financial assets to partially replace their mortgage debt. The revenue effects
of changing the property tax deduction similarly depend on how state and local governments alter
their mix of revenue instruments in response to federal tax reform. Our results underscore the importance
of recognizing behavioral responses when calculating the revenue costs of income tax provisions relating
to owner-occupied housing.

       Income tax provisions related to owner-occupied housing account for several of the

largest entries in the annual tax expenditure budget. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT)

estimates the tax expenditure for the home mortgage interest deduction as $73.7 billion in 2007.

For the state and local property tax deduction, the tax expenditure estimate is $16.8 billion, and

for the favorable treatment of capital gains on owner-occupied housing JCT estimate is $28.5

billion. In addition to these implications for federal revenues, federal income tax policy toward

owner-occupied housing also has first-order effects on incentives for housing consumption.

       This paper explores how current federal income tax provisions affect the after-tax cost of

owner-occupied housing as well as income tax revenues. While popular discussions often cite

the tax-deductibility of mortgage interest and property tax payments, and the significant tax

exemption for capital gains on owner-occupied homes, as the key tax benefits for homeowners,

academic studies emphasize the exclusion of the imputed rental income on owner-occupied

housing. We measure the tax subsidy to owner-occupied housing by comparing the last-dollar

user cost of housing under the current tax law with the last-dollar cost under a Haig-Simons

income tax that applies to a broadly-defined measure of economic income. The analysis is based

on household-level data drawn from the 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances and the NBER

TAXSIM model.

       The subsidy to owner-occupied housing is substantial – over twenty percent on average –

and it varies considerably by age and income. For the highest income groups the marginal cost

falls by about one-third while for the lowest income groups it declines by less than ten percent.

The differences by age are smaller and are almost all due to changing incomes, and

corresponding changes in marginal tax rates, over the life-cycle.

       We consider the effect of eliminating the mortgage interest deduction and the property

tax deduction on the user cost of owner-occupied housing and on federal income tax receipts.

The effect of both policies is sensitive to our assumption about taxpayer behavioral response. In

the mortgage interest context, Gervais and Pandey (2008) suggest that if mortgage interest were

no longer deductible, many households would retire some of their mortgage debt by drawing

down their holdings of taxable financial assets. This would in turn reduce the income tax

collected on interest and dividends and capital gains on other real or financial assets, thereby

reducing the revenue gain from repealing the mortgage interest deduction (MID). Many earlier

studies recognize that leverage on owner-occupied homes is likely to depend on the tax treatment

of mortgage interest. We explore the sensitivity of the revenue effect of repealing the MID to

alternative assumptions about the set of assets that households might sell to replace mortgage

debt, and about the returns on those assets.

       We estimate that repealing the mortgage interest deduction would raise the marginal cost

of owner-occupied housing by five percent on average if households did not change their debt-

to-value ratios. Under plausible assumptions, between one sixth and one third of that increase

would be undone by changes in leverage. The largest changes take place among higher-income

households who are more affected by the tax change and who have more discretion to make

portfolio adjustments. A key determinant of the portfolio reshuffling associated with a change in

the mortgage interest deduction is the cross-sectional correlation between mortgage indebtedness

and financial assets. Assuming no change in house prices or housing demand, we estimate that

tax revenues would increase by $910 per homeowner, or almost $62 billion, if the mortgage

interest deduction were repealed.
                                                 3


       We also estimate that repealing the property tax deduction would raise $23.8 billion, or

$350 in revenue per household, after allowing localities to substitute away from such taxes and

toward tax-deductible income taxes. Repealing the property tax deduction has a small impact on

the marginal user cost of housing for most households. It is distributed more evenly across

taxpayers than the tax increase associated with limits on mortgage interest, because almost all

homeowners who itemize claim property tax deductions, while not all such itemizers have

substantial mortgages.

       We emphasize revenue estimates and the marginal cost of housing, rather than tax

expenditures such as those estimated by the JCT, in our analysis. Tax expenditure estimates are,

by construction, “static” measures of the revenue cost of particular tax provisions. They are not

estimates of the change in revenues that would be associated with repeal of specific tax

provisions. For most deductions, the tax expenditure estimate is likely to exceed the revenue

estimate corresponding to repeal because of taxpayer behavioral response. Numerous studies,

including Altshuler and Dietz (2008), U.S. General Accountability Office (2005), and Toder

(2005), have identified conceptual difficulties with the current tax expenditure concept.

       Our paper is divided into seven sections. Section one describes the user cost framework

that underlies our analysis. Section two describes the relationship between the marginal user

cost of owner-occupied housing and the tax saving associated with homeownership. While the

user cost depends on last-dollar marginal tax rates, the tax saving is affected by the standard

deduction and infra-marginal as well as marginal tax rates. The third section describes potential

behavioral responses to changes in the mortgage interest deduction, and section four presents a

brief overview of similar issues relating to the deduction for state and local property taxes.

Section five presents our estimates of the user cost of housing under several modifications to the
                                                  4


current income tax structure, restricting either the mortgage interest deduction or the property tax

deduction. Section six presents parallel calculations of the increase in tax burdens associated

with such reforms, disaggregating households by age and income. A brief conclusion suggests

directions for future work.

1. The User Cost of Capital for Owner-Occupied Housing: Conceptual Framework and

Baseline Estimates for 2003

       The user cost of capital provides a conceptual framework for analyzing the effect of tax

rules on the cost of owner-occupied housing. It also helps to set the stage for analysis of the

revenue cost of current tax provisions. Poterba (1992), Gyourko and Sinai (2004), and many

others have used this approach to describe how tax policy parameters affect homeowners’

marginal costs of purchasing additional housing services. Since the user cost can be computed

under various tax policy regimes, it allows us to evaluate the relative tax subsidies to owner-

occupied housing in different settings.

1.1 Conceptual Framework

       We define the user cost under the current income tax regime, c, as:

(1)    c = [1 –{τded*λ + τy*(1-λ)}]*rT + (1-τy)*β + m + (1-τded)*τprop – πe

where τded is the marginal income tax rate that applies to mortgage interest and property tax

deductions, λ is the loan-to-value ratio, τy is the marginal tax rate on investment income, rT is the

risk-free interest rate, β denotes the pre-tax risk premium, m is the combined cost of depreciation

and maintenance, τprop is the property tax rate, and πe is the expected nominal house price

appreciation rate. This equation assumes that homeowners receive no benefits from property tax

payments. If, instead, property taxes were benefit taxes, with taxpayers receiving benefits valued

at 100*κ% of their property taxes, (1-τded)*τprop in (1) would be replaced by (1-κ -τded)*τprop.
                                                   5


       Equation (1) distinguishes between the marginal income tax rate that applies to mortgage

interest and property tax deductions, τded, and the tax rate that applies to investment income, τy.

For taxpayers who do not itemize their deductions for federal income tax purposes, τded = 0 even

though τy is positive. Specialized tax rules that apply to some types of investment income, such

as the current reduced rates for dividend income, may also generate differences between τy and

τded. In our calculations, we measure τded as the household’s marginal federal income tax rate on

its last dollar of itemized deductions, and τy as the marginal tax rate on its last dollar of taxable

interest income. The value of τy depends on the financial asset that we define as the alternative

investment vis-à-vis owner-occupie housing.

       Equation (1) assumes that capital gains on homes are untaxed. While homeowners with

gains in excess of $500,000 face taxation under current rules, the number of such taxpayers is

very small. For most taxpayers, most housing gains are likely to be untaxed.

       We follow Poterba (1992) and several other studies in including a risk premium in the

user cost, but our measure of the risk-adjusted cost of funds differs from that in many previous

studies which have defined the cost of funds as a weighted average of the mortgage interest rate

and a return on an alternative asset, typically a long-dated corporate or Treasury bond.

Himmelberg, Mayer, and Sinai (2005), hereafter HMS (2005), note that mortgage interest rates

reflect the risk-adjusted required return on a housing loan as well as a premium for the

borrower’s refinancing and default options. The cost of funds for a housing investment should

not include either of these . We therefore calculate the user cost by using the risk-free rate in the

bracketed term in (1) and adding a risk premium. The user cost expressions in HMS (2005) and

Poterba and Sinai (2008) differ from those in (1) because they also include a term corresponding

to the tax benefit of deducting the cost of the default and refinancing options. We exclude this
                                                6


second-order term, which has a minimal effect on the user cost.

1.2 Household-Level Data: Balance Sheets and Tax Returns

       To estimate the last-dollar user cost of owner occupied housing under the current tax

regime, we use data from the 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) and the NBER

TAXSIM model. The 2004 SCF was carried out in early 2004 and asked households about their

incomes for 2003, as well as their assets and liabilities, including owner-occupied homes and

mortgages, in 2004. The SCF sample includes 22,595 household observations, based on five

replicates for each of 4,519 underlying households. The sub-sample we analyze throughout this

study excludes 1,475 observations corresponding to households that live on a farm or a ranch or

in a mobile home, 812 additional observations for households headed by someone under the age

of 25, 64 additional observations that report having mortgages but pay no mortgage interest,

eleven additional observations with loan-to-value ratios above 1.5, and 224 additional

observations with inexplicably high or negative estimated marginal tax rates. This leaves a sub-

sample of 20,009 observations. We estimate marginal tax rates for the 2003 tax year using the

NBER TAXSIM federal and state income tax calculators and Moore’s (2003) mapping of SCF

data to tax return items.

       Our calculations of tax liabilities rely on the household’s self-reported income, asset, and

demographic characteristics. SCF households often fail to report capital income even when they

report owning financial assets that should generate that income. We use the SCF data as

reported. We have also tried imputing capital income to households based on their asset

holdings, and obtained results broadly similar to those reported below.

       Some households in the SCF report that they itemize on their tax returns even when our

analysis of their income and potential deductions suggests that their taxes would be lower if they
                                                  7


claimed the standard deduction. Other households report that they do not itemize when our

TAXSIM-based calculations suggest that they should. We categorize a household as an itemizer

if TAXSIM estimates that the household’s federal income tax liability would be lower if the

household itemized than if it claimed the standard deduction. In our data, 16,288 observations,

corresponding to 74.1 million households, self-report the same itemization status in the SCF as

we calculate using TAXSIM. However, 3,721 observations, corresponding to 22 million

households, differ. In the SCF, more households report that they itemize than actually do in

Treasury Department statistics. In the 2004 SCF, 52.7 million households self-report that they

itemize. The U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service (2005) reports 43.9

million itemizers filed tax returns in 2003. Our sample, expanded to population size, includes

just 44.5 million TAXSIM-estimated itemizers.

       We calculate last dollar marginal tax rates by adding $1000 separately to each of the

mortgage interest deduction and the property tax deduction, subtracting $1000 from taxable

interest income, and using TAXSIM to compute the resulting change in tax liability in each case.

These tax differentials are then divided by $1000 to find the last-dollar tax rates. We measure

the pre-tax cost of funds as the risk-free medium-term interest rate plus a risk premium, and we

use the ten-year Treasury bond rate as the riskless rate (rT). We assume a pre-tax risk premium

(β) of 200 basis points, a value that follows earlier studies but is admittedly not well grounded in

a calculation of risk and return trade-offs. The effective property tax rate, τprop, is assumed to be

1.04 percent, which is the population-weighted average of self-reported property taxes paid

divided by self-reported house value for each household in our SCF sample. Gravelle (2007)

finds higher average property tax rates, on the order of 1.50 percent, which would raise our

estimated user cost. We assume a depreciation and maintenance rate (m) of 2.5 percent.
                                                 8


       In 2003, the 10-year Treasury yield was 4.01 percent and the average mortgage interest

rate was 5.82 percent. The Livingston Survey showed expected CPI inflation of 1.4 percent.

Real house price inflation between 1980 and 2002, measured by averaging state-level inflation

rates computed from the OFHEO index, was 0.73 percent. We therefore assume an average

nominal house price inflation rate of 2.13 (= 0.73 + 1.40) percent.

       Table 1 reports last dollar user cost calculations for households in four different age

groups, divided on the basis of the age of the household head, and in five different income

categories based on 2003 annual household income. Household income is defined as Adjusted

Gross Income plus income from non-taxable investments, an estimate of employer contributions

for FICA, payments from unemployment insurance and workers compensation, gross Social

Security income, and any AMT preference items that can be estimated from the SCF.

       We compute each household’s last-dollar user cost and take the average across all

households in each of the various age and income categories. The table shows estimates

corresponding to the actual 2003 tax law. The average user cost is 6.0 percent, but the values for

various sub-samples range from 4.8 to 7.1 percent. Those with the highest household incomes –

more than $250,000 – display an average user cost of 4.8 percent, compared with 5.6 percent for

households with incomes of $75,000-125,000 and 6.8 percent for households with incomes

below $40,000. The user cost for the high-income households with the lowest user cost is about

two thirds as great as the user cost for the lower-income households who, as a result of their

lower marginal income tax rates and lower probability of itemization, face higher user costs.

With plausible estimates of the price elasticity of demand for housing services, the variation in

the user cost of housing in Table 1 would result in substantial tax-induced differences in housing

consumption across income groups.

1.3 The User Cost of Owner-Occupied Housing under Haig-Simons Taxation

       The extent to which the current U.S. income tax system subsidizes homeownership

depends on the alternative tax system to which it is compared. We consider a Haig-Simons

broad economic income tax base, which would include the rental value of a home as well as any

accruing capital gains while allowing deductions for economic depreciation and maintenance

expenses as well as interest and property tax payments. While the Haig-Simons tax base has a

long history as a point of reference, it seems unlikely that the U.S. would ever adopt such a broad

income tax base. In Poterba and Sinai (2008) we consider another alternative tax system in

which homeowners are subject to tax rules similar to those that apply to landlords – receiving a

deduction for maintenance and depreciation and facing taxation on their rental income, but

remaining untaxed on their accruing capital gains.

       Under the Haig-Simons tax system, homeowners would be taxed on rental income and

capital gains but they would receive more deductions than at present. The equilibrium condition

for consuming housing services is

(2)    (1–τy)*(R/P) = (1–τy)*(rT + m + τprop + β– πe).

In this expression R is the marginal rental value of a unit of housing services, and P is the market

price of one unit of owner-occupied housing. The net-of-tax value of the rental services

provided by a house, on the left side of the equality, equals the after-tax cost of providing these

services. We can define the user cost in the Haig-Simons setting, cHS, implicitly from the

relationship cHS = R/P:

(3)    cHS = rT + m + τprop + β – πe.

This user cost is independent of the household’s marginal tax rate, because the same tax rate

applies to rental income flows as to the costs of providing rental services. For the parameter
                                                  10


values we described in the last section, cHS equals 7.4 percent for all households. The differences

between 0.074 and the entries in Table 1 measure the net last-dollar subsidy to owner-occupation

under the current tax system relative to Haig-Simons taxation. Averaged over all homeowners,

the net subsidy is 1.4 percentage points, 7.4 – 6.0, or almost twenty percent. The net subsidy is

largest, on average, for high income households with the highest marginal tax rates. For

households with incomes between $125,000 and $250,000, for example, the subsidy is 2.2

percentage points, or almost thirty percent. For those with incomes less than $40,000, it is 0.6

percentage points, an eight percent decrease.

       The difference between the current user cost and that under the Haig-Simons tax base can

be decomposed into three components that provide some insight on the source of the tax subsidy.

(4)    cHS - c = τded*λ* rT + τded*τprop + {τy*(1–λ)*rT + τy*β}.

The first term is due to mortgage interest deductibility: τded*λ*rT. The second is due to property

tax deductibility: τded*τprop. The third is due to the untaxed return on the equity invested in the

house: τy*(1–λ)*rT + τy*β. The relative importance of the components due to mortgage interest

deductibility and due to the tax treatment of housing equity depends on λ, the loan-to-value ratio.

       This decomposition of the difference between (1) and (3) sheds some light on the

frequent claim that the principal source of the tax subsidy to owner-occupied housing is the

failure to tax net imputed rent. If the current tax treatment of owner-occupied housing was

modified by creating a new tax on imputed rent and allowing deductions for maintenance and

economic depreciation, the current equilibrium condition, R/P = c, would be replaced by

(R/P)*(1-τy) = c - τy*m, so the effective user cost would be (c−τy*m)/(1−τy). Defining cIR as the

user cost with “current tax rules plus a tax on imputed rent and a deduction for depreciation and

maintenance” we find:
                                                   11


(5)     cIR = [1 –{τded*λ + τy*(1-λ)}]/[1- τy]*rT + β + m + [(1-τded) /(1- τy)]*τprop – [1/(1- τy)]*πe.

The difference between (5) and the user cost under the current tax system is

(6)     cIR – c = [τy/(1- τy)]* [1 –{τded*λ + τy*(1-λ)}]*rT + τy*β

                       + [(1-τded)* τy/(1- τy)]*τprop – [τy/(1- τy)]*πe.

For a taxpayer who itemizes, and for whom τded = τy, equation (6) becomes

(6’)    cIR – c = τy*rT + τy*β + τy*τprop – [τy/(1- τy)]*πe.

Under the same simplification, (4) becomes

(4’)   cHS - c = τy*rT + τy*β + τy*τprop.

The difference between these two expressions is [-τy/(1- τy)]* πe. The user cost is higher under

Haig-Simons taxation because homeowners are taxed on their housing capital gains, but they

would not be taxed on these gains if the current tax law were modified to tax net imputed rental

income without any change in the capital gains tax rules.

1.4 Components of the User Cost

       The progressive structure of the income tax and variation in itemization rates generate

non-trivial differences across age and income sub-categories in the user cost that we observe in

Table 1, and in the corresponding subsidy relative to the Haig-Simons user cost of 0.074. Table

2 presents information on the average last-dollar tax rate on taxable interest income, τy, the

average last-dollar tax rate at which mortgage interest is deducted, τded, the fraction of

homeowners who itemize on their income tax returns, and the average loan-to-value ratio, λ.

The first panel shows that the average last-dollar tax rate on the assets that represent the

alternative investment relative to mortgage debt rises with income, generating a higher average

subsidy per dollar of housing equity for higher-income households. There is also important

variation by age, with households headed by someone between the ages of 35 and 65 facing
                                                12


average tax rates about two percentage points higher on average than those for households under

the age of 35. The average income tax rate for households headed by someone over the age of

65 is about nine percentage points lower than that for households between the ages of 50 and 65.

       The average last-dollar tax rate applicable to mortgage interest and property tax

deductions, in the second panel, follows a similar, but more exaggerated, pattern. In addition to

the income-driven variation in the underlying tax rate, the subsidy rate on deductions is affected

by whether the household itemizes. It is worthwhile for a household to itemize when its

deductions exceed the standard deduction. If total deductions are below the standard deduction,

an additional dollar of deductions does not provide any marginal tax saving. Whether a

household’s deductions exceed the standard deduction is determined in part by its housing-

related deductions, and in part by the household’s other potential deductions such as charitable

giving and state taxes. The third panel of Table 2 reports the fraction of homeowners in each

age/income cell who itemize. Poorer and older households are less likely to itemize. More than

98 percent of homeowners with income in excess of $125,000 were predicted to itemize in 2003,

compared with only 23 percent of those with incomes below $40,000. Among households

headed by someone over the age of 65, the itemization rate at incomes below $75,000 is about 38

percent. It is much lower, only about four percent, for the over-65 households with family

income below $40,000.

       The subsidy to owner-occupied housing depends in part on how much of the house is

financed with mortgage debt. Debt finance saves τded per dollar while home equity foregoes a

market return that would have been taxed at τy. The tax rate at which interest can be deducted

can be different from the rate that would apply to returns on foregone home equity. The relative

weighting on these two tax rates is determined by the loan-to-value ratio (LTV). The last panel
                                                 13


of Table 2 reports average loan-to-value ratios in our various age-income cells. LTVs decline

with age across the income spectrum, with an average value of 68.9 percent for households

headed by someone between the ages of 25 and 35 and a value of 11.6 percent for households

headed by someone over the age of 65. The average LTV in our sample is 38.7 percent. The

effect of the LTV on the overall tax subsidy to housing is complex, and depends on other

parameters. The fact that the LTV is lower at older ages, for example, means that the low value

of the mortgage subsidy rate at those ages has only a modest impact on the user cost.

2. User Cost Differentials vs. Tax Savings

       While marginal user cost calculations provide some evidence on the potential demand

effects associated with current income tax rules, they may not provide a very good guide to the

distribution of tax savings associated with these rules. Follain and Ling (1991) and many

subsequent studies have observed that the infra-marginal after-tax cost of housing services may

differ from the last-dollar cost because tax rates can change between the first and last dollars of

housing spending due to nonlinearities in the tax schedule, particularly those associated with the

switch from the standard deduction to claiming itemized deductions. Thus the tax saving for a

household that claims the mortgage interest deduction may not equal the last-dollar tax rate

applicable to the mortgage interest deduction times the amount of interest paid, because the loss

of the standard deduction may reduce the total tax saving. For taxpayers who itemize their

deductions under the current tax system, the comparison of the last-dollar user cost under the

status quo and the Haig-Simons income tax does not depend on the size of the standard

deduction – but the difference in total tax payments under the two systems does. Similarly,

whether we assume the presence of a standard deduction in the Haig-Simons setting only affects

the user costs for those who would not itemize, while it affects the tax consequences of
                                                14


homeownership for all taxpayers who do itemize.

2.1 Differences in Income Tax Payments: Status Quo vs. Haig-Simons Income Tax

       The first panel of Table 3 shows the average difference in homeowners’ income tax

liability under the current tax system and the Haig-Simons income tax without a standard

deduction, while the second panel shows the difference when the Haig-Simons tax includes the

standard deduction. The difference between the two cases, as a share of the increased tax

liability, is greater at lower than at higher incomes, because the amount of housing equity taxed

at higher incomes is greater. We compute current tax liability for each household using

TAXSIM and self-reported mortgage interest and property tax payments. We also use TAXSIM

to estimate tax liability under a Haig-Simons income tax. We set the mortgage interest and

property tax deductions to zero and assume the household would have earned a 6.01 percent

return, comprising a 4.01 percent yield on 10-year Treasury bonds in 2004 and a two hundred

basis point risk premium, on their home equity, and that this income would be taxed as interest

income. Home equity is measured as the self-reported house value less self-reported housing

debt and can be negative.

       The entries in the first panel of Table 3 show that the average tax subsidy within our age

and income cells ranges from $1,742 per household to $30,474, and averages almost $5,700 per

homeowner. Higher-income households enjoy larger tax subsidies than poorer households, with

the average subsidy approximately doubling for each income category. For example, households

earning between $75,000 and $125,000 receive less than 60 percent of the average subsidy

($5,862) of households earning between $125,000 and $250,000 ($10,704). In general, within

income category, the average subsidy rises with age. However, in some income categories, the

subsidy falls for the oldest households. This same pattern is reflected in the overall means by
                                                 15


age in the last column of the table: the oldest households receive about half as much subsidy as

do 50 to 65-year-olds, reflecting their overrepresentation in the lowest-income groups. Three

factors – higher marginal tax rates, higher itemization rates, and higher home values at the higher

income levels – contribute to the greater average value of the tax subsidy for those in the higher

income brackets. Gyourko and Sinai (2004) find that the distribution of subsidy also varies

considerably across states, cities, and towns, but the lack of geographic identifiers that are finer

than large census regions makes studying this issue with the SCF virtually impossible.

       The second panel of Table 3 shows parallel estimates assuming that the Haig-Simons

income tax retains the standard deduction at current levels. The average value of the tax savings

declines from $5696 to $4869. The difference is largest in the middle income range, when it

averages nearly one thousand dollars. The elimination of the mortgage interest and property tax

deductions is less onerous when the standard deduction provides a backstop. We have also

computed the tax savings for homeowners using a modified version of the current income tax

code, in which we suppress the standard deduction. In that case, the average subsidy under the

current tax system versus the Haig-Simons system would be $5,504.

       Aggregating the household-level subsidy to homeownership across all the nearly 68

million homeowners in the SCF, we estimate that the total tax subsidy was about $387 billion if

the benchmark Haig-Simons tax does not include a standard deduction, and $331 billion if it

does. Our estimates are substantially larger than the sum of the Joint Committee on Taxation

(2003) estimates for the tax expenditures from the mortgage interest, property tax, and capital

gains treatments of owner-occupied housing, and that sum is itself an over-estimate of the static

revenue effect of the three provisions since it neglects the interactions among them. The JCT

analysis does not consider the failure to tax imputed rent on owner-occupied homes, and it does
                                                 16


not recognize that the required return – and hence the amount of imputed income – is higher

when capital gains on owner-occupied homes are taxed. This point follows from the capital

market equilibrium condition: when capital gains on housing are taxed more heavily, owner-

occupiers demand a greater “dividend,” more rental income, on their investment. Our estimate

of the total tax subsidy is somewhat smaller than Gyourko and Sinai’s (2004) estimate of $420

billion, which was based on Census data from 2000.

2.2 Components of Tax Savings

       The distribution of subsidies by age and income in Table 3 is more skewed than the

distribution of last-dollar user costs in Table 1. The underlying reasons can be deduced from the

distributions of some of the inputs to the tax saving, which are shown in Table 4. The first panel

reports the average tax rates on interest income. The distribution looks much like that of the

analogous last-dollar tax rates, reported in Table 2. To compute average tax rates for the various

components of the current tax subsidy, we calculate measures of tax saving as the difference

between the household’s tax bill with a deduction item, such as mortgage interest, set to zero,

and the household’s actual tax bill. We then find an average tax rate applicable to mortgage

interest, which equals this tax difference divided by the total amount of mortgage interest. For

interest income, we calculate the average tax rate starting with the current reported interest

income and then adding the interest income that would be received on the equity invested in the

house if it were instead invested in taxable bonds.

       There is a larger difference between average and last-dollar rates when we consider the

tax rate applicable to mortgage interest and property tax deductions. The second panel of Table

4 presents the average rate. In every cell, the average rate is significantly lower than the last-

dollar rate reported in the second panel of Table 2, but especially for lower-income households
                                               17


and older households. That is because many of these households would not itemize in the

absence of the mortgage interest and property tax deductions. Some of their property tax and

mortgage interest payments do not generate incremental tax savings, because they are “used up”

before the household reaches a level of deductions at which itemization is warranted.

       The last panel of Table 4 reports average home values, which are another key source of

differences across age and income groups in the value of current tax subsidies. Average house

value rises with age and income, ranging from $119,400 to $1,153,000. There is a strong

positive relationship between household income and house value. Home value averages

$201,700 for families with incomes of $40-75,000, compared with $428,300 for those with

incomes between $125,000 and $250,000. The sole exception is in the highest-income category,

where the oldest households own slightly less valuable houses than do 50 to 65-year-olds.

Because older households are overrepresented in the lower income categories, house values drop

for households over the age of 65 when we do not condition on income. Because of the positive

relationships between average tax rates and income and house values and incomes, the total

subsidy, which is determined by the average tax rate times the house value, has an even stronger

positive relationship with income than do any of the individual components.

2.3 The Alternative Minimum Tax

       The alternative minimum tax (AMT) has almost no effect on our estimates of marginal

tax rates and tax savings. If we compute the current and baseline taxes with and without the

AMT, as in Table 3, our estimate of the average tax subsidy to owner-occupiers rises from $5696

to $5,740. This is because in 2003, the reach of the AMT was limited by an AMT “patch”

enacted by Congress. Our TAXSIM-based calculations suggest that 5.4 percent of taxpayers in

2003 faced the AMT, although for those with household incomes over $250,000, the percentage
                                                 18


was over 70 percent. Conditional on paying the AMT, AMT liability averaged $1,177. Since

mortgage interest is deductible under the AMT as well as the income tax, the most important

housing-related deduction is still available in the AMT.

3. Behavioral Response to Repeal or Limitation of the Mortgage Interest Deduction

       While the Haig-Simons baseline is a useful way of calibrating the total subsidy to owner-

occupied housing, most policy discussions focus on more modest deviations from the current tax

code such as repealing or limiting the mortgage interest deduction or repealing the deduction for

property taxes. We apply the user cost framework to compute changes in the marginal cost of

housing services for such proposals. We also examine the potential revenue effects of these

reforms, which depend on how these changes affect taxpayer and local government behavior.

This section considers changes in the mortgage interest deduction; the next section considers

changes in the property tax deduction. Our analysis is a partial equilibrium study of these policy

changes; Gervais (2002) addresses related issues in a general equilibrium setting.

       Dunsky and Follain (2000), Follain and Dunsky (1997), Ling and McGill (1998), and a

number of other studies suggest that households adjust their mortgage borrowing in response to

changes in the after-tax cost of mortgage debt. The price elasticity of demand for mortgage

borrowing appears to be close to -1.0; households adjust on the margin of drawing down other

financial assets to build housing equity rather than borrowing. This margin of adjustment is

particularly important for middle-aged and older households, many of whom accumulate

financial assets while also incurring substantial mortgage debt. In light of the sensitivity of

household balance sheets to the tax treatment of mortgage debt, it seems implausible to hold the

loan-to-value ratio fixed when examining the revenue effects of eliminating the deductibility of

mortgage interest. Without such deductibility, households with both financial assets and
                                                  19


mortgages would be borrowing at the pretax rate of return but investing at the after-tax rate of

return. Those with substantial financial asset holdings might draw down those assets and repay

part of their mortgage debt.

       Gervais and Pandey (2008) observe that this behavioral response implies that “static”

analysis of the mortgage interest deduction may substantially overstate the revenue gains that

would be associated with eliminating this deduction. They analyze data from the 1998 SCF and

suggest that the actual revenue cost of the mortgage interest deduction is likely to fall well below

the usual estimates. While conventional analysis applied to the 1998 SCF suggests that the tax

expenditure for mortgage interest is $50 billion in 1998, Gervais and Pandey’s (2008) preferred

set of balance sheet adjustments suggest a revenue cost of $29 billion. This calculation assumes

that households draw down liquid financial assets, tax-exempt bonds, money market funds,

business equity, and residential assets other than owner-occupied homes, and it assigns a single

rate of return to all of these assets. A more inclusive measure of the assets that could be drawn

down yields an even lower revenue estimate. Jones (1995) presents empirical evidence

suggesting important effects of non-housing asset choices on mortgage debt; this suggests that

reshuffling of assets and liabilities across the balance sheet is likely to be one response to

changes in the mortgage interest deduction.

       From the standpoint of revenue estimation, the two key questions about portfolio

adjustment are which assets households will adjust, and what rate of return they would have

earned on those assets. Gervais and Pandey (2008) consider three sets of assets that might be

subject to adjustment. All assets yield 7.3 percent per year in their analysis. We allow different

assets to yield different returns, and in particular recognize that many more liquid assets generate

relatively little income tax revenue because their yields are low. We also examine the
                                                20


distribution of the tax burdens associated with limiting the mortgage interest deduction under

various assumptions about portfolio adjustment in response to such policies, and we update the

analysis by using the 2004 SCF.

       Our starting point for the analysis of portfolio adjustment is a comparison of household

ownership of financial assets and current patterns of mortgage indebtedness. If households were

to fully draw down their holdings of taxable financial assets to increase their home equity and

avoid borrowing at the pre-tax rate of return, this comparison indicates the share of deductible

mortgage debt that could be replaced by balance sheet adjustments.

       Table 5 presents data on the ratio of financial assets to mortgage debt for three different

sets of assets that households might choose to liquidate if mortgage interest were no longer

deductible. The denominator, “mortgage debt,” is the same in all three cases: the minimum of

the household’s outstanding mortgage debt and $1 million, which is the current cap on mortgage

interest deductibility. The numerator in each corresponds to the minimum of the household’s

financial assets in a given category and “mortgage debt.” The ratio for each household is

bounded above by unity.

       Households in the 2004 SCF had $6.2 trillion in mortgage debt with potentially tax-

deductible interest. The first column of Table 5 shows that using only liquid financial assets,

such as checking and savings accounts, money market funds, and brokerage call accounts,

households could pay down about 16 percent of this debt. This would reduce the aggregate

liquid financial assets held by the repaying households by just over one third. Households with

small mortgages tend to have larger financial asset holdings, and vice versa, which contributes to

the relatively modest amount of mortgage debt pay-down in this case.

       The second and third columns of Table 5 consider what happens if households shifted not
                                                21


just liquid financial assets, but other assets as well, to repay mortgage debt. In column two, we

consider shifting from all non-retirement financial assets to repay mortgage debt, and in this case

31.2 percent of deductible mortgage debt could be repaid. This amounts to a $1.9 billion shift of

mortgage debt -- 31 percent of outstanding mortgage indebtedness. While households with large

mortgages do not have enough liquid financial assets to replace all of their mortgage

indebtedness with equity, including their less liquid assets in the balance sheet adjustment

increases the share of mortgage debt that could be retired. Households as a whole can use only

16.6 percent of their non-retirement financial assets to pay down their mortgage debt, but for the

average household it comprises more than 62 percent of their assets. In the third column, we

assume households are willing to use all non-housing, non-retirement assets to pay down

mortgage debt. This includes vehicle equity and net business equity. Now we find that

households would repay 56.1 percent of their deductible mortgage debt.

       There are two ways to evaluate the degree of portfolio substitution that might follow

changes in the tax treatment of mortgage interest. One is to use the elasticity estimates

mentioned above. Table 2 shows that the average last-dollar tax rate on mortgage interest,

averaged across households, is 14.1 percent. This makes the average after-tax cost of mortgage

interest 0.859 times the pre-tax cost; eliminating the deduction would raise the cost of borrowing

by 16.4 percent. If the elasticity of demand for mortgage borrowing is -1.0, then there would be

a 16.4 percent decline in mortgage debt, financed by changes in other assets on the household

balance sheet. This calculation could be refined by using household-level data on tax rates and

mortgage holdings.

       The other approach to estimating the potential degree of portfolio substitution in response

to a change in the tax rules affecting mortgage interest deductions is to assume that households
                                                 22


would draw down all of the assets they could in some portfolio categories. This is the approach

used in Gervais and Pandey (2008). We apply this approach as well, recognizing as noted above

that different asset categories produce different amounts of taxable income. Gervais and

Pandey’s (2008) “preferred” estimate of the potential to repay mortgage debt using other assets

implies a 42 percent reduction in the revenue cost of the mortgage interest deduction, relative to

the no-behavioral-response scenario. In our baseline analysis, we assume that all non-retirement

financial assets, but no non-financial assets, would be sold to replace mortgage borrowing. This

is likely to overstate the actual portfolio adjustment, since it is unlikely that households would

choose to set their liquid asset holdings to zero. This calculation suggests that 31 percent of the

current mortgage debt would be replaced by housing equity. If this reduction in financial assets

had the same average yield as all assets held in the household sector, the resulting revenue gain

from eliminating the mortgage interest deduction would be 69 percent of the static estimate.

However, because households would liquidate assets with below-average yields first, and

because high-tax-rate households tend have more equity available to pay down housing debt, we

estimate that the actual revenue gain will be just 85.4 percent of the static estimate.

       Households differ in their capacities to replace mortgage debt by drawing down financial

assets. For various age and income categories, Table 6 reports the fraction of deductible

mortgage debt that could be replaced by selling non-retirement financial assets. The population

average in each panel of Table 6 corresponds to the second row of Table 5. When we limit

attention to liquid financial assets, in Panel 1 of Table 6, high income and older households are

best able to substitute equity for mortgage debt. Older households usually have very little

mortgage debt. In both cases, liquid financial assets are more likely to be large relative to

mortgage debt. For example, households headed by someone over the age of 65 and making
                                                 23


more than $250,000 per year can pay off half of their deductible mortgage debt using liquid

financial assets alone. By contrast, young, poorer households can cover less than five percent of

their mortgage debt by drawing down their financial assets. The potential for asset reshuffling

rises with age and income no matter the asset category. It also expands with the size of the asset

category. When we expand the set of balance sheet components that we consider drawing down

to repay mortgage debt, we find that households with incomes above $250,000 could repay

between 68 and 96 percent of their mortgage debt by drawing down these assets.

4. Behavioral Responses to Eliminating the Deductibility of Property Taxes

       Recognizing household portfolio adjustments in response to changes in the mortgage

interest deduction can have an important effect on estimates of both the change in the user cost

and the revenue gain associated with such a policy. The same point applies to changes in the

deductibility of state and local property taxes. Feldstein and Metcalf (1987) find that sub-federal

governments alter their mix of revenue sources in response to federal income tax changes.

Metcalf (2008) reviews the subsequent literature and presents new empirical results that are

broadly consistent with those findings. If local governments shift from property taxes to sales

taxes, for example, then the user cost of owner-occupied housing will decline. From the

standpoint of a household considering the purchase of another unit of housing capital, the key

question is what taxes will be triggered by such a purchase.

       We assume that the elasticity of property tax payments with respect to their net-of-federal

income tax cost to the taxpayer, their tax price, is -1.0, so when the deductibility is eliminated,

the use of property taxes falls. For our calculations, we assume that the marginal voter has a 20

percent tax rate and itemizes, so eliminating tax deductibility of property taxes increases the net-

of-tax-rate by 25 percent, from 0.80 to 1.0. The -1.0 elasticity implies that localities would shift
                                                 24


one quarter of their property tax base to other tax instruments. Since state sales taxes, which

appear to be the most likely alternative revenue source, do not enter the user cost of owner

occupied housing, the revenue shift away from property taxation alters the user cost.

5. User Cost Estimates with Modified Mortgage Interest and Property Tax Deductions

       We apply the user cost framework to compute the increases in the marginal cost of

housing services when the deductions from mortgage interest and property taxes are restricted or

eliminated. The corresponding increases in the user costs translate into long-run changes in the

demand for housing services, which can be absorbed through lower house prices, which reduce

housing expenditures for a given bundle of housing services, or by a contraction in the quantity

of housing consumed. In principle both effects may operate.

5.1 Modifications to Mortgage Interest Deductibility (MID)

       If mortgage interest were no longer deductible but the loan-to-value ratio remained at its

current value, then the user cost would be

(7)    c’ = (1 – τy*(1-λ))*rT + (1-τy)*β + m + (1-τded)*τprop – πe.

Estimates of this user cost are reported in the top panel of Table 7. The results suggest an

increase in the user cost of about five percent, from 6.0 to 6.3 percent. The effect would be

largest on the high-income, young homeowners with high loan-to-value ratios.

       The next panel in Table 7 assumes that housing leverage responds to repeal of the MID,

as discussed above. When 31 percent of mortgage debt (on average) is replaced with home

equity, drawn from the sale of financial assets, the user cost change is smaller than the change in

the case without behavioral response. We estimate that the user cost would rise, on average, by

0.2 percentage points in this case, compared with 0.3 percentage points (0.063 − 0.060) in the

case with no adjustment. Changes in the loan-to-value ratio partly offset the tax-induced
                                                 25


increase in the after-tax cost of mortgage borrowing.

       Comparison between the first and second panels of Table 7 suggests that the balance

sheet adjustment has its largest effect on user cost for young, high-income households. For 35-

50 year olds with household income of over $250,000, the average user cost in Table 1 was 4.8

percent. The first panel of Table 7 shows that with no portfolio adjustment, this user cost rises to

5.3 percent. When we allow for balance sheet adjustments, the user cost rises to 5.0 percent –

less than half of the increase in the no-behavioral-response case. This difference would reduce

the magnitude of the housing demand effects of this policy change.

5.2 Modifications to Property Tax Deductibility

       The third panel of Table 7 considers elimination of the property tax deduction. The

average impact on the user cost is an increase of two-tenths of one percentage point, from 6.0 to

6.2 percent. There is less variation across subgroups for this tax reform than for elimination of

the mortgage interest deduction because property taxes as a share of the cost of the last dollar of

housing do not vary much with age or income whereas the mortgage interest payments’ share of

the cost varies with the loan-to-value ratio. The effects of repealing either the mortgage interest

deduction or the property tax deduction are greater at higher income levels than at lower levels,

because of these taxpayers’ higher marginal income tax and itemization rates. For those with

incomes of $250,000 and above, for example, the average user cost rises from 4.8 percent to 5.2

percent when the property tax deduction is repealed.

       The last panel of Table 7 reports user cost calculations when the property tax deduction is

repealed and there is a behavioral response on the part of state and local governments, as

discussed in the last section. We now replace (1-τded)*τprop by .75*τprop. The effect is small – for

many cells the behavioral response does not make a measurable difference. For the highest
                                                 26


income category, however, the user cost after accounting for the behavioral response is 0.002

lower. This difference could translate into a four percent increase in housing demand.

6. Revenue Calculations with Modified Mortgage Interest and Property Tax Deductions

       We now consider the revenue effects of changing both the mortgage interest deduction

and the property tax deduction, with and without behavioral response.

6.1 Eliminating the Mortgage Interest Deduction

       Table 8 describes the effects of various changes to the mortgage interest deduction. The

first panel shows the effect of repealing the mortgage interest deduction without considering the

possibility that households would adjust their debt levels when the deductibility of mortgage

interest was eliminated. The average tax increase in this case is $1065. This is about twice the

product of the mean house value ($266,000), the mean loan-to-value ratio (.387), the mean

mortgage rate (0.0582), and the mean mortgage interest subsidy rate (0.097). The product is

$581; the difference reflects the positive correlation between marginal tax rate, the size of the

house owned by a household, and the amount of deductible mortgage interest.

       Table 8 displays the heterogeneity across groups. Not surprisingly, the largest tax

payment effects are on young, high-income households. For 25-35 year olds with income

between $125,000 and $250,000, for example, the tax increase averages $7736. We estimate

that in the absence of any behavioral response, eliminating the mortgage interest deduction

would raise $72.4 billion. By comparison the Joint Committee on Taxation (2003) estimated the

tax expenditure for mortgage interest deductibility to be $69.9 billion for FY 2003.

       The next panel in Table 8 considers the effect of portfolio adjustment on the revenue cost

of the mortgage interest deduction. The calculations assume that households would shift all

available paper and liquid assets to pay down mortgage debt, up to the current cap of $1 million,
                                                27


if deductibility was eliminated. We assume that households whose available assets exceed their

mortgage debt would liquidate assets in order of yield – lowest to highest – when retiring their

mortgage debt. We estimate that if all available liquid assets were drawn down to repay

mortgage debt, the average loan-to-value ratio would fall from 38.6 to 30.7 percent. When

households liquidate their taxable financial assets to retire mortgage debt, they no longer earn

taxable income on those assets. We assume the lost taxable income equals the dollar value of the

asset that is reshuffled times the median yield on that asset as reported by all SCF households

with that asset. This approach avoids using a household’s actual self-reported yields on each

asset type, which may be subject to measurement error. Our broadest definition of assets that

might be sold to repay mortgage debt allows the possibility of a household selling a high-

yielding business to pay off low-cost mortgage debt. Our more limited asset substitution

analysis admits more limited substitution possibilities. We ignore any capital gain tax revenue

consequences from selling assets to pay down mortgage debt.

       The second panel of Table 8 shows that our estimate of the average tax increase allowing

for portfolio adjustment is $910, about 85 percent of the tax increase when we do not consider

portfolio substitution. The aggregate estimate of the revenue cost of the mortgage interest

deduction is $61.9 billion. The relatively modest impact of portfolio substitution is due to the

fact that only 16.2 percent of mortgage debt can be paid down using liquid financial assets. The

average tax increase varies substantially by age and income group. Among households between

the ages of 50 and 65 with incomes between $125,000 and $250,000, for example, the average

tax increase that we associate with eliminating the mortgage interest deduction is roughly $1780.

For 25-35 year old homeowners with over $250,000 in income, the tax increase is nearly four

times greater ($5,654). Reflecting the lower housing tax benefits among the elderly, the average
                                                28


tax increasing from eliminating the mortgage interest deduction for homeowners over 65 is only

$105, and even among those with incomes of $250,000 or more it is only $1046.

6.2 Capping the Mortgage Interest Deductions

       We next consider the tax increases associated with a cap of $500,000 per household, and

$250,000 per household, on mortgage indebtedness. Anderson, Clemens, and Hanson (2007)

discuss fixed nominal caps like these, as well as several other limits on the mortgage interest

deduction. Table 9 provides information on the share of households with mortgage debt above

various thresholds, and it demonstrates that substantial reductions in the current mortgage

interest cap would be required before this cap would affect significant numbers of households.

At present, taxpayers can deduct interest on up to $1 million of mortgage debt that is used to

purchase, construct, or renovate a house. In addition, interest on up to $100,000 of housing debt

is also deductible, even if the loan proceeds were used for non-housing purposes. This cap is

binding for only 0.2 percent of households. Even among those with income above $250,000, it is

binding for no more than 6.5 percent of any age category. Reducing the cap to $500,000 would

affect 1.6 percent of households, very few of whom have incomes below $125,000. At this level

the cap would only affect about 20 percent of the highest-income households.

       A cap of $250,000 would bind for almost seven percent of homeowners, assuming no

behavioral responses. It would be more likely to bind on younger, high-income homeowners.

Among households headed by someone between the ages of 25 and 35, for example, with

incomes above $250,000, 65 percent have mortgage debt in excess of $250,000. Even

eliminating the mortgage interest deduction would only affect 68.5 percent of homeowners. For

younger households, however, the effect would be widespread. Almost 95 percent of 25-35 year

old homeowners have mortgages, compared with 28 percent of homeowners over age 65.
                                                29


       Returning to Table 8, the bottom four panels present revenue estimates from the two

mortgage cap proposals, both with and without changes in household balance sheets. Because

the mortgage caps that we consider affect relatively few households, they have a much more

modest effect on average tax payments than the repeal of the mortgage interest deduction,

although once again the pattern shows larger effects for young, high-income households. The

second-to-last and last panels in Table 8, for example, show that a $250,000 cap on the size of

mortgages that could generate deductible interest would raise taxes on average by $2,566 without

portfolio adjustment, and $2,032 with such adjustment, for households with income above

$250,000, and by $586 and $518 respectively for households with incomes between $125,000

and $250,000. For lower income households the average tax increase is less than $150. We

estimate the aggregate revenue gain after portfolio adjustment from the $250,000 cap to be $13.6

billion. We estimate that the revenue gain from the $500,000 cap is $6.8 billion, again

recognizing portfolio adjustment.

6.3 Eliminating the Property Tax Deduction

       Table 10 considers eliminating the deductibility of property taxes. While the average

income tax saving from the property tax deduction varies across age and income categories, the

variation is less pronounced than that from eliminating the mortgage interest deduction. The

upper panel shows the distribution of tax increases assuming that local governments do not

change their property tax rates in response to the elimination of federal tax deductibility. The

average income tax saving from this deduction peaks for middle-aged homeowners, rising from

$415 for households under the age of 35 to nearly $600 for those between 35 and 65. For those

over 65, the average tax saving from the property tax deduction falls to $205, reflecting both a

decline in the deductions among older relative to younger households within each income group
                                                  30


as well as a shift in composition of the households toward lower income categories. For this

over-65 group, the tax savings from the property tax deduction substantially exceed those from

the mortgage interest deduction. The bottom panel of Table 9 repeats the estimation assuming

that localities reduce their use of property tax revenue by 25 percent. The revenue cost falls

commensurately, from an average of $468 to an average of $350. A similar reduction is seen

across all age and income categories. Because property taxes are not deductible under the AMT,

our results on repeal of the property tax deduction are more sensitive to assumptions about the

presence or absence of the AMT than our results about the mortgage interest deduction. In the

absence of the AMT, the revenue cost of eliminating the property tax deduction averages $518

assuming no behavioral response, and $393 with behavioral response. The difference between

the AMT and no-AMT cases is larger for higher-income households, for whom the AMT is more

often binding. For example, for households with incomes of $250,000 or more, the revenue cost

assuming a behavioral response is just $1696 with the AMT in place and $2414 in its absence.

       Our estimates of the aggregate revenue gains associated with repeal of the property tax

deduction are larger than the tax expenditure estimates reported by Joint Committee on Taxation

(2002). The estimate of the 2003 tax expenditure for the property tax deduction was $22.1

billion; our static revenue cost estimate is $31.8 billion.

4. Conclusion and Future Directions

       This paper examines the revenue cost of the income tax provisions relating to owner-

occupied housing, notably the deductibility of mortgage interest and property tax payments, and

their effect on the marginal cost of housing. Using data from the 2004 Survey of Consumer

Finances and the NBER TAXSIM model, it presents new evidence on the distribution of the tax

saving associated with these deductions across age and income categories. It also explores the
                                                 31


sensitivity of estimates of these tax savings to the extent of behavioral response by taxpayers, in

the case of the mortgage interest deduction, and local governments, in the case of the property

tax deduction. We find that the extent to which homeowners draw down their holdings of other

assets when mortgage interest is no longer deductible, and replace debt finance with housing

equity, is an important determinant of the revenue impact of changing this tax expenditure. The

standard assumption of no behavioral response that underlies tax expenditure analysis is likely to

overstate the revenue effects of repealing or limiting the mortgage interest deduction.

       Age- and income-related patterns of mortgage indebtedness are important for

understanding the distributional effects of restricting the mortgage interest deduction. Mortgage

debt is concentrated among younger homeowners, and many older homeowners do not even have

a mortgage. Consequently, many homeowners would face only a modest tax increase, if any at

all, if mortgage interest were no longer deductible. In contrast, the vast majority of homeowners

claim property tax deductions.

       Our analysis unfortunately makes a rather ad hoc set of assumptions about the set of

assets that households might liquidate to replace mortgage borrowing. Our findings suggest that

portfolio substitution effects can be an important factor in the revenue cost and the distributional

burden of changes in current housing-related deductions, and they underscore the need for more

empirical work measuring the key behavioral parameters related to portfolio substitution.

       Our analysis focuses on how various income tax provisions affect the user cost of owner-

occupied housing. We have only discussed potential effects of tax changes on housing demand

in passing. Many estimates, for example those reviewed in Rosen (1985), suggest that the

demand elasticity for owner-occupied housing is between -0.75 and -1.0. Our findings suggest

that particularly for high-income households in high marginal tax brackets, the user cost increase
                                                32


associated with eliminating the mortgage interest deduction, and to a lesser extent with

eliminating the property tax deduction, would lead to a substantial decline in the demand for

owner-occupied housing. These changes might lead to changes in housing demand conditional

on choosing to own not rent, and to changes in the likelihood of renting versus owning. For

lower- and middle-income taxpayers, the user cost changes and the associated changes in

housing demand are more modest. We have not incorporated changes in housing demand into

our analysis of the revenue consequences of limiting the mortgage interest and property tax

deductions. Extending the analysis to allow for such demand effects is a natural next step in

analyzing these tax code provisions.
