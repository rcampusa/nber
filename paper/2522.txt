                                   I.   Introduction

       Since Akerlof's       (1970) seminal study of the sorting effects of

prices in the used car market, the implications of adverse selection in

the presence of informational        asymmetries    has been an active area of

economic research.      This is especially true with regard to the labor

market, where Informational        asymmetries    arise naturally   between

individuals     who know their productivity and firms who don't, or           between
current employers who have learned the quality of their workers and

potential   employers who remain uninformed.          The former Informational

asymmetry appears, for example, in Weiss (1980). who shows that it can

lead firms to make rigid wage offers accompanied by layoffs.               The latter

informational    asymmetry     has been studied    by Greenwald   (1986), who

examines its dampening effect on the interfirm mobility of labor.

      Recently,    several authors      have emphasized the role of sectoral

shocks which require the reallocation of an economy's productive

resources   as an empirically Important source of unemployment           (Lilllen,

982, Summers, '986).         Such structural     unemployment   makes sense only in

the presence of some form of "friction" in the labor market, which acts

to diminish the Intersectoral mobility of labor.            Labor market

informational    asymmetries    represent   one possible source of this

friction.

      We consider the informational         asymmetry analyzed by Greenwald, but

do so in a two sector model.J This allows us to explore the

Implications    of asymmetric    information     in the presence of sectoral

shocks, the existence of which give rise to a need for reallocation of
                                         —2


the labor force across sectors2"         We show that, when current employers

have more information about worker quality than do potential employers,

sectoral shocks give rise to structural unemployment,        That is, some

workers laid off from the injured sector remain unemployed in

equilibrium despite the fact that they are of sufficient quality to be

productively employed somewhere in the economy at the prevailing wage.

The source   of'   this market failure is the inability of potential

                                                                  of
employers to distinguish the abilities of workers within the pool

unemployed.

       We also show that sectoral unemployment rates are not monotonic in

the severity of sectoral shocks.        For small shocks, unemployment
increases    in the injured sector and falls in the favored sector,

However, for larger shocks these relationships are reversed due to the

interaction of layoff and hiring decisions.        For larger shocks, firms in


the declining sector layoff more, higher ability workers, which
increases the average ability of the pool of unemployed in that
sector.     The quality effect induces firms in the favored sector to hire

from   that pool more agesslvely, substituting       these workers for

marginal incumbent      workers. This substitution reduces unemployment in
the injured sector and raises      it   in the expanding sector.
      Finally, we show that equilibrium employment decisions are not
constrained Pareto efficient. In making layoff decisions, firms in the
injured sector ignore an important externality. The marginal retained
worker has    greater ability than the average laid—off worker. Thus     if
injured   firms were to layoff more, higher quality workers, this would
                                               —3—




increase   the average       of workers that relooate in the favored
                           quality

sector. Thus from an eff iciency standpoint, even more layoffs in the
declining sector would be desirable. Adjustment assistance, in the form
of a subsidy to workers leaving employment in the injured sector,
internalizes this externality.
      We explore tnese issues in the context of a small, two sector, two

period • open economy subject to random terms of trade shocks. The model
is developed in section II.  Section XII characterizes the equilibrium
adjustment of labor markets. Section IV characterizes unemployment
rates as a function of terms of trade shocks, while section V examinem
tne efficiency role for trade adjustment assistance. Section VI
concludes.


                                     II.   The Model


        Consider     a small    open economy with two   sectors Cs - 1,2) and two
periods    t  1,2). The economy is
                 —                             endowed with a continuum of workers
with mass II. A worker is of uncertain quality q. The distribution of
quality across the economy's wcrkforce is described by the
differentiable cumulative distribution function             11(q);   let
h(q)   • 11'Cq).       Define



        1(q) '       x dHCx)/H(q).

1(q)    is the average     quality of that portion of the labor force which

includes   only workers     of quality     q    or below.     • Z(—)    is the
(finite) population mean.               Finally, we assume that       Z(q)   is concave

                has full support on the nonnegative real line.                  The concavity
and    K(q)

of    Z(q)     will be used to ensure uniqueness of the equilibrium derived

in the next section (see Remark 3).

       For     future reference define



        L(q)      f   x   dH(x).



M.L(q)       gives the economy's effective labor force counting only workers

of quality       p    or above.

         Firms are risk neutral and discount period 2                 profits   by the factor

.      Each firm requires           k    units of capital to operate; this investment

is nondepreciating and irreversible.                 K     k.N   is the economy's

                                                 N   is the number of firms in the
exogenous total capital stock, and
                                                                                  1   so that
economy.       Firms allocate themselves across sectors in period

the expected (two period) return to capital Is the same in each

sector.       There is no entry or exit of firms in perIod 2.

         The two sectors are symmetric and thus have an equal number of

firms in equilibrium.              All firms share the same production function

f(.)     which gives a firm's output as a function of its effective labor

 force.       We assume that:


          f'(•) > 0; t''(.) < 0; f'(O)                   f'()    0.



          Goods prices are given each period by the rest of the world, and
                                                                is
 units are chosen so that the first period price in each sector

distributed   draws from a cumulative distribution function                       0(P).      We

assume that    0(P)    has full support on the nonnegative real line,

      Firms make period       1       labor hiring decisIons with no information

about individual worker quality,                In response to relative price changes,

firms then make period 2 labor hiring decisions knowing the quality of

each of their own period          I    employees.      However, no firm can observe

directly the quality of workers it has not employed previously.                             As we

show below, this period 2 informational asymmetry can impede efficient

intersectoral labor movements and lead to structural unemployment in the

presence of terms of trade shocks.

      The     N    firms in each sector make Identical period                 I    hiring     arid


production decisions given a first period wage                   W.    W   is determined in


equilibrium by a (period          1)   labor market       clearing condition that          we

discuss   later.   For now we maintain the assumption of full employment in

period 1: each firm employs             m         workers.

      Observing period 2 prices             P1     and     P2,   each firm makes a period

2 employment decision.       A firm knows only the ability of its

incumbent workers.     If'   it retains workers above quality               q,          then its

effective retained labor force is                mL(q);     if a firm employs only

incumbent workers above quality             q     its output is       f(rnL(q)).

      We characterize labor market institutions as follows.                          After

observing period 2 prices, a firm makes wage offers to incumbent

workers, which they might either accept or reject.                     Different offers

might be made to different workers; a worker is "laid off"                        if'   offered a

wage below the opportunity wage,

       The   reservatior wage at      which   a worker is indifferent between
working and     not is determined by the expenditure funotioâ

           —
               e(P1,P2).

All workers are      assumed to   have identical preferences           and a   coon
reservation     utility level1"        .   ignore period       1   laying by scrkers, so

that period     2   utility depends   only on     periâd   2   prices and   labor
income.    We also assume     that each worker       possesses      a single   indivisible

unit of labor services (of varying     quality) that might be either
aupplied     or wfthheld from the labor larkeb.
       The    expenditure function     is liner hcmogenous, differenti6li

satisfies a boundary condition; e(1,p) • e(pl) and e(1,O) a

Thus       •

relevance of this will be made clear in the next section (see Remark 1).
             rejecting their wage offer from period 1 employers go to a
       Workers

sector-specific labor hiring hall. Knowing individual work history but
not worker qualtity, firms can go to either labor hiring hall and hire
new   workers   at a market clearing wags.
        Several facts about equilibrium employment decisions are apprent
from these assumptiOns. First, no labor Is ever employed at a wage
below the reeeivation wags w0. Second. retained workers are paid the
equilibrium wage in the labor hiring hall for their sector. Third, due
to symsetry, firms never hire new workers from their own sector's hiring

                  III.   Equilibrium Responses to Sectoral Shocks


        We now characterize period 2 equilibrium conditions for any pe'iod

 2 relative price realization, assuming symmetric full
                                                       employment in

 period   1
              by the       firms    in each sector.      The characterization is

 particularly simple for a second period relative price realization of

unity, i.e., in the absence of a second period terms               of'   trade shock.

This is because the quality composition of the labor hiring halls in                      the
two sectors will be identical in this            case.    Since firms never find

quality in their own sector hiring halls sufficient to generate hiring

activity, and since in the absence of a second period terms of trade

shock the quality composition of each hiring hail is the same, no -iring

will occur from either hall.          Moreover, since retained workers are paid

the equilibrium wage in the hiring hall for their sector, the economy—

wide lack of hiring activity Implies that all retained workers receive

the reservation wage
                              w0.

        Clearly for second period relative price realizations close to

one, the quality composition of each sector's hiring hall will still be

sufficiently similar to keep the hiring halls inactive, and retained

workers will still be paid their reservation wage                        We now determine
                                                                 w0.

true.     To this end, suppose that given the sectoral labor wage                        and
                                                                                    w5

each firm in sector       s    would be willing to retain all new workers above

        Define the excess demand function for labor in sector 2's nir Log

(2)     E(p)      D(e(l,p), Z(Y(l/o,m)),m) —                rnH(Y(l/p,m))

We assume for convenience that                    E(p)    is decreasing in            p   over the

range    0 < p <    p*.      This assures that there is a unique                          p   less than


p     such that excess demand is zero.


        Lemma 2.     There exists            p,        0 ( p** < p*,       such that          E(p**)

        0, E(p)    > 0    for     0 < p <         p,      and   E(p) < 0        for

        p** < p      p.

        Proof.     For    p—O,     we have that            e(1,p)    0,        Since      f'()      0,

        it follows that          •(0)        f'1(0)             and thus that

        D(e(1,p), Z(q2),m) =            .         Therefore,    E(0) =     .      For         pp      it

        follows from                                     e(i,p*) =
                           Q(p*m)1            that
                                                                     f'(mL(Z(q2)))            which

        implies in turn that            D(e(l,p*), Z(q2),m) =             0.    Thus, E(p*)        < 0.

        The lemma then follows from the fact that                      E(p)       is continuous

        in    p   and our assumption that                E(p)   is decreasing in              p   over

        the relevant range.

        Remark 2,             If     E(p)   were not decreasing in                 p     over the relevant

        range, there could exist disjoint intervals on which the

         inequalities stated in the lemma fail.                               However, E(p) > 0              for


        p       suffIciently close to zero                    nd        E(p) < 0   for       p   sufficiently
        close to              p.

         Lemma 2 establishes that the sector 2 labor hiring ball is active

and clears at the reservation wage if                              p      <   (PIP)    <               If
                     <             then there is an excess demand in this market at the

reservation wage, and so the sector 2 wage must rise to clear the

market.         Workers in sector 2            will   now be paid a wage                 w   >
                                                                                                 w0,        and

workers above                q2 = Q(w/F2,m)        will be retained.               All workers laid off

from sector 2 are hired by sector                         1    fIrms at the wage           w.     Firms in

sector      1    retain workers above quality                             at the reservation wage,
                                                                   q1

Finally, market clearing for the sector 2 labor market requires

          Lemma 3.       For a given value of       p, 0 < p <            equations (3),

        ()     and (5) have a unique solution in
                                                               q1, q2,   and    w/P2.


        Proof'.      Equation (3) establishes a monotonically increasing

        relationship between          q1   and     q2.    Equation (5) establishes a

        decreasing relationship, with              q1    going to zero as              goes to
                                                                                q2
        infinity, and        q2    going to zero as        q    goes to infinity.           Thus

        equations (3) and (5) have a unique solution in                         and
                                                                         q1            q2,

        with      w/P2    determined by equation (a).


        Remark     3.    The concavity of        Z(q)    establishes a monotonic

        relationship between         q1    and     q2    in equation (5), which

        establishes uniqueness but is unnecessary for existence.                       By

        selecting the equilibrium          with    the lowest value of         w/P2,    the

        assumption       can be dropped.

        It   may seem     paradoxical that workers from the injured sector might
be   paid a higher wage, but there is a natural intuition for this.                         Our

assumed    labor market institutions imply that workers in each sector are

paid their opportunity wage, which is determined in part by the average

quality of the stock of workers laid off from that sector.                      Layoffs are
greater in the injured sector, and since layoffs are ordered by quality,

the average quality of laid off workers in that sector is greater.

Thus, if demand for labor in the favored sector is sufficiently great,

the wage for workers in the injured sector can be higher.

      This provides a complete characterization of period 2 equilibrium

when sector 2 is the injured sector, i.e.                           >           Relationships are

following proposition.


      Proposition 1.         Let     p        (P2/P1)    and    p       satisfy    Q(p*)    1.


      Then    p* <   1    and there exists              p**, C < p** < p*,         such that:

      (a)    If    p<p       < 1/p*,          then labor hiring halls are not active

      and retained workers In both sectors are paid the reservation

      wage.

      (b)     If   p     < p < p*         or    1/p* < p < 1/p**,             then the favored

      sector hires workers laid off from the Injured sector and all

      employed workers are paid the reservation wage.

      (c)     If   0 < p <       p       or    p > 1/p**,      then the favored sector

      hires all workers laid off from the injured sector, retained

      workers in the favored sector are paid the reservation wage, and

      all workers previously employed In the injured sector are paid a

      wage above the reservation wage.

         In this section we describe the nature of the unemployment that

arises    in the second period of the model, and show that structural

unemployment can result from a terms of trade shock.                                We take structural

unemployment to refer to the situation in which a portion of the workers

laid off from the injured sector remain unemployed in equilibrium

despite the fact that they are of sufficient quality to be productively

employed somewhere in the economy at the reservation wage.

         Suppose that sector              1   is the favored sector and sector 2 is the

injured sector;             p                 < 1.        Define the sectoral effective
                                    (P2/P1)
unemployment rate in the second period as the fraction of a sector's

first period effective labor force that does not find employment

somewhere in the economy in period                     2..     The period   I       effective labor
force in each sector is                            with    q   L(O).   Thus         the period 2

        To   see how effective unemployment rates depend on the terms of
trade shock, consider first the case with the second period relative
price remaining at its first period value;                      p   —   1. Then q1   —    —

Un     the "natural" rate of unemployment in each sector. It's level
      is
reflects only the underlying quality ccmposition of the labor force.
Moreover, since the marginal product of labor is equated across sectors,
and    is equal to the reservation                wage, labor   is allocated efficiently.
Hence   the natural rate of unemployment is not structural in nature.
        Next, suppose that p < 1 and consider the favored sector, sector
1•    Frcm our previous analysis we mow that no worker laid off in the

favored sector is ever rehired by the injured sector • However, this
unemployment is not structural, because the marginal worker laid off in
sector I is of lower quality than the marginal worker retained in sector
      i.e.                                                     woricer in
2;             q2. Since the marginal productivity of a q1
                 q1
sector 1 is just equal to the reservation wage, and the marginal
productivity of that worker in sector 2 is lower, it follows that no
worker laid off in sector I can be productively employed anywhere in the

econcmy. Thus,            if struotural unemployment exists              it must   be found in
the    injured sector 2.

increasing in the size of the ahock.                 Conversely, unemployment in the

favored eector is below           the    natural rate and is decreasing               inthi   size

of    the shock.
        .Mcieover, for relative prices in             this range,           acme of   the
unemployment        in   the injured sector        is structural.           A   portion of wärkers
laid   off in sector 2          are of   sufficient quality to             be productively

employed in seotcr I •            This follows frcm q2           >

of    retained workers in sector 1 is equated to the reservation wage.

However,      the marginal retained worker in sector 2 is of higher quality

than    the   marginal retained worker in sector 1, and therefore would have

a    strictly higher marginal            product   if employed       in sector 1.

        Nevertheless,       none of the      high quality workers laid off in the

injured      sector are     picked    up by firms    in    the favored sector. High
quality laid off workers are unable to distinguish themselves                           frcm

others    in the injured sector's           unemployment pool • The average                 quality

The qualitative behavior of this ueeasre of                 inemployment depends on two
effects.
      Since sector 2 firms do not               hire any   new wor,cers from   labor hiring
halls,     q2 a Y(1/p,m)           is the marginal     retained .,orice in the injured
sector •    Thus     the fraction of worars retained in sector 2
                    is inoreasing in p. However, the fraction of laid—off
sector 2 effective workers that are rehired                 by   sector 1,
                        is deoreasing in p.21          Depending on   the relative
pZCq2)/mtCO).
strengths of these two effects, the sector 2 unemployment rate, U2,
may not be monotonic in p over the range p* ) p ) p55

Nevertheless, as p goes to p'5, p goes to dI(q2) and therefore
                                         must be inoreasing with p in
U2 must go to zero. Consequently, U2
this range that are sufficiently close to p'5.

       Note, however, that structural unemployment persists in the
injured seotqr as long as U2 > 0, since the quality composition in the
sector 2 hiring halls is unaffected by the hiring activity of sector 1
firms. Since sector       1   firms cannot directly observe the quality of an
individual worker, these firms must hire new workers arbitrarily.
Since q2   ) q1 •     there will remain workers in sector 2's unemployment
pool who could      be productively employed in sector 1 at the reservation
wage, but who   are not. Thus structural unemployment persists until
U2   is driven to zero.
      Paradoxically, unemployment in the favored sector I is also non-
monotonic in the size of the shock. That is, unemployment may increase
in sector 1 even as conditions improve in that sector • This phenomenon00cm
for relative price realizations in the intprval pt' p ( p'.
In this case, sector I firms rehire a positive quantity of labor from
sector 2, although some unemployment remains in the injured sector whose
labor hiring hall is clearing at the reservation wage. The
corresponding optimal retention rule for sector              1   firms is to equate the
marginal quality of retained workers to the average quality of new
workers; q1 — Z(q2). Since Z(q2) is increasing in the size of the
shook Cu better quality workers are laid off from sector 2), so must
be q1,    and unemployment      in sector I   must   rise.
      Finally, oonsider very large terms of trade shocks for which
0 < p < p". In this case p — irM(q2); laid off workers in sector 2
are fully rehired by firms in sector I • Thus the effective unemployment
rate in the injured sector is zero.        On   the other hand, the optimal
                                                         —21—




retention            decision for sector         1     is still to equate the marginal                                    eve e
product of incumbent workers to the reservation wage.                                     Unemployment

sector         1    persists, even though it oust                vanish   in the limit as                             p     goes

to zero.             This follows from our             assumption that the distribition of
labor quality has full support on the posItive real line.                                               Thus there

exist very low quality                  worers        wno are unproductive in sector                              I       for sri

positive price realizatLon.                     Moreover, these laid off worgers fron

sector         1    are not rehired in sector 2 where they are even less

productive.

              Figure    1    summarizes this discussion by depicting                              U1         and               as

effective unemployment declines monotonically in the favored sector

and increases monotonically in the injured sector 2.                                     For

p*   >    p > p**,           sector    1   firms substitute labor from the sector 2 niring

hail for their own marginal workers;                            U1   rises, while                 U2         eventually

falls reaching zero at                     p.    Finally, for          0 K p     K       p, 2                     remains at

zero, while                     falls asymptotically to zero.

              An inverse mirror image of these patterns characterizes

unemployment rates In the converse case where                              p >       1    and sector 2 is

the favored sector.                   Finally, note that structural unemployment, as

defined above, exists at any price realization different from unity that

leaves a positive unemployment rate in the injured sector.                                                   e summarize
these results.

      In this section     explore the possibility of welfare improving

government intervention. In particular, we examine the effects of a

government prcgi'sm to assist workers in moving frcm the injured to the
favored Sector    in the second period. ml           assistance is
                                                           adjustment
assumed to take the form It an "exit subsidy" offered to• any worker who
is willinj to leave the injw'ed sector and sesrch for work elsewhere in
the econcmy,   i.e.   go   to the labor hiring hall.
      As   noted in section          III   the   first period   of the model     is
chsracterized by full employment, with labor (and capital) symmetrically
allocated across sectors. Since the second period adjustment assistance
program will, cx ante, have symmetric effects on second period profits
in the two sectors, it Will not effect the sectoral allocation in the
first p*iod of either capital or labor (though the first period wage
will be affected) and thus will leave unaltered the first period output
levels and full   Imployment          condition that prevail absent intervention.
As such,   assuming that lump sum instruments are available for
redistribution, any changes in welfare brought about                    by   the adjustment
program will be found in the second period.

      In the presence of lump sin redistributive instrur.ents, second
period welfare is neasured by the value of production, measured at wrd
prices • plus the val a of unemployed labor • measured at the reservation
wage.    Assume     as before that sector           1    is the relatively favored sector;

        q1 ,q2,;&


        subject to iII(q2)            ii     0.

        This definition of constrained efficiency presaes that the
 tanner also cannot identify the ability of laid off workers.
Consequently, structural unemployment is consistent with this notion of
constrained efficiency. In this sense, structural unemployment might cm
viewed as an       inevitable consequence            if asyimsetric information about
workers'      abilities,    and the absence          of institutions to ooemunioate that
information.  In principle a planner could gain information on worcer's
ability by receiving ooemunications from sector 1 firms, who have a weak
incentive to be truthful, and do even better (Harris and Townsend I $1,
Holmstrom and Myerson 1983).                We    shall   show   that without intervention

equilibrium employment decisions fail our stricter definition of
constrained efficiency for sufficiently large shocks, but that a policy
of adjustment assistance can rectify this.
         Constrained efficiency requires that (favored) sector I                      firms

equate the marginal revenue product of the marginal retained worker to
the resevation wags;

(6)                    +                    a
         P1f(mI(q)          pZ(q2))q1           w0.

If        0,             labor is reallocated from the injured to the
               so that some

favored óector, then the marginal reveâue product of the average
reallocated worker must be greater than or equal to the reservation
wage;

(7)                     +
         P1f'(m14q1)         pZ(q2))Z(q2)               w0.

If  dflq2) > p     >   0,   that some but not all laid off labor from the
                              so

injured sector     is reallocated to the favored sector, then relation (7)
must hold with     equality.
      finally, a necessary condition for an optimal retention decision
in (the injured) sector 2 is

(8)      P2f'(mL(q2))q2

                                                                          •

                              is   the fraction of laid off sector              2 firms hired in

sector 1.      This condition is derived by ocmbining the first order

conditicns for     optimal         p    and       q2.
                                                           Its interpretation is that the

marginal    revenue product of a            marginal retained worker in the injured

sector    should be equal to           a weighted average of the reservation              wage and
                                                    —25—



his marginal revenue product in the favored sector.                                   This weighting

reflects tne fact that the laid off worger will be reernployed with some

probability.

         When    >   p >   o    it is straightforward to show that the

equilibrium employment decisions are constrained efficient.                                     In

equilibrium, eacn firm equates toe marginal revenue product of toe

marginal retained worker to the reservation wage, which is a necessary

condition for welfare maximization gi/en that                                    0.        Moreover,

    0     is optimal because, at these prices,                      q1 > 1(q2)              implies that

the marginal revenue product of toe average laid off worker in the

injured sector is below the reservation wage.

         The more interesting case is when                 p*   >    p   and at least some laid

off workers are reemployed in equilibrium;                      u > 0.                At the equilibrium

corresponding to these prices, condition (6)                        odds         and condition (7)

holds,    but condition (8) fails.              To see this, recall that in

equilibrium, the marginal revenue products of the marginal retained

worker in sector 2, and        at'       the average new worker in sector 1, are each

equated to market clearing wage for sector 2's labor hiring ball (w).

Moreover, this wage is equal to the reservation wage                                   (w0),    unless

unemployment is zero in sector 2, in which case                              0        1.    Since      q2 >

Thus   âondition (8)   fails in equili*itma when           p    < p*.   Too few   workers
are   hid off from the injured         sector!
        This surprising    result has a straightforward intuition.
Equilibrium layoff deoiSions are            profit—maximizing.      However, when      p>
p,    there is an externality to layoff decisions which sector                2   firms

ignore.   Laying oft more, higher quality, workers increases the average
quality of the pool of unanployed, which increases the average quality
of new workers hired in sector one. At the margin, the loss of profits
in sector   2   are of second order importance, while the gain in profits in
sector 1 is of fii'st order impbrtsncè. Thus total welfare goes up.
      We next show that an exit subsidy to workers in the injured sector

can achióve conàtriinèd efficienoy. Suppose that all Workers leaving
jobs in the injured sector 2 are paid a subsidy S. The wags to
retained workers in that sector must be raised by the full amount cf the

subsidy   to induce them tostay.            Consequently, firms in the injured
sector kiill be induced to layoff more workers, maximizing profits by
equating the marginal revenue product of the marginal retained worker to
the mirket-clearing wage in the labor hiring hafl plus the subsidy.
Other equilibrium conditions are as before. Therefore,

Comparing   this condition with condition (8),             the optimal subsidy
satisfies

         PropositIon      3.   A policy of     ad0stment assistance        is   warranted on

         efficiency grounds         whenever the second period terms of trade shock

         is of sufficient magnitude to induce some labor reallocation from

         the injured to the favored sector.



                                       VI.    Concluaton

         We   have   attempted to    explore    how   an economy responds       to a terms of
trade shock      when   current employers       know more about     the quality of tneir
workers than do potential employers located in another sector. Three
main   results               analysis. First, in such an economy,
                     emerge from our
sectoral shocks give rise to a situation in which many of those laid off
from injured sector firms fail to find employment elsewhere in the

economy, despite the fact that the value of their marginal pr0000t In

the favored sector would be greater than the prevailing wage.                      We define

this as structural unemployment.               Second, due to the interaction of

layoff    and    hiring decisions, sectoral unemployment rates are not
monotonje       in the size of sectoral shocks. Third, if the sectoral shock
is   of sufficient magnitude, a case can be made on efficiency grounds for

providing adjustment assistance to workers leaving the injured sector.
         The simple model we have developed can be extended             in several
directions, to which we believe these basic results are rcbust. We
mention here some of the potentially more interesting possibilities.
         Greenwald's (1986)     analysis suggests a couple of natural

extensiàns.                        lodeling cf labcr Markets. We have
                 The first concerns cur

modeled labor market institutions ma way that rules cut raiding by

assumption. Hcweverl cur set up is formally equivalent to the "offer

matching" assumption employed by        Greenwald   and by tlilgrcm and      Oster

(1987) in which raidsdo not occur in equilibrium; A model in which
raids can occur in equilibrium is that of Lazear (1985) due to Cirar
speoific quality attributes.         In his set up, it is    the higher quality
workers that gain interfirm mobility as a result of raidi. As such, the
possibility of iuch raids is unlikely to alter in a fundamental way the
nature of the structural unemployment that arises in our. model, which

occurs    at the   low end of   the quality spectrum.

         We   could also introduoe random quits as     in Greenwald       and Gibbons

and Katz (1987),       This would capture the idea that workers leave jobs
for other           reasons. The addition of random quits would
               exogenous
faoilitate seotoral mobility, by increasing the average quality of the
pool of unemployed in each sector, but would not resolve the fundamental
adverie selection problem that gives rise to our results. In fact, by
promoting mntereectoral hiring activity, random quits would increase the
range of price shocks for which adjustment assistance             is warranted.
         Gibbons and Katz extend     the   Greenwald model   to   two   sectors, but
assume    technological differences between sectors which          make    one sector
                                     —29—



sensitive to labor quality differences and the other not.    While toe

authors explore the intersectoral wage and mobility predictions of toe

model in the presence of random quits, one could presumably study how

such an economy responds to sectoral snocs as well.

      A third period could also be added to our model,    This would

                                                                of firms
complicate the model considerably, since the retention decision

in period 2 would provide publicly available information about worker

quality in period   3.   However, as in Greenwald's model, the addition of

a third period is likely to intensify the problem of adverse selection

in this model, reducing further the level of intersectoral labor

mobility and, as such, exacebating the degree of structural

unemployment and pushing the economy further away from its constrained

Pareto optimum.

      The role of contracts might also be considered.     Our analysis has

relied on the implicit assumption that employers cannot make credible

long—term commitments to workers.     However, allowing long—term bilateral

contracts between a firm and employees would not alter the information

                                                                    In fact
asymmetry between sectors which is at the heart of our results,

contracts might further diminish intersectoral mobility due to tnsurance

provided to workers.     On the other hand, in a multiperlod extension of

our model, contracts might in some circumstances facilitate

intersectoral mobility by enabling workers of different abilities to

self—select.

      Finally, we note that our analysis might have some implIcations

for empirical methodology.     For example, Lillien (1982) estimates a
                                        3C

linear relationship between unemployment and a measure of seotoral
shifts. The implicit underlying hypotheses is that greater sectoral
shocks   result in   more   layoffs. However, our analysis suggests that
sectoral   unemployment     rates are not generally monotonic in sectoral
shocks.    Thus a more flexible funotional form might be more appropriate

for   estimation,

      In Greenwaid's       one—sector      mode.,   worKers      change firms tecause of

      random   quit     behavior.       Absent these random quits, there would De

      no interfirm labor movement, and no need for it from the

      standpoint of economic efficiency.                 We briefly discuss random

      quits in    our    concluding section.

                                                                which
      Implicitly, we are assuming that there is a third sector,

      reservation utility is associated.

      We have modeled labor market institutions tn a way that rules cub

      raiding of retained workers by outside firms.                    Formally,     our set

      up is equivalent to the "offer matcning" assumption of Greenwald

      (1986).

      Here we make use of the fact that we are working with a continuum

      of workers Implying a "large numbers" property (Judd, 1985).

      Otherwise the concavity of the production function would induce

      "risk aversion" In hiring new workers.

      a worker who chooses to work in period                 I    receives the first period

      wage   W,    while a worker who chooses to remain unemployed receives

      the first period reservation wage                  e(1,1).     In the second period,

      a worker who was previously employed say, in sector 2, will
     receive the wage         wd       with probability        p    and the second period

     reservation wage         wm       with probability        (1       p),   where   o    is the

     probability that         p <      p*.       If the worker chooses not to work in

     the first period, he then enters period 2 thought to be the

     population mean quality q.     Since second period equilibrium
                      f     d     d
     requires that             >         such a worker would choose to

     locate in the favored sector and receive       q.   Thus, the worker
                                                 q
     will choose to work in period    if           I

                       q
     M     are not too large.

     It is convenient to work with units of effective rather than

     actual unemployment though the two measures respond to terms of

     trade shocks in a qualitatively similar fashion.

0/   This   follows from tne fact that the effective wage—price ratio for

     sector 1,       e(l,p)/Z(Y(I/p,m)),               is increasing in       p.

     These results regarding constraIned inefficiency and the

     availability of welfare improving tax instruments are an

     application of a more general analysis in Greenwald and Stigiitz

     (1986),
