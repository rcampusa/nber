1         Introduction

Financing early stage businesses involves special problems and is fundamen-

tally diﬀerent from financing investments by mature and well established

companies. Because of lacking collateral and the absence of any past track

record, and due to their informational advantages, pioneering entrepreneurs

often face severe diﬃculties in convincing banks to finance projects with

potentially high returns but high risks as well. Another problem that con-

tains the roots of business failure, is the commercial inexperience of new

entrepreneurs. They tend to be equipped with excellent technical science ex-

pertise but usually lack business experience and managerial training. Venture

capital has come to specialize in financing early stage investment. Venture

capitalists (VCs) not only supply equity finance but also provide valuable

business advice to enhance survival chances of new start-ups. Viewing start-

up investment as a key source of innovation, growth and employment, policy

makers often emphasize the need to enhance entrepreneurship and venture

capital activity.1

        A recent OECD report on Austria, for example, includes a special feature on promot-

ing entrepreneurship, see OECD (1999). Similar issues are also discussed in European

      The traditional literature on entrepreneurship, risk bearing and taxation

ignores a distinct feature of venture capital finance, i.e. the productive con-

tribution of financiers to the survival and success of start-up firms.2 The

tax literature on adverse selection in investment finance similarly excludes

an active role of financiers.3 Despite the importance attached to venture

capital by the policy community, a systematic analysis of public policy in

this context has largely been neglected. The exceptions are Gordon (1998)

and Poterba (1989a,b). Gordon points to the importance of tax avoidance

through business ownership as a determinant of entrepreneurship. In this

context, he briefly addresses the implications of asymmetric information for

the availability of outside equity finance such as venture capital and also

studies the role of various tax instruments. Poterba investigates the eﬀects

of capital gains taxes on the supply of venture capital. Neither of them is

very specific on the contractual problems in VC finance. Both abstract from

managerial support and tax incentives on this margin. Many business fail-

ures, however, result from avoidable management mistakes that originate in

the managerial incompetence of entrepreneurs in the early stages of their

career. An active role of VCs in providing valuable business advice might

be an important factor in raising survival chances of start-up businesses. It

thus seems interesting to ask which factors determine the incentives to pro-

vide advice. Could taxes and other government activity improve upon such

incentives and, thereby, boost survival rates by improving the ‘quality’ of

venture capital finance?

       This paper extends the existing literature on entrepreneurship and tax-

ation in allowing for an active role of financiers and providing an analysis

of various tax policy initiatives. We propose a stylized general equilibrium

model of entrepreneurship and venture capital, featuring two sectors: one

producing ‘traditional’ goods and another entrepreneurial sector where an

‘innovative’ good is produced with an inherently risky technology, and where

informational problems loom large. The model conforms well with some im-

portant stylized facts of venture capital finance.4 Financiers provide start-up

among others. Gompers and Lerner (1999) provide a systematic account of how the

venture capital industry works.

finance in exchange for an equity share. The typical arrangement consists of

a low base salary combined with profit participation. In financing a portfo-

lio of companies, venture capital funds are able to diversify risk and could,

in principle, fully insure the entrepreneur. Risk diversification, however, is

limited by the extent of moral hazard in the relation between entrepreneur

and financier. The equity contract must thus be structured to retain the

entrepreneur’s full committment and eﬀort in the face of a moral hazard

problem that results from entrepreneurial eﬀort being non-observable and

non-verifiable. While the entrepreneur’s eﬀort certainly is critical for the

venture to have any positive survival chance at all, the financier also con-

tributes with valuable business advice to further enhance survival rates.5

       Apart from solving incentive problems with respect to entrepreneurial

eﬀort, the venture capital contract must be suﬃciently generous to attract
   5
       In focusing on the advisory activity and tax incentives, the paper obviously neglects

other important aspects of venture capital finance such as two-sided moral hazard between

entrepreneurs and venture capital firms [e.g. Repullo and Suarez (1998)], or stage financing

and convertible debt [e.g. Cornelli and Yosha (1997)]. Venture capital firms are also

intensively screening projects. The eﬀects of taxes in such a context are discussed in the

above mentioned literature on investment with adverse selection, although the intensity

of screening is usually not considered.

entrepreneurs in the presence of alternative career opportunities. Agents may

either go for a safe worker’s salary in the traditional sector or opt for an en-

trepreneurial career with potentially high rewards but high risk as well. The

equilibrium solution with occupational choice splits the population into en-

trepreneurs, consultants and workers and endogenously determines the qual-

ity of venture capital finance (i.e. the extent of managerial advice). We then

investigate the eﬀects of a broad range of tax instruments such as diﬀeren-

tial wage and corporate income taxes, progressive taxation, incomplete loss

oﬀsets, an investment subsidy and an output subsidy to portfolio companies.

The paper now proceeds with presenting the model in section 2. Section 3

discusses the eﬀects of proportional taxes on the equilibrium level of man-

agerial advice and venture capital backed start-up investment. Section 4

addresses the welfare implications of policy. Section 5 considers incomplete

loss oﬀset and progressive taxation. Section 6 summarizes and discusses fu-

ture research.

2     The Model


2.1    Definitions


Overview: The economy consists of two sectors, producing ‘traditional’

and ‘innovative’ goods, respectively. A deterministic Ricardian technology is

available for production of the traditional good with one unit of labor yielding

one unit of output. Choosing the standard good as a numeraire, its price

and the wage rate are both equal to one. Innovative goods result from an

entrepreneurial activity which is inherently risky and requires a fixed start-up

investment on top of the entrepreneur’s input. Each entrepreneur pursues

exactly one venture that yields one unit of output with probability p and

nothing with probability 1 − p. Projects will fail with certainty, however, if

entrepreneurs choose not to devote full eﬀort and attention to their venture.

    Households are risk averse and choose to become workers or entrepreneurs.

Since entrepreneurs pursue only one project, they face an undiversifiable in-

come risk. No income accrues if the venture fails. In face of this existential

income risk, entrepreneurial activity can emerge only if financial intermedia-

tion provides suﬃcient insurance. Assuming project risks to be stochastically


                                       6
independent, financiers are able to partially insure entrepreneurs by financing

a diversified portfolio of projects. By the law of large numbers, the aggregate

economy is free of risk.



Risk, Eﬀort and Advice: Survival probability p is assumed to depend

on eﬀort e which cannot be verified and contracted by an outside investor.

A minimum amount 0 < δ < 1 of the entrepreneur’s time input is freely

observable. Only the rest of time 1 − δ is under discretion and is assumed

not to be observable by outsiders. High eﬀort means that, in addition to the

basic activity δ, the entrepreneur also devotes 1 − δ of her time exclusively to

the venture. Low eﬀort or shirking means that it is directed to some lucrative

outside activity. Only high eﬀort implies a positive survival chance p > 0,

while low eﬀort results in business failure for sure, p = 0. We suppress the

eﬀort variable in the probability p, knowing that it is positive only if the

entrepreneur supplies high eﬀort. In addition to the entrepreneur’s eﬀort,

we also postulate a productive contribution of the VC consisting of some

managerial services a:6


      p = p (a) ,      p0 > 0 > p00 ,        p (0) = p0 > 0,   lim p (a) < 1.   (1)
                                                               a→∞




Taxation of Portfolio Company: A corporate income tax (CIT) at rate

τ and an output subsidy of σ to innovative goods give an expected net income

of the portfolio company equal to


                        (1 − τ ) (pQ(1 + σ) − b) − (1 − z) K,


where Q is the consumer price of innovative goods. Profits are reduced by

the entrepreneur’s base salary b. Setting up a business also requires a fixed

start-up investment K, part of which is subsidized with an investment tax

credit at rate z. Investment demand is for traditional goods. In case of

business failure, the company runs up a loss equal to the base salary and the

start-up investment cost net of taxes. At this stage, we assume that VCs can

oﬀset any losses against income from successful projects.



Taxation of Venture Capitalist: Entrepreneurs have no funds of their

own. To get the firm started, the VC must thus inject equity in the amount

  6
      We use p0 as a short-hand for dp/da.


                                              8
of I = (1 − τ ) b+(1 − z) K, which is in exchange for a share 1−s of the com-

pany’s cash flow. The VC earns gross revenues (1 − s) Q (1 + σ) and pays

CIT on her own expected operating profits equal to τ [(1 − s) (1 + σ) pQ − a]

where equity purchases equal to I are not deductible. VC firms hire a ‘con-

sultants’ per project to supply business advice. Note that the VC calculates

with expected profits because she is assumed to hold a diversified portfolio

of start-up companies that eliminates all income risk on her part. For each

project, her expected, net of tax profit is


            Π = (1 − τ ) [(1 − s) pQ (1 + σ) − b − a] − (1 − z) K.        (2)


The entrepreneur’s income directly subtracts from the amount of income that

may possibly be claimed by the VC. The expected cost of entrepreneurial

compensation to the VC is


                        c = (1 − τ ) [spQ (1 + σ) + b] .                  (3)


It will prove useful to write expected, net profits of the VC firm as


                Π = (1 − τ ) [pQ (1 + σ) − a] − (1 − z) K − c.            (4)



Taxation of Entrepreneur: Apart from a base salary b, the entrepreneur

receives income from her equity share s in the company. Suppose, for sim-

                                       9
plicity, that the CIT rate τ is equal to the personal tax rate on capital

income. There is no further tax burden at the individual level. The en-

trepreneur’s base salary, however, is subject to a wage tax at rate t. Expected

entrepreneurial income net of taxes thus amounts to


                     cN = s (1 − τ ) pQ (1 + σ) + (1 − t) b.                   (5)



Demand: Agent i with income Yi consumes quantities Ci and Di of tradi-

tional and innovative goods, respectively. Demand derives from utility max-

imization subject to a budget constraint, (Ci + QDi ) (1 + v) ≤ Yi , where v

is the rate of a uniform consumption tax. Being endowed with preferences

u = ln (u0 · C α D1−α ), where u0 = α−α (1 − α)−(1−α) for convenience, agents

spend

                                                                £            ¤
(1 + v) Ci = αYi ,   (1 + v) QDi = (1 − α) Yi ,   Vi = ln Yi −ln (1 + v) Q1−α .

                                                                               (6)

Indirect utility Vi is concave in disposable income Yi . The logarithmic spec-

ification of utility implies constant relative risk aversion equal to unity.



Labor Allocation: Given our technological assumptions, and with L de-

noting the number of workers and E the number of entrepreneurs, the supply

                                       10
of traditional goods is L and that of innovative goods S = pE. Apart from

the entrepreneurial input, production of the innovative good is enhanced by

managerial advice which requires aE consultants in total. The production

possibilities are thus traced out by an allocation of labor satisfying the re-

source constraint. Given a population of mass one, labor market clearing

requires

                                     1 = L + (1 + a) E.                          (7)



Income: All agents potentially receive profits Πi from ownership of VC

firms which will be zero, however, in equilibrium with free entry. Apart from

this, individual disposable income depends on the agent’s occupation. A

worker obtains a safe salary equal to the wage rate net of the wage tax t, i.e.

Yi = 1 − t + Πi .7 The entrepreneur’s income is risky and equal to cN + Πi in

expected value. Given symmetry within each occupational group, aggregate

disposable income is8

                Y =             Yi di = cN E + (1 − t) (L + aE) + ΠE.            (8)

                                             11
The aggregate budget constraint reads (C + QD)(1 + v) = Y .



Public Sector: The government collects taxes and hands out subsidies.

Any net revenue is rebated as a consumption subsidy. It will become apparent

that a proportional consumption subsidy with a uniform rate is neutral and,

thus, allows to isolate the allocative eﬀects of other distortive taxes.9 The

government budget constraint is


τ (pQ (1 + σ) − b − a) E + t (L + (b + a) E) + v (C + QD) = σQpE + zKE.

                                                                                      (9)

Apart from the salaries of L workers, both the base salary b of each en-

trepreneur and the wage income of aE consultants are liable to the wage tax

at rate t. While tax revenue from each project is risky, the government’s

revenue is deterministic since the law of large numbers consolidates stochas-

tically independent risks.



Market Clearing: Commodity market clearing requires


                              C + KE = L,          D = pE.                          (10)
   9
       Lump-sum per capita transfers, in contrast, are not neutral because they aﬀect the

incentive compatible provisions of the equity contract. They are introduced in section 5.

                       Y = (1 + v) (QpE + L − KE) .                          (11)


To verify Walras’ Law, substitute the budget constraint (C + QD) (1 + v) =

Y into (11) and get (C + KE − L) + Q (D − pE) = 0. The sum of valued

excess demands is zero.



2.2     Venture Capital Activity


2.2.1   Incentive Contract


The following sequence of events determines individual decision making. Oc-

cupational choice comes first. Workers receive a safe wage, set their consump-

tion levels and derive utility as in (6). If agents opt for an entrepreneurial

career, they approach a VC to fund their project. An equity share and base

salary is negotiated, and the VC promises to support the venture with a veri-

fyable level of advice. Given the contractional arrangement, the entrepreneur

chooses eﬀort and the VC supplies managerial advice. Next, risk is resolved

and state-dependent income determined. Knowing income, consumption and

welfare of entrepreneurs is given by (6).

                                      13
       The VC buys an equity stake 1 − s at a cost I that covers both the

entrepreneur’s base salary b and the fixed start-up investment K. The remu-

neration of entrepreneurs is optimally specified in a venture capital contract

and must provide suﬃcient incentives for their participation and eﬀort. To

maximize profits in (4), the VC chooses s and b as well as a level of advice

a. Her maximization problem is conveniently decomposed into two stages.

For any given level of advice, she first minimizes the cost c of obtaining the

entrepreneur’s participation. Knowing how contract cost depends on advice,

she then chooses a to maximize profits. The second stage of profit maximiza-

tion is taken up in the next subsection.

       In contracting with the entrepreneur (agent), the VC (principal) struc-

tures the terms of the contract to solve the incentive problems arising from

asymmetric information. Given the entrepreneur’s other job opportunities,

the contract must be generous enough to secure her participation. For this

reason, the contract cost in part reflects the foregone alternative income

such as a worker’s safe salary equal to net wages,10 Yi = 1 − t. To retain sur-

vival chances of start-ups, remuneration of entrepreneurs must also provide
  10
       From now on, we set Πi = 0. Profits are zero in the competitive VC sector with free

entry.


                                             14
suﬃcient incentives for high eﬀort. However, the contract cannot be made

contingent on non-verifiable eﬀort, but only on freely observable outcome.

If eﬀort is high, the VC thus concedes a gross income to the entrepreneur

equal to sQ(1 + σ) + b if the venture succeeds but only b if it fails, where b

is a safe, but moderate base salary. If the entrepreneur shirks, the business

always fails. In this case the entrepreneur is left with the base salary b only,

but may reap some outside wage from tacitly working 1 − δ of her time in

manufacturing, giving b + 1 − δ in total. With taxes, the entrepreneur’s net

income is lower. A proportional wage tax at rate t is subtracted from all

sources of wage income while the CIT cuts into profit income. Defining


                  θ ≡ s (1 − τ ) Q(1 + σ),     β ≡ (1 − t) b,              (12)


the entrepreneur receives an expected income of cN = pθ + β net of CIT and

personal wage taxes if eﬀort is high. The expected net cost to the VC is

c = pθ + (1 − τ ) b and may diﬀer from cN because of taxes. Since the base

salary is deductible from the CIT, the eﬀective cost to the VC is (1 − τ ) b

while the entrepreneur receives (1 − t) b. The problem of the VC is now to




                                      15
obtain the venture at minimum cost,11

   c = minθ,b pθ + (1 − τ ) b               s.t.

             P C : p ln (θ + β) + (1 − p) ln (β) ≥ ln (1 − t) ,                           (13)

              IC : p ln (θ + β) + (1 − p) ln (β) ≥ ln (β + (1 − δ) (1 − t)) .

The contract must specify profit participation and base salary such that

both the participation (PC) and incentive compatibility (IC) constraints are

satisfied. The PC compares expected utility derived from entrepreneurship

with utility from a safe worker’s salary. The IC is fulfilled if expected utility

from supplying high eﬀort is no lower than utility from shirking. Given that

the VC cannot observe shirking, the base salary must be paid in all cases.

Income from shirking thus consists of the base salary plus any outside income

that the entrepreneur would derive from working 1−δ of her time somewhere

else.

       As a benchmark, we first consider the full information case. When the

principal can costlessly verify eﬀort, the contract may be conditioned on
  11
       Given indirect utility as in (6), the constraints should take into account the logarithm

of the consumer price index, − ln(1 + v) − (1 − α) ln Q. These terms, however, cancel out

on each side. The consumption tax — and indeed the CPI — are neutral with respect to

the contract! Only net income flows matter.


                                               16
eﬀort without any incentive problems. Since the principal holds a fully di-

versified portfolio of companies while the risk-averse agent pursues a sin-

gle project only, it is eﬃcient to provide insurance. The PC requires θ =
         ¡         ¢
(1 − t) b b−1/p − 1 . Minimizing cost then gives an optimality condition
               £                 ¤
1 − τ = (1 − t) p + (1 − p) b−1/p . The VC’s marginal cost of raising the

base salary is 1 − τ while the other side gives the savings from reducing the

entrepreneur’s profit participation in return. Only if tax rates are equal do

we have full insurance with a base salary equal to gross wages (b = 1) and a

zero profit share (θ = 0). However, if tax rates diﬀer, entrepreneurs and VCs

no longer agree on the value of safe income. If the wage tax rate exceeds the

CIT rate, the VC will shift some risk to the entrepreneur even in the absence

of incentive problems, because the VC’s eﬀective cost of providing a safe

salary exceeds the amount that the entrepreneur obtains net of taxes. Put

diﬀerently, the entrepreneur prefers low taxed profit income over high taxed

wage income and will accept some risk in exchange for the tax advantage. In

Figure 1, the slopes of the PC and the cost line diﬀer at the full insurance

point.

   With asymmetric information, both constraints are binding whence we



                                     17
obtain the solution by computing the intersection of them. Figure 1 illus-

trates. Moving away from full insurance along the PC, the reduction of the

base salary must be compensated by ever higher profit shares such that ex-

pected income exceeds the safe alternative by a premium to reward for risk

bearing. If τ = t, we have c = cN , and expected income cN from the eq-

uity contract exceeds the net wage of a worker by the risk premium. For

an analytical solution, substitute the definition of β and get ln (1 − t) =

ln [β + (1 − δ) (1 − t)] or b = δ. The PC then gives 1 − t = (θ + β)p β 1−p , or

       ¡          ¢                   dθ     θ                dθ   dθ

We note some immediate implications for tax incidence. The base salary

just compensates for the opportunity cost in terms of foregone wages of the

entrepreneur’s basic time input δ and is exogenous. For a given survival rate

p, the entrepreneur’s profit income θ depends only on the base salary net of

the wage tax. Since θ = s (1 − τ ) Q(1+σ), the CIT is thus fully shifted to the

VC while the entrepreneur is compensated by an increase in the profit share

to obtain the same overall income in case of success. Similarly, the output

subsidy σ fully accrues to the VC while the entrepreneur is able to capture


                                      18
not even part of it. In contrast, a higher wage tax reduces the alternative

income and allows the VC, ceteris paribus, to cut the entrepreneur’s profit

share and still retain her participation and high eﬀort. The burden of the

wage tax lies as much with entrepreneurs as with workers. In equilibrium,

however, the survival rate is endogenously determined which will then aﬀect

the described pattern of tax shifting.

   The overall contract cost that the VC must incur to attract the en-

trepreneur determines her residual expected income and willingness to invest.

It depends on taxes. In raising survival chances p (a) through more intensive

managerial advice, the VC herself may control the cost. Appendix A proves

the following properties:



Proposition 1 (Cost of Contract) The cost c (p; τ, t) = pθ + (1 − τ ) b of

incentive compatible compensation of the entrepreneur satisfies

           dc                d2 c         dc     pθ        dc
    c0 ≡      < 0,   c00 ≡        > 0;       =−     < 0,      = −b < 0.
           dp                dp2          dt    1−t        dτ


   There are two oﬀsetting influences of p on cost. On the one hand, a

higher survival rate raises cost since high income must be paid with higher

probability. On the other hand, when project risk declines, the principal

                                         19
may ensure participation of the entrepreneur with a smaller risk premium.

The VC is therefore able to squeeze the entrepreneur’s profit share in the

                    ∂θ
successful state,   ∂p
                         < 0. The second eﬀect dominates and marginal cost

falls. Furthermore, the cost function is unambiguously convex in the survival

rate. The wage tax allows to cut the entrepreneur’s profit share and, thereby,

reduces the VC’s contract cost since it makes the alternative career option

less attractive. The CIT also squeezes cost. Since the base salary is tax

deductible in the portfolio company, the government eﬀectively pays for part

of it. Note finally that contract cost is completely independent of the output

subsidy σ to innovative goods. The subsidy boosts the company’s cash flow

in case of success but the VC simply cuts the profit share and appropriates

all of it.



2.2.2        Managerial Advice


Only successfully launched businesses eventually contribute to the VC’s rev-

enues. According to (1), however, VCs may themselves contribute to higher

survival chances of their portfolio companies and strengthen their revenues

by giving business advice. In raising the survival rate, more advice also allows



                                       20
to squeeze the entrepreneur’s risk premium over safe wage income by making

entrepreneurial income more certain, whence the venture may be obtained

at a lower contract cost. Advice, however, is costly and results in operating

costs gross of taxes equal to a per project. The profit maximizing level of

advice is most easily analyzed by rewriting (4) as

                                                       c (p; t, τ ) + (1 − τ ) a + (1 − z) K
Π = max p [(1 − τ ) Q(1 + σ) − m] ,              m≡                                          .
            a                                                             p
                                                                                         (15)

We refer to m as cost to market which is the expected cost incurred in order

to produce one unit of the innovative good. On average, one must start 1/p

projects to accomplish this. Apart from savings in contract cost, an increase

in the survival rate now reduces cost to market because a smaller number

of projects need to be started for each successful one. The necessary and

suﬃcient conditions for the VC’s advisory activity are, thus,12

                   Π0 = p0 {(1 − τ ) Q(1 + σ) − m} − pm0

                          = p0 [(1 − τ ) Q(1 + σ) − c0 ] − (1 − τ ) = 0,

The second order condition is fullfilled by the curvature properties of p (a, g)

and c(p; t, τ ).



2.3     Equilibrium

Zero Profits and Managerial Advice: As long as they make additional

profits, VCs attract ever more entrepreneurs E and generate more business

start-ups. In equilibrium, the price of innovative goods must satisfy the zero

profit condition relating to (15),


                            (1 − τ ) Q (1 + σ) = m.                        (17)


With free entry and zero profits, the cost m of bringing a venture to the

market must be equal to the producer price net of the CIT. The intensity of

managerial advice and the equilibrium market price are solved recursively.

Imposing the zero profit condition (17) on the individual optimality condition

of the VC in (16) gives


                   Π0 = −pm0 = p0 (m − c0 ) − (1 − τ ) = 0,                (18)


where c depends on a only via its eﬀect on p. With taxes given, this equation

autonomously fixes the level of managerial advice. In equilibrium, the VC’s

                                      22
marginal benefit of supplying more advice is p0 (m − c0 ). More advice boosts

survival rates which directly reduces cost to market, and does so indirectly

as well, since a lower risk allows to cut the profit share of the entrepreneur.

In providing more advice, the VC incurs a marginal cost equal to 1 − τ . Once

the level of advice is known, p, c, and m are determined which, in turn, fixes

the demand price Q according to (17).



Number of Entrepreneurs: We impose labor market clearing and bud-

get constraints and solve for the number of entrepreneurs that equilibrate

the market for innovative goods. Walras’ Law then implies market clearing

for standard goods as well. Given neutrality of the consumption tax, equi-

librium will be independent of its rate. We start with the observation in (6)

that agents spend a fixed share of disposable income (1 + v) (C + QD) = Y
                                                         (1−α)Y
on innovative goods. Spending is thus QD =                 1+v
                                                                  = (1 − α) Y G where

Y G ≡ C + QD = Y − v (C + QD) denotes gross factor income.13 Before

we equate demand and supply, we compute gross income by replacing the

consumption subsidy from the government budget in (9). Using (8), (7),
  13
       To rebate tax revenues, the government gives a consumption subsidy, i.e. v < 0. A

consumption tax is charged only when an output or investment subsidy must be financed.



                                            23
(5) and (12), disposable income is Y = [pθ + (1 − t) b] E + (1 − t) (1 − E)

where the zero profit condition, by way of (15) and (13), implies pθE =

[(1 − τ ) (pQ(1 + σ) − a − b) − (1 − z) K] E. Taking vY G from (9) and re-

placing L from (7), gross income emerges as


                Y G = Y − vY G = 1 + pQE − (1 + a + K) E.


Equate supply and demand in the entrepreneurial sector, pE = (1 − α) Y G /Q.

Note in particular that in zero profit equilibrium, managerial advice, survival

probability, contract cost c and cost to market m are all autonomously deter-

mined by (18) independently from the rest of the model. Figure 2 illustrates

the solution for the untaxed equilibrium with the number of entrepreneurs be-

ing the equilibrating variable. In this case, gross income is Y G = 1+(c − 1) E.

A part (1 − α) /Q of demand is autonomous but it increases with E for the

simple reason that average income of entrepreneurs exceeds wages by a risk

premium c − 1. The demand schedule is flatter than the supply curve such

that the equilibrium number of entrepreneurs given by the intersection is

smaller than unity. By the zero profit condition (17), the number of en-

                         1−α
trepreneurs is E =   1−α+a+K+αc
                                  < 1. By the same steps, entrepreneurship in




                                       24
the taxed equilibrium is given by

                                                                     αpm
        1 − α = E · Ω,         Ω ≡ (1 − α) (1 + a + K) +                         .       (19)
                                                                (1 − τ ) (1 + σ)



3        Entrepreneurship


3.1        Cost to Market

The recursive structure of the model greately simplifies policy analysis. Cost

to market and managerial advice may be solved independently of the rest of

the model. Note that (18) is equivalent to m0 = 0 which is also the condition
                                                    c(p,t,τ )+(1−τ )a+(1−z)K

mization combined with free entry is, thus, equivalent to cost minimization

and yields the same level of advice.14 Applying the envelope theorem to the

minimization problem and using proposition 1 gives

dm    −θ                     dm    a+b                   dm   −K                     dm

  14
       Imposing zero profits on (16), the necessary and suﬃcient conditions of the two prob-

lems are related according to Π0 = −pm0 = 0 and Π00 = −pm00 < 0 whence the cost

function m is indeed convex.


                                              25
Wage taxation allows to cut entrepreneurial compensation since it reduces

alternative income. Wage taxes thus reduce cost to market and boost profits

of VC firms. They start to attract more entrepreneurs and will bring more

start-up companies to market. The market price falls until, in equilibrium,

profits are sqeezed to zero again and no more projects are funded. Because

the base salary and advisory costs are tax deductible, the CIT eﬀectively

subsidizes these expenditures and reduces cost to market as well. A subsidy

z to start-up investment similarly reduces cost to market. An output subsidy

is unable to aﬀect cost to market and, thereby, the zero profit producer price.

It is completely passed on to consumers by reducing their demand price Q.



3.2    Managerial Advice


VCs not only provide equity finance but also supply valuable business advice.

Do taxes impair incentives to provide managerial advice? Condition (18)

implicitly determines the extent of consulting when market entry is free and

competition eliminates profits in VC finance. Taking the diﬀerential thereof

shows how policy induces VCs to adjust advice in equilibrium. Using the




                                      26
partials listed in (B.2) yields
                               ·               ¸

where the elasticity µ is defined in (A.2). Henceforth, we use r to denote

a comprehensive income tax, i.e. r = t = τ = z. With signs determined

in (B.2), the equilibrium eﬀects of taxation on incentives to give advice are

summarized as



Proposition 2 (Managerial Advice) In equilibrium with free entry, the

intensity of managerial advice increases with a higher corporate income tax,

while a higher investment subsidy and higher wage taxes discourage advice.

An output subsidy and a comprehensive income tax are neutral:

             da            da          da           da   da
                > 0,          < 0,        < 0,         =    = 0.          (21)
             dτ            dz          dt           dr   dσ

The CIT seemingly holds ambiguous incentives for advice. As indicated by

(15) and (18), the marginal benefit p0 (m − c0 ) of giving more advice is a

higher survival rate which saves costs, since fewer projects need to be started

for each successful one. On the one hand, a higher CIT reduces the marginal

benefit of business advice by p0 ∂m
                                 ∂τ
                                    = − (a + b) p0 /p. When start-up cost

becomes smaller due to the implicit tax subsidy associated with a higher CIT

                                      27
rate, then less is saved by raising the survival rate and the marginal benefit of

advice declines accordingly. On the other hand, since advisory costs are tax

deductible, a higher CIT rate reduces the marginal cost of advice by −dτ

and thereby encourages managerial support. The net eﬀect is positive.15

Via the eﬀect on managerial advice, the CIT tends to strengthen survival

chances of new start-ups. A comprehensive income tax avoids interfering

with VCs’ incentives since it aﬀects marginal benefits and costs of advice

proportionately.



3.3        Entrepreneurship


With an endogenous survival rate, the number of entrepreneurs E willing to

start up new projects is no longer proportional to and must be distinguished

from the number of successful projects pE. How then is tax policy aﬀecting

entrepreneurship and supply in the innovative sector? The quality of VC

finance, i.e. the intensity of consulting, determines entrepreneurial risk and

thereby aﬀects agents’ willingness to opt for an entrepreneurial career. Are

       Since x ≡ 1 − (a + b) p0 /p > 0 as shown in (B.2) of the appendix, the eﬀect of the CIT
               da
is positive,   dτ   = −x/Π00 > 0, since Π00 < 0.

tax incentives for advice in line with the tax eﬀects on occupational choice?

To build intuition, consider first the market for innovative goods in the un-

taxed equilibrium which is p (a) E = (1 − α) [1 + (c − 1) E] /m with Q = m

by the zero profit condition. In holding a constant, we identify some direct

eﬀects of taxes on the demand side. For a given number of entrepreneurs,

taxes contribute to aggregate income and boost demand if they raise the

risk premium, i.e. the income diﬀerential, of entrepreneurs. This income

eﬀect is enhanced by a price eﬀect if taxes reduce cost to market and thus

allow for a lower demand price. To eliminate excess demand, the number of

entrepreneurs must increase. The indirect eﬀect of taxes works through in-

centives for managerial advice. More intensive advice boosts survival chances

and adds to aggregate supply when a larger fraction of start-up projects is

successful. In reducing risk, more advice squeezes the income premium of en-

trepreneurs and erodes demand. Note also that a marginal increase in advice

fails to aﬀect the output price since m0 = 0. If taxes encourage more intensive

advice, they contribute to excess supply of innovative goods. The number of

entrepreneurs must decline to restore equilibrium. With these transmission

channels in mind, we now consider how various taxes aﬀect entrepreneurship

and industry supply.

Wage Tax: In the general case, we start from a taxed equilibrium. Take the
                                                                              0

As a direct eﬀect, the wage tax reduces cost to market and thereby strength-

ens demand by means of a lower output price. On the other hand, lower net

wages render the entrepreneur’s alternative career option less attractive. The

VC is thus able to save on entrepreneurial compensation which reduces de-

mand. The price eﬀect is seen to dominate, and VCs will fund more projects

and attract more entrepreneurs to restore equilibrium. The second term in

the curly bracket is an indirect eﬀect of the wage tax that stems from the

diminished incentives for managerial advice, see (21). Less intensive advice

contributes to excess demand and further stimulates entrepreneurship.

   A higher wage tax entices more start-ups but each one receives less advice

from VCs and is, thus, less likely to succeed. What is then the net eﬀect

on pE, the supply of innovative goods? Using (22) and introducing Ψ =

1 − α − pEΦ/p0 , we obtain

   d(pE)              αθ (pE)2               p0 EΨ ∂a

Ω = pQ − (1 − α) [pQ − (1 + a + K)]. Then, (19) implies 1 − α < EpQ ⇔

[pQ − (1 + a + K)] > 0. The condition holds in the untaxed equilibrium

where pQ = pm = c + a + K. In this case, pQ − (1 + a + K) = c − 1 > 0

is equal to the risk premium. By continuity, the condition will be satisfied

as long as tax rates are not too large. With a comprehensive income tax

and a zero output subsidy, i.e. t = τ = z > 0 and σ = 0, the condition

is again related to the entrepreneur’s risk premium, [pQ − (1 + a + K)] =

      −1=      1−t
                        > 0, and is therefore satisfied even for large taxes. With

the inequality 1 − α < EpQ thus established, the first two terms in Ψ are

negative and the third one is negative anyway. With Ψ < 0, the wage tax

is seen to boost output of innovative goods. The fact that the wage tax

discourages consulting, reinforces the direct eﬀects on entrepreneurship and

aggregate supply.

ship and industry supply that are induced by the CIT and the investment

An increase in the investment subsidy leads to a rise in both the number of

entrepreneurs and of successful projects. It lowers cost to market of innova-

tive goods which expands supply and attracts additional entrepreneurs. In

discouraging VC advice, the subsidy reinforces both the number of start-ups

and aggregate supply and thereby expands the entrepreneurial sector. The

CIT has opposite eﬀects. It lowers cost to market as well. However, since

it hits revenues even more forcefully, the relative market price of innovative

goods is higher which reduces output and demand for entrepreneurs.



Comprehensive Income Tax: A comprehensive income tax features com-

mon rates for the wage tax t, the CIT τ , and the investment subsidy z. A

comprehensive income tax was shown to be neutral with respect to the level

of managerial advice. It turns out that this broad-based tax with full loss

oﬀset neither aﬀects entrepreneurship nor the supply of innovative goods.

In (19), the direct eﬀect of the tax would enter through m/ (1 − r) but the


                                                32
tax factor cancels out since all terms in m including θ as given in (14) are

proportional to (1 − r). Consequently,

                                 ∂E   ∂(pE)
                                    =       = 0.                        (25)

Output Subsidy: In zero profit equilibrium with free entry of VCs, an

output subsidy σ avoids to distort incentives for advice. It aﬀects neither

survival chances nor cost to market. In subsidizing consumer prices, however,

the subsidy boosts demand for innovative goods and, thereby, encourages

entrepreneurship and aggregate supply,

Proposition 3 (Entrepreneurship) A wage tax, an investment subsidy

and an output subsidy raise the number of entrepreneurs and industry supply.

The CIT works in the opposite direction. A comprehensive income tax with

full loss oﬀset is neutral.

4    Welfare

Tax policy aﬀects the incentives of VCs to advise entrepreneurs and thereby

influences the survival rates of start-up businesses. It also aﬀects the propen-

sity of households to opt for an entrepreneurial career. What are the norma-

tive implications of tax policy from a welfare theoretic point of view? The

main complication compared to a standard competitive economy is the pres-

ence of asymmetric information in the relation between entrepreneurs and

financiers. To avoid moral hazard and to retain survival chances of start-

up ventures, the equity contract must be arranged to provide entrepreneurs

with powerful incentives for full eﬀort. For this reason, entrepreneurs must

bear risk via profit participation even though full risk diversification would

be possible in principle. In the presence of unconsolidated risk, taxation

could provide further insurance. It is expected, however, that further diver-

sification is counterproductive since it conflicts with private arrangements to

contain moral hazard. We now proceed with an explicit welfare analysis to

check this conjecture.




                                      34
The Welfare Measure: To investigate the welfare consequences of tax

policy, we analyze (ex ante) welfare of agents prior to occupational choice.16

Given a price index P = (1 + v) Q1−α , an agent with real income Yi /P derives

indirect utility Vi = ln (Yi /P ), see (6). In equilibrium, expected utility from

entrepreneurship is exactly matched by utility from a safe job in industry.

The participation constraint holds with equality. Therefore, utility Vi of a

worker which depends on the after tax real wage (1 − t) /P , is a complete

welfare measure.17 The marginal welfare eﬀect is, thus,

                                   dt   dv           dQ
                         dV = −       −    − (1 − α)    .                              (27)
                                  1−t 1+v            Q

Welfare depends on the real wage net of taxes. Tax policy thus aﬀects welfare

via three channels: (i) the after-tax wage; (ii) the consumption tax; and (iii)

the price of innovative goods. The wage tax determines (i) while (ii) and
  16
       Boadway et al. (1991) provide a welfare analysis in several models of occupational

choice.
  17
       This ex ante welfare measure also corresponds to a social welfare function which

adds up ex post utility levels of diﬀerent agents.      The population splits into 1 − E

workers and E entrepreneurs of whom pE are successful and (1 − p) E fail. Given net

income Yi ∈ {1 − t, θ + β, β}, social welfare amounts to SW F = (1 − E) · V ( 1−t
                                                                               P ) +

pE · V ( θ+β                    β
          P ) + (1 − p) E · V ( P ). Since the participation constraint binds with equality,

pV ( θ+β                β        1−t                                           1−t
      P ) + (1 − p) V ( P ) = V ( P ), social welfare is again given by V = ln( P ).



                                             35
(iii) reflect the price index. As indicated in (20), tax policy aﬀects the cost

to market m and, thereby, the price Q = m/[(1 − τ )(1 + σ)] which obtains

under perfect competition and free entry of VCs. In particular, the welfare

evaluation of taxes must take account of the fact that revenues are rebated

by means of a consumption subsidy.

      As a first step in evaluating (27), we compute the diﬀerential of the gov-

ernment budget constraint to obtain the adjustment in the consumption sub-

sidy. For the rest of this section, we start from an untaxed equilibrium posi-

tion and derive the marginal welfare eﬀects of introducing small taxes from

zero. This way, we avoid complicated tax base eﬀects that would identify the

excess burden of taxes. With small taxes, the excess burden is zero to the

first order. The remaining welfare eﬀect must then be due to other distor-

tions if there are any. The diﬀerential of the public budget constraint in (9)

is


     Y dv = − [1 − (1 − b) E] dt − (pθ + K) Edτ + KEdz + (1 − α) Y dσ. (28)


In the untaxed equilibrium, the tax base of the consumption subsidy is equal

to income Y = C + QD = 1 + (c − 1) E. By way of (7), the wage tax base

is L + (a + b) E = 1 − (1 − b) E. Using the zero profit condition Q = m plus

                                        36
contract cost c = pθ + b, the corporate tax base is pQ − b − a = pθ + K.



Marginal Taxes and Subsidies: We start with the introduction of a

small wage tax that generates revenues Y dv = − [1 − (1 − b) E] dt. With

free entry, Q = m and, by (20), dQ/Q = −θ · dt/m. Substituting into the

welfare diﬀerential in (27), and using Y = 1 + (c − 1) E and c = pθ + b, we

find

   dV        1 − (1 − b) E (1 − α) θ   (1 − α) Y θ − mpEθ
      = −1 +              +          =                    = 0,             (29)
   dt              Y          m                mY

where the last equality exploits the conditions for zero profits and equilibrium

in the entrepreneurial sector, mpE = QD = (1 − α) Y . A small wage tax,

with revenues rebated by means of a neutral consumption subsidy, boosts

the number of entrepreneurs and supply of innovative goods, but it fails to

raise welfare at the margin. There is no market distortion that would require

a wage tax to correct private decisions. Starting again from the laissez-

faire equilibrium, marginal changes in τ , z, and σ yield the same result [use

(20), (28), and the conditions for zero profits, Q = m/ [(1 − τ ) (1 + σ)], and

equilibrium in the innovative goods sector, mpE = (1 − α) Y ].




                                      37
Proposition 4 (Welfare Eﬀects of Taxes) Using a proportional con-

sumption tax or subsidy to balance the budget, and starting from an untaxed

equilibrium, the welfare eﬀects from a small wage tax, CIT, and small output

and investment subsidies are zero.




5    Extensions

Having discussed the major taxes being relevant for start-up investment by

risk-bearing entrepreneurs, we now proceed with two further scenarios. In

practice, tax systems are often restrictive to some extent in allowing VC funds

to oﬀset losses from failures against profits from successful start-ups. The

first subsection thus addresses the eﬀects on entrepreneurship, managerial

advice, and welfare when the income tax allows for less than full loss oﬀsets.

The second subsection turns to a redistributive policy that levies a propor-

tional consumption tax in order to finance a uniform per capita transfer.

This scenario mimicks an indirectly progressive tax. Obviously, such trans-

fers are relatively more important in case of failure when the entrepreneur

is left with a modest base salary only, as compared to the exceptionally

high income generated by a successful start-up. Such transfers provide wel-

                                      38
come insurance to entrepreneurs. However, risk bearing and ex post income

inequality is required to contain the moral hazard problem. It will be impor-

tant to investigate how such a redistributive tax transfer scheme interacts

with the financial arrangements of the VC contract.



Restricted Loss Oﬀsets: Consider an initial situation where a compre-

hensive income tax at rate r with full loss oﬀset is in place and revenues are

rebated by means of a proportional consumption subsidy at rate v < 0. All

other taxes and subsidies including lump-sum transfers are set to zero. The

loss oﬀset is relevant only for the VC since the portfolio company doesn’t

come into existence when the project fails. While government fully taxes

profits at rate r, VCs are denied to deduct a fraction ε of losses from their

tax liability with ε = 0 at the outset. We now consider the eﬀects of restrict-

ing full loss oﬀset by increasing ε. The income tax rate is kept constant but

the consumption subsidy adjusts to rebate any excess revenues.

   The VC injects equity I = b + K gross of taxes for a share 1 − s of

prospective returns. The VC’s profit from a successful start-up is ΠG =

(1 − r) ((1 − s) Q − a − b − K) where I is borrowed and must be subtracted.

In case of failure, she incurs a loss ΠB = − (1 − (1 − ε) r) (a + b + K) since

                                      39
only a fraction 1 − ε of losses can be oﬀset against dividends from other

projects. The VC’s expected, net of tax profit per project is thus Π =

pΠG + (1 − p) ΠB , or


Π = (1 − r) (1 − s) pQ−(1 − rγ) (a + b + K) ,       γ ≡ p+(1 − p) (1 − ε) ≤ 1.

                                                                           (2’)

Full loss oﬀset is given by ε = 0 and γ = 1 which results in (2) again when

a comprehensive income tax with τ = t = z = r is in place and σ = 0.

Appendix C now repeats in Table C.1 all those elements of the basic model

that will change due to the presence of restricted loss oﬀset and lump-sum

transfers. The modified equations are primed.

   In case of failure, the VC runs up losses of a+b+K which include her own

operating expenses for advice, the entrepreneur’s base salary, and the start-

up investment cost. When restricting loss oﬀset, the government fully taxes

profits from a successful start-up but participates relatively less in the loss

from project failure. Consequently, contract cost (13’) and cost to market

(15’) both increase when a larger share ε of losses are not tax deductible from

other revenues. Profit maximization with free entry and minimization of cost

to market are equivalent since they result in the same optimality condition

The square bracket in (18’) identifies the marginal benefit which stems from

an increase in the survival rate by p0 . The first part of the marginal ben-

efit, p0 m, reflects the fact that a higher probability of success directly re-

A higher survival chance not only squeezes the entrepreneur’s risk premium,

but also reduces the VC’s eﬀective contract cost of the base salary since a

higher survival rate makes the tax disadvantage from limited loss oﬀset hit

less likely. If the loss oﬀset is restricted further, the VC derives an even

higher marginal benefit from more advice which helps to avoid a larger tax
                                                                  0

nally, part of marginal benefits stem from avoiding the tax disadvantage of

limited loss oﬀset for costs other than the base salary, p0 r (a + K) ε. By the

same reasoning, if a larger share ε of losses is not deductible, the VC again

faces higher incentives to avoid this tax disadvantage, and marginal benefit

of advice increases by p0 r (a + K). Adding up gives the second term in the

square bracket of (21’). Restricting loss oﬀset thus increases both marginal

benefits and marginal costs of advice such that the net eﬀect is ambiguous.

   Restricting the loss oﬀset aﬀects entrepreneurship directly as well as in-

directly by its implication for managerial advice. Using the optimality con-

By (20’), a restricted loss oﬀset raises the tax cost of VC operations and

inflates cost to market. By this direct eﬀect, government discourages en-

trepreneurship and start-up investment activity. As with all other scenarios,

the indirect eﬀect on managerial advice, if it is positive, will reinforce the

direct eﬀect and further discourage start-ups. Restricting loss oﬀset, how-

ever, may as well diminish incentives for managerial support and thereby

contribute to a larger number of start-ups, each one being more risky.

ups pE. Defining Ψ = 1 − α − pEΦ/p0 < 0,19 the net eﬀect of the loss oﬀset

to sign Ψ. Expand Ω such that Ω = pQ − (1 − α) [pQ − (1 + a + K)]. Then, (19’) implies

1 − α < EpQ ⇔ [pQ − (1 + a + K)] > 0. The condition holds in the initial equilibrium

positive due to the risk premium since c = cN in the presence of a comprehensive income

tax with full loss oﬀset. With the inequality 1 − α < EpQ thus established, the first two

To summarize, the direct eﬀect of restricting loss oﬀset, i.e. increasing ε, is to

discourage entrepreneurship and retard output of the entrepreneurial sector.

This is reinforced if the limitation of loss oﬀset induces more managerial

support. Fewer entrepreneurs are needed if each project succeeds with higher

probability. However, the relation between the generosity of loss oﬀset and

the extent of managerial advice is ambiguous.

   Welfare depends on the disposable real wage. Keeping the income tax rate

constant, real wages change along with transfers and the consumer price index

as indicated in (C.6). By assumption, the government rebates tax revenues by

means of a neutral consumption subsidy. The required change in the subsidy

follows from the diﬀerential of the public budget (9’) which we usefully rewrite

as in (C.7). In analyzing the loss oﬀset, we start from a position of T = 0 and

Substituting (20’) and (32) into (C.6) yields a welfare eﬀect of

                                   .   When a comprehensive income tax with full

loss oﬀset is in place, the initial equilibrium is free of distortions. A small

restriction of the loss oﬀset provision entails negligible welfare eﬀects that

are zero to the first order.



Proposition 5 (Restricted Loss Oﬀset) Starting with a comprehensive

income tax with full loss oﬀset, restricting the loss oﬀset provision raises

cost to market and, thereby, discourages entrepreneurship and industry out-

put. However, it raises both marginal benefits and costs of managerial advice

       In the transfer scenario, we suppress the income tax (r = 0), giving a budget T =

vY / (1 + v).

and creates ambiguous incentives for consulting and entrepreneurship. The

welfare eﬀect is zero to the first order.



Lump-Sum Transfers: When the government hands out uniform lump-

sum transfers, cost to market falls according to (20’). The reasons are easily

explained in terms of figure 1. Since the disposable wage from a safe job

increases, transfers shift out the participation constraint while they do not

directly enter the incentive constraint. It is easily shown that the slope of the

incentive constraint is either negative or positive but less than unity. With

uniform per capita transfers, disposable income β in the bad state increases

one to one while income in the good state therefore rises less than one to one.

While the VC’s cost of the base salary remains unaﬀected by transfers, she

may save on the entrepreneur’s profit share θ. Alternatively, risk is reduced

if income in all states is increased by the same absolute amount, and risk

averse agents require a lower risk premium to compensate for entrepreneurial

risk bearing. Consequently, the cost of the contract to the VC falls which

translates into lower cost to market. For the same reasons, transfers reduce

marginal benefits of advice, p0 (m − c0 ), while marginal costs remain the same.

Consequently, transfers weaken the incentives to provide active consulting

                                       46
services, see (21’). With lower cost to market, VCs expand their operations

and fund more projects until increased supply squeezes prices to restore zero

profits in equilibrium. Entrepreneurship and industry output in (30) and

(31) both increase. Since equity finance comes with less intensive advice,

however, business failure is more probable. More projects must be started to

expand the industry. The negative eﬀect on consulting reinforces the eﬀects

on entrepreneurship and industry supply.

     By assumption, transfers are financed with a proportional consumption

tax. Substituting (32) into (C.6), the welfare eﬀect of a small transfer is

               −    Q ∂T
                          .   The income definition Y = 1 + (c − 1) E thus yields

                                           ∂Q
since Q = m with free entry and            ∂T
                                                 < 0 by (20’). A proportional con-

sumption tax combined with uniform per capita transfers in fact mimicks a

progressive tax that redistributes from high to low incomes. The government

is thereby able to provide further insurance of unconsolidated risk associated

with entrepreneurial income. This yields a net welfare gain that is propor-

tional to the risk premium c − 1. As taxation renders entrepreneurial income

less risky, entrepreneurs accordingly require a lower premium for risk bear-

                                            47
ing. Financiers are thus able to attract entrepreneurs at a lower cost and at

the same time retain their incentives for full eﬀort. With free entry, lower

cost to market is passed on to consumers by cutting the price Q = m where

                =   dT
                         < 0, see (20’).



Proposition 6 (Progressive Taxation) Starting from an untaxed posi-

tion, a redistributive tax transfer scheme (uniform per capita transfers fi-

nanced with a proportional consumption tax) retards managerial advice but

boosts entrepreneurship and industry output. The tax transfer scheme reduces

unconsolidated risk and raises welfare.


       The welfare gains from the redistributive tax transfer scheme are in

marked contrast to the proportional tax and subsidy scenarios of the pre-

ceding section. As Boadway et al. (1991) have demonstrated, welfare results

in models of occupational choice should generally reflect three components:

eﬃciency, equity and insurance. Given that the equity contract is optimal,

and with no other obvious distortions, decentralized equilibrium is eﬃcient

in our framework.21 Starting from an untaxed equilibrium, the first order
  21
       Given homothetic preferences, Vi = ln (ui ) with ui = u0 Ciα Di1−α , we can interpret

the subutility as consumption of a ‘final good’ in quantity ui . In allocating ui to workers


                                              48
eﬃciency gains of government policy are therefore zero. There cannot be

any welfare gains on account of equity since all agents are identical ex ante.

The only source of first order welfare gains is, thus, social insurance in the

sense of Varian (1980). Boadway et al. (1991) further noted that the gains

from insurance actually stem from two components which are also reflected

in (34), namely a direct eﬀect from the tax transfer scheme, and an indirect

eﬀect from equilibrium price adjustment. Apart from the direct insurance

provided by the progressive consumption (income) tax, the induced price

reduction compresses the return on start-up investment and diminishes the

risk of entrepreneurial income. In the scenarios of the preceding sections,
and entrepreneurs, the planner faces the same constraints as in (13), and will therefore

allocate consumption of entrepreneurs to the two states as in figure 1. Private contracts

just replicate this allocation by means of an equity share cum base salary and are, thus,

optimal. Whenever a worker gets u units, expected consumption of an entrepreneur must

exceed it by a factor c(p). The social optimum is attained by maximizing the utility

of a worker, max ln (u), subject to four constraints. One cannot distribute more units of

final consumption than what is obtained from demanding the two goods, i.e. u0 C α D1−α ≥

u (1 − E)+c(p (a))uE. The other restrictions are the two commodity balances, p (a) E ≥ D

and L ≥ C + KE, and the labor constraint, 1 ≥ L + (1 + a) E. It can be shown that the

planning solution replicates the market allocation.




                                           49
in contrast, the government balances the budget by means of a proportional

consumption tax and, thus, fails to provide any insurance. High income peo-

ple pay high taxes but also receive a high consumption subsidy because they

have high consumption as well. For this reason, there cannot be any welfare

gains on account of social insurance in the preceding section.

   To a large part, the public finance literature has dealt with the benefits

from social insurance by simply assuming the absence of private insurance

markets. In this paper, unconsolidated risk is an endogenous outcome of

the optimal decisions of financiers who could otherwise costlessly provide full

insurance. Entrepreneurial risk bearing is an essential part of venture capital

finance to retain incentives for high eﬀort in the face of a moral hazard

problem. It was not obvious a priori whether government should interfere

with private risk sharing arrangements by further consolidating risk. In the

light of proposition 6 we conjecture that the redistributive scheme yields

welfare gains from social insurance while the eﬃciency cost of doing so is

zero to the first order. However, as the scheme is expanded, it starts to

distort incentives for managerial advice ever more.

   Proposition 6 also relates in a non-obvious way to existing studies on


                                      50
entrepreneurship and insurance. Assuming absence of private risk sharing,

for reasons exogenous to his model, Kanbur (1980) finds that government

can raise welfare by taxing the risky occupation and subsidizing the safe

occupation which restricts entry into the risky activity. In the presence of

costly state verification and partial private insurance, Black and de Meza

(1997) find the opposite result that subsidizing entry into the risky occupa-

tion is welfare improving. In their case, government does not have superior

information over outcomes but can create collective insurance more cheaply

through its influence on equilibrium prices. Our analysis is in between. Since

expected income of entrepreneurs is higher than a worker’s income, our tax

subsidy scheme implies a net tax on risky activities, as in Kanbur but dif-

equilibrium price of the innovative good, the scheme encourages entry into

the risky occupation, as in Black and de Meza but diﬀerent from Kanbur.




6    Conclusions

Promoting entrepreneurship and business formation is widely recognized as

an important policy objective. Among others, the OECD has recently con-

                                     51
cluded that entrepreneurial activity needs strengthening.22 The structure of

taxes, the operation of financial markets, and the “entrepreneurial climate”

are important policy areas. This paper proposed a model of entrepreneur-

ship and start-up investment that emphasizes risk-bearing on the part of

entrepreneurs and its implications for occupational choice as well as the

‘quality of equity finance’. Even though financiers may, in principle, di-

versify project risk, some risk-bearing on the part of entrepreneurs is never-

theless required to contain a moral hazard problem in the relation between

VCs and entrepreneurs. Apart from structuring equity contracts, VCs also

supply valuable business advice to strengthen survival chances of their port-

folio companies. We analyzed how tax policy might influence the propensity

for entrepreneurship as well as the incentives for managerial support by fi-

nanciers. We found that a capital income tax strengthens incentives for

managerial advice but reduces the number of entrepreneurs while a wage tax

holds precisely opposite incentives. A broad based income tax is neutral on

all margins, distorting neither occupational choice nor incentives for business

advice. Output and investment subsidies to start-up firms both stimulate en-

on promoting entrepreneurship and employment, see OECD (1999).

trepreneurial activity. Unfortunately, our static framework is not well suited

to analyze capital gains taxation. Since much of the income from venture

capital investments actually accrues in the form of capital gains, it seems

an important task for future research to address this issue in an enriched

intertemporal model.

   One might argue that the government could raise welfare by further con-

solidating uninsured risks. Because of a moral hazard problem, however, pri-

vate financiers intentionally abstain from oﬀering complete insurance even

though they could in principle do so by means of diversification. The en-

trepreneur’s profit share is intended to preserve incentives for eﬀort by mak-

ing them bear part of the risk. Further consolidation by the government

could thus be counterproductive. Since government has no informational

advantage over private financiers, private risk sharing arrangements, and in-

deed the entire market allocation, are socially optimal in our framework.

Eﬃciency losses of taxes and transfers are therefore zero to a first order.

However, government may generate welfare gains from social insurance if it

introduces a small tax transfer scheme. Further expansion of redistributive

taxation would, however, increasingly impair eﬃciency by distorting equity



                                     53
contracts and incentives for managerial advice. Future research might inves-

tigate the role of taxes and subsidies in situations where private contracts are

not necessarily optimal. Such cases might arise if there are more than two

states of nature, or eﬀort is continuous rather than discrete. Private agents

might then not have enough instruments available to achieve the optimal

risk sharing arrangement. One could also contemplate more traditional mar-

ket distortions such as imperfect competition among VCs, or learning and

knowledge spillovers among them, to justify public policies other than redis-

tributive taxation to promote entrepreneurship and venture capital finance.

Except for T , x and therefore the elasticity µ do not depend on policy pa-

rameters. To prepare the analysis of transfers T in section 5, we compute

          − ln x                             −y (x)
µ (x) =          > 1,           µ0 (x) =              < 0,               y (x) = 1−x+x ln x > 0.

To establish the sign of µ0 (x), we have to show y (x) > 0. We have y (1) = 0

and y 0 (x) = ln x < 0 for all 0 < x < 1. The graph of y (x) is negatively

sloped over the unit interval and is zero at x = 1. Hence, y (x) > 0 for all
                                                                                  dµ            ∂x

vice as stated in proposition 2, take the diﬀerential of condition Π0 = 0 in

(18) and use (20). As shown in (16), the second order condition is Π00 < 0.

An investment tax credit, for example, is seen to discourage advice,

elasticity µ is independent of any tax rates as mentioned following (A.2).

Proposition 1 then yields the eﬀect of the wage tax. To verify that the sign

of the second partial is positive, multiply x ≡ 1 − (a + b) p0 /p by (1 − τ )

and replace the tax factor on the r.h.s. by (18): (1 − τ ) x = p0 (m − c0 ) −

(1 − τ ) (a + b) p0 /p. Using (13) and (15) to replace m yields (1 − τ ) x =

−p0 c0 + (pθ + (1 − z) K) p0 /p > 0 which is positive due to c0 < 0. Finally, the

The square bracket is simply m under the income tax. Using the eﬃciency

condition (18), it is seen that a comprehensive income tax with full loss oﬀset

does not interfer with the VC’s incentives to provide managerial advice,

                     dΠ0    p0 (m − c0 ) − (1 − r)
                         =−                        = 0.                  (B.3)
                     dr            1−r

Alternatively, one may verify that all terms in (18) turn out to be propor-

tional to a common tax factor 1 − r, which cancels. Note in particular that

also θ is proportional to 1 − r which is obvious from (14).



C   Extensions: Table C.1 repeats those equations that change as a result

of the scenario analysed in section 5, and derives some intermediate results.

The primed equations must be compared with the basic model when a com-

prehensive income tax is in place, τ = t = z = r with σ = 0. Restricted loss

oﬀsets inflate cost c in (3’) because government takes over a smaller part of

losses. Lump-sum per capita transfers T are part of the individual income

and are thus included in disposable income in (8’). In computing the incen-

tive compatible contract we obtain (14’) which collapses again to the basic

                                      57
result in (14) for T = 0. Since ε does not enter the constraints in (13’), θ is

not aﬀected. To prove the eﬀect of T on θ, note that β = (1 − r) b + T with
                                                 p

³          ´1/p
  (1−r)δ+T

                . Consider X1 (δ) and X2 (δ) for 0 < δ < 1. We have X10 (δ) =
                          ³          ´ 1−p

                                           ·X10 (δ). Furthermore, X1 (1) = X2 (1) =

1 and X10 (1) = X20 (1) > 0. The slope X10 (δ) is independent of δ while

X20 (δ) < X10 (δ) for δ < 1. Plotting the X schedules against δ proves that

X1 − X2 < 0 for all δ < 1. With these results, we may restate proposition 1

as

The convexity of the cost function is proved exactly by the same arguments

as in appendix A, except that variable x introduced after (A.2) is now defined
        ³        ´1/p

          dµ            ∂x
sign of   dT
               = µ0 (x) ∂T , we first compute, for 0 < x < 1,

          − ln x                             −y (x)
µ (x) =          > 1,           µ0 (x) =              < 0,          y (x) = 1−x+x ln x > 0.

If y (x) is positive, the sign of µ0 (x) is negative. Since y (1) = 0 and y 0 (x) =

ln x < 0 for all 0 < x < 1, the graph of y (x) is negatively sloped over the unit

interval and is zero at x = 1. Hence, y (x) > 0 for all values strictly less than

   The program in (15’) determines optimal managerial advice. In equilib-

rium with free entry, the necessary condition is given by (18’). The reader

may easily verify that the suﬃcient condition (16’) surely holds if evaluated

at ε close to zero. To obtain the comparative statics in the level of advice, we

first need the derivatives of marginal cost c0 . While θ and µ are independent
                                            ∂µ
of ε, they do depend on T where             ∂T
                                                 < 0 by the arguments following (C.3).

Therefore,
