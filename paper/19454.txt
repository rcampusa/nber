Wages, Pensions, and Public-Private Sector Compensation Differentials for Older Workers

                                              ABSTRACT

We use a sample of full-time workers over 50 years of age from the 2004 and 2006 waves of the Health
and Retirement Study to investigate whether workers in federal, state, and local government receive
more generous wage and pension compensation than private sector workers, ceteris paribus. With
respect to hourly remuneration (wages plus employer contributions to defined contribution plans),
federal workers earn a premium of about 28 log points, taking differences in employee characteristics
into account. However, there are no statistically discernible differences between state and local workers
and their private sector counterparts, ceteris paribus. These findings are about the same whether or
not indicators of occupation are included in the model. On the other hand, pension wealth accumulation
is greater for employees in all three government sectors than for private sector workers, even after
taking worker characteristics into account. As a proportion of the hourly private-sector wage, the hourly
equivalent public-private differentials are about 17.2 percent, 13.4 percent, and 12.6 percent for federal,
state, and local workers, respectively. We find no evidence that highly-educated individuals are penalized
by taking jobs in the public sector, either with respect to wages or pension wealth.

1. Introduction

       For the public sector to compete effectively for workers, compensation needs to

be comparable to that in the private sector. For many years, both academics and public

policy makers have debated whether public sector workers are over- or underpaid relative

to their private sector counterparts. This issue has recently received particular attention

because of the severe budgetary constraints facing governments at all levels. For

example, former Governor Mitch Daniels of Indiana argued, “We have a new privileged

class in America…We used to think of government workers as underpaid public servants.

Now they are better paid than the people who pay their salaries…Who serves whom

here? Is the public sector — as some of us have always thought — there to serve the rest

of society? Or is it the other way around?” [Garofalo, 2010]. At the same time, some

public employees maintain that they are underpaid. A seventh-grade English teacher

demonstrating against Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker’s plan to reduce public sector

benefits told the Huffington Post, “I can't get a home loan. I set my thermostat at 62. No

cable at my house, no internet…I'm also $36,000 in debt from becoming a teacher”

[Delaney, 2011].

       New Jersey Governor Chris Christie [2010] captured the essence of the issue

nicely when he said, “at some point, there has to be parity between what is happening in

the real world and what is happening in the public-sector world." But determining what

“parity” means in this context is challenging for two reasons. First, the human capital of

public and private sector workers may differ. If, for example, public sector workers have

more education than private sector workers, then it is neither surprising nor objectionable

that they earn higher wages. This is precisely the argument made by former White House
                                                                                              2


budget director Peter Orszag regarding federal government compensation: “Basically the

entire delta between private sector and public sector federal government average pay can

be explained by education and experience…while there may be some remaining

disparities, I think some of the more dramatic newspaper stories I’ve seen about that

disparity are somewhat misleading” [Tuutti, 2010]. The second reason why public-private

sector comparisons are problematic is that compensation consists of more than just wages

and salaries. Pension benefits comprise an important part of compensation, so that

comparisons of just wages and salaries may be misleading. Indeed, sectoral differences in

pension benefits have recently drawn considerable attention. According to Cook [2011],

“union chiefs can downplay their pension benefits all they want. The fact is, most of their

members have been guaranteed a millionaire's retirement.” Public-sector unions argue

that such criticism is hyperbolic and unjustified. In the words of Hetty Rosenstein, New

Jersey Director of the Communications Workers of America, “there’s pension envy

because people who are working in the private sector, they're being denied pensions”

[Mulvihill, 2011].

       In any case, it is clear that a sensible approach to measuring an overall

compensation differential requires considering both wages and pension benefits. Further,

the analysis of pension differentials needs to take into account that, because pensions are

a form of compensation, their magnitude is determined in part by employee

characteristics, just as is the case for wages and salaries. Simply examining average

pension benefits across sectors is not an appropriate way to estimate sectoral differentials.

       As noted below, a great deal of research on public-private sector wage

differentials has been done, including careful analysis of micro-level data on individual
                                                                                                          3


employees that takes into account differences in human capital endowments. In contrast,

there has been little work using micro-level data on differences in pension wealth across

sectors. Furthermore, the few attempts to integrate wages and pension benefits into more

comprehensive measures of sectoral compensation differentials use different data sets

from different time periods to estimate the wage and pension components of the

differential. In this paper, we use a single data set and a unified econometric approach to

estimate wage and pension wealth differentials between public and private sector

workers. Compensation packages, of course, have other components, including

employment security, paid vacation, health insurance benefits, and so on.1 Our analysis

focuses on wages and pension benefits because they are of major importance and micro

data are relatively accessible.

        Section 2 surveys the existing research on public-private sector compensation

differentials. Section 3 discusses our dataset, the Health and Retirement Study (HRS),

and presents summary statistics for the key variables. A great advantage of the HRS is

that it allows us to study wages and pensions within a unified statistical framework. A

drawback is that it surveys individuals who are 50 years and older. Such workers are

unlikely to be representative of the entire workforce because, for example, the public-

private pension differential for older workers may differ from that of their younger

counterparts because of changes in public sector pensions that have grandfathered the

former group.



1
  In 2006, the year that we study, 70.1 percent of compensation came in the form of wages and salaries.
Another 9.5 percent consisted of monetary compensation such as paid vacations and overtime pay.
Contributions to defined benefit and defined contribution retirement saving plans were 4.3 percent. For
further details on the composition of compensation see
http://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/ecec_06212006.pdf
                                                                                               4


       That said, older workers are not an inconsequential component of the labor force--

our tabulations from the 2006 Current Population Survey (CPS) indicate that the

proportion of the workforce over 50 years exceeds 30 percent.

       Section 4 presents the econometric setup and basic results. We find that the hourly

wages of federal government workers are about 28 log points more than private sector

workers with similar characteristics, ceteris paribus. However, there are generally no

statistically discernible differences between state and local workers and their private

sector counterparts with similar characteristics. On the other hand, pension wealth

accumulation is generally greater for employees in all three government sectors than for

private sector workers, even after taking worker characteristics into account. As a

proportion of the hourly private-sector wage, the hourly equivalent public-private

differentials are 17.2 percent, 13.4 percent, and 12.6 percent for federal, state, and local

workers, respectively.



       Section 5 presents several alternative econometric specifications to assess the

robustness of the results. We find that controlling for occupation leaves our substantive

conclusions unaffected. Further, there is no evidence that highly educated workers are

disadvantaged by working in the public sector. Section 6 concludes with a discussion of

the implications of our results for the ongoing public debate about public-private sector

compensation differentials and suggestions for future research.


2. Previous Literature

       The relevant literature can be classified into three broad categories: public-private

sector wage differentials, pension benefit differentials, and total compensation
                                                                                              5


differentials, which include both wages and pension benefits. We now discuss each of

these topics in turn.

           2.1 Wage Differentials

           The literature on wage differentials between public and private sector employees

spans roughly four decades, originating with Smith’s [1976a, 1976b, 1977] seminal series

of papers. The core of her analysis is the estimation of conventional human capital

earnings functions. For example, in Smith [1976b] she uses 1973 CPS data to estimate for

each gender a regression of the logarithm of the wage on various worker characteristics

such as years of schooling and race, including a series of dichotomous variables

indicating whether each individual worked in the federal, state, or local government

sectors (the private sector is the omitted category). For males, she finds wage differentials

relative to the private sector of 19 percent in federal government and –4.9 percent in local

government. The coefficient on the state government variable is statistically insignificant.

The differentials for female workers are 31 percent in federal government, 12 percent in

state government, and 3.6 percent in local government. In a variation on this approach, in

Smith [1977] she estimates separate equations for each sector, in effect relaxing the

constraint that coefficients on the right hand side variables are the same across sectors.

This modification does not change the qualitative results.

           Papers subsequent to Smith’s have modified her approach by trying to correct for

self-selection of workers into various sectors,2 by using panel data to estimate fixed

effects models,3 and by estimating models on a state-by-state basis to allow for the

possibility that labor market institutions, and hence public-private wage differentials,

    See Krueger [1988].
                                                                                                            6


vary across states.4 A fair way to summarize the findings in this literature is as follows: a

robust result, found in almost all the research from Smith’s early papers on, is that there

is a substantial positive wage differential for federal employees, even after controlling for

worker characteristics in the standard way.5 On the other hand, there is less agreement

with respect to state and local government workers. Positive, negative, and zero

differentials have all been estimated, sometimes within the same paper.

         2.2 Pension Differentials

         Data are available on average pension characteristics by sector, including the

proportion of plans that are defined benefit (DB), that is, plans in which future benefits

are based on a formula involving years of service, age, and so on, and defined

contribution (DC), that is, plans in which future benefits are based on a cash balance in a

pension account. (See, for example, Clark, Craig, and Ahmed [2010].) However,

sophisticated econometric analyses using micro data like those described above for

sectoral wage differences are rare. A notable exception is Quinn’s [1982] important study

of a sample of older workers from the 1969 Retirement History Study. He calculates

pension wealth by discounting a stream of expected pension benefit cash flows from age

of eligibility through age 100, using standard mortality tables to adjust for the probability

of receiving a benefit in any given year.6 Quinn estimates a regression of his pension

wealth measure on dichotomous variables designating federal, state, local, and postal

workers, and includes the number of years of job tenure and the final wage rate as control

  See Belman and Heywood [1995], Schmitt [2010], and Lewis and Galloway [2011].
5
  Hence, the opposite characterization of the literature by Peter Orszag (see Section 1 above) and Paul
Krugman [2010] seems rather curious.
6
  Quinn’s calculation eliminates the average sectoral portions of pension wealth that are associated with
workers’ contributions.
                                                                                            7


variables. He estimates pension wealth differentials of 72 percent for federal workers, 80

percent for state workers, and 30 percent for local workers.

       A limitation of Quinn’s analysis is that he does not control for differences in

worker characteristics such as schooling, gender, and race. In addition, his computation

of pension wealth excludes DC plans. While such a decision was sensible at the time

Quinn was writing, this is no longer the case, as DC plans have become an important

component of pension wealth, particularly in the private sector. According to Munnell

and Perun [2006], the share of private DC plan assets out of all private pension plan

assets increased from 22 percent in 1980 to 50 percent in 2004, and the corresponding

share of active participants increased from 35 percent to 70 percent over the same period.

As noted below, our analysis takes advantage of a more suitable estimate of pension

wealth that encompasses both DB and DC plans.

       2.3 Aggregating Wage and Pension Differentials

       Some recent research has sought to integrate wages with fringe benefits in order

to obtain a broad measure of sectoral compensation differentials. In an important paper

using data from the Health and Retirement Study for 1992-2000, Ramoni-Perazzi and

Bellante [2007] combine federal, state, and local employees to form a single “public”

category, and use the standard approach to estimate a public-private sector wage

differential that ranges from 3.5 to 11 percent. They next compute the difference in the

average sectoral fringe benefit share of total compensation from Bureau of Labor

Statistics data (which are not corrected for differences in the demographic composition of

workers across sectors). Adding this figure to their estimated wage differential, Ramoni-
                                                                                                             8


Perazzi and Bellante find a total public-private sector compensation difference that

ranges from 6 to 14 percent.7

          Keefe’s [2010] similar approach begins by estimating wage differentials in the

conventional fashion (using CPS data for 2009). To incorporate fringe benefits, Keefe

marks these wage differentials up by average benefits based on the employee’s

occupation and establishment size, as reported in the Employer Costs for Employee

Compensation Survey. He finds fringe-inclusive differentials of –10.7 percent for state

workers and –4.1 percent for local workers. The adjustment for fringe benefits does not

take into account employees’ personal characteristics. Other studies following the same

general approach are Allegretto and Keefe [2010], Bender and Heywood [2010],

Thompson and Schmitt [2010], Cannon [2010] and Gittleman and Pierce [2012], all of

whom study sub-federal levels of government, and the Congressional Budget Office

[2012], which examines federal government compensation. To our knowledge, no

analysis of public versus private sector compensation patterns has estimated both wage

and pension wealth differentials using a unified multivariate econometric framework

based on micro-level data. Our data allow us to apply the same econometric approach for

analyzing pension differentials as has been used to study wage differentials.


3. Data

          Our analysis sample comes from the 2006 wave of the Health and Retirement

Study (HRS), a longitudinal study of Americans aged 50 and over, who are interviewed




7
 This calculation includes fringe benefits other than pensions, such as sick leave, paid vacation, and the
value of differences in unemployment probabilities.
                                                                                                             9


every two years by the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan.8 As

stressed above, there are reasons to believe that public-private compensation differentials

for these older individuals are not typical of the workforce as a whole. But as we also

noted, they are an important part of the labor force; more than 30 percent of all workers

are over 50 years old. According to our tabulations using the 2006 CPS, the proportions

of employees who were 50 years or older in the private, federal, state, and local sectors in

2006 were 29.3 percent, 39.5 percent, 34.8 percent, and 36.5 percent, respectively.

Because the HRS is primarily based on older workers, our results might not apply to

employees throughout the age distribution.9 However, in addition to standard

demographic data, the HRS has information on sector of employment10 as well as a rich

set of variables on pension benefits, which makes it invaluable for making compensation

comparisons that go beyond wage and salaries.

         All variables relating to worker characteristics, hourly pay, pension plan types,

and employer pension contributions are either included or directly calculated from the

original 2006 Core dataset and tracker file. Data on pension wealth are obtained from a



8
  We use the unrestricted HRS sample, which, unlike the restricted sample, does not include pension plan
descriptions provided by employers. As noted by Gustman, Steinmeier and Tabatabai [2010, Chapter 4],
there are advantages and disadvantages to each dataset, and for a study like ours, it is not obvious whether
one would be better than the other. For example, individuals’ self-reports in the unrestricted data are
subject to error, especially when it comes to identifying plan type. But in the restricted data, other pension
attributes are erroneously reported by employers. Further, the proportion of HRS respondents for whom it
is possible to obtain employee information is relatively low in the restricted sample. In the 2005 employer
survey, for example, employer-provided plan descriptions were available for only 49 percent of the
respondents who reported having a pension (p. 64).
9
  In addition, public employees may leave public sector employment in their 50s and then switch to private
sector jobs. However, in our sample, we find little evidence for this phenomenon. Out of 392 government
workers with non-zero sample weights whom we are able to track over time, only 6 individuals made such
transitions between 2006 and 2008. Relatedly, the propensity to leave the workforce altogether because of
health reasons or retirement might differ systematically across sectors, but our data do not allow us to
investigate this phenomenon.
10
   Starting in 2006, the HRS clearly identifies government sector affiliation through questions KJ720 (“Are
you employed by the government at the federal, state, or local level?”) and KJ721 (“Would that be the
federal, state, or local government?”).
                                                                                                            10


supplement constructed by Gustman, Steinmeier, and Tabatabai [2010]. They note that

there is some evidence of errors in reports of pension values, and the accuracy of the

reports does not improve over time (p. 213). However, Gustman, Steinmeier and

Tabatabai argue that the estimates do not appear to be systematically biased. If the

reporting errors differed systematically by sector of employment then this would bias our

estimates of pension differentials. There is no evidence with respect to whether pension

wealth estimates for public sector employees are more or less accurate than their private

sector counterparts.

         A total of 4,759 respondents provide salary and wage information. Respondents

are also asked about the number of hours worked in a typical week and the number of

weeks worked per year, allowing us to calculate total hours worked per year and hourly

pay. This information is available for 4,344 respondents. We drop from the sample the

self-employed as well as part-time workers, defined as individuals who worked fewer

than 1,500 hours per year.11 This leaves us with 3,199 observations. Furthermore, we

exclude respondents who, while earning a positive hourly wage, earned less than the

minimum wage or characterized themselves as retired12. Finally, we drop workers for

whom information is missing for any of our right hand side variables, leaving us with

2,496 observations, which comprise our basic analysis sample. There are 1,907

respondents in the private sector, 115 in federal government, 225 in state government,

and 249 in local government. Compared to the entire sample of 4,759 individuals who
11
   There is, of course, some arbitrariness to the selection of a cutoff for what constitutes full-time work. We
experimented with a lower cutoff, 1,250 hours per year, and found that our substantive results were not
affected.
12
   Question KJ005 on the 2006 HRS questionnaire reads “Are you working now, temporarily laid off,
unemployed and looking for work, disabled and unable to work, retired, a homemaker, or what?”
Respondents are allowed to give multiple responses to this question. We excluded all workers who
indicated “retired” as one of their responses. There were a total of 333 workers who did so (including part-
time workers). Retired individuals were not asked their sector of employment during their working years.
                                                                                           11


reported wage and salary information, this sample is slightly younger (mean age of 58.2

years versus 59.5) and has fewer black workers (9.0 percent versus 9.7 percent) and

female workers (47.8 percent versus 51.4 percent).

       Table 1 presents definitions and summary statistics for our dependent variables.

WAGE is hourly pay in 2006 dollars. Federal and state government employees earn

substantially more than either private sector employees or employees in local

government. Three dichotomous variables indicate whether a given respondent has a

primary (most important) pension plan of a specific type. DBPlan indicates a primary

defined benefit plan, DCPlan indicates a primary defined contribution plan, and HPlan

indicates a hybrid plan, which has attributes of both DB and DC plans. Respondents who

either refused to or did not know how to answer the question about their primary pension

plan were excluded from the part of our analysis that involves these variables (37

respondents did not know their primary plan type or refused to identify it). Local

government workers are the most likely to have a DB plan and private sector workers are

the most likely to have a DC plan.

       EmpC is the amount contributed by the employer to all of the worker’s DC plans

per hour (in 2006 dollars), conditional on it being positive. It includes both the basic

contribution and any matching amounts. Respondents can provide information on

employer pension contributions for up to four DC plans as either a percentage of pay (in

which case EmpC is calculated as the reported fraction multiplied by WAGE) or as an

amount per some unit of time (in which case the conversion to an hourly basis proceeds

along the same lines as for WAGE). A number of respondents either did not know their
                                                                                                         12


employer’s contribution or refused to answer the question.13 In total, we were able to

calculate positive hourly employer contributions for 806 workers out of the 1,262

workers who reported having at least one DC plan.

         WAGE+DC is defined as the sum of WAGE and EmpC, that is, wages and salaries

plus employers’ contributions to DC plans. There is not much difference between the

average values of WAGE+DC and the figures for WAGE in the first row. Differences in

DC coverage are not large enough to exert substantial effects on wage and salary

differences.

         PensionW is pension wealth as calculated by Gustman, Steinmeier, and Tabatabai

(GST) [2010]. It is defined as the sum of the present value of future pension benefits

based on work to date from a respondent’s most important DB plan14 and the cash

balances in all DC plans on the current job in 2004 (in 2006 dollars). More precisely,

GST take a worker’s expected annual DB payments while in retirement and discount

them back to the expected time of retirement.15 They then further discount these figures

back to 2004. The specific discount rate, of course, plays a central role in these




13
   A respondent with several DC plans might only know his employer’s contribution to one of them. In this
case, EmpC would only capture a fraction of the total employer contribution. Given that DC plans are
relatively more important in the private sector, the lack of information on employer contributions to DC
plans might have different impacts in the public and private sectors. However, we have no way to quantify
the possible importance of this phenomenon.
14
   The proportion of workers who have more than one DB plan is relatively small: 2.2 percent in the private
sector, 5.5 percent in the federal government, 3.0 percent in the state government, and 4.0 percent in the
local government. Gustman, Steinmeier and Tabatabai [2010] do not include the present value of a
worker’s second DB plan in their calculations because there is a higher probability of confusion among
workers with two DB plans who are asked to report plan details (p.337).
15
    Some public employees are not covered by Social Security. They neither contribute to Social Security on
their jobs nor collect Social Security benefits. Therefore, their wealth upon entering retirement is lower
than their private sector counterparts, but so are the payroll tax contributions they made during their work
lives. However, according to Gustman, Steinmeier and Tabatabai [2013, Table 7], the present values of
Social Security benefits and taxes experienced by our HRS cohort are virtually identical, so there should be
little to no effect on our findings.
                                                                                                              13


calculations. GST [2010] use a discount rate of 5.8 percent, consistent with the figure

used by the Social Security Administration in its long-term projections (p.338). 16

         Since the value of a DC plan in 2004 is a cash balance that has been accumulated

based on work to date, the value of a DB plan in 2004 also needs to reflect the fraction of

its total value that has accrued to it based on work to date. In order to make this

adjustment, GST [2010] assume that a given worker will continue to work for his

employer up to retirement and multiply the total present value of the DB plan by the

number of years of service for the current employer in 2004, divided by the total

(anticipated) number of years of service at the time of retirement. Adding the DC cash

balances to this adjusted DB present value yields a measure of total pension wealth.

         We use the 2004 value because 2004 is the most recent year that GST calculate it

for all workers.17 PensionW is available for respondents in our analysis sample who were

interviewed in both 2004 and 2006, and worked for the same employer in both years--

2,100 of the 2,496 respondents in our analysis sample.

         The variable PositivePW is one if the individual has positive pension wealth and

zero otherwise. According to the figures in Table 1, employees in all levels of

government are more likely to have positive pension wealth than private sector workers,

and conditional on having pension wealth, their average values are also higher. Both the

probability of having positive pension wealth and the conditional mean are greatest for

federal government workers.


16
   Further, they make a mortality adjustment to account for variability in the probability of receiving a
benefit. However, there is no correction for the possibility of financial insolvency. Given that both public
and private sector entities might renege on part or all of their obligations, it is not clear how this would bias
estimates of public-private differentials.

         The sectoral differences among the various compensation measures are striking.

However, one must be cautious in interpreting them, given that the characteristics of

workers might “explain” these differences. Table 2 shows weighted means and standard

deviations of the key demographic variables for workers in the private sector and various

levels of government. The figures indicate that, indeed, worker characteristics differ

substantially across sectors. For example, on average, government employees at all levels

have more education than private sector employees, which gives some credence to the

notion that the compensation differentials in Table 1 might be due to differences in

human capital.

         Public and private sector workers also differ with respect to gender, race, marital

status, age, and whether they live in highly populated areas.18 Women account for a large

share of the state government workforce (61 percent), but smaller shares of the federal

(49 percent), local (47 percent), and private sector workforces (46 percent), respectively.

Federal and state government have the highest proportions of black workers (15 and 14

percent, respectively), followed by local government (9.6 percent), and the private sector

(8.0 percent). With regards to marital status, state government has the largest proportion

of married workers (73 percent), while the proportions in federal government (67

percent), local government (68 percent) and the private sector (67 percent) are nearly

identical. Workers’ ages are essentially the same across sectors, although one must keep

in mind that our data set includes only individuals who are 50 years of age or older.19 In

   The indicators for size of metropolitan area are meant to provide a rough control for differences in the
price level across areas. We are grateful to a referee for this suggestion.
19
   In all sectors, most workers are between 50 and 59 years of age. The proportions of workers who are
between the ages of 50 and 59 in the private, federal, state, and local sectors are 67.7 percent, 63.2 percent,
67.7 percent, and 72.6 percent, respectively. The proportions who are between the ages of 60 and 69 in the
private, federal, state, and local sectors are 29.4 percent, 33.0 percent, 30.6 percent and 24.8, respectively.
                                                                                                          15


this context, an important question is whether our analysis sample is plausibly nationally

representative (conditional on the screens used to generate it). The issue is cogent

because the 2006 survey does not have many of the respondents included when the HRS

was started as a nationally representative data set of individuals who were 51 to 61 years

of age in 1992.

         This is an empirical issue, and a sensible way to approach it is to apply to a

nationally representative data set the same screens that we use to generate our HRS

analysis sample, and compare summary statistics of the key variables that are available in

both samples. To that end, we took the 2006 CPS, applied the screens described above,

computed the relevant (weighted) summary statistics, and compared them to the HRS.

The results, reported in the appendix, indicate that the summary statistics for the two

samples are quite close. Indeed, for none of the variables can one reject the hypothesis

that the respective HRS and CPS means are equal.


4. Econometric Specification and Results

         While informative, the figures in Table 1 are only suggestive because they fail to

account for the fact that, as documented in Table 2, employee characteristics differ

substantially across sectors. This section presents the results from multivariate models.20

         4.1 Hourly Wages

         Basic setup. To begin, we estimate regressions of the log of hourly pay

(LOG(WAGE)) on worker characteristics and dichotomous variables for sector of

20
  The HRS sample includes features such as stratification, clustering, and differential selection
probabilities. All regressions use the HRS respondent sample weights. The HRS contains design-specific
sampling error codes in order to facilitate the computation of standard errors. Following the suggestion in
the HRS documentation, we use the SVY command set in STATA to incorporate these sampling error
codes into the calculation of the standard errors. For further details, see pages 5 and 6 of the HRS document
Sample Evolution: 1992-1998 ( http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/sitedocs/surveydesign.pdf).
                                                                                                         16


employment. This is sometimes called the “people approach” to analyzing public/private

compensation differentials, and is based on the notion that differentials should be

computed by comparing the wages of public and private sector workers who have the

same characteristics (Gittleman and Pierce [2012, p. 225]).21 Specifically, we regress the

logarithm of the hourly wage on a set of indicators for sector of employment (with the

private sector as the excluded category) as well as educational attainment, gender, race,

marital status, and a quadratic in age.22,23 In effect, this specification constrains all the

coefficients, except those on the sectoral variables, to be the same across sectors. A more

flexible approach, suggested by Blinder [1973] and Oaxaca [1973], allows all the

coefficients to vary across sectors. We choose the more constrained model because it

generates essentially the same results as the Blinder-Oaxaca approach and is simpler to

exposit.


21
   The alternative approach is to match individuals in the public and private sectors whose job descriptions
are comparable. Our data do not permit us to take this approach, and in any case, as Gittleman and Pierce
[2012, p. 221] point out, it is problematic because some occupations, such as sales, are almost all in the
private sector, while other job categories are almost all public. An appendix table available upon request
shows the occupational distribution by sector in our data.
22
   A subset (2,174 workers) of our observations provided responses to the question , “How long have you
been with your current employer?” Specifically, we can calculate it for 1,668 workers in the private sector,
92 federal workers, 192 state workers, and 222 local workers. If the 2006 response was not available, we
added two years to the 2004 response provided that the worker was still on the same job in 2006 as in 2004.
The average tenure by sector is 12.6 in the private sector, 17.7 years in the federal government, 14.8 years
in state government, and 17.4 years in local government. However, Altonji and Williams [2005] have
argued persuasively that including tenure in an OLS model is inappropriate, because it is positively
correlated with the error term in the likely event that individuals with low productivity have high quit and
layoff propensities. Similarly, including tenure on the right-hand side in modeling the determinants of
pension wealth could also lead to inconsistent estimates—where pensions are more generous, individuals
are likely to stay on the job longer, ceteris paribus.
23
   In principle, one could take advantage of the panel nature of the data to estimate a fixed effects model.
We do not take this tack for two reasons. First, we would lose 802 observations: only 1,694 workers in the
2006 basic sample were re-interviewed and had a positive hourly wage in 2008. Second, in a fixed effects
model, the coefficients on the sectoral variables are identified off of worker transitions between
employment sectors, of which there are very few between 2006 and 2008. Out of 1,302 private-sector
workers in 2006, 2 move into federal government, 5 move into state government, and 5 move into local
government in 2008. Out of 75 federal workers in 2006, 1 moves into the private sector, and 1 moves into
state government in 2008. Out of 145 state workers in 2006, 2 move into the private sector in 2008. Out of
172 local workers in 2006, 3 move into the private sector. This paucity of sectoral transitions would result
in imprecise estimates of the sectoral differentials.
                                                                                                         17


         Unlike some previous studies, we do not include occupational variables in our

canonical model. As Gittleman and Pierce [2012, p. 227] point out, there is no consensus

on this matter. We choose not to include occupation, because occupational choice could

very well be jointly determined with wages and it is available only for a subset of our

sample.24 However, as shown in Section 5 below, when we include occupation on the

right hand side, the results with respect to sectoral differences are nearly identical.

         Results. The estimates are reported in Table 3. In the first column we show the

results when only the sectoral variables are included. Substantial positive differentials are

present for all government levels: federal government employees earn approximately

37.1 log points more than private sector employees, state government employees earn

16.3 log points more, and local government employees earn 8.6 log points more. All of

this is just a different way of characterizing the information from Table 1.

         The estimates in column (2) show the results when employee characteristics are

taken into account. The federal-private differential falls to 0.278 (s.e. = 0.045),

considerably smaller than the corresponding figure in column (1), but still significantly

different from zero. In contrast, the state and local government differentials are generally

rendered small and statistically insignificant when worker characteristics are included in

the model. Taken together, the results in columns (1) and (2) are consistent with the claim

that looking at public-private wage differences without taking into account worker

characteristics can be misleading. Our finding of a large and statistically significant

federal differential is generally in line with previous results, most notably by Smith

24
  We cannot control for union coverage because the HRS does not include this information in the 2006
wave. In any case, as Gittleman and Pierce [2012, p. 226] argue, controlling for unionization status does
not seem appropriate, “because union wage premia probably do not reflect ability differences, and those in
the public workforce would not likely take their public sector unionization rates with them if they were to
move to the private sector.”
                                                                                                       18


[1976a, 1976b, 1977], Venti [1987], Krueger [1988], and Moore and Raisian [1991].

However, our point estimate is somewhat larger than theirs. This raises the question of

whether our finding with respect to the federal differential is idiosyncratic to the HRS

dataset. To investigate this possibility, we applied to the CPS the same screens as we

used to generate our analysis sample, and then replicated the specification in column (2)

as closely as we could. The results, reported in the appendix, indicate that the estimated

federal differential using the CPS is somewhat smaller than our estimate in Table 3, but

one cannot reject the hypothesis that they are equal. Thus, our estimate of the federal

hourly earnings differential does not appear to be an artifact of the HRS sample.

        Turning to the other covariates listed toward the bottom of column (2), the signs

and magnitudes of the coefficients are sensible and in line with the results of previous

econometric work on wage determination. Hourly pay increases with educational

attainment; for example, compared with workers who have no degrees, those with a four-

year college degree earn approximately 64 log points more. Married workers enjoy an

earnings premium of about 8 log points, and the wage rate decreases with age throughout

the relevant range.25 Workers in urban and suburban areas have higher hourly wages than

those who live in less densely populated areas.

        4.2 Hourly Wages and Employer Contributions to DC Plans

        We now turn to differences in compensation that come in the form of pensions.26

Integrating employer contributions to defined contribution plans with wages is fairly



25
  The negative quadratic term on Age starts to dominate the positive term at 49 years of age.
26
  Recall from Table 1 that, on average, government workers at all levels of government are more likely to
have DB plans and less likely to have DC plans than their private sector counterparts. These findings
continue to hold in multivariate models that include the demographic variables in Table 3 (results are
available upon request). The dramatic differences in the incidence of DB and DC pensions in the public and
private sectors cannot be attributed to differences in worker characteristics.
                                                                                                          19


straightforward. (We return later to issues associated with incorporating defined benefit

plans.) We create a variable, WAGE+DC, which equals the sum of the (hourly) dollar

amount of employer DC pension contributions (if any)27 and hourly pay. The last two

columns in Table 3 show the results when we use our standard earnings function to

analyze this broader measure of compensation. Comparing column (1) to column (3)

suggests that including employer contributions to DC plans has little effect on the raw

sectoral coefficients. The results after taking demographic characteristics into account

(columns (2) and (4)) are similarly very much the same. We conclude that incorporating

employers’ DC contributions into the analysis does not substantively change the results

one obtains by looking at wages only.

         4.3 Pension Wealth

         So far, our focus has been on flows of compensation associated with wages and

employer contributions to DC plans. In principle, one would also want to include the

incremental accrued value of employer contributions to defined benefit plans during the

relevant time period, which is also a flow. Such a variable is not included in the public

version of the HRS data. However, a useful stock measure, total pension wealth, has been

calculated by Gustman, Steinmeier, and Tabatabai [2010]. It is defined as the sum of the

present value of future benefits from a worker’s most important DB plan on the current

job and the cash balances in all DC plans on the current job, based on work to date.




27
   State and local government employees are significantly less likely to receive employer contributions
(state workers are 17.4 percentage points and local workers are 19.4 percentage points less likely than
private sector employees), but there is no statistically discernible difference between federal employees and
their private sector counterparts along this dimension. In results not reported here, we show that apart from
the case of federal workers, differences in the likelihood and amount of an employer contribution to a
worker’s DC plan(s) cannot be attributed to differences in demographic characteristics.
                                                                                               20


        This section examines how total pension wealth depends on sector of

employment. As previously noted, just like wages, pension wealth likely depends on an

employee’s personal characteristics. Gittleman and Pierce [2012, p. 224], for example,

conjecture that public sector workers might demand compensation packages skewed

towards benefits because they have more education. Hence, a multivariate approach is

needed to ascertain the independent effect of sector of employment upon pension wealth.

We include the same set of right hand side variables as in the wage regressions. A

substantial proportion of individuals in our sample have zero pension wealth (see Table

1). There is some controversy with respect to the best econometric strategy in this

situation. Some argue that in the presence of a limited dependent variable, a nonlinear

estimator such as probit or Tobit should be employed. However, we follow Angrist and

Pischke [2009, p. 94], who note that ordinary least squares provides the best linear

approximation to the conditional expectations function, and hence, in a context like ours

where censoring is not present, is the appropriate estimator.28

        Column (1) of Table 4 shows the estimates from a linear probability model of the

impact of sector of employment on the probability of having positive pension wealth

without any additional covariates. Compared to private sector employees, federal workers

are 21.6 percentage points more likely to have positive pension wealth, state workers are

14.8 percentage points more likely, and local workers are 12.9 percentage points more

likely. All the coefficients are statistically significant. The corresponding pension wealth

differentials are in column (2). Workers in all government sectors have more pension

wealth than their private sector counterparts: on average, federal workers have $111,000


28
  However, when we re-estimated the model using a Tobit estimator, the marginal effects were
qualitatively quite similar to those from OLS.
                                                                                                             21


more pension wealth, state workers have $89,800 more, and local workers have $80,800

more.

         Columns (3) and (4) add in our other covariates. The most striking result is that

the uncorrected pension wealth differentials from column (2) are reduced yet remain

substantial and statistically significant. Specifically, column (4) shows federal, state and

local pension differentials of $93,600, $62,900, and $65,800, respectively. Because

wages are a flow variables and pension wealth is a stock variable, the results from Tables

3 and 4 are not directly comparable. To allow comparisons, we begin by computing the

hourly annuity value of the pension wealth differential in each government sector.

Suppose that the pension wealth differential in sector s is Ds. Suppose further that the

average number of years of service for workers in that sector is Ts. Then we compute the

annuity value of Ds over Ts years, assuming an interest rate of 5.8 percent, the rate used

by Gustman, Steinmeier, and Tabatabai [2010] in their calculations.29

         The mean years of service with the current employer for our 2004 pension wealth

subsample30 are: 13.1 for private sector workers, 17.1 for federal workers, 14.0 for state

workers, and 16.4 for local workers. Using these values and the respective pension wealth

differentials from Table 4, the annuitized differentials are $8,778, $6,685 and $6,323 for

federal, state, and local workers, respectively. The mean yearly number of hours worked

for our pension wealth sample in 2006 is 2,256 for private sector workers, 2,192 for

federal workers, 2,148 for state workers, and 2,156 for local workers. Therefore, the


29
   We also did the calculations assuming a lower interest rate, 3 percent, and the results were substantively
very similar.
30
   As was mentioned in section 3, some respondents in our sample changed jobs between 2004 and 2006,
which makes it impossible to determine whether their pension wealth in 2004 can be associated with a
federal, state, local, or private sector job. For this reason, the sample for this analysis includes only those
individuals who worked in the same job in 2004 and 2006.
                                                                                                               22


annuitized pension wealth differentials per hour come to $4.00, $3.11 and $2.93 for

federal, state, and local workers, respectively. As a proportion of the hourly private-sector

wage, these amount to 17.2 percent, 13.4 percent, and 12.6 percent for federal, state, and

local workers, respectively.

         4.4 Preliminary Conclusions

         Summary. Taken together, this section’s results suggest several preliminary

conclusions. (1) Once differences in worker characteristics are taken into account, there

are no statistically significant differences in hourly wages between state and local

workers and their private sector counterparts. There is, however, a substantial wage

differential for federal workers, ceteris paribus, of about 28 percent. (2) The results for

hourly wages are essentially unchanged when employer contributions to employee DC

plans are included in the measure of hourly compensation. (3) Employees of all levels of

government generally have substantially more pension wealth than their private sector

counterparts.

         Toward a comprehensive measure of compensation differentials. One way to

generate comprehensive compensation differentials would be to take the sum of the

hourly equivalent pension wealth differentials computed above and the wage differentials

from the second column of Table 3.31 However, doing so could be misleading; seeing

why brings us to the next complication in interpreting the pension wealth differentials.

Suppose that a given individual’s DB pension is funded entirely by her own

contributions; the employer puts in nothing. In that case, pension wealth would not


31
  We add the annuitized pension wealth differentials to the differentials from the second rather than the
fourth column of Table 3 because the latter embody employer DC contributions, which are already
included in the pension wealth variable. In effect, adding the pension differentials to the differentials in
log(WAGE+DC) would be double counting.
                                                                                                     23


represent any additional compensation; it would just be a use to which the individual puts

her wages. Hence, it would be inappropriate to add the pension wealth and wage

differentials to obtain a total compensation differential.

         More generally, as long as a portion of contributions to DB pension plans come

from employees, then to some extent double-counting will occur if one simply adds the

wage and pension differentials. This observation immediately leads to the question of

how much pension wealth is due to employer and to employee contributions,

respectively. Our data do not provide an answer. However, using information from

several sources, a back-of-the-envelope estimate is possible. The steps in this calculation

are as follows:

        First, obtain an estimate of the average hourly amount of DC contributions made

by employers and employees in each sector. As noted in Section 3 above, this

information is available in the HRS data.

        Second, obtain an estimate of the hourly amount of DB contributions made by

employers and employees. The HRS data do not have this information. However, Bureau

of Labor Statistics data allow us to make a rough imputation. Specifically, BLS data

report the average hourly employer cost for state and local workers’ DB plans ($2.27 in

2006)32 and the average required employee contribution rate for state and local workers’

DB plans (6.3 percent in 2007)33. Given that the average required employee DB

contribution rate is computed only over the set of state and local employees with DB

plans requiring an employee contribution, we multiply the 6.3 percent figure by the

percentage of DB plans that require a contribution (77 percent in 2007)34, which yields an

average employee contribution rate of 4.85 percent across all workers. For federal

workers, the website of the Office of Personnel Management indicates that the

contribution rate is 7.0, 7.5 or 8.0 percent for both employers and employees; we use 7.5

percent, the midpoint of this range35. By multiplying the employee’s average required DB

contribution rate with the mean hourly wages listed in Table 1 and the average number of

DB plans per worker in each sector in our sample, we calculate hourly employee DB

contributions of $1.60 for federal workers, $1.55 for state workers, and $0.89 for local

workers.

        Third, multiply our respective estimated hourly pension wealth differentials by

the ratio of the sum of the employer DC and DB contributions to the sum of employer

and employee DC and DB contributions. This yields a set of differentials due to employer

contributions. An appendix available upon request provides details.

        The last step is to add these figures to the wage differentials from column (2) of

Table 3. Given that one cannot reject the hypothesis that the state and local differentials

are zero, for this purpose we simply treat them as zero. This yields total compensation

differentials of 34.2 percent for federal employees36, 7.49 percent for state employees,

and 8.29 percent for local employees.

                                                                                                    25


        In order to assess the robustness of our results, in this section we estimate several

alternate specifications of the basic model.

        5.1 Differential Effects by Education

        In our model, sectoral compensation differentials are independent of education.

This specification runs counter to longstanding concerns that because of inflexibilities in

government pay schedules, highly educated public sector workers earn less than their

private sector counterparts.37 We explore this hypothesis by augmenting our basic model

with interaction terms between the sectoral dichotomous variables and a binary variable,

CollegePlus, which equals one if a worker has a four-year college or higher degree, and

zero otherwise. We report here only the key results. In the equation for WAGE + DC, the

interactions of the sectoral dichotomous variables with CollegePlus are all statistically

insignificant. For pension wealth, the interaction term between STATE and CollegePlus is

positive and significant at $75,820 (s.e. = $27,906), while the other two sectoral

interaction terms are insignificant. Thus, we find no evidence in our data that highly

educated workers are disadvantaged by working in the public sector.

        This specification constrains the coefficients on all the other right hand side

variables to be the same across education groups. As an alternative approach, we relax

this assumption and estimate the model for WAGE + DC separately for each education

group. In no education group is there a negative and statistically significant coefficient on

either the federal or state sectoral variable. In the very highest education group, there is a

statistically significant negative coefficient on the local variable, but we are not inclined

to make too much of a single anomalous estimate. In short, our basic conclusion that


37

phenomenon at federal and sub-federal levels of government, respectively.
                                                                                                           26


there is no penalty for highly educated workers who work in the public sector is robust to

this change in the specification of the model.38

         5.2 Controlling for Occupation and Firm Size

         As noted above, it is controversial whether occupation should be included in

models of public sector compensation differentials. We chose not to include controls for

occupation, because of concerns that it might be jointly determined with compensation.

In addition, in our data, occupation is reported for only 1,453 observations, considerably

fewer than the 2,496 used to estimate our basic model in Table 3. Nevertheless, it is of

some interest to see if our results change qualitatively when we augment the model with a

set of dichotomous variables designating occupational categories.39 Table 5 displays the

results for the logarithm of (WAGE+DC). In columns (1) and (2) we establish a baseline

by using the smaller sample to estimate the models from the last two columns of Table 3,

and then add the occupation variables in column (3). Only the coefficients on the sectoral

variables are reported. The coefficients in columns (1) and (2), while having somewhat

different magnitudes, are qualitatively similar to their counterparts in Table 3. Once

occupation controls are added in column (3), the implied federal differentials falls

slightly and remains statistically significant. The point estimate, 0.265, is virtually the

same as the corresponding figure in Table 3, 0.277. The state and local differentials




38
   To assess the robustness of this result, we also estimated this specification using the CPS data set
described in the Appendix. The result was the same. There is no education group for which the coefficient
on Federal is negative. The State coefficient is negative and significant for individuals whose highest
educational attainment is a master’s degree, but returns to insignificant for those who have a doctorate or
professional degree. There is no education group for which the coefficient on Local is negative and
significant.
39
   An appendix table available upon request provides a list of the occupation categories that are available in
the HRS, and the proportion of employees in each category.
                                                                                                         27


remain statistically insignificant, also just as they were in Table 3. In short, our

substantive results are essentially unchanged when controls for occupation are included.40

         Another variable that sometimes appears in empirical studies of compensation,

especially with respect to pensions, is firm size. We are inclined to agree with Gittleman

and Pierce [2012, p. 226] who argue that including firm size in compensation regressions

is not appropriate because it is not a skill-related factor that an individual can transfer

from job to job. However, as a check on the robustness of our findings, we estimated the

pension wealth regression using the 1,716 observations for which we have information on

firm size (indicators for whether the firm is small, medium, or large)41. Consistent with

previous studies, we find that pension wealth increases with firm size, and the

coefficients are statistically significant. With the size of firm variables included, the

sectoral differentials are $87,200, $61,900, and $65,600, respectively, for federal, state,

and local government, and all are statistically significant at the 0.01 or smaller level. The

story is essentially the same as in our basic model in Table 4—large and statistically

significant positive differentials for all sectors.


6. Conclusion

         We have used a sample of older full-time workers from the 2006 Health and

Retirement Study to study wage and pension compensation differentials between

government and private sector employees. With respect to hourly wages (including

employee contributions to defined contribution plans), federal workers earn a premium of

40
   In the same way, the coefficients on the sectoral variables in our pension wealth equation (column (4) of
Table 4) are not substantively changed when we augment it with the occupation variables. Moulton [1990],
using CPS data from 1988, finds that including occupation variables has a substantive effect on the public-
private differential.
41
   Firms with fewer than 100 employees are classified as small, between 100 and 500, medium, and more
than 500 employees, large.
                                                                                             28


about 28 log points. However, no statistically significant differences for state and local

workers emerge once employee characteristics are taken into account. Workers at all

levels of government accumulate more pension wealth than private sector workers, even

after holding employee characteristics constant. Specifically, as a proportion of the

hourly private-sector wage, the hourly equivalent public-private differentials are about

17.2 percent, 13.4 percent and 12.6 percent at the federal, state, and local levels,

respectively. Our results offer some support to both sides in the rather noisy public debate

over public sector compensation. The argument that taking worker characteristics into

account can make a big difference in public-private comparisons is correct. However,

those who assert that examining wages alone can be misleading are also right. Once

pension benefits are taken into account, employees at all levels of government receive

higher compensation than private sector workers, and these differentials cannot be

explained away by differences in worker characteristics.

       As usual, one must be cautious in interpreting compensation differences. They

might be due to compensating differentials associated with unobserved job

characteristics, or they might arise from successful rent-seeking. Also, to the extent that

public sector employment contracts are more back-loaded than those in the private sector,

this could contribute to the presence of public-private differentials. An important subject

for future research is to determine the source of these unexplained differences. Further, it

would be interesting to apply the methods used in this paper to a sample that includes a

larger proportion of younger workers, if a data set with all the requisite variables were to

become available.
                                                                                            29


       As mentioned at the outset, we have focused on wage and pension differentials

because comparable data on other dimensions of the compensation package are not

readily available. Ideally, future work in this area should incorporate other components of

compensation, particularly employer-provided health insurance benefits. The HRS does

include information on whether an individual has health insurance coverage. In results

available upon request, we find that government workers are in fact significantly more

likely to have employer-provided health insurance than their private sector counterparts

with the same characteristics. The differentials are 10.2, 10.0 and 8.1 percentage points

for federal, state, and local workers, respectively. However, there is no information on the

cost to employers of providing this benefit. Integrating information on the value of

employee-provided health insurance with wage and pension differentials within a micro

data framework is another important topic for future research.

                              Comparing the HRS and CPS

         As detailed in the text, we apply a set of screens to the HRS data in order to

obtain our analysis sample. The purpose of this appendix is to investigate whether our

HRS analysis sample is statistically similar to a sample generated by applying the same

screens to the CPS.

         Table A1 exhibits the means of a set of variables that are common to both data

sets.42 Column (1) has the HRS means along with their standard deviations, and column

(2) has analogous calculations for the CPS. A glance at the table suggests that the means

are quite similar. Indeed, for none of the variables can one reject the hypothesis that the

respective HRS and CPS means are equal.

         A related question arises in the context of our estimated wage differentials. As

shown in Table 3 in the text, once personal characteristics are taken into account, the

state and local differentials are small and statistically insignificant, a result not unlike that

found in a number of earlier papers. Our federal differential is 0.278 and statistically

significant. While a positive and statistically significant federal differential is a common

finding, the magnitude of our estimate is somewhat larger than in many papers. One

possible explanation for the difference is that the HRS sample is somehow non-

representative. Another is that previous papers have not applied the same screens to

generate their analysis samples—they generally look at the entire population, while we

focus on workers over 50. To investigate this issue, we applied the same screens to the


42
  All means are computed using sample weights. The labeling of the education categories in the two data
sets is not exactly the same. We assume that what the CPS refers to as "bachelor degree" is the same as the
"4-year college degree" in the HRS, and that "professional degree" in the CPS includes doctoral degrees.
                                                                                                34


CPS as we did to the HRS, and used this sample to replicate as closely as possible our

basic wage regression from column (2) of Table 3. The key results are as follows: The

state differential in the CPS is -0.0112 (s.e. = 0.0360) and the local differential is 0.00626

(s.e. = 0.0291). Like their counterparts in Table 3, they are small and statistically

insignificant. The federal differential is a statistically significant 0.170 (s.e. = 0.0406).

While smaller than the estimate in Table 3, one cannot reject the hypothesis that they are

equal-- the chi-square statistic for a test of equality of these two estimates is 2.17, while

the critical value at the 0.05 level is 3.84. In short, there is no statistically discernible

difference between our HRS estimate of the federal-private differential and an estimate

generated by the CPS.

Observations***

* This table shows means and standard deviations for dependent variables by employment sector, weighted
by 2006 respondent weights. Variables that are measured in dollars (WAGE, EmpC, WAGE+DC, and
PensionW) are in 2006 dollars.
** Means and standard deviations for PensionW and EmpC are computed over positive observations.***
These are the maximal number of respondents with non-zero sample weights in each sector. However, not
every question is answered by all respondents; therefore, the number of observations varies slightly across
variables.

* This table augments the model of Table 3 with a set of dichotomous variables for occupation. A list of the
occupation categories is in Table A2. The number of observations differs from that of the basic sample
(2,946) because not every respondent provided information about occupation. The other right-hand side
variables are the same as in Table 3, but not reported here. Standard errors are in parentheses. A (***)
