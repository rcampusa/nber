Unions Increase Job Satisfaction in the United States

                                           ABSTRACT

We revisit the well-known negative association between union coverage and individuals' job
satisfaction in the United States, first identified over forty years ago. We find the association has
flipped since the Great Recession such that union workers are now more satisfied than their non-
union counterparts. This is found to be the case for younger and older workers in the National
Longitudinal Surveys of Youth of 1979 and 1997. The change is apparent when we use the panel
data to account for fixed differences in those who are and are not unionized, suggesting changes
in worker sorting into union status are not the reason for the change. The absence of substantial
change in the union wage gap, and the stability of results when conditioning on wages, both
suggest the change is not associated with changes in unions' wage bargaining. Instead, we find
some diminution in unions' ability to lower quit rates ­ albeit confined to older workers - which
is suggestive of a decline in their effectiveness in operating as a `voice' mechanism for unionized
workers. We also present evidence suggestive of unions' ability to minimize covered workers'
exposure to underemployment, a phenomenon that has negatively impacted non-union workers.

1. Introduction
It was in the late 1970s that economists first discovered that unionized workers were less
satisfied with their jobs than their non-unionized counterparts. The empirical work
conducted by Richard Freeman (1978) and George Borjas (1979) was for the United States.
The finding appeared to be at odds with unions' ability to raise wages above those set in
the market (Lewis, 1963; 1986) ­ something which surely would have raised union
workers' satisfaction?      However, the association persisted even when Freeman
incorporated wages as a control variable. Freeman offered an explanation:

       "At the 1975 [NBER] meetings, I suggested that the inverse relation might
       reflect the role of unions as a `voice' institution, encouraging workers to
       express discontent during contract negotiations and to make formal
       grievances rather than to quit, which would keep the dissatisfied from
       leaving the employer. If this view is correct, the satisfaction relation lends
       some support to the exit-voice model of the union" (Freeman, 1978: 139-
       140)

Freeman was referring to a model, originally devised by Albert Hirschman (1970) to
explain the behavior of consumers when faced with a defective product or deficient service.
They could choose to voice their concerns in the hope of rectifying the problem or else
leave the provider of the good or service (exit) and seek an improved product or service
elsewhere. Applying this model to employment relations, Freeman (1978, 1980) (and
subsequently Freeman and Medoff (1984)) suggested that unions, by helping to solve
employees' problems at work, made them less likely to quit the workplace than similarly
dissatisfied non-union workers so that unions appeared to increase the `stock' of
dissatisfied workers. Freeman (1980) attributed the lower quit rates among unionized
workers to the availability of an effective grievance system in the union sector.

However, Blanchflower, Bryson and Green (2021) have shown that this negative
correlation between unionization and job satisfaction no longer holds. Indeed, in cross-
sectional analyses for both the United States and Europe, they find the sign has switched:
unionization now appears to be positively correlated with job satisfaction. They go on to
use panel data for the UK to find the partial correlation between unionization and job
satisfaction remains positive and significant among union switchers. Why this has occurred
is not entirely clear.

In this paper we return to the National Longitudinal Survey (NLS) initially used by
Freeman (1978) to see whether the relationship between unionization and job satisfaction
has indeed switched signs in the United States. We run OLS estimates, as Freeman did,
but we also run person fixed effects models to assess whether becoming unionized raises
job satisfaction having accounted for fixed unobserved differences between union and non-
union workers which might potentially affect selection into unionization and workers'
propensity for job satisfaction. This is a valuable addition to what Freeman (1978) did
originally because, as many have argued, those who have a tendency towards
dissatisfaction with life, and perhaps also with their jobs, may be more inclined to unionize
than those who feel less dissatisfied. Again, following Freeman (1978), we run estimates
for older and younger workers to see whether effects are robust across cohorts. We run the
models for the NLS79, which contains workers born between 1957 and 1964, and those
from the NLS97 born between 1980 and 1984.

We find the sign of the union coefficient does indeed switch after the Great Recession. It
is positive and statistically significant in both the OLS and person fixed effects panel
estimates, and is apparent for the younger and older cohorts, indicating that the emergence
of positive union effects on job satisfaction are not driven by those selecting into (out of)
unionization. Indeed, the effects are a little larger in the fixed effects models, confirming
that those switching into (out of) unionization experienced improvements (deterioration)
in their job satisfaction.

The effects are quite sizeable and economically meaningful. Drawing from job satisfaction
estimates in the literature that use NLSY data, our union coefficient is approximately equal
in size to the positive impact on job satisfaction of having three employer-provided fringe
benefits or having a job in the public versus the private sector (Artz, 2010a), nearly the
value of taking part in an employer-provided profit-sharing scheme (Heywood and Wei,
2006) and roughly half the effect of getting a promotion (Kosteas, 2011).

We examine three issues that may potentially help explain change in union effects on job
satisfaction. The first is a decline in unions' ability to operate as an effective `voice' for
union workers, something that might be apparent from a reduction in their ability to lower
quit rates. We find some, albeit limited support, for this proposition among older workers.
The second issue is unions' ability to procure a wage premium for covered workers, relative
to their non-union counterparts. We extend estimates of the union wage premium we
originally ran through to 2002 (Blanchflower and Bryson, 2004) right through to 2019 to
see whether union effects on wages had changed over time.

An increase in the union wage premium might conceivably feed through to an increase in
the job satisfaction gap between unionized and non-unionized workers, potentially
offsetting any (negative) union voice effects on job satisfaction. In fact, the union wage
premium has been remarkably constant over time, neither rising nor falling significantly.
Yet, given the wage stagnation experienced by many workers, even a constant wage
premium in the union sector may generate greater job satisfaction since the Great
Recession. We therefore follow Freeman (1978) by plugging wages directly into the job
satisfaction equation to net out any potential impact of the union wage premium on
unionized workers' relative job satisfaction. The inclusion of wages does not kill the
positive association between unionization and job satisfaction, suggesting union wage
bargaining is not linked directly to improvements in unionized workers' job satisfaction.

The third issue we explore is the role that underemployment may have played in workers'
job satisfaction since the Great Recession. As Bell and Blanchflower (2019) have shown,
the Great Recession led to a big rise in underemployment around the world, whereby
workers desired far more hours of work than they were able to find in the labor market.
This underemployment is the chief reason why there was no upward pressure on wages
following the gradual recovery from the Great Recession, despite relatively low


                                              2
unemployment rates. Since 2008, Bell and Blanchflower (2021) find that the
unemployment rate does not enter wage equations, whereas the underemployment rate
does, variously defined, in the US, the UK and in an international sample of countries. This
is consistent with John Dunlop's (1944) argument that "wage policy is determined by the
employed not the unemployed" (p.69).

To our knowledge, there has been no investigation into the role played by trade unions in
protecting unionized workers from underemployment, despite the fact that maintaining
one's hours of paid employment is an important aspect of income maintenance, especially
in a period of sluggish wage growth. If unions are successful at reducing unionized
workers' exposure to underemployment post-recession, this may help explain an increase
in their job satisfaction relative to that of non-unionized workers. We confirm that
unionized workers are less likely to be underemployed than non-unionized workers, and
that the gap is counter-cyclical, rising in periods of recession. However, when we insert
hours worked directly into job satisfaction models, although job satisfaction is positively
associated with higher working hours, it accounts for none of the union effect on improving
job satisfaction since the Great Recession.

The remainder of the paper is set out as follows. Section Two reviews the existing
literature, focusing on studies examining links between job satisfaction and unionization
in the United States. Section Three presents our data and approach to estimation. Section
Four presents our results and Section Five concludes.

2. Previous Literature
Although trade unions as institutions vary somewhat across the countries of the world,
there is a common acceptance that Freeman and Medoff's (1984) characterization of their
`voice' and `monopoly' faces captures a large part of what they do at the workplace. These
two faces of unionization have potentially countervailing effects on how workers feel about
their jobs. On the one hand, unions' ability to monopolize the supply of labor to the
employer and thus bargain for wage and non-wage conditions above those set in the
absence of unions, should positively impact how covered workers feel about those jobs.
This, in turn, should reduce their desire to quit unionized jobs since their outside options
set in the market are likely to be inferior. Of course, there is the possibility for
dissatisfaction to arise if workers' expectations about bargained outcomes are not met. But
the literature is quite clear on this issue: unions continue to procure premia on wages and
related conditions such as paid leave, despite some debate about decline in their bargaining
power (Blanchflower and Bryson, 2004).

On the other hand, unions' `voice' face might conceivably generate job dissatisfaction via
what Freeman and Medoff (1984) termed `voice-induced complaining', part of the process
by which unions foster support from covered workers strengthening their hand in dealings
with the employer, or though the increased flow of information that comes to unionized
workers as a result of the two-way communication between management and employees
which is a pre-requisite for unions in representing their members. This, together with the
increased likelihood of dissatisfied workers remaining in the presence of union voice ­ as
predicted under the exit, voice, loyalty model discussed above ­ results in cross-sectional


                                             3
estimates of the partial correlation between unionization and job dissatisfaction originally
identified in the work of Freeman (1978) and Borjas (1979). 1

In his original paper Freeman (1978) partly motivated the importance of job satisfaction as
a variable, economists should be interested in, by showing that it was a strong predictor of
labor mobility. Using panel data on older men in the NLS Older Men and NLS Younger
Men samples and the Michigan Panel Survey of Income Dynamics (PSID) Freeman
showed job dissatisfaction predicted higher quit rates in the late 1960s and early 1970s
(1978: 137). However, unionization was associated with both lower job satisfaction and
lower quit rates in the Michigan PSID and NLS Older Male samples which, he argued, was
consistent with unions providing effective voice for workers, thus reducing their quit
probabilities for a given level of job dissatisfaction. He revisits the issue in his Freeman
(1980) paper using the same data sets plus the Current Population Survey (CPS),
confirming reduced separation rates among unionized workers, particularly among the
least satisfied workers. The reduction in quits among unionized workers is apparent having
conditioned on wages (p. 666) which are intended to net out potential monopoly face
benefits of unionization, thus isolating voice effects. 2

Borjas (1979) comes to similar conclusions analyzing data from the National Longitudinal
Survey of Mature Men aged 50-64. His estimates of union negative associations with job
satisfaction are robust to his efforts to account for potential simultaneity using an
instrumental variables approach. But he goes a stage further in testing the voice hypothesis
for union dissatisfaction effects by showing the effects are strongest among workers with
high tenure. 3 The effects hold when conditioning on wages too. However, he adds to
Freeman's analysis of quits by showing the union effect in reducing quits is largely
confined to low tenured workers, a finding he attributes to the flatter wage profile faced by
older workers arising from the seniority wage system promoted by unions.

Blanchflower and Oswald (1999) estimated job satisfaction equations using data from the
US General Social Survey from 1972-1996 as well as the 1989 International Social Survey
Programme across a sample of ten countries including Germany, UK, USA, Austria,
Hungary, Netherlands, Italy, Ireland, Norway and Israel. In both cases they found that a
union variable was significantly negative. Artz (2010b) also found a negative union
coefficient in a job satisfaction equation based on panel data for the period 1979-2004 from
the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. 4

1
  Borjas (1979: 21) expressly refers to the "politicization of the unionized labor force" as a contributory
factor. In a study for the UK, Bender and Sloane (1998) confirm that unions negatively impact the climate
of employment relations at the workplace and that, when one accounts for this, the association between
unionization and job dissatisfaction is no longer significant. They conclude that "union workers' relative
dissatisfaction....stems from poor industrial relations or from unions forming where satisfaction would be
low anyway" (p. 222).
2
  A parallel literature using establishment-level data for Britain confirms a partial correlation between the
presence of union voice and lower quit rates (Bryson et al., 2013). The effect did not vary significantly over
the period 1990-2004 despite declining within-establishment union density, something which may have
impaired the effectiveness of union voice.
3
  Borjas' contention is that low tenure workers provide information to the firm about the problems workers
face via exit whereas high tenure workers provide that information through expressed dissatisfaction (p. 30).

As noted above, Blanchflower, Bryson and Green (2021) have established that the partial
correlation between unionization and job dissatisfaction no longer holds in the United
States and in Europe. Their estimates for the United States, based on data from the General
Social Survey for the period 1972-2018, confirm Freeman (1978) and Borjas' (1979) and
Blanchflower and Oswald's (1999) finding of a negative correlation between unionization
and job satisfaction in the early years. However, the correlation turned positive and
statistically non-significant between 1998 and 2008 and became positive and statistically
significant after the Great Recession. They confirm this positive, significant correlation
for the period after the Great Recession in data from the Gallup Daily Tracker.
Investigating why the change may have occurred they present evidence from analyses of
the General Social Survey indicating that unionized workers were more likely than their
non-union counterparts to expect job loss in the period prior to the Great Recession, but
that this was no longer the case after 2008. At the same time, union workers continued to
benefit from a wage premium. They conclude: "This likely helps to explain the positive
coefficient in the job satisfaction equations: union workers are less fearful of job loss than
previously, yet they continue to receive the substantial wage premium they have always
received" (p. 13).

Blanchflower, Bryson and Green (2021) also consider the possibility that changes in the
composition of union and non-union workers over time may have contributed to changes
in the correlation between job satisfaction and union status. They do so by examining the
partial correlation between job satisfaction and union status in the Gallup Daily Tracker
data for the period 2009-2013 for members of different birth cohorts. They find early birth
cohorts who would have made up most of the sample in Freeman and Borjas' studies in the
1970s continued to exhibit a negative union partial correlation with job satisfaction,
whereas subsequent birth cohorts (born after 1959) exhibited a positive partial correlation. 5

There is, as yet, no obvious explanation for the role of birth cohorts in the change in the
partial correlation between job satisfaction and unionization, although the persistent
negative correlation between job satisfaction and unionization among earlier birth cohorts
may be related to Artz's (2010b) finding based on panel data for the period 1979-2004
from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth which showed the negative association
between unionization and job satisfaction increased with union experience. In any event,
the finding points to the potential importance of accounting for compositional change in
those becoming unionized.

One way to do this is to undertake panel estimation which focuses on changes in union
status within individuals over time, thus accounting for fixed unobserved differences across
union and non-union workers over time. There are a number of such estimates for the
United Kingdom, and these tend to show the negative partial correlation between job
satisfaction and union status is ameliorated and, in some cases, even switches sign with the
inclusion of person fixed effects.


5
 They subsequently confirmed the persistence in the negative partial correlation between job satisfaction
and unionization in a UK birth cohort born in 1958 (Blanchflower and Bryson, 2020).

                                                     5
The most recent example is the only panel analysis presented in Blanchflower, Bryson and
Green (2021). These estimates, based on data from the British Household Panel Survey
and its successor Understanding Society for the period 1996-2018, show the union partial
correlation with job satisfaction is negative and statistically significant in OLS estimates
but becomes positive and statistically significant when introducing person fixed effects
which net out fixed unobserved differences between union and non-union workers. 6
However, the authors do not present estimates for early and later periods. There is no
recent panel evidence on the association between unionization and job satisfaction for the
United States, so it is unclear what their incorporation might imply for the switch in the
union partial correlation with job satisfaction apparent in OLS estimates. We address this
issue below.

If the switch in the partial correlation between job satisfaction and unionization is linked
to a diminution in union effectiveness as a `voice' for unionized workers, a corollary might
be a reduction in unions' capacity to lower quit rates. We investigate this issue below.

Finally, when considering how union effects on job satisfaction may have changed since
the Great Recession it is important to recall the importance of changes in labor market
trends since 2008. The discussion above noted the potential role played by unions in
insuring against job loss, but another potential role unions might play relates to their ability
to guarantee income security through the avoidance of underemployment. The issue of
underemployment has come to the fore in the United States and elsewhere since the Great
Recession (Bell and Blanchflower, 2019). In a period characterized by wage stagnation and
recession-induced unemployment, it might not be surprising to find unions bargaining to
maintain covered workers' hours to ensure income security. However, nobody has
investigated this issue to date.

3. Data and Estimation
In accordance with the previous literature reviewed in Sections One and Two we estimate
job satisfaction equations using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation supplemented
with models incorporating person fixed effects. The fixed effects estimator holds constant
all time-invariant unobserved individual characteristics that may affect selection into union
status and job satisfaction, thus measuring changes in job satisfaction as an individual's
union status changes. This approach requires longitudinal panel data tracking workers and
their job satisfaction over time.

In the United States, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) is the most widely
used and respected panel containing both job satisfaction and union status measures, and it
is one of two data sets Freeman (1978) used in his examination of unionization and job
satisfaction. We analyze two separate cohorts from the NLSY. The first cohort (NLS79),
born between 1957 and 1964, were first interviewed as teenagers in 1979, and were most
recently reinterviewed in 2018. The second cohort (NLS97), born between 1980 and 1984,
were first interviewed in 1997 and were most recently surveyed in 2017.



6
    For earlier similar results for the UK see Bryson and White (2016a, 2016b).

                                                       6
Both surveys initially interviewed individuals annually but shifted to a biennial survey
(from 1994 in the case of the NLS79 and from 2011 in the case of the NLS97). In addition
to union status and job satisfaction, both cohorts contain information on demographic and
job characteristics which we include as covariates in our estimations. These include
gender, race, age, region of residence, education level, marital status, the presence of
children, and the job's industry and occupation. Summary statistics separately for the 1979
and 1997 NLSY cohorts are presented in Table 1.

The way union status is identified in the NLS79 differs over time. The survey records
union membership status in 1979 and in the period 1988 to 2018. Between 1979 and 1993
workers were asked whether their wages were set by a collective bargaining agreement.
And between 1994 and 2018 the survey asked whether workers were covered by union
contracts. The NLS97 merely asks whether respondents are covered by a contract
negotiated by a union. Since no single measure exists across all waves in the NLS79, and
since in the United States there is little difference between union membership and union
coverage by a collectively bargained contract, we combine all three measures in NLS79 to
form a single union status measure similar to that in the NLS97. 7

We confine our analyses to overall job satisfaction because satisfaction with facets of the
job is only available in a sub-set of waves. The two cohorts use nearly identical wording to
record workers' job satisfaction. NLS79 respondents are asked "How do you feel about
the job you have now?" whilst NLS97 respondents are asked "Which of the following best
describes how you feel about your job?". NLS97 offers five responses ranging from
"dislike it very much" to "like it very much", including a "neutral" response in the middle.
The NLS79 omits the neutral response and consequently offers only four options. 8

The self-employed and those working in the military and private households are removed
from the estimation sample to increase the comparability of employees entering the union
and non-union samples. We also restrict the estimation sample to those in the private
sector. Although unions loom large in government settings, their role and bargaining power
are somewhat different to those in private sector settings. Moreover, in many instances
public and private sector jobs consist of distinct tasks and employment relationships,
making job satisfaction comparisons difficult. Finally, to address potential concerns that
respondent non-response or attrition in some variables may bias our results we estimate job
satisfaction using a sample that omits missing observations and another that retains those
with missing observations through imputation. The final job satisfaction estimation
samples are approximately 161,000 and 68,000 in the NLS79 and NLS97 respectively.

We also examine the partial correlation between union status and the propensity to quit
using NLS79 and NLS97. We run linear estimation models on the (0,1) voluntary quit
outcome where 1 denotes all worker-initiated (voluntary) job separations except for family

7
  Throughout the union status measures also encompass membership of "employee associations". We cannot
disentangle the two. We remove the 1994 wave of the NLS79 from the estimation sample due to inaccurate
or incomplete union data in the wave arising due to recording errors in the union coverage variables.
8
  NLS79 records all workers' job satisfaction. However, NLS97 limits the question to those workers who
have been at their employer for more than 12 weeks, thus reducing the estimation sample in the NLS97.

                                                  7
or pregnancy reasons. These separations specifically identify workers quitting to look for
another job, take another job, or for other reasons: they exclude employer-initiated job loss.

We estimate the union wage gap in the same fashion as Blanchflower and Bryson (2004)
using the Monthly Outgoing Rotation Group (MORG) nested within the Current
Population Survey (CPS). These data are publicly available for download at the NBER -
see https://www.nber.org/research/data/current-population-survey-cps-data-nber

Finally, we examine union effects on both job satisfaction and the Cantril Ladder, a second
subjective wellbeing metric, using the Gallup Daily Tracker which tracks around 1,000
people per day in the United States. Although the data are only available from 2009, so do
not permit us to establish what changed pre- and post-2008 resulting in the union partial
correlation with job satisfaction turning positive, the sample sizes are large and the data
contain measures of underemployment ­ part-time workers expressing a desire for more
paid hours - thus allowing us to test the proposition that some of the higher job satisfaction
among union workers relative to non-union workers is their increased ability to avoid
underemployment.

4. Results
Figure 1 presents mean job satisfaction for private sector union and non-union workers in
the NLS79 over the period 1979-2018. Among these workers, born between 1957 and
1964, mean job satisfaction is lower for the union than the non-union workers, apart from
in the period since 2008.

To assess whether the switch in the union association with job satisfaction is statistically
significant and robust to the introduction of controls, we present regression-adjusted
estimates in Table 2. We code the dependent variables such that a positive coefficient
means higher job satisfaction. The first three columns of the table present pooled OLS
cross-sectional estimates. Column 1 reports union status interacted with time-period, with
year dummies as the only additional controls. Missing observations are included following
imputation. Column 2 is run on the same sample but incorporates the demographic traits
reported in the table, together with additional controls for regional location, occupation and
industry. Column 3 is identical to column 2 but drops the cases with missing information.

The models in columns 4-6 exploit the panel nature of the data by incorporating person
fixed effects to identify changes in job satisfaction within person over time and their links
to changes in union status. For this reason, some of the fixed observed traits of individuals
such as race fall out of the models, but otherwise they follow the model specification in
columns 1-3.

The main effect of union status in columns 1-3, which captures its partial correlation with
job satisfaction in the period prior to 1989, is negative and is statistically significant in
Models 1 and 3. But what is particularly striking is the positive and precisely estimated
change in the union interaction with job satisfaction from 2008: the interaction term
union*2008-2018 is positive and highly statistically significant in all three models
indicating a significant change in the union effect on job satisfaction relative to its impact

in the base period prior to 1989. Combining the main and interaction effects it is apparent
that unionized workers are significantly more satisfied with their jobs than their non-
unionized counterparts in the post-Great Recession period. 9

Appendix Table 1 splits the estimates into pre- and post-Great Recession sub-samples to
aid interpretation of the interaction terms: union status is associated with an increase of
roughly 0.05 points on the job satisfaction scale post-Great Recession. The effect is
roughly equivalent in size to the positive impact on job satisfaction of having three
employer-provided fringe benefits or having a job in the public versus the private sector
(Artz, 2010a), nearly the value of taking part in an employer-provided profit-sharing
scheme (Heywood and Wei, 2006) and roughly half the effect of getting a promotion
(Kosteas, 2011).

One potential reason for this switch in the union partial correlation with job satisfaction
could be a change in the composition of union and non-union workers over time. If those
workers sorting into (out of) unionization have a greater (lower) propensity for job
satisfaction over time, this might explain the increasing propensity for unionized workers
to be more satisfied with their jobs than non-unionized workers. We can discount this
possibility based on the estimates in columns 4-6 in Table 2 because they confirm the
positive and highly statistically significant interaction between union status and the period
from 2008 onwards is robust to the inclusion of person fixed effects. These estimates
confirm that the union partial correlation with job satisfaction switched positive in the
period from 2008 among union switchers. That is to say, the change is apparent within
workers over time, so cannot be driven by time-variance in the fixed unobserved traits of
union and non-union workers.

Figure 2 and Table 3 repeat the exercise, but this time for the younger NLS97 cohort whose
job satisfaction is recorded over the period 1997-2017. The figure indicates that the raw
difference in mean job satisfaction favors non-union workers until the onset of the Great
Recession where, for a few years, the union differential appears negligible. Then from
2011/12 job satisfaction appears higher among unionized workers.

Turning to the regression analyses in Table 3, although the interaction of union status with
the post-Great Recession period is positive it is not statistically significant at conventional
levels in the OLS estimates presented in columns 1-3. However, the estimates become far
more precise with the introduction of person fixed effects such that the interaction is
positive and statistically significant in columns 4-6.

The recent positive partial correlation between unionization and job satisfaction in both
NLS cohorts, and its robustness to fixed unobserved differences across individuals, raises
two related questions, namely whether the change is associated with a change in job quit
behavior between union and non-union workers, and what might lie behind the change?

    In column 3 the net effect is -.021+.067=+.046.


                                                      9
We begin by considering whether the positive partial correlation between unionization and
job satisfaction since the Great Recession indicates a decline in union effectiveness as a
voice mechanism for workers. Freeman (1978: pp. 139-140) had suggested that union
voice effects may explain the otherwise paradoxical finding that unions lower quit rates
despite raising job dissatisfaction, something which is otherwise known to raise quit rates.
Therefore, a corollary of unionization being associated with higher job satisfaction since
the Great Recession might be a diminution in unions' ability to lower quit rates by
providing effective voice for workers.

Figures 3 and 4 plot quit rates for union and non-union workers separately for the NLS79
and NLS97 respectively. Figure 3 is suggestive of a closure in quit rates between union
and non-union workers, but only at the height of the Great Recession in 2008 and again in
2018. In the NLS97 non-union quit rates have been persistently higher than those for union
workers since the early 2000s, though they do close between 2015-2017 (Figure 4).

We test more formally for a change in relative quit rates among union and non-union
workers by running regressions similar to those in Tables 1 and 2 for job satisfaction. Table
4 presents linear estimation models for the (0,1) probability of quitting the job over the
period 1979-2018 among those born between 1957 and 1964 in the NLS79. The negative
union effect on quits is apparent for the base period before 1989 in row 1 of the table and
is represented by the union coefficient. However, the union interaction with the period
post the on-set of the Great Recession is positive and statistically significant in all model
specifications ­ both OLS and person fixed effects models ­ indicating that the union
association with lower quit rates has dissipated. If we take column 6, for example, which
conditions on worker fixed effects, the interaction effect exactly offsets the union effect in
the base period prior to 1989, implying those who switched union status over the period
were no more nor less likely to quit their jobs than their non-union counterparts.

The union effect on quits is quite different for the younger people surveyed in the NLS97
born between 1980 and 1984. Union effects are largely absent for quits among these
younger workers over the period 1997-2017, and do not vary significantly over time, as
indicated by the weak or zero significance of the union interaction term with the post-
recession period (Table 5).

Taken together, the evidence from Tables 4 and 5 is that, if unions were associated with
lower quit rates, the association may have been apparent for older workers and was
confined to the period prior to the Great Recession. Together with our finding that the
partial correlation between job satisfaction and unionization turned positive post-Great
Recession, there is some indication that the efficiency with which unions provide workers
with voice may have declined somewhat recently.

Next, we turn to the possibility that changes in unions' effectiveness in procuring a union
wage premium may help explain the increase in job satisfaction among union relative to
non-union workers. The final column of Table 6 presents estimates of the regression-
adjusted union wage gap in the CPS MORG using the methodology previously deployed
by Blanchflower and Bryson (2004). The union wage gap has fluctuated between 12-15%


                                             10
between 2000 and 2019, but shows no discernible pattern, suggesting change in the union
wage premium is unlikely to explain rising job satisfaction among union relative to non-
union workers. 10

However, it may be that job satisfaction has simply become more sensitive to a given wage
level, such that the job satisfaction returns to a constant union wage premium may have
risen over time. To establish whether this is a possibility we conditioned directly on
earnings in the NLSY job satisfaction equation. The results, presented in Appendix Table
2, are robust to this sensitivity check in both the NLS79 and NLS97.

Finally, we turn to the issue of underemployment and the possibility that positive union
correlations with job satisfaction since the Great Recession may reflect unions' ability to
shore up unionized workers' income by ensuring they continue to work sufficient hours. It
is apparent from columns 1 and 2 of Table 6 and Appendix Chart 1 that underemployment
rates rose after the Great Recession, only returning to their pre-recession levels in 2016/17,
but it should be noted they have still not returned to the lower rates observed at the start of
the millennium. It is also apparent from columns 1 and 2 of Table 6 that underemployment
rates were much higher among non-union workers than among union workers throughout
the first two decades of the century. They were one-third higher among the non-union
workers at the beginning and end of the period, but the underemployment rate was actually
double for the non-employed in 2016.

Workers in search of additional paid hours of work may have sought second jobs or
supplemented their income with self-employment, but Bureau of Labor Statistics figures
indicate this did not happen. This suggests that workers were `stuck' off their labor supply
curves due to depressed labor demand. It is perhaps no surprise to discover, therefore, that
the underemployed ­ whether unionized or not ­ were less happy with their jobs than other
workers, both on the job satisfaction and Cantril Ladder metrics (Table 7). It is also notable
that among the under-employed, non-union workers were less happy than union workers.

To establish whether underemployment may play a role in the job satisfaction of union
workers relative to non-union workers post-Great Recession we ran estimates for job
satisfaction and life satisfaction using the Gallup Daily Tracker. These estimates, which
are the first in the literature to consider the links between unionization, underemployment
and employee wellbeing, are presented in Table 8.

Panel A shows the importance of underemployment for job and life satisfaction. Whereas
those in part-time employment who do not want additional hours are more satisfied than
full-time employees (the reference category), those part-timers who want additional hours
are significantly less satisfied with their jobs and with life than full-time employees. Panel
A also shows union workers are more satisfied with their jobs, and with life, than their non-
union counterparts, confirming our earlier work (Blanchflower, Bryson and Green 2021).

10
   The union hourly wage differential estimates here extend the results in Table 5 for the period 1973-2002
in Blanchflower and Bryson (2004) using the same data and excluding workers with allocated earnings. The
results for 2000 and 2001 are identical but there is a slight difference in the estimates for 2002 of 18.6% in
the earlier paper and 13.7% here. The prior 2002 estimate of 18.6% was in error.

                                                     11
Panel B extends the analysis by interacting union status with underemployment. The
interaction coefficients in both the job and life satisfaction equations are positive and
statistically significant, partly offsetting the large negative and statistically significant
effects of underemployment these workers would have experienced if non-unionized. A
significant, positive union effect persists even when introducing the interaction between
unionization and underemployment, so unions' ability to combat the worst effects of
underemployment are not the sole reason for the positive union association with worker
wellbeing post-Great Recession. It would therefore appear that the switch in the union
coefficient on job satisfaction from negative to positive is due, in part, both to the lower
rates of underemployment in the union sector compared to the non-union sector, as well as
unions' ability to ameliorate the negative effects of underemployment on workers'
satisfaction. 11

5. Conclusions
In this paper we revisited the well-known negative association between unionization and
individuals' job satisfaction in the United States, first identified over forty years ago. We
find the association has flipped since the Great Recession such that union workers are now
more satisfied than their non-union counterparts. We show this to be the case for younger
and older workers in the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth of 1979 and 1997. The
change is apparent when we use the panel data to account for fixed differences in those
who are and are not unionized, suggesting changes in worker sorting into union status are
not the reason for the change.

The absence of substantial change in the union wage gap over time suggests the change is
not associated with changes in unions' wage bargaining. Incorporating wages directly into
satisfaction equations does not affect the union coefficient, suggesting union-induced
changes to job satisfaction do not arise due to increased sensitivity to a given union wage
premium. Instead, we find some diminution in unions' ability to lower quit rates ­ albeit
confined to older workers - which is suggestive of a decline in their effectiveness in
operating as a `voice' mechanism for unionized workers. We also present evidence
suggestive of unions' ability to minimize covered workers' exposure to underemployment,
a phenomenon that has been particularly detrimental to the wellbeing of non-union
workers.




11
  This last point is somewhat reminiscent of recent work suggesting unions are able to ameliorate the adverse
wellbeing effects of other aspects of labor market experience, such as workers' exposure to anxiety-inducing
innovation at the workplace (Bryson et al., 2013).
