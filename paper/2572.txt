          LABOR DEMAND AND THE STRUCTURE OF ADJUSTMENT COSTS




                                  ABSTRACT



      This study examines the nature of the costs that firms face in adjusting

labor demand in response to shocks induced by changes in output demand and

prices.   Empirical work on monthly plant-level time-series data shows that

adjustment proceeds in jumps:   Employment    is unchanged in response to small

demand shocks, but moves instantaneously to a new long-run equilibrium if the

shocks are large.   Results in the large literature that assumes smooth


adjustment are due to aggregation of this inherently nonlinear relation over

subunits experiencing different shocks.      The finding has implications   for

cyclical changes in productivity and for examining the effects of policies

such as severance pay, layoff and plant-closing restrictions, and mandatory

listing of job vacancies, all of which change the cost of adjusting employment.

I. Introduction

         Most models of factor adjustment assume smooth paths from an initial to

a final equilibrium when the fundamental determinants of factor demand are

shocked.     Indeed, most tecent econometric work has even assumed that the

adjustment is characterized by a geometric lsg structure.       The purposes of

this study are to reexamine the theory underlying these assumptions, to

discover whether they make sense empirically, and to consider the implications

of alternative estimates that allow one to infer the structure of the costs of

adjusting labor demand.

         Thia reexamination is necessary for several reasona.    It may be that

predictions of the paths of factor demsnd are unaffected by econometric

specificstiona that fail to embody the underlying structure of the adjustment

costs that face decision-makers at the firm level.     However, without specifying

snd estimating equations thst embody these structures we cannot know if this

is so.     Secondly, in most European countries, snd increasingly in the United

Ststes too, a variety of lsbor-msrket policies has been enacted in the past 15

years that can be characterized as affecting the sdjustment of labor demand)

Without knowing more about the structure of adjustment costs, we cannot link

specific policies to those costs in order to infer how the policies affect the

labor market.

         I begin by examining the origins of the conventional wisdom about factor

adjustment, including issues of aggregation.     The section also discusses the

nature of labor costs and distinguishes between static costs and those

associated with mitering employment.     Next I analyze the optimal path of

employment under generalized costs of adjustment.     The inferences about the

adjustment paths are used to specify a set of estimating equations.      These

are studied using data on individual plants and then on longer time series on

highly dismggregated industries, The empirical analysis provides the first

                                          I
tests of competing hypotheses about the structute of the costs of adjusticg

labor demand, and it does so using the appropriate mioro data,

II.     The Conventional Wisdom, Suggested Emendations and the Nature of
          Labor Costs

          The conventional model of dynazsic factor demand specifies an equation

system such as:



(1) xis      F(X151,,..,                   ;5K,z5
               i=1,     ...,M                                ...,N   ;l=l,...,L,
where t     denotes   time, the      are inputs and the            are exogenous variables.     In

early studies and the recent studies that have concentrated on how expectations
affect the structure of the variables in Z, N K I --- i.e., a simple
geometric     lag structure is imposed and the adjustment of and demand for the

single input of interest is assumed to be independent of the adjustment and

demand for other inputs.          Thus Rosen (1968) examines the adjustment of the

employment-hours ratio with N =           K = 1.    Sargent (1978) studies the dynamics of

labor demand with N =       I but with a very       complex lag structure on the          for

labor.      In the estimation of large macroeconomic models the assumption that

K = 1 baa become standard         (see,   e.g.,   Fair,   1984).

        A   variety of other studies has examined (1) with N > 1 under varying

degrees of generality about the lags of the inputs other than                 x   included in

each equation and about the Z.             Thus lismermesh (1969) examined gross


employment changes in this context; Brechling (1975) and Shapiro (1986) studied

simultaneous employment and capital-stock adjustment; Topel (1982) specified

inventories and employment as adjusting together; and Nadfri-Rosen                  (1969)

included all of these decision variables in a model like (1).

         All of these studies specify factor adjustment aa a simple distributed

lag, with initial partial adjustment of the                  in response to changes in

                                                   2
the          In most, equilibrium is approached only asymptotically because a
      Z.
geometric lag atructure is imposed.      Its imposition is justified by arguing

that the coats of adjustment are convex.        Apparently the fitst use of this

assumption was by Bolt et al. (1960).      Yet in discussing decision rules

shout labor use, those authors noted, "Whether these costs [of changes of

various sizes in the work force] actually rise at an increasing or decreasing

rate is difficult to determine." [p. 53)        Indeed, they draw sn adjustment

cost function without fixed costs snd with linear variable costs.        They

justify s convex (quadratic) curve as an approximation that allows the
derivation of linear decision rules for adjusting inputs.

       Subsequent theoretical work derived explicit paths for factor demand

under the assumption of quadratic variable adjustment coats snd no fixed coats

of adjustment.      Yet none of the leading studies (Eisner-Strotz, 1963; Gould,

1968) provides much more justification for the assumption than do Holt etal.

More recent work just imposes the sasumption of quadratic variable and zero

fixed adjustment costs with no discussion of why this representation of the

atructure may be correct (e.g., Sargent, 1978, p. 1016).        Indeed, the assumption

that this particular structure characterizes the world has found its way down

to intermediate macroeconomics texts (Froyen, 1983, p.       353).   Obviously there

is nothing wrong a priori with the assumption.        However, its exclusion of

fixed costs and its insistence on increasing average variable adjustment coats

are very restrictive and not necessarily consonant with reality.

           In the literature on labor demand only Nickell (1986, and some of his

earlier work) recognizes that increases or decreases in employment may be

characterized by average variable costs of adjustment that are initially

decreasing but eventually increasing.      He derives the firm's dynamic demand

for labor under both the standard assumption of increasing variable costs and

the assumption of constant costs.      There is no existing empirical work on

unknown to the observor.                    Does reducing employment by eliminating a shift

reduce profits proportionately more or less than a reduction in employment that

occurs when a few workers are laid off?                            Do morale problems arise among the

remaining workera when staffing is reduced regardless of the size of the

reduction?      These questions suggest that the structure of the costs of

adjusting employment levels need not be convex and may affect the path of

employment just as much as the "ore visible costs of gross employment changes.

         Even the level of variable relative to fixed adjustment costs is

difficult to discern from the sparse published data.                            The typologies by which

hiring and separation costs are categorized in the (very few) available

surveys of employers             -    -   - such as   advertising, training, etc.      -   --   do not allow

for an easy link to the economic concepts outlined here.'                            These surveys tell

us nothing about adjustment costs that arise when production is disrupted by

changes in staffing.                 The study of the structure of the costs of changing flows

and stocks of employment is barely in its infancy.

III.     Adjustment Paths

         To analyze the adjustment of labor demand in response to exogenous

shocks, let us simplify by assuming that the product price is unchanged for

all time at P          1, and that the employer knows                    that the wage, which changes

at time zero, will be constant thereafter.                            (We could equally well hold the

wage fixed and assume a price shock.)                          I write the concentrated production

function as Q          F(L), where L is the labor input.                      (I ignore the issue     of

employment-hours substitution and assume in this derivation that hours per

worker are fixed.            See Hart, 1984.)               The firm's static profit function is


ir(L),   with   it   ' >   D,   it"       < 0, and    lr(L*)       D, where L*is the long-run profit-


maximizing labor demand.

         Without loss of generality                    I   assume that the variable costs of


                                                               S
adjusting labor demand are quadratic in the size of the adjustment.                                                The
fixed costs of adjusting labor demand are k >                                    0.      both fixed ond variable

costs are symnetrir in the direction of the adjustment, a simplifying

assunotion that doos not qualitatively change the results.                                           The adjustment

cost function is then:

                                               if   ILl   >o
                              bL

where       the superioc dcc denotes the rate of change, and b is a parameter of the

sdjustment cost function,               linear tens in L; were it included,
                                                    (I exclude
its ocly effect on the path would be to change the trrgec.) Implicitly this
cost structure is on net changes in employment. an approach taken in some hut

            If b > 0 and k                    0,   the    optimal adjustment path between              t      0   and T   is
described by the Euler equation:

3)     2bL              2brL +   '(L)              0; L(0)     L5,       L(T)   —   4,
This    is the standard solution, with T                                   end   L • L.          The adjustment path

is amooth, end the equilibrium labor demand is approached eaymptotically.


                                                                     6
Obversely, if b —       0    and k    >    0, the firm sets T —         0 and sets     Lr
                                                                                            — L0 or Lz

depending on whether:

                             [r(L)     -
                                              ir(L0)]
                      k<                  r

       In the general case            b,      k > 0.      The nature of the solution depends on the

relative sizes of these two parameters, the discount rate r, and the structure

of the profit function i.              Two additional equations beyond (3) describe the

solution completely in this case.                       The first is:


(4)    -2bLT +        rT     —   o.
The economic interpretation of (4) is that the present value of the marginal

profits from increasing LT must equal the marginal adjustment costs of that

increase.     The second additional condition is:

         •2     ir'(L )L
(5)    -bLT +                    k
This condition states that the present value of the increased profits from

raising T must equal the increased cost of adjustment.

       Together (3)-(5) imply an adjustment path in which, if the shock is

relatively small, the firm does not adjust its labor demand.                                If the shock is

large enough, though, labor demand will adjust smoothly toward L*; but the

firm will stop changing its labor input before L* is reached.                               The comparative

dynamics of the system can be analyzed to show the effects of changes in the

underlying parameters on this path.

       Equation (5) is a quadratic in                     I.     It has real roots only if:
                                 2

                            rT       4bk.

Since we know that r(L*)                   0, and since         both b and   k   are positive in general,

this condition means that in general LT <                        L.   We can rewrite this condition

and substitute in (4) to obtain:

                      l/z

(4')     L1

(5')       r'(L) a 2r{bk*2.

         Equation (5') shows that as k increases tha slops of the profit function

at the terminal point increases; equation (4') showe that an increase in k

raises the rate of adjustment at the terminal point.                             Together these inferences

show that higher fixed costs of adjustment inrrease the gap between                             L and
C     and redure T,          An increase in b increases the slope of the profit funrtion

at rho terminal point, hut it reduces the rare of adjustment at                            T.   Together

these facts imply that increased h raises the gap between                              and C,   but   that

it takes longer for the finr, to adjust from L.                       to   LT.   Finally. increased r
reduces LT.
         This        di..scnssioo   of adjustment paths augggests there is              little justifi-
cation    except simplicity for assuming away fixed costs and positing that the

variable costs facing the fins are quadratic.                         As we have seen, avoiding this

simplification changes and enriches the predictions about paths of adjustment

of labor demand in response to external shocks.                        The task of the empirical

work here is to add the complexities                  ---   the   possibilities of discrete jumps

IV.     Implications for Estimation

           The standard estimating equation equation corresponding to (1) can in

the aimplest case be written as:


(6)             L5      rl-7}L:, +          +

where L and L*           are the logarithms of actual and long-run (static) equilibrium

labor demand respectively, t              denotes   time, and p is a rsndom error term


                                                        S
(whose distribution I leave temporarily general).                                 This equation is based on

the usual assumption of convex variable adjustment costs with no fixed


adjustment costs.

        If those variable costs are not convex, or if there are fixed costs of

                                                                   firm will
adjustment, Section III showed that the long-run profit-maximizing

either not adjust or will immediately set L                                L*.    I have shown that the second


choice will be made if the long-run static L* is sufficiently different from

the most recent choice of L and if k is relatively small.                                  We can make this

operational by describing the firm's choices about employment in the plant by:


(7a)   L      L1     +   pit,
                                           -
                                                         K,


and

(7b)   L      L      +                         -
                                                   L[   > K,

wnere K iS a parameter that is an increasing function of the fixed adjustment

costs facing the firm.                   K is the percentage deviation of last period's

cmpioyment from desired employment that is necessary to overcome the fixed

costs of adjusting the amount of labor used.                               I   assume that              0
                                                                                             E(p1,p5)

        To estimate        (7)      we need to specify L.                  Let:


(8)    L      aX +       Er,

where a is a vector of parameters,                         X   is a vector of variables that affect


L,     and       is a disturbance term.                    (I assume that E(p1E)                        0
                                                                                             E(p5t)

throughout the discussion.) The firm operates on (Ja) if:

             K   +   [L1       -
                                   aXJ    and      e      -K +         -   aXJ.
It operates on (7b) if:


       Er   > K+     [L1 -                or            < -K +   [L1   -
                                                                           aXJ.

                                                                 9
It jumps to its new long-run equilibrium (moves along (7b)) if it is

aufficently shocked by changes in             X   or if it makes errors in forecasting

      thst are not captured in the variables we use in the vettor X.


            We need to specify L* and to construct a method of estimating the

parameters in (7)           the a parameters and the variance
                                                                               o4.   c   and   o.

The system (7a) and (7b) is essentially a switching regression (see Coldfeld-

Quandt, 1976), with the probability of being on (7a) equal to:




where
                          °J
                   rK÷L.-ax,1                     r-K±L .-aX

              is the cumulative unit normsl distribution function (and i have

implicitly assumed that s is normally distributed)                    p       ts then the prob-


ability that the firm jumps to        L.          The likelihood function characterizing

the switching model is:

               T       1-p                p
(9)     £
               JJ g(p11) g(p21
                                     c)
where
            g(p1) is the density of           from (7a), and
                                                               g(p2
                                                                          +       is   the density


of the error term in       (7b),   after substituting for       L.        Both errors are

assumed to be distributed normally.                The logarithm of the likelihood function

in    (9)    is maximized in the empirical work in the next two sections.

            A huge literature has arisen on the appropriate specification of L*

(see Hamermesh, l986a).        Since my purpose here is not the estimation of static

labor-demand relations, and since the available data limit the possibilities


severely, I use two different approaches to estimate                  L for use in         (6)   and

(7).        The first, which can be viewed as perfect forecasting under rational

expectations, simply lets:

(10)        L:a0+a1y1÷a3t+s1,
                                                    10
where the   a    are parameters to be estimated.5                 The second, based on a simplified

version of Nickell's (1984) approach, estimates a transfer function for                            Y
using all information available at time t-1.                     This produces the prediction

        as well as allowing predictions of                 Y÷,    i — 1, 2 ,...        In   this


approach    L   is approximated as:


(11)    L    a    + a1          +          +   a3t +

where           is the change in the        orecasted value Y              from   time t to time t+i.

This simple equation reflects the role of labor-saving technical change and

expectations about sales.7

        If the behavior characterizing individual firms is described by (7), and

firms differ in the sizes of their                     -
                                                           L1 and    their K, at any time t

some fraction 6, of the firms in any aggregate will hold employment constant

at        (will behave according to (7a)), while                  l-6 of     the firms will adjust

according to (7b).           If we observe only the behavior of the aggregate, we will

find that the adjustment of labor demand will be characterized by an equation

that looks just like (6) (with & substituted for                    -y),     If one ignores the time-

varying nature of the p             and the problems of aggregating individual firms' p

to obtain 1- &,        the   standard specification in (6) describes aggregate employ-

ment dynamics fairly well even though the underlying behavior is characterized

by (7).

        Equation (6) is based on quadratic variable adjustment costs, so that

-y   is presumably related to the quadraticity of the adjustment cost function.

Estimates of     -y   could be related to the characteristics of firms that make

them adjust slowly or rapidly in response to shocks.                         Equations (7) are based

on fixed adjustment costs.             Estimates of        K   could be used to indicate which

finns change employment in response to small demand shocks and which firms

have sufficiently large fixed costs of adjustment that they change employment


                                                   11
only in response to large shocks.                In the presenoe of aggregation it is

difficult to distinguish between these two possIble adjustment cost structures,

and between these two quite different views of the nature of firma' responses

to shocks to factor demand.

V.   Estimates for         Individual Plants

     To examioe the effects        -cf   differing structures of adjustment costs at the

proper  level of disaggregation I acquired data on seven nanufatturing plants
of a largo 17,5. corporation. Monthly data on outtut were obtained for December
1977 through       May   1987, aa were monthly employment levels from January 1983

through May 1987. In addition to estimates over the individual plants for
February 1981 through May 1987             1    alan present eatiaatea baaed on the aggregationa
of emnlnynent and cutput over all               seven p1-ants and cc the pooled aample of ISA
obaervationa.
          The employment    data are mid-month counts of production -workers in each
plant.     The    output data measure total production in the month. During the 51
months for       which I have employment data there were no major strikes in this

company.     A few plants were      shut       down due r.c   strike-s for less than one week,
but thia does not seem to have affected prnducticnwnrkar employment on
monthly    totals    on output.
         Before proceeding to      the   estimation of (7),        a   detailed preview of the
results    can be obtained by examining plots of the logarithmic                of employment

and output in the seven plants, and of the aggregated data covering rheae

plants.     The data are presented in Figure 1.               Each plot shows the 52 months of

the sample period; each origin represents February 1983 and the minimum value

of the logarithm of one plus the plant's employment level,                     The first seven

plots ate striking.          There are substantial fluctuations in output; but

production-worker employment is essentially constant, except for large changes

about the time of the lsrger changes in output.                   This is seen especislly

clearly in the data for Plants 1, 4 and 5, but appears to characterize the data

for the other four plants too.          This inference contrasts sharply with the

appearance of the data aggregated over the seven plants, shown in the last

plot.    There are continuous fluctuations in employment, and these roug)üy

coincide with the fluctuations in output.            The first seven plots are quite

inconsistent with a model of smooth fluctuations in employment based on convex

variable adjustment costs; the last plot appears consistent with such a model.

        While these figures tell much of the story, they cannot tell us whether

the underlying relationship between the logarithms of employment and output

(L and Y) are consistent with the static theory of production; nor can they

provide us with insights into the size of the shock, K, that is necessary to

induce the firm to change employment in the plant.                 To make these inferences

we must estimate      (7)   and the accompanying equation, alternatives (10) or (11).

Throughout the analysis I use seasonally unadjusted data:                 Only in Plant 3 was
there significant twelfth-order autocorrelation in Y.


        To generate the sequences              I initially used a transfer function

based on continuously-updated regressions of Y on its 12 lagged values, a time

trend, and the 12 lagged values of the company's retail sales,                 While these

regressions fitted better than did those that excluded the firm's retail sales,

they did not predict Y so well.         Accordingly,    (7)      is estimated using ARI(12)

forecasts of Y.       Each forecast is based on the most recent five years of data

on output.

        A comparison of the estimates of       (6)   and   (7)    is essentially a test of

how the standard model of convex variable costs of adjustment performs relative

to a model in which variable costs are of degree one or less, but there are

fixed adjustment costs.         Under alternative (10) the model in (6) has five

parameters   -   - - the four   regression parameters a0, a1, a3 and -, and       o.

                                              13
Under the same alternative the switching model has seven parameters                     the


three                c,        and         To make estimation of the system somewhat

that errors that occur when the firm seeks to hold employment constant are not


likely to be so large as those produced when the firm tries to move from


to   L.    The basic switching model thus has          six.   free parameters,   While (6)

is not nested in (7), ye can discriminate between them hy examining the values

of the likelihood functions of each.

          I begio with a discussion of the estimates of an autoregression of L,


and of     (11)      and two alternatives of (6), which are shown in Table        l.   The

estimates for the individual plants are not too encouraging, as they contain

some negative autoregressive terms in the AR(l) model and in (6), some positive

time trends and even a negative coefficient on expected output for Plant                 1.


This instability across the plants            is probably due to the     use of microeconomic

data    and to the relatively few observations available for each plant.
          The   estimation problems induced by this combination are overcome           when

either the        pooled or the aggregated date underlie the estimation.           The results

for these two cuts of the date are shown. in the first two tableaux of Table 1.


In the aggregated data the coefficients on                     are consistent with previous


work using industry data; the time trends, particularly in the pooled data, are

consistent with an implied trend in labor productivity of about 2 percent per


year.'°        The coefficients on the autoregressive term in L, although somewhat

lower then found in most estimates based on monthly industry date, are not

in the fourth column in each tableau) gives a better          fit,   the t ward-looking

terms          do add significantly to the equations.

        Table 2 shows the maximum      likelihood estimates   of the switching model

in   (7) for   each of six plants, for the pooled data on seven plants, and for

those data aggregated.11       A comparison of the log-likelihood values of          (6)   in

Table 1 to those for either of the two models in (7) is striking:               For all six

plants the values of the log-likelihood of model (7) are higher by at least 2

than they are for the equivalent version of model (6) (which has one less

estimated parameter)           The   clearest comparisons   are again on the pooled

data.     While no nested hypotheses can be tested,     2log         - log      —   44.5

and 63.7 for alternatives (10) and (11) estimated over the pooled data.                This

confirms the impressionistic evidence in Figure 1 that the switching model

describes these plant-level data far better than does a model of smooth

               13
adjustment.

        The estimates of K are quite large, implying that the firm will change

employment levels only in response to very large shocks to expected output.

In the pooled data       —   .6.   Consider what an estimate this large means.

Unless demand is very slack in these plants, the increases in product demand

that occur are met by combinations of greater effort and increased hours per

worker.     This inference is corroborated by the knowledge that there are

large variations in overtime hours in the industry to which these plants

belong.     With very large changes in product demand, though, firms respond by

non-marginal changes in employment.         This is the same sequence of responses

that is implicit in standard views of how firms adjust.              However, the standard

view that employment is adjusted marginally is inconsistent with these data.




                                              15
      The last column of Table 2 presents statistics associated with     .    There

is aubstantial monthly variation in the probability that the firm switches to a

new equilibrium.    Moreover, for most plants, and in the pooled data,       ranges

over most of the interval (0,1).    This implies that the model can discriminate

fairly well in separating observations onto (7a) and (7b).     That the mean of

     .20,   though, shows that it is unlikely at most times that the firm is

choosing to change employment.

      Recall that these estimates are based on employment levels, and thus,

like the theory in Section III, implicitly on costs of net adjustment.       We do

know, though, that voluntary turnover in the four-digit SIC industry to which

these plants belong averaged .8 percent per month in the late 1970s.'4     If,

as seems likely, this fairly large monthly outflow occurs repeatedly in the

same jobs, we may conclude that either that variable hiring costs are not very

important to this firm or, more tikely, that they are not convex and that the

fixed costs of hiring are small.    The important nonconvexity in adjustment coats

in these plants is in the level of staffing ---   in   the workplace itself rather

than in the activities of the personnel office.    The sizes of the estimated K

indicate that the lumpiness results from economies of scale in maintaining

intact an entire work shift or production line.

      If one examines Figure 1 it appears that most of the fluctuations in

employment represent temporary decreases that are soon restored to the initial

employment level.    Clearly much of what is occurring in these data is temporary

layoffs.    Much, though, also reflects permanent changes in the level of staffing,

for example, in Plants 2 through S at various points during the sample.       Even if

all the discontinuous employment changes represented temporary layoffs, we would

still have learned much from examining these employment and output data.       Even

under this most restrictive (and clearly not entirely correct) interpretation


                                         16
the data show that small fluctuations in output demand are not met by changes

in employment demand.

      This insight is nearly lost when one begins to aggregate rae data.                    The

estimates on the aggregated data present an entirely different picture from

those on the pooled data or on the individual plants.                The   K   are insignificant

and very small; and the average values of the                  are much higher than in


the pooled data.            Also, while (')   describes    the data better than does (4),

                            —   7 98 and 12.32, far below the differences in the

estimates on the pooled data, and below most of the differences in the

estimates on the individual plants.              Clearly     even at this very low level of

                                                        models of adjustment
aggregation much of the ability to discriminate between

costa is lost.

VI.   Estimates for Small Industries

       To examine problems of model discrimination when further aggregation is

made, I obtained published and unpublished data characterizing small (four-

digit) industries in United States manufacturing.                 Of the several industries

for which the data reflect physical output rather than employee-hours,                   only

four have had the same definition and have sufficiently long Continuous series

of data on employment and output.              These are; Slt 2821, plastics materials and

                                                                      and
resins; SIC 3221, glass containers; SIC 3632, household refrigerators

freezers; SIC 3633, household laundry equipment.

       The monthly data cover all employees.                Output is monthly also, with the

                                                          For both series the data cover
seasonally unadjusted series used here.15

1958-1985.       Forecasts of Y are constructed exactly as in Section V, and the

 same models are estimated here.              With the loss of the observations needed to

                                       to begin the data set used in estimating
produce these forecasts and the desire

 (7) with a full        years      data, the model is observed over the period 1965-85.

        Table 3 presents estimates of the same models as did Table 1.                   In this

periods under study.           In all industries except SIC 3221 the two         rsiona of

equation (6) add little explanatory power beyond that provided b                 a simple

AR(l) model.     This contrasts sharply to the results in Table 1, where a first-

order autoregresaion generally explained little of the variation in employment.

Moreover, except in SIC 3633 the cern in                  ia either insignificant or

has an unexpected negative sign.

VII.    Concluaiona, and Implications for Macroeconomic Adjustment and
            Labor-Market Policy

        I have demonstrated on data for a particular set of individual plants

that the standard model of convex variable adjustment coats is quite inferior

to a specification based on adjustment costa that are fixed. For data on saall

U.S. manufacturing induatres, and for data aggregated over a number of plants

of one manufacturing company, it is more difficult to discriminate between the

two models.      Clearly, the particular form of adjustment coats that I have

chosem is not necessarily a correct description of employment adjustment at

the micro level.     All I have shown is that, as a summary of the Costs this

particular firm faces in the plants it operates, it is better :can that embodied

in the standard model.     Similarly, the lumpy employment adjustn'nt in these

plants may be quite atypical of industry generally; but no one has demonstrated

that smooth employment adjustment is typical.     Rather, smoothness has heretofore

been assumed rather than tested.

         This study is the first attempt to compare different models of employment

adjustment      It shows that fixed costs characterize adjustment at the plant

level,     it may be that even at the level of decision-making by firma the

standard quadratic cost model is more appropriate,     The lumpy adjustment that

exists at the plant level may be consistent with the smooth adjustment of

shifts of workers across a number of plants operated by a single large firm,

Without additional testing on plants in other firma the question cannot be

answered.     Is it worth doing the additional data collection and research at

the appropriate micro level that might cement the abandonment of the standard

model?     After all, the standard model may describe aggregated data just as

well, it leads to simple linear decision rules, and it is much easier to

estimate.     Aside from a desire for completeness and correctness there are, I

believe, many reasons for an affirmative answer to this question.

         The first relates to macroeconomic fluctuations in employment and

cyclical fluctuations in productivity.    Aggregation of individual firms'

behavior under the linear equation that is derived from the standard model

yields a linear equation characterizing aggregate employment dynamics.       This

equation iiplies labor hoarding but no special timing effects.    Yet there is a

long tradition in macroeconomics (Fair, 1969; Cordon, 1979) of including timing
effects in equations "explaining" cyclical productivity change to capture the

observation that productivity grows unusually slowly as the economy nears a

cyclical peak.    These are imposed in an ad hoc fashion; but they are


                                          19
consistent with microeconomic structures characterized by fixed costs, so that

linear aggregation is impossible.    Abandoning the standard model requires

expanding models of macroeconomic employment adjustment to include information

about che distribution of sub-units (in the specification used here, the

distribution across (7a) and (7b)).    Indeed, for one specific probability

density function (the uniform) a mean-preserving   spread in demand shocks

decreases the aggregate response of employment to those shocks.16

      Massive and rapid "shake-outs" of employment, such as occurred in 1974-75

and 1982, are also not predicted by the standard model.    They are, though,

quite consistent with a model with fixed costs in which the response to large

shocks is more rapid and disproportionately greater than to smaller shocks.

      Slow adjustment has been linked (Nickell, 1979; Msmermesh, 1986b;

Abrsham-Houseman, 1987; Burgess, 1988) to the imposition of policies that, for

exsmple, make it harder for firms to shed labor through layoffs or plant

closings.   It is difficult to see how such policies impose an increasing

variable cost of adjustment.    Unemployment insurance benefits (that are not

fully offset by a lower supply price of labor) impose a linear variable cost of

adjustment on most employers.    Mandatory advance notification of massive

layoffs or of plant closings imposes a lump-sum cost that is effective under

most proposals only if the drop in employment exceeds some minimum.17     Other

proposed cost-increasing labor-market policies also are hard to analyze in the

context of increasing variable adjustment costs.     For example, requiring

employers to list all vacancies with the Employment Service, as has been

suggested in the United States (e.g., Lawyers' Committee, 1971, p. 99), and as

is the norm in some European economies, would impose some fixed costs and

linear variable costs.   Our   results and these observations   on the likely

structure of adjustment costs mean that we cannot readily use previous

empirical work to infer their likely impact.     Rather, as has been so fruitful


                                         20
in the study of other effects of labor-market policies and social programs, it

will be necessary to model their costs carefully and estimate their impacts by

applying those models to microeconomic data.

       These conclusions should give pause to researchers who worry about

complex structures of error terms characterizing dynamic factor adjustment

under the maintainedassumption that adjustment is Slow because of increasing

variable costs.      More   attention needs   to be paid to linking the maximizing

behavior that produces factor adjustment to the underlying atructure of

adjustment costs.      That linkage must be made at the micro level, aith

implications for macro behavior based on determining the         correct   mechanism

for   aggregation.   The estimates here suggest tha       the most   profitable
approach   to studying      factor, and particularly employment adjustment requicea

obtaining and using rnicroeconomic data to         discover what individual firms

actually do.

2. There has oeen some discussion of more genecal adjustment processes
outside the labor area. Rothschild (1971) points out the weakness of the
justificacions tot the quadraticity of the cost function characterizing the
adjustment of the capital stock and shows that costs that are non-increasing
in the size of the adjuatmenc lead to an instantaneous move to a new
equiliorium when a shock occurs, Sarro (1972, and Sheshinski-Woiss (1977)
analyze      altsenatire structures of the cost of adjusting prices. Blinder
(1981) examines (S a) 'sodels of inventon adjustment essentially assuming both
fixed and increasine variable costs of adjusrment. Aside from Pck (1,974, who

6. While factor prices are undoubtedly important, they are not available in
my main source of data, Also there is some evidence that they are less
important in affecting the abort-run labor demand fluctuations on which I
focus here than are variations in expectations about output (Freeman, 1977).
7. Obviously, decisions about the path of L are part of a larger system in
which production, inventories, investment and laboc demand are determinad by
forecasts of all the relevant costs and of sales. Here I examine just one
part of this large system and assume that sales expectations can be proxied
by expectations about output.

both   (6)    and   (7)   (because of the inclusion of       ag',.

9. 1 present results using only the one-month ahead forecast of output and
the expected change three months beyond that. Inclusion of a six-month
forecasted change did not add to the quality of the fitted equations for any
of the plants. Also, because the estimates of (7) for Plant 7 never converged
no matter what starting values or algorithms were chosen, results are presented
only for six individual plants. The seventh plant is, though, included in the
pooled data and in the estimates based on the aggregate of all plants.
10,  We can conduct a brief inquiry into the specification errors in the
equations that result from the absence of wage data by examining Figure 1
around the one time during the sample period when a substantial amount of wage
information suddenly became available (the one time when a new collective
bargaining contract was negotiated).  In only one of the seven plants was there
a sharp fluctuation (drop) in employment during that month, and in only one of
the other plants did employment fluctuate (drop) during the prior month, It is
not likely that any of the parameter estimates or our inferences about the
nature of paths of employment adjustment are gteatly affected by the absence of
wage data for this sample.
11.  In all oases the procedure MAXLIK in GAUSS is used to find the maxima of
the likelihood functions. The particular algorithm chosen is the Dsvidon-
Fletcher-Powell method.  The starting values for the parameters were the OLS
estimates of (6), with K set equal to 0 and    set equal to 1.

12.  One teat for serial correlation of the residuals from (7) was performed,
namely estimating the first-order autocorrelation of e. In none of the
plants, nor in the pooled or aggregated data, was the autocorrelation
significant.

13.  To approximate the general model of Section III a term in
to (7b).
                                                               Li  was added
          Its addition did not significantly raise the estimated values of the
likelihood functions in either the pooled or the aggregated data, and did so In
estimates for only one plant.

14.  Because of Federal budget cuts, no such turnover data are available for
the sample period we use in estimating (6) and (7).

15.  The unpublished output data were provided by Kenneth Armitsge of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. Unlike in the plant-level data,
theta is substantial seasonality in the output data for these industries.
(About one-third of the variation in output is accounted for by a simple
AR(l2) model.)  Despite this, the estimates presented in this Section are
based on seasonally unadjusted data to maintain comparability with the
previous Section. The inferences we draw about the inability to discriminate
between models of adjustment costs did not differ when the models were
reestimated using seasonally adjusted data on output.

16.     With fixed adjustment costs, in a simplified model employment change
in a plant will be 0 if output change y C K or y > -K, end be some multiple
of y if        K.  Let y be distributed uniformly over the interval
[y*  -  a, y* a), with Pr(y—y') =
             +                         on this interval and a > K. I assume
y*  >  0, so average output is rising. Then:

              E(y lyl : K)
A mean-preserving spread in y involves an increase in a, which implies a

                                       26
decrease in if E(y   y    K) a-K > 0.      For a given aggregate change in output,
an increase in the dispersion of output change across subunits reduces the
average output change among those units that are    va'ing employment.     Since the

average change in employment is a multiple of    E(y   lyl    K), it is reduced by
the increased dispersion even though   y   has not changed.

17.  For example, H. 1484, introduced March 9, 1987, required 90 days notice
for layoffs or closings involving 50-100 workers; 120 days if 100-500 workers
were involved, and 180 days if 500 or more workers were to lose their jobs
