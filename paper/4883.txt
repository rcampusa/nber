       Many states have or are considering implementing school finance reforms aimed at

lessening inequality in the provision of public education across communities. These reforms will

tend to have complicated aggregate effects on income distribution, intergenerational income

mobility, and welfare. In order to analyze the potential effects of such reforms, this paper

constructs a dynamic general equilibrium model of public education provision, calibrates it using

US data, and examines the quantitative effects of a major school finance reform. The policy

reform examined is a change from a system of pure local finance to one in which all funding is

done at the federal level and expenditures per student are equal across communities. We find

that this policy increases average income and total spending on education as a fraction of income.

Moreover, there are large welfare gains associated with this policy; steady-state welfare increases

by 3.2% of steady-state income.

     A distinguishing feature of public education in the US is the

significant role played by local property taxes and the resulting large

disparity in expenditures per student observed across school districts. A

series of State Supreme Court rulings and public concern over public education

have led many states to consider and/or to enact reforms with the aim of

reducing inequality of access to quality public education.

     The effects of various reforms to the system of financing public

education are difficult to predict, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Total resources devoted to education, property values, residence patterns and

aggregate welfare may all be affected. Moreover, given educations critical

role in determining individual income, reforms which alter total spending on

education and/or its pattern across communities should have aggregate effects

on income distribution, growth and intergenerational income mobility. This

paper takes a first step assessing the potential effects of education finance

reform. We construct a dynamic general equilibrium model of public education

provision in a multi—community setting, calibrate it using US data, and use

the calibrated model to evaluate the quantitative effects of a major    reform.1

     We extend to a dynamic setting the model of Fernandez and Rogerson

(1992). This is a multi—community model in the tradition of those pioneered

by Westhoff (1977) and Epple. Romer and Filimon (1984, 1988). Although our

model is highly stylized, it incorporates four features which are central to


        notable early attempt to analyze the quantitative effects of some
education reforms is Inman (1978). He estimates a lulti—community model using
data from the New York metropolitan area and examines the welfare effects of
several reforms. One difference between his work and ours is that we model
the income distribution dynamics resulting from changes in the quality of
education received by children. A second difference is that whereas his model
contains more features than does ours, our analysis is explicitly general
equilibrium.

an analysis of public education finance in the US. First, there is

substantial heterogeneity of income across households. Second, individuals

are mobile across communities. Third, public education is provided at the

community level and fourth, funding for public education is largely determined

at the local level.

     The population structure is that of a two—period—lived overlapping

generations model in which there is a large number of households every period,

each consisting of one old and one young member. Households choose in which

community to reside. Each community has a local housing market and determines

a tax rate on local housing expenditures by majority vote. The proceeds are

used to provide public education for its residents. An old individual's

income is determined by the quality of education received when young and an

idiosyncratic shock.

     The equilibrium inter—community population distribution and the tax rates

that result in a given period determine the quality of education obtained by

each child which, in conjunction with the realization of idiosyncratic income

shocks, then determines the equilibrium income distribution over households

for the following period. This process repeats itself. The equilibrium for

this model has the property that in each period individuals stratify

themselves into communities by income. higher income communities have higher

per student expenditures on education and higher gross—of—tax housing prices.

As a result, children born into higher incoiie households have higher expected

incomes than do children born into lower income households.

    te calibrate the model described above to US data. The calibration uses

information on the (cross—sectional) elasticity of educational expenditures
                                      —3—




 per student with respect to community mean income, the elasticity of

 (subsequent) earnings with respect to quality of education when young, price

 elasticities of housing demand and supply, mean and median income, and

expenditure shares for housing and education.

     In the model described above, public education is entirely funded at the

local level. The major policy reform we analyze is one in which local

financing of education is replaced with national (or state) financing and the

revenue is distributed equally per student across communities. Several states

have taken significant steps towards this kind of system.2

     Our analysis highlights the tradeoffs that exist between a local and a

national finance system. The former permits individuals, Liven their income,

greater scope for sorting themselves into communities that more closely offer

their preferred bundles than does a national system which imposes uniform

spending. The latter system, on the other hand, by reducing heterogeneity in

education expenditures, can modify the income distribution in such a way to

attain higher average income. While the net welfare effect of the above

tradeoff cx ante is not signable in our framework, our calibration yields the

following results: relative to the case of pure local financing, we find that

a policy of national financing leads to higher average income in the steady

state, higher average spending on education, and higher welfare. The

magnitude of the welfare improvement measured in terms of steady—state income


          state public education finance systems vary widely in the extent to
which state aid provisions attempt to lessen the inequality in spending across
districts with some state systems lying close to the extremes of either local
or national financing. Thus, a comparison of these two extreme possiblities
is a natural starting point in an attempt to gauge the potential significance
of education finance reforms that aim to lessen inequalities in local
spending.

is 3.2%, which is a large gain relative to that found for many policies. The

welfare implications of the transition path are also examined. We find that

for annual discount rates smaller than 8.2%, a social planner would choose to

implement the policy change.

     Our work is related to two literatures. The first is a theoretical

literature that addresses various aspects of the interaction between

education, income distribution and political economy. Recent contributions to

this literature include papers by Fernandez and Rogerson (1991), Gloam and

Raiikumar (1992), oldrin (1992), Saint—Paul and Verdier (1994), and Perotti

(1993). These papers all consider education as being provided centrally.

Papers which model the local provision of education include Durlauf (1992),

Benabou (1992), Cooper (1992), Fernandez and Rogerson (1993) and Epple and

Romano (1993). A distinguishing feature of our current paper is its emphasis

on quantitative analysis.

     The second related literature is a large empirical literature on the

determinants and consequences of expenditures on public education. One aim of

this literature is to examine the pattern of expenditures across communities

in relation to the cross—community variation of variables. Inman (1979) and

Bergstrom et al. (1982) survey this literature and Rothstein (1992) is a

recent contribution. There is also a literature on the relation between

spending on education and outcomes which is too extensive to survey here.

Coleman (1966) is an early contribution, Hanushek (1986) surveys the

literature, and Card and Krueger (1992) provide new evidence on the issue.

     The outline of the paper follows. Section 2 describes the benchmark

model. Section 3 discusses the calibration of this model. Section 4 reports
                                        —5—




the results of the calibration and of the policy reform carried out in the

calibrated model. Section 5 performs a sensitivity analysis and Section 6

concludes.




2.   The Model

     The economy is populated by a sequence of two—period—lived overlapping

generations. A continuum of agents with total mass equal to one is born in

every time period. Each individual belongs to a household consisting of one

old person (the parent) and one young person (the child). All decisions are

made by old individuals, each of whom has identical preferences given by:

                      u(c,h) + Ew(y).                                            (1)

where c is consumption of a private good, h is consumption of housing

services, E is an expectations operator, and     is next period's income of the

household's young individual. The function u is assumed to be strictly

concave, increasing in each argument, twice continuously differentiable and

defines preferences over c and h that are homothetic.3 The function w is

increasing and concave.

      Individual income is assumed to take one of I valuas: Yi' y2,   .
                                                                          .y1,   with

         .y1. An individual's income when old is determined by q—the quality

of education obtained when young—and an idiosyncratic shock.4 The


     3Homothetic preferences are assumed since they simplify computation; they
are in no way essential.
     4Thus, we abstract away from any possible peer effects (i.e. the
possibility that who you go to school with matters) and parental
characteristics other than income. Quantitative evidence on peer effects is
mixed. de Bartolome (1990) summarizes empirical findings and provides a
theoretical analysis of peer effects in a multi—community model as does
Benabou (1994). The importance of parental characteristics is the subject of
much controversy (see Card and Krueger (1992)).
                                            —6—




prcability that an individual has income Yj when old given an education of

qu4ity q when young is equal to j(q).

     Define v(q) by:

                        v(q) — Ew(y0) —    E(q)w(y1)                           (2)

Preferences can then be defined over c,h and q:

                        u(c,h) +   v(q).                                        (3)

We ssuzne   that v is   increasing, concave and twice continuously differentiable.

     Old individuals must choose a community in which to reside. There are

two communities. Each community j is characterized by a proportional tax

on nousing expenditures, a quality of education qj and a net—of—tax housing

pri'e Pj      Each community has its own    housing   market, with supply of housing

in    given by              Note that this function is allowed to differ across
                  Hj(pj).
communities, reflecting differences in land endowments and other factors. We

assume that       is increasing, continuous, and equal to zero when Pj is zero.

The gross—of—tax housing price in Cj is given by j_(l+tj)pj. We assume that

housing services are rented and, so as not to introduce further complications,

the owners of the housing services are assumed to live outside the two

communities    and simply consume their rental income. Proceeds from the tax are

used exclusively to finance local public education. We assume that the

quality of public education is equal to per pupil spending on education. All

residents of a given community receive the same quality of education;

education cannot be privately supplemented.5


     5See Epple and Rocnano (1993) for a model that incorporates a private
education option.
                                        —7—




     We now describe the decisions and outcomes that correspond to each time

period. In each period the interaction among individuals and communities can

be described as a stage game of the following form.     In the first stage, all

(old) individuals simultaneously choose a community (C1, 1—1.2) in which to

reside. Thereafter, these individuals are assumed Co be unable to move.6 In

the second stage, communities choose tax rates through a process of majority

vote, after which individuals make their housing and consumption choices and

young individuals receive education in the community in which their parent has

chosen to reside. At the end of the period, uncertainty about next period's

income is resolved (note that this occurs before the residence decision of the

following period) .    Then time rolls forward and the two—stage game is repeated

with the previous period's young individuals becoming this period's old

individuals. We analyze the subgame—perfect equilibria of such a game.

     Note that from an individual's perspective, a community Is completely

characterized by the pair (r,q). Thus, an individual with income y has an

indirect utility function V(w,q;y) defined by:

                  V(w,q;y) — Max u(c,h) +     v(q)                         (4)
                             c,h
                      s.t. h+cy, cO, hO,

where   c has been chosen as nuxneraire.7 Since each individual can solve the

two—stage period game by backward induction, for any equilibrium outcome


           assumption implies that each individual takC2 the composition of
the community as given when voting. This greatly simplifie. the strategic
interactions between communities.
     7Note that we have implicitly assumed that education is the only
technology available by which a parent can contribute to her child's income.
                                             —8—




           each individual must reside in the community that yields her the

gr.-ater utility.

        Define h(.y) to be the individual housing demand resulting from the

ma.imization problem in (4). By homotheticity h can be written as

Gi';en a set of residents of mass Nj and a tax rate tj in Cj, the variables qj

ant: Pj wuSt satisfy:


                                     —   H(p)                             (5.1)


                                         —                                (5.2)


where       is mean income in Cj .   The first equation requires that the housing

market clear. The second states that the quality of education qj equals the

per (old) person tax revenue of the community. It is straightforward to show

that for any positive value of t1 equation (5.1) has a unique solution for p.

Furthermore, p is decreasing in tj and             is increasing in tj.

        The following assumption on preferences greatly facilitates

characterization of equilibrium in the two—stage game.9

Assumption 1.:    For all w,y v'(q)/(u(c,h)h(R,y)J is increasing in y.

        Since v'/(uh) is the slope of an individual's indifference curve in q—

space, Assumption 1 guarantees that this slope is increasing in initial

income, i.e. that


     81n what follows we assume that the optimization problem in (4) results
in interior solutions for c and h.
     9Th1s assumption is a single—crossing condition. While its algebraic
expression depends on the particular model, it is used by the multi—community
literature to induce separation of individuals and thus allow equilibria to be
characterized (see, for example, ¶Jesthoff (1977), Fernandez and Rogerson
(1992, 1993) and Benabou (1994)),
                                              —9—




                               S_ucch(l_-why) + uchhhy +   uh <    0                   (6)

     The power of this assumption to characterize equilibrium is seen in the

next two propositions which are common in the multicouununity literature.

Proposition 1: Given a set of residents, majority voting over tax                   rates    in a

community results in the preferred tax          rate   of the resident with the median

income.

Proof: This follows immediately from the property of indifference curves

discussed previously. See Fernandez and Kogerson (1993) and Epple and Roceer

(1991) for detailed proofs in slightly different contexts.II

Proposition 2: If in equilibrium q is not equal to q and no community is

empty, then:
                  *   *        **
                 (1,q1)>>(w2,q2)
     (ii) All individuals in C1 have income at least as great as any

                 individual in C2

where C1 is defined as the community with the higher value of q.

Proof:    (i.)   If    *
                      l<c2
                          *         **
                           and q1q2 then all individuals prefer to          live in C1,

which contradicts the assumption that no community            is   empty.

(ii) Follows directly from Assumption I regarding the slope of indifference

curves in (q,ir)       space   as a function of y.II

      Proposition 2 implies that an equilibrium with q"q               will   be

characterized by the coexistence of a community with high income residents,

                                                                                   another
high gross—of—tax housing prices, and high quality education and
                                                                                             and a
community with lower income residents, low gross—of—tax housing prices,

 lower quality of education.
                                         —10—




     Any equilibrium that displays property (ii) of Proposition 2 is said to

be a stratified equilibrium and is common to multi—community models.1°

Problems of existence and uniqueness of a stratified equilibrium are endemic

to multi—community models (see, for example, Westhoff (1977,1979) and Epple,

Ftlimon and Romer (1984) for a discussion). In all of the simulations

reported later in the paper, however, the specifications are such that a

unique stratified equilibrium exists.

     Lastly, we turn to a characterization of the tax rates generated by

lajority voting. Using (5.1) and (5.2) one can write qj(t,,N) and

as the quality of education and tax inclusive housing price, respectively, in

C given    a tax rate t,   community mean income   and a community population of

N. The preferred tax rate for an individual with income y is determined by:


               Max u(y—wh,h) +     v(q(t,p,N))
                                                                       (7)
                           s.t. (5.1) and (5.2)

and where h solves (4), i.e. is the utility maximizing choice given w(tj,N)

and y.

     Using the envelope theorem, the first order condition for this problem

implies:


                                                                       (8)
                              uh(p4(l+t)p]_ v'q


     10There may also exist equilibria which are not stratified. For example,
given identical housing supply functions there always exists an equilibrium in
which the two communities are identical. i.e. half of each income group
resides in each community, resulting in equal tax rates, prices, and quality
of education. In the analysis that follows, however, we only consider
stratified equilibria. See Westhoff (1979) and Fernandez and Rogerson (1992)
for a discussion in a slightly different context of how requiring stability of
equilibria can eliminate all non—stratified equilibria.
                                           —11—




where p(t,,N) solves   (5.1) and (5.2). Note that p+(l+t)pt—d/dt>O.

      In a stratified equilibrium C1 has both higher mean and higher median

income than C2. Two comparative statics exercises, therefore, are of

interest; how is the tax rate that solves (8), denoted by ,         affected   by (i)

a change in y and (ii) a change in M? Straightforward calculation yields:



                             3/8y    —   S/D > 0                               (9)

and


                                             + (vqq + vq)
                                     D
                                                                                     (1)


where D denotes the second derivative of the maximand in (7) with respect to

t. y the second order condition, D is non—positive at a maximum.

      The first expression states that higher income individuals prefer higher

tax rates and necessarily, therefore, higher quality education. The second

expression says that an increase in mean income has an ambiguous effect on an

individual's preferred tax   rate.       Thus it is not possible to state whether in

equilibrium C1 must have a higher or lower tax rate than C2. As will be seen

in the next section, evidence on the relationship between community mean

income and spending on education suggests that the sign of ôt/8p is negative.

      Thus far we have discussed extensively the properties of equilibrium of

the two—stage game for any period t without making reference to future

periods. It was possible to do so since the outcome in period t is
                                            —12—




independent     of the future evolution of the state variable.11 Since our larger

game simply repeats this two—stage game every period, we need only keep track

of the state variable of this game—the income distribution of old agents—

which we write as —(),1,A2, •) where                is the fraction (or equivalently

mass) of old agents with income equal to Yj.

        If      is the income distribution of old individuals at the beginning of

period t,      then   an equilibrium to the two—stage game in period t   generates   a

beginning—of—period income distribution for period t÷l, A÷i. We denote by

A(A)    the   set of values for At+i that correspond to subgame—perfect equilibria

of the two—stage game given At—i.         In   a later section of the paper we focus on

the properties of a stationary or steady state for the system i.e. a value

such that *A(A*)



3.     Calibration

       The objective of this work is to quantify the effects of a major change

in the system of financing education. To do so it is necessary to specify

functional forms for the relationships introduced in the previous section and

assign parameter values. We first turn though to a brief description of the

computation of equilibrium.

3.1 Computation of Equilibrium


     11This fact, which greatly simplifies the analysis, follows from the
assumption that an old individual cares about the young individual's income
rather than utility, thus severing the link between on. time period and the
next. This is a commonly used device to render this typ. of analysis
tractable. See, for example, Cooper (1992), Durlauf (1992) and Clomm and
Ravikumar (1992). See Krussel and Rios—Rull (1993) for an illustration of the
difficulties in relaxing this assumption.
                                      —13—




      We use numerical methods to solve for the equilibrium of our model.

Given a beginning—of—period income distribution, our algorithm finds all

stratified equilibria to the two—stage game played in each period. The key

fact used in this procedure is that all potential stratified equilibrium can

be parameterized by the fraction of the population that resides in C1. We

denote this fraction as p. Each value of p determines the income

distributions of the two communities since it partitions the income space into

higher income individuals that reside in C1 and lower income individuals that

reside in C2. Associated with each value of p is a highest income individual

in C2; call this value Yb2 Let Ybi be the lowest income of an individual in

Cl.
      Define Wj(P) to be the utility of an individual with income Ybj residing

in Cj given that p partitions the residents of the two communities and that

each community chooses its tax rate via majority vote. An equilibrium can be

depicted as a crossing of the two        curves.12 We compute the Wj curves and

therefore find all the stratified equilibria. In all our simulations the

stratified equilibrium is unique.

      Given an initial income distribution, repeated application of the above

procedure can be used to solve for the entire equilibrium sequence.    We look

for stable steady—state income distributions by examining the dynamic path     for


A that results from each of a large set of initial distributions.     In our

simulations we find a unique (stable) steady state and convergence always

occurs.


     12Since the Ybi are discontinuous functions of p (given a discontinuous
income distributioni, the equilibrium need not require W1(p)—W2(p).

3.2 Functional Forms

       Three functional relationships need to be specified: preferences, housing

supply and the effect of the quality of education on subsequent earnings. For

preferences we assume:


                    a
                a c +
                                   a                              7
                        (1—aC )h                              a (yC —1)
                C                                             q
                                               w(y)                       O<a<l. Q,71 aq>o (11)
      u(ch) —                                             —



Th specification for u(ch) is a transformation of a constant elasticity of

substitution utility function. Note that Assumption 1 will be satisfied if

and only if         turns out to be strictly negative (given v'(q)>O). The choice

for u(y) displays constant relative risk aversion.

       We assume identical constant elasticity housing supply functions for both

communities, i.e.

                             uSi           s          b
                             "jPj)                  aPj

This specification yields the same price elasticity for both communities (i.e.

b).

       The final relationship to be specified is that linking quality of

education to subsequent earnings. We assume that each individuals realized

income is a draw from a discrete approximation to a log—nornal distribution

whose mean depends on q. In particular, consider a log normal distribution of

income where log of income has mean m(q) and variance                         and ra(q) is defined

by:


                                                6
                          y0 +     B(l+q)
            m(q) —                                                                   (13)
                                       6
                                     —15—




Given a vector (       .) where   Yj is contained in j'j41 for

i—l,2,...I—1, and y1)'1, we transforn the continuous distribution in (13) Co

a discrete distribution over the I income types (hence obtaining the 1(q)) by

integrating the above log normal distribution over the interval containing

     A few comments should be noted concerning this choice. First, Z>O

implies that expected income is increasing in q. Second, we assume that       is

independent of q. Third, m(q) can be concave or convex in q, depending on

whether S is smaller or larger than one. Lastly, it should be noted that (13)

is a specification meant to hold only over the relevant region of q, since

otherwise some combinations of parameter values and q yield negative expected

income. 13

3.3 Parameter Values

     We choose parameter values such that the steady—state equilibrium of the

model matches important observations for the US economy. In particular, we

require that the steady state match several aggregate expenditure shares,

elasticities, and properties of the income distribution for the US economy.

     There are three commodities in the model: consumption, housing, and

education, and hence two independent expenditure shares. The ratio of annual

aggregate housing expenditures to aggregate expenditures on consumption (which

includes housing). H/TC, (averaged over 1960—1990) is 0.15, and the average

annual ratio of spending on public elementary and secondary education to

aggregate expenditures on consumption, E/TC, is 0.053.


     13The term (1+q) is used rather than q as a normalization to avoid large
negative numbers.
                                     —16-.




     We match four elasticities: the price elasticities for housing demand and

supply       and        the elasticity of mean earnings with respect to the

quality of education mq' and the cross—sectional elasticity of community

public education expenditures with respect to community mean income

     Quigley (1979) surveys the literature on urban housing markets. Based on

this survey we choose to match a price elasticity of housing demand (gross of

taxes) equal to —.7 and a price elasticity of housing supply equal to .5.

Estimates of the demand elasticity range as high as —.95, however, and the

range of estimates of the supply elasticity is large. Additionally, the

mapping between the (implicit) models underlying these elasticity estimates

and our model is not exact. Hence we also explore the effect of different

price elasticities for our results.1-4 Note that the functional form we have

chosen for the utility function does not imply a constant demand price

elasticity for housing. By homotheticity, however, the price elasticity of

demand for housing is independent of income so that we can use the model's

cross—sectional steady—state observations of housing prices and per capita

housing quantities to compute the (gross) price elasticity,15 We normalize

the parameter a in the housing supply function to equal 1.

     A key difference between the two communities in our model is that in

equilibrium C1 has both higher mean income and quality of education than C2.

Therefore, from the steady—state equilibrium one can compute a cross—sectional

elasticity of (per—student) expenditures on education with respect to


     14Additional empirical studies are surveyed in Olsen (1986).
         demand elasticity less than one in absolute value corresponds to a
negative value of o, which is required to satisfy Assumption 1.
                                         —17—




community mean income. Many empirical studies obtain estimates of this

elasticity   (see Inman (1979) and Bergstrom, Rubinfeld and Shapiro (1982) for

surveys). The range of estimates obtained in these studies is 0.24—1.35, with

the vast majority of the estimates lying in the narrower range of 0.4—0.8. We

choose parameter values so that                 when evaluated at the steady—state

equilibrium. Note that a value greater than zero but smaller than one is

significant since it   implies   that, ceteris paribus, communities with higher

mean incomes spend more on education but tax       at   a lower rate.

     To choose a value for the elasticity of mean earnings with respect to

education quality we rely on evidence presented by Card and Krueger (1992),

Wachtel (1976), and Johnson and Stafford (1973). Card and Krueger. using

several indicators of quality of schooling across states and time, estimate

that a decrease in the student to teacher ratio by ten students would increase

earnings by 4.2%. Over the period 1924—1964 the average axuiu.al ratio of

teachers wages to total costs for public elementary and secondary schools was

54% and the average annual student—teacher ratio over the same period was

28.0. The resulting estimate of the elasticity of earnings with respect to

education expenditures (quality) is 0.1774.16 Wachtel, in a study that

examines the returns to schooling using school district expenditure levels,

finds an elasticity of 0.2. Since college expenditures are included as a

separate variable in his regressions, it is reasonable to view this estimate

as being on the low side to the extent that higher secondary education


     16Note that Card and Kruegers elasticity estimates combine two different
effects of quality on earnings: an increase in earnings holding years of
education constant, and an increase in wages due Co increased years of
education. While our model abstracts from the effect of quality on years of
education, we believe that the combined effect is the appropriate measure.
                                        —18—




exnditures also increase the probability of attending a higher quality

colLege. Johnson and Stafford also find an elasticity estimate of 0.2. In

our benchmark ca1ibraton we choose mq°•1911 and explore the sensitivity of

our results to changes in this value in section 5. We compute the elasticity

by ising the cross—sectional variation in the steady—state values of q across

comaunities and equation (13) relating q to mean earnings.

     The final piece of information we use in calibration is data on the

incuale distribution of families from the 1980 Census. We choose the i' to

mat.h the commonly used (in thousands) income intervals—y—(0,5.7.5,10.lS,2O.

25, 35,50)—and set the vector of yj's equal to (2.5,6.75,8.75,12.5.17.5.22.5,

30,.2.5,60). Two   additional   items of information that we match in the steady

stae of our model are the 1980 Census values of mean and median family income

values, equal to 21.4 and 17.9 respectively.17

     Lastly, in our benchmark specification we set —0 which implies that v(q)

can be approximated by the expression:18


                     a [y0 +
                      q
          v(q)                                                       (14)



Although this choice of -y is somewhat arbitrary, this value lies within the

range of estimates for risk aversion obtained in the asset pricing literature

when preferences are defined over consumption sequences. In Section 5 we

consider alternative values for this parameter.


     17When we compute median income in the model we assume that individuals
with income yj are uxiiforaly distributed over the interval
     18The fit of this approximation depends on how closely the transformation
from a continuous to a discrete distribution preserves the mean of log income.
                                      —19—




     Thus the items of information described above (two expenditure shares,

four elasticities, mean and median income) and the chosen values of -y and a

can be used to determine the eight parameter values: 8. aq. b, 6, a B. y0

and a2.

3.4 Discussion

     One   issue concerning the calibration procedure should be noted. Whereas
the model assumes that public education is entirely financed at the local

level, in the US state aid accounts for a substantial portion of expenditures

on education. It is possible, therefore, that the statistics that we match in

the calibration procedure are not invariant to the structure of educational

finances, and hence should not be used to calibrate a model with pure local

financing. The fact that financing provisions have changed significantly over

the last thirty years provides an opportunity to gauge the extent of this

problem. The aggregate expenditure shares for housing and (elementary and

secondary) education have been relatively constant over this period and we

know of no evidence to indicate significant changes in the price elasticity of

housing demand over time. Hence the concern raised by this issue for these

estimates is probably minor.

     On the other hand, calibrating the model to match the cross—sectional

elasticity of expenditures on education per student with respect to community

mean income is potentially more problematic. Much of the empirical work in

this area effectively involves a regression of (log of) community education

expenditures par student on a number of variables including log of community

mean income and a variable designed to capture the effect of state aid on the

marginal price of education expenditures faced by the tax payer. The
                                     —20--




coefficient on mean income is then interpreted as the elasticity of

expenditures with respect to mean income. While the empirical work attempts

to take into account the rules by which state aid is provided, the elasticity

estimated need not be invariant to these rules. This is perhaps less

problematic than may appear at first, however, since the estimates are derived

from studies of different states and many of the estimates are quite similar.

Nonetheless, in light of these concerns, Section S provides a sensitivity

analysis that allows us to address how changes in the values of the

elasticities used in the calibration affect our results.



4. Results

4.1 Properties of the Benchmark Model

     In this section we report the parameter values generated by the

calibration described in the previous section and present some additional

properties of the steady state and of the dynamics of the systei. As noted

before, our computations yield a unique equilibrium for the one period game, a

unique stable steady state, and convergence to the steady state)9

     Table I below reports the parameter values used in the calibration and

the steady—state values for several variables and Table 2 provides the steady—

state values of the community variables..


     19Typically, convergence to the steady state is quite rapid (three or
four periods)

     Note that, as required for a stratified equilibrium, both quality and the

gross price of housing are higher in community one. The net—of—tax price     of

housing is also higher in C1. This is essential to produce stratification

since the tax rate in C1 is lower than that in C2 as required by qM<l (given

q1>q2 and p1>p2).
     Spending per student is nearly twice as large in C1 as in C2. Although

there are many metropolitan areas in which this range of expenditures exists,

this ratio is somewhat on the extreme side of what is observed in the US data.

This is not surprising, however. Our model describes how expenditures would

vary across communities if all financing were done at the local level. The

fact that differences are not as large in the US data as they are in our

calibrated model simply indicates that state aid does (on average) decrease

differences in education expenditures across communities.

     In the steady state all individuals with income greater than 22.5 live in

C1, all individuals with income less than 22.5 live in C2, and individuals

with income equal to 22.5 are split across the two communities. Since the

quality of education differs across communities, the children of wealthier

individuals will belong to a different income distribution when old than that

of the children of poorer individuals. In the steady state computed above,

these two income distributions are given by:

4.2 Policy Experiment

     In this section we determine the effects of switching to a public

education system in which there is no local financing. Rather, per student

expenditures on education are the same regardless of the community of

residence and the total level of expenditure is determined at the state (or

national) level.20 Of courses the ann.r by which revenue is raised is also

important. We maintain the property tax as the tax     instrument   so as to keep

the local versus national question starkly focused.


     20This is similar to the system of financing education of some European
cotmtries.
                                         —24—




     Formally, the stage game of section 2 is modified so that in the second

stage voting is over a single property tax        rate   and expenditur.s per student

are equal across communities.21 It should be clear that in a subgame—perfect

equilibrium of this game the price of housing must be equal across

communities: since all individuals face the same tax          rate   and   obtain   the same

quality of education independently of the community in which they live, no one

would choose to reside in the community with the higher housing price.

     We use the functional forms and parameter values from the calibration

procedure described in the preceding section to determine the effects of the

change in policy. This is a classic policy analysis exercise in which the

fundamentals or primitives are held constant but individuals are allowed to

adjust their decision rules in response to the change in policy environment.

     We compute the steady—state equilibrium for this economy. It remains

true that there is a unique equilibrium in each period, a unique stable steady

state, and that the economy converges to the       steady   state. Table 4 displays

some of the properties of the steady—state equilibrium.

no local supplements.
                                         —25—




      A comparison of the steady—state outcomes generated by the two systems

yields several expected results. Since the median voter and mean income of

the entire economy Lies between those of the individual communities, it is not

surprising that, for example, spending per student in the steady state of the

second system lies between the corresponding values for the two communities of

the first system, as do the tax rate and the price of housing. Two results

(not necessarily expected) are that average income and education expenditures

as a fraction of total consumption are both greater under national financing.

These will turn    Out to be   central to our welfare results.

      Our analysis also allows us to trace out the transition path between the

two steady—states. Properties of the transition will be important to the

welfare calculation of Section 4.3. For completeness, Table 5 shows the

evolution of the tax rate, housing price, the quality of education, mean

income, and E/TC from period I (defined as the first period in which

individuals vote on a national tax rate given the income distribution, but not

     As can be noted from Table 5, the transition to the steady State is

monotonic in all the relevant variables as of period 1. Compared to the local

steady—state equilibrium of period 0, however, the transition entails a jump

in E/TC as the median voter first chooses a large tax      rate   to increase

spending on education by a large amount and then, as the income distribution

shifts to the right and total income increases, the tax rate and E/TC are

chosen progressively smaller.22 We now turn to the question of the effect of

this policy change on welfare.

4.3 Welfare Effects

     It is clearly desirable to have some measure of the welfare effects

associated with the change in the education financing system. We construct

the following welfare measure. For each economy we compute, for each period

t, the expected utility (EU) for a hypothetical individual whose income is a

random draw from that period's income distribution. Thus, if           is the

fraction of the population with income Yj and         is the utility of an

individual   with   income     then the expected utility in period t is given by:


                             EU_ Fi'i                                    (15)


Henceforth we define EU0 to be the value of EU in the steady state of the

local finance   system.
     We first examine the value of EU in the local financing steady state vs.

the national    financing steady   state. Under the local system EU—.3l97; under

the national system EU—. 3117.      In order to translat. the difference in


     22The income level of the median voter remaini unchanged throughout the
transition. This need not always be the case and would generically not be so
if a continuous income distribution were used.
                                          —27—




utility   into a measure not affected by monotone transformations of the utility

function, we calculate the percent, t, by which the vector of income

           .y9) would have to be reduced in the national financing system to
(y1,y2,

tender the hypothetical Individual indifferent between the two economies.

This calculation holds prices, tax      rates    and quality of education constant at

their original equilibrium levels. The magnitude of the required decrease in

income is 3.2%. This is a very large difference in welfare; welfare Costs of

alternative policies usually turn out to be a fraction of a percent of total

income.

     We next examine the welfare effects along the transition path to the new

steady stare. Table 6 shows the value of EU from period 0—the steady—state

under local financing—through period 4 (at which point the economy is at ts

steady—state equilibrium under the national financing system).

                                        TABLE 6

                1                      —.3205                        —.3

                3                      —.3117                        3.2

                4                      —.3117                         3.2




Note that the third column gives, for each period t, the percentage             by

which the vector of income would have to be changed in order to equate that

periods EUt to EU0 (recall that prices, tax          rate   and quality of education at
                                       —28—




kept at the equilibrium level attained in period t).23 Note that period 1

will have, ceteris paribus, a greater tendency to have a negative A associated

with it since any change in income distribution will not be realized until the

following period (i.e. the income distribution of this period is that from the

steady state under local finance).24

     In order to end up with an overall welfare evaluation which includes the

transition path, we need to assign a discount rate and the associated length

of a period, r. If each period is interpreted to be the productive life of an

individual, 30 years seems a reasonable benchmark. The structure of our

model, however, is such that an individual spends th. same length of time

going to school when young as being productive when old. Thus another

reasonable alternative is a time period of 15 years. We explore the

implications of both possibilities. Instead of arbitrarily assigning an

annual discount factor, however, we ask at what rate must the future be

discounted in order for both systems (including the transition to the national

financing system) to yield the same total utility. More formally, we find the

5 such that




                              sO YS    A1     —   0                     (16)


For r—30, this yields 9—.924 or an implicit annual interest rate r—8.2%. For

any discount factor greater than .924, therefore, under the welfare criteria

used it would be beneficial to switch to a national finance system.


     23Note chat by our previous definition, A0—O.
     24See Benabou (1992) for a somewhat different tension that exists between
long run and short run welfare.
                                           —29—




Similarly,    for r—l5   the   implied annual interest rate required for indifference

is r—17.2%.

      Note that the above welfare calculation did not take into account the

welfare of the owners of housing (who receive the rental income)          Total

producer surplus from the housing market is easily computed in the two

economies: Relative to its value in the steady state under local financing, it

first decreases by 1.7% in period 1. and then increases first by 2.89% in

period 2, and thereafter by 3.33% in each subsequent period (recall that the

comparison is always with period 0—the steady—state under local financing).

The    required for indifference in this case i higher (—.966 for f—30) but

in any case producer surplus is a small fraction of total steady—state income

(roughly 10%).

      What is the source of the larga overall welfare gain? By definition, any

difference in welfare must be induced by changes in the Vj and/or changes in

the Ai. Thus, we must examine the change in utility derived from each income

level's new c,h, and q bundle as well as the overall change in the income

distribution.

      Comparing across steady states, for the two financing systems studied

above, each of the        is greater under local financing. That is, for each

given income level, the steady state of the local financing system is

preferred to that of the national financing system. Since expected utility is

higher under national financing, it must be the case, therefore, that

favorable changes in the distribution of income (i.e. the At's) more than

offset the decrease in the Vj's. This points to a tradeoff that is central to

a comparison of a local and a national financing system. On the one hand, a
                                       —30—




local system has the ability to make individuals better off by allowing them

greater scope to sort themselves into communities that more closely reflect

their preferences ziven their income than does a national system that forces

individuals to consume the same quantity of the publicly provided good. On

the other hand, a national system may yield a better income distribution (in

that higher output is generated) than a local system which generates greater

heterogeneity in education expenditures. We now turn to a more detailed

examination of these points.

     Note first that the steady—state Income distribution under national

financing stochastically dominates that under local financing; in particular,

A1 through A4 are greater under local financing whereas A5—A9 are greater

under national financing. The income distribution under national financing is

characterized by a single parameter—the mean of the log normal distribution

(recall that the variance is constant). Thus, an explanation of the higher

level of mean income should provide insight into th. higher welfare achieved

under the national financing system.

     Although equation 13 allows the mean of log income to be either concave

or convex in q, our finding of 6—3.9 implies substantial concavity. It

follows that holding total spending on education fixed, next period's mean

income is greatest if these funds are divided equally across all students.

Whereas equal division of funds is what occurs under national financing,

under local financing students in C2 receivs roughly half the per student

expenditures as students in C1. To obtain an idea of how much this concavity

matters, we calculate the income distribution that would result from

distributing total steady—state expenditures on education in the local system
                                        —31—




equally across students. The mean of the resulting income distribution is

22.02. a gain of 2.1% over the mean of 21.56 that results from the pattern of

educational expenditures found in the steady state under local financing and

63.9% of the total increase in mean income found in the steady state of the

national system. Thus, there are large gains to be realized simply by

spreading resources equally across all students, the remainder of the gain in

mean income coming from the increased education expenditures induced by a

change in financing systems.

      It may be thought that a substantial portion of the   welfare    increase is a

consequence of concavity of preferences over q since our calibration implies

that v(q) is concave. Holding total spending on education Constant,

therefore, the average value of v(q) is maximized by a constant q across

communities. A simple calculation, however, indicates that the        quantitative
magnitude of this effect is small, In particular, using the steady—state

equilibrium values under   local   financing yields v(p*q+(l_p*)q) exceeding

p*v(q)+(l_p*)v(q) by 0.0008, which is only about 10% of the difference in

steady—state expected utilities for the two financing systems.

      We now turn to a closer e,camin.ation of the tradeoff between local and

national financing systems via the us. of two    illustrative   examples.

4.4   Two Examples

      The previous discussion of welfare effects highlighted two opposing

factors central to a comparison of local and national financing systems. On

the one hand, local finance permits heterogeneous agents to obtain bundles

closer to their preferred ones. On the other hand, the equalization of

expenditures across students that occurs in a national system may       result   in
                                           —32—




greater mean income. In our benchmark model the second effect is dominant.

Here we present two examples to show that this outcome is a result          of   the

particular parameter values generated by our calibration procedure and is not

inherent to the structure of the model. These examples may also           help to
illustrate   the nature of the tradeoff described above.

     Table 7 displays parameter values (where different froii the benchmark

model) and some selected statistics for the steady—state allocations under

local financing for the two examples and for the benchmark. As the table

indicates, both examples are not acceptable from th. perspective of our

calibration procedure. Moat importantly, in Example 1,                is too high and

in Example   2,         is too low. Our   focus   is on the predictions of these two

examples   for steady—state welfare gains associated with a change from local

finance to national finance. These are reported on the last row of the table.

Expressed as before in terms of output, ,         the   gains ar. —6.2 and +.27 percent

for Examples 1    and   2 respectively.

     Table   8 presents two additional pieces of information useful for
interpreting the above diffetences in welfare predictions. First it lists
preferred tax rates in the steady stat. under national financing by income
level for the benchmark model (BM) and the two examples. This provides some
indication of the extent to which individuals desire different bundles of
goods.25 Preferred tax rates exhibit the smallest range in Example           2 and the

greatest   range in Example I. The second piece of information provided is the
percent change in mean income (%ii) that would result if the resources devoted

     25Note that this is a rough indication since both preferences and
technology differ in the three cases.
                                                     —33—




to education   in the local financing steady state were spread equally                     across
all students (as in the discussion on page 30). This figure provides some

indication of the potential gains from equalizing expenditures. Note that

this number is largest in the benchmark model and smallest in Example 2.

       An explanation of the contrasting results for welfare gains in the three

cases is as follows. Example           2 is     a case where spending on education is not

very   important   (as evidenced by the small value of jq).                      Consequently,
neither of the two    factors      mentioned above is particularly significant and the
                                         —34—




overall welfare gain is also small. Example 1 is a cas. where heterogeneity

is quite important. Thus, although there are sizable gains to be had simply

by smoothing expenditures across students, these are outweighed by the gains

associated with allowing individuals to sort themselves into different

communities. Relative to Example 1, the benchmark model reverses the relative

magnitudes of the two effects yielding a larg. overall welfare improvement.



5. Sensitivity Analysis and Alternative Comparisons

     Our calibration exercise relies on several estimates obtained from

empirical work. Because the empirical studiss often suggest a range of

estimates rather than a single value, it is of interest to check the

sensitivity of our policy analysis to the use of a].t.rnative values in the

calibration exercise. Furthermore, it is also of interest to see what our

model implies for some statistics not used in our calibration exercise.

5.1 Sensitivity to Alternative Parameter Values

     In all the exercises that follow, the model's parameters are

recalibrated, i.e. parameters are chosen so that th. model's steady—state

matches the appropriate set of statistics. To focus the discussion, we

consider only the effect of these alternatives on the steady—state welfare

calculation carried out in Section 4.3.

     We begin with a brief discussion of three variations that we found to

have virtually no effect on the magnitude of th. steady—state welfare gain:

changes in the preference parameter      and in the two housing price

elasticities. Recall that 1 was set to 0 in the benchmark specification. The

results are very similar when 1   is   set to values of —l and —5. Similarly, we
                                           —35—




found no significant effect of changing the values of the price elasticities

of housing used in the calibration. For the demand elasticity we used a value

of —.93 (which corresponds to the upper range of estimates) ,          and for the

supply elasticity we used values ranging from 1/3 to 3.

     In contrast to the above, we found       that   variations in        and
                                                                                q    have

a significant impact on the magnitude of the steady—state welfare gains

predicted by our model. Table 9 presents the results for several alternative

values of these two elasticities. (In each case the table shows the parameter

values that differ from those of the benchmark specification.) In the

interest of space we do not include any of the other summary statistics for

the steady—state equilibria, but note that in all cases these values are

similar to those for the benchmark model.

     From the table we note that although changes in                result in a sizable

range of associated welfare gains, in all cases the welfare gain is

substantial. Furtheriiore, welfare gains significantly larger than those

reported in Section 4.3 are apparently plausible. As for the alternative

values for        these are not chosen in accord with any ranges based on
             mq
                                     —36—




empirical work (as indicated in Section 3, the range of estimates for this

value is in fact quite tight). Nonetheless, we think it informative to

indicate the sensitivity of our results to this value. For the range of

values displayed in the table, the steady—state welfare gain appears to be

rougbly linear in this elasticity.

5.2 Some Additional Comparisons

     In addition to the previous sensitivity analysis, it is also of interest

to contrast the income distribution and the intergenerational mobility

generated by our model with that observed in reality as well as with some

alternative measures of the rate of return to education. Th, calibration

ensures that the mean and median income in the model's steady state are

approximately equal to their counterparts in the US data. The distribution of

income from the 1980 US Census is given by (.07,.06,.07,.l5.l5,.14,.l9,

.ll.,.06). As is well—known, the log normal distribution does a good job of

accounting for the observed income distribution except that it does not have

enough mass in the tails. Not surprisingly, therefore, comparing with the A

in Table 1, the saaa is true of the model's steady—state income distribution.

     The intergenerational mobility implied by the steady—state equilibrium of

the mbdel are summarized by the numbers in Table 10 and contrasted with

averages obtained for the US by Zimmerman (1992) which are presented below in

parentheses.

Note that our model produces a smaller probability of a child ending up in the

cop quarter given that the parent is in that quarter and likewise a smaller

probability of remaining in the bottom quarter given that the parent is in

that quarter. This is probably in large part due to the fact that we only

have two communities and use a log normal distribution to approximate the

income distribution generated by the quality of education in each community.

A   larger   number    of   communities would give wealthier parents access to a higher

q (and thus their children a greater probability of being likewise wealthy)

and the opposite would hold for poorer parents.26'27

      An additional piec. of information that can be computed using the steady—

state allocations is the implicit rate of return to expenditures on education.

In the steady state, C1 spends an additional q1—q2 per student on education.


     26Note that the equivalent to Table 10 under national financing would
have .25 for all its entries since parental income doe. not affect the child's
income under a national system. Henc. there is greater intergenerational
mobility between the bottom and the top quartiles under a national financing
system.
     27Higher values of either tm   or e     in the calibration also make         the
                                  q
model's predictions closer to Ziaiierman''numbers.

This leads to a gain in mean income of m1—a2. Assuming that a period lasts r

years, the implied annual rate of return r satisfi.s:


                                           m —m
                                     r
                                (l+r) —     12
                                           q1—q2


For a time period of thirty years, using the appropriate steady—state values

yields r—.0422 whereas for r—15, r—.086.

     There is a fairly large literature that attempts to determine the rate of

return to investment in human capital, in particular, the return to an

additional year of schooling (see, for example. Becker (1975)). Returns of

between 4 and 9 percent are at the lower half of the range found in this

literature, where the typical range is 5—15%. Although our calibration

procedure does not attempt Co match this rate of return, it is obviously

closely related to         which is defined as (log(m1)—log(m2)]/(log(q1)—
                     aq'
log(q2)]. Thus one possibility is to calibrate to a larger i'q yielding

higher implied annual rates of return (See Table 9).



6. Concluding Remarks

     This paper develops a dynamic multi—community model and calibrates it to

US data. W. use th. calibrated model to evaluate the consequences of

reforming the public education finance system from a system of pure local

finance to one in which education is financed at the national level and

expenditures per student are equal across communities.

    We analyze the effects of such a reform on allocations and welfare, both

across steady states and along the transition path. Our findings indicate a

substantial welfare gain associated with this change in policy. In our
                                          —39—




benchmark model the steady—state welfare gain associated with the national

finance system is over 3% of total income.

          Some simplifying features of the model should be kept in mind when

interpreting the above welfare gain, First, our analysis assumes that all

parents sand their children to public schools. While under the current system

of local finance in the US less than 10% of children attend private schools,

it   is   possible that a move to a national finance system would increase this

proportion and thereby diminish public support for public expenditure on

education. Second, we assume that the quality of education is only affected

by   spending    per student; in particular, we abstract from any peer effects and

assume that parental characteristics do not influence educational outcomes

other than through spending on education. Third, this welfare gain presumably

overstates the potential gain.s from reform facing a state whose educational

finance system is somewhere between the extremes of local and national

financing.28 Future work should focus on evaluating how the incorporation of

these factors in the model influences the evaluation of public education

finance systems.



     281n the US, local spending accounts for roughly 45% of all spending on
public education. Potential benefits from r.forms d.p.nd on both th. fraction
of total expenditures accounted for by state aid and on the rules which govern
its allocation. A system whereby State aid simply matches local spending
dollar for dollar is obviously quite different from one in which aid is
primarily targeted to lower—income communities. Th. framework developed here
can also be used to analyze systems which involve a mix of local and state
financing.
