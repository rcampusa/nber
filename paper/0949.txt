A SYNTHESIS OF KEYNESIAN, MONETARY, AND PORTFOLIO APPROACHES TO

FLEXIBLE EXCHANGE RATES




                              ABSTRACT


     This paper presents a simple synthesis of Keynesian,

monetary, and portfolio approaches to macroeconomlc theory under

flexible exchange rates. By including the key features of all

the partial approaches in a general model, we show that some of the

important   contrasts that have bcen drawn   between Lii   app roLlciles

are due to a neglect of   repercussions elsewhere in   the economy.
After reconciling these false contrasts, we show how some of the
approaches still give different predictions about the effects of

monetary and fiscal policy using differing assumptions about the

international mobility of goods and financial assets.

TO FLEXIBLE EXCHANGE RATES




Introduction


       The purpose of this paper is to extend our earlier synthesis of

monetary and Keynesian approaches to balance—of—payments theory under
                      1
fixed exchange rates to the    analysis of flexible exchange   rates.   As

they   have been presented in the literature, the Keynesian, monetary,

and   portfolio approaches to the determination of exchange rates give
very   different predictions about, for example, the effects of changes

in income   and interest rates on   exchange rates. As a result, strong

contrasts   have been drawn between them, especially   between the Keynesian

and monetary   approaches.2 Like our earlier paper, this one is intended
to   show that most of these contrasLs are potentially misleading, since

each approach can be best seen as part of a larger system. Within the

larger system which we develop, we show that the different predictions

of the partial approaches are based in part on ignoring other important
parts of the system, and in part on particular assumptions about

expectations   and about the strength of the international

linkages among national markets for goods and financial assets.
                             2




     In Section I we introduce the general model on which our

synthesis of the Keynesian, monetary, and portfolio approaches

is based. Section II presents a brief review of the partial

approaches in order to highlight the role of each of these in

the general model; we also discuss attempts that have been

made to discriminate empirically among the partial approaches.

In Section III we reduce the general model to a simple diagram

which illustrates the simultaneous determination of the exchange

rate and output in the shnrt and medium term, and use the diagram

to analyse the effects of monetary and fiscal policy. We also discuss

the role of exchange rate expectations and show how purchasing power parity

and interest parity can be handled as special cases of the general

model. Section IV summarizes our findings.



I.   A General Model of Exchange Rate Determination


     We begin by presenting a general model of exchange rate

determination which, unlike the partial approaches, permits the

short—run endogeneity of output, prices, and interest rates to

be taken into account simultaneously. As the model is essentially

short—run in nature, it suppresses many elements of economic

behavior that are potentially relevant for exchange rates,

especially in the longer run. In particular, we ignore the

effects of capital formation and other changes in wealth

on spending and aggregate supply. This we do deliberately in order

to be able to present the synthesis in the simplest possible way.
                                              3




      Our model has a linkage between the current account and the

capital account similar to that emphasized by Kouri (1976) and by

Dornbusch and Fischer (1980): the exchange rate adjusts to give

portfolio equilibrium in the short run, and the resulting current

account surplus or deficit is the means by which the stock of

foreign assets adjusts towards its new equilibrium value. While

their models have much richer expectations structures than ours,

our model (like those of Kenen and Allen (1980) and Tobin and

Macedo (1980)) permits output to alter under a demand shock, thus

providing an important additional linkage between the current account

and the exchange rate.




      The equations of the general model are as follows:
                +    —


(1)   M = m(Y,       r, r*, ( — e)/e)W                          (money market)
                p    +—              —


(2) B        b(Y, r, r*, ( — e)/e)W                             (bond market)
                      +  —+
(3)   eB*     b*(Y, r, r*,( —            e)/e)W                 (foreign bonds)

(4) W =      M + B + eB*                                        (wealth)
                +    —                   —+      ÷
(5) Y = E(Y,         r) +      C +    T(Y, Y, eP*/P)            (goods market)

(6) P       = Q(Y)                                              (aggregate   supply)
                         ÷       +
(7) LR        PT(Y, Y, eP*/P) -,          eB*     0             (balance of payments)

     The first four equations describe equilibrium conditions in the

markets for three types of assets:3 (i) domestic money M [equation (1)

with m > 0,     m <    0 and m, m— < 01; (ii) domestically issued nontraded
                                                                      internationally

b < 0,   b<     0, b**, b± >      0].   The three assets are assumed to be gross

substitutes. While M and B are exogenously determined, B* is initially pre-

determined, but changes as a result of international capital movements. Equa-

tion (5) shows income as the sum of private expenditure E, government expen-

diture G, and net exports T. Private axpenditure is assumed to vary directly

with income (0 <
                   E   <   1) and inversely with the interest rate (Er <

as usual,4 while net exports vary inversely with the level of domestic

income (T < 0) and directly with the level of foreign income (T > 0)

and with relative prices at home and abroad (Tp*p >        O).   Equation (6) is

a standard aggregate supply equation which can be derived from the

equilibrium condition for the labor market. Gradual adjustment of either

nominal wages or of price expectations to changes in the price level

ensures a positively sloped supply schedule; while either condition is

sufficient, neither is necessary. The focus of the analysis to follow

on the short to medium term justifies the exclusion of physical capital

from the supply function, even though the allocation of financial

capital among alternative assets plays a key role in the model.6

Equation (7) defines the balance of paynents as the sum of (nominal)

net exports and capital inflow from abroad; eB* is the net accumulation

of foreign bonds, measured in domestic currency, in the hands of

domestic residents.

II. A Brief Review of Partial Approaches

      Before proceeding to analyze the general model and to present the

partial approaches as special cases thereof, it is useful to provide a

brief overview of these approaches as they have been formulated and

tested in the literature.


a3    Keynesian_approach. In the tradition established by Meade (1951),

Mundell (1962), and Fleming (1962), this approach may be represented by

rewriting the balance—of—payments equation (7) as

                   —   +     +          +—
(7') R = PT(Y,         Y*, eP*/P) +   F(r,   r*) = 0


expressing the capital account in flow form rather than in stock adjust-

ment form.7 With the exchange rate assumed to clear the foreign exchange

market, equation (7') may be solved for e to yield:

              +    —   +      —+
(8)   e =   f(Y,   Y*, P, P*, r, r*)


This "Keynesian" exchange rate equation implies the ceteris paribus

propositions shown in the first line of Table i.8


b.    Monetary approach. In one of its two main versions, the monetary

approach emphasizes immediate and continual purchasing power parity

(PPP) through the close international linkage of goods markets

(Frenkel 1976, Bilson l978a, 1978b), and may be summarized by

combining domestic and foreign money market equations: M = Pm(Y,      r)


and M = P*m*(Y*, r*), with the PPP condition e =       P/P.   This yields

the following exchange rate equation:

                   +   +— +—
(9)   e =   f(Y,   Y*, M, M*, r, r*)
                                       7




         The other main version of the monetary approach gives priority

 to the maintenance of interest parity through perfect arbitrage in

 international financial markets (Dornbusch 1976a). In this version

 the PPP equation is replaced by the interest parity condition

 r =    r*   + (e —   e)/e   where e is assumed to be equal to the forward

 exchange rate. If, as in Dornbusch (1976a), P and e are taken as

 largely predetermined in the short run, then this equation and the

money market equations can be solved to give:9
                —     +   +—     —+        +
 (9')   e     f(Y, Y*, M, M*, P, P*, -e)


        Equations (9) and (9') imply the ceteris paribus propositions

shown in lines 2 and 3 of Table 1. As the table shows, the partial

Keynesian approach and the two partial monetary approaches generally

yield different predictions about the effects on the exchange rate

of changes in domestic and foreign incomes, prices, and interest

rates, reflecting different assumptions about what is being held

constant: In particular, the monetary approach with PPP holds

constant at all times a variable, eP*/P, that plays a crucial role

in the adjustment process according to the Keynesian approach.


c.      Portfolio approach. Within this framework, exchange rates (and

interest rates) are determined in the short run by equilibrium conditions

in asset markets, summarized by equations (1) — (4) above. Abstracting
                                      3




from expectations and assuming output fixed, substitution

of equation (4) into (1) and (3) gives the following quasi—reduced—

form solution for the exchange rate (note that equation (2) is
                                 10
redundant by Walras Law):

            + ?— +
(10) e = f(M, B, B*, r*)


This equation implies the ceteris paribus propositions shown

in line 4 of Table 1. The effect of r* on e is consistent with the

Keynesian approach and with the interest parity version of the monetary

approach, but not with the PPP version.



    The portfolio approach also includes the balance—of—payments equation (7)

which governs the evolution of the exchange rate over time. If, for given Y,

Y*, P, and P, the instantaneous equilibrium solution for e from equation

(10) does not result in current account equilibrium, the corresponding

disequilibrium in the capital account changes B* and thus feeds back on
                                                               ii
the exchange rate through equation (10). Assuming stability,        this

dynamic process continues until equilibrium is reached in both the

current account and the capital account, implying the following

medium—term equilibrium solution for the exchange rate:

              + —      -I-
                             —
(10') e =   f(Y,   Y*, p, p*)


This equation implies the standard "Keynesian" propositions about the

effects of changes in output and prices. These predictions are

contrary to some of the ceteris paribus predictions of each of the

monetary approaches (see Table 1).

Empirical tests

       What could one hope to learn from the results of empirical tests of

the various partial approaches to the exchange rate? Although each

approach offers an equation that may be estimated directly, each of

these equations contains variables that have important links to the

exchange rate through channels other than the one emphasized (as

illustrated by Lindbeck 1976, p. 140). This poses a potentially serious

problem of omitted variables, especially if the estimated equation is

a quasi—reduced form rather than a structural equation. For example,

estimates of equation (9) have been taken to '1offer strong support

for the monetary approach in general" (Bilson 1978b, p. 396), and

when the equation is run against direct estimates of the PPP condition,

e =   P/P*,   it generally provides much better forecasts of the exchange

rate. But how can the PPP condition, when estimated together with money

demand equations, do better than the PPP equation by itself? When Bilson

(1978a, p. 64) constrains the coefficients of equation (9) to be con-

sistent with his a priori beliefs about the parameters of money demand

equations, he finds "the harsh truth ...     that   the monetary model does

not improve upon a sophisticated PPP model as an exchange rate fore-

casting tool". Yet if the true money demand parameters were included

in the estimating equation, would not the resulting equation have to be

identical to the directly estimated PPP equation? In the absence of

fortuitous cross correlations between the errors in the money demand

equations and the PPP equation, the monetary equation for the exchange

rate can only be better than the PPP equation itself by the coefficients

of r, Y,and N moving away from their true structural values (based on the

money demand equations) to capture indirectly channels of influence not
                                               10




 contained in the partial monetary approach. This may permit the

 monetary approach with PPP to predict better than PPP by itself, but

 is hardly grounds for satisfaction. A much more direct test of the

 partial monetary approach would be to estimate the structural

 equations directly, and to solve the three equations for the exchange

 rate. The same applies to Frenkel's (1976) and Clements and Frenkel's

 (1980) tests of the monetary approach with PPP and also to Frankel's

 (1979) test of the monetary approach with real interest parity.


        Since each partial approach involves different endogenous variables

on the right—hand side of the estimating equation, and hence provides

different scope for unmodelled channels of influence to be captured

unintentionally, there are difficulties with using these tests to

discriminate among the different approaches. In our general model,

to which we now return, we have therefore set up our equations in a way

that allows the partial approaches, to the extent that they are inconsistent,

to be interpreted        as special cases.

III.   A Synthesis of the Partial Approaches

       The essence of the general model presented in Section I can be illu-

strated in a simple diagram. For this purpose we express the seven

equations of the model as two linear quasi—reduced—form relationships

between output and the exchange rate. The first is based on equations

(1), (4), (5), and (6), reflecting equilibrium in the markets for domestic

goods, money, and labor:'2


(11)    e =
              k1Y
                    +
                        k2G
                              +
                                  k3M
                                        +
                                            k4B*÷ k5B + k6e
                                                            +
                                                                k7r*   +   kP*   ÷ ky* (K schedule)
                                                ii




The second is based on equations (1), (3), and (4) and shows the pairs

of output and the exchange rate that give instantaneous equilibrium in

asset markets, including the market for foreign bonds:13

                        +                   —            +         +
(12)    e =
              a1Y
                    +
                        a2M
                              +
                                  a3B
                                        +
                                            a4B*
                                                     +
                                                         a5e
                                                               +
                                                                   a6r*   (A schedule)


The locus of both schedules depends on the three domestic exogenous

policy variables of the model: M, B, and C, as well as on domestic

holdings of foreign bonds B*, the expected exchange rate e, and

the three foreign exogenous variables: r*, P*, and Y*. M, B,

and C are linked by the government budget constraint, which we shall

take into account in our later discussion of the effects of monetary

and fiscal policy. The balance—of—payments equation (7). ensures that

the current account surplus (or deficit) implied by the above solu-

tions for Y and e is matched by an equal deficit (or surplus) on

capital account, etB*.

       The instantaneous equilibrium values for the level of output and

the exchange rate are determined by the intersection of the K and A

schedules as shown in Figure 1 (the C schedule is explained

lelow). The slopes of the two schedules (i.e., the signs of

k1 and a1) reflect not only the effects of income acting on the

exchange rate through the current account and asset demands, but also

price and interest rate effects. Thus, the positive slope of the K

schedule results from the positive relationship between the exchange

rate and aggregate demand via the current account that is only

partially offset by the negative demand effects of depreciation
                             12




through rising interest rates and prices. The negative slope of the

A schedule reflects the positive relationship between the exchange

rate and the excess demand for money via the domestic—currency value

of wealth; by creating an excess demand for money, depreciation

presses output down and interest rates up to preserve equilibrium in

asset markets, and this effect is reinforced by our provisional

assumption of exogenous exchange rate expectations. The arrows in

Figure 1 show how the K and A schedules shift in response to increases

in the predetermined variables.

     The diagram shows clearly how potentially misleading it is to

regress e against Y and other variables in an attempt to see whether

e and Y are negatively related, as predicted by the partial monetary

approaches, or positively related, as predicted by the partial Keynesian

approach. In the general model e and Y can move in the same direction

or in opposite directions in the short run depending on what kind of

exogenous shock moves them both. For example, an increase in G, P,

or Y shifts the K schedule to the right, lowering e and raising Y.

But an increase in M, e, or r*, or a decrease in B*, shifts both

schedules to the right, so that Y rises while e can either rise or

fall. An increase in B shifts the K schedule to the left, but the

A schedule may shift in either direction, so that the effects on e and

Y are uncertain.

     If we were concerned only with the initial instantaneous equilibrium,

this would be the end of the story: equations (1) — (6) determine Y and

e as shown in Figure 1 and equation (7) gives the resulting current account

position and hence eLB*. Over time, however, as B* changes, the exchange

rate and output must adjust until the final equilibrium values of Y

and e simultaneously satisfy equations (1) —   (7).
                                      13



By rewriting the balance of payments equation (7) as



(7")            B* =      T(Y,    Y*, eP*/P)



we can determine the dynamic stability of the adjustment of B* by

evaluating the sign of the partial derivative B*/B* which depends on

the direction and magnitude of the reduced—form effects of B* on e, P,

and Y. Under reasonable parameter assumptions and with B* positive,

an increase in B* lowers e, and thus contributes to a reduction in T

and hence also in B*, thus ensuring stability.

        Given stability, we can set LB* = 0 in equation (7") and solve

for e as follows:


                      +
(13)            e =         +                            (C schedule)
                      c1Y       c2Y* + c3P*


This equation describes the current account equilibrium relationship

between e and Y. The C schedule is flatter than the K schedule

(c1 <   k)   as shown in Figure 1. To the right of the C schedule the

current account is in deficit, while to the left, it is in surplus.

Whenever the A and K schedules intersect off the C schedule, the

resulting current account imbalance will gradually shift the A

schedul&towards the point of intersection of the K and C schedules.

Thus, while the A and K schedules determine the exchange rate with B*

treated as predetermined, the C and K schedules determine the exchange

rate in the "medium term" when current account imbalances accumulate

to change B*.

Effects of Monetary and Fiscal Policy

     We are now in a position to make some policy experiments with the

model. Assuming that the economy is initially in full equilibrium at

point E in Figure 2, a tax—financed increase in government spending

causes the K schedule to shift to the right so that output rises and the

exchange rate falls as the economy moves to a new instantaneous equi-

librium at point E'. Since E' is below the C schedule, the current

account is in deficit. As the stock of foreign assets runs down, the

A schedule also moves to the right. Meanwhile, the K schedule drifts

further rightwards as a result of the effect of B* on the demand for money.

This process continues until stock equilibrium is restored at E" where

both output and the exchange rate are higher than initially, notwith-

standing the initial appreciation. This conclusion would have to be

qualified to the extent that the higher taxes influenced capital

accumulation or introduced wage or price pressures. More importantly,

the market's anticipation of the medium—term depreciation will raise e

and thus reduce or reverse the initial instantaneous appreciation.

These results are summarized in the first column of Table 2.

     Figure 3 shows the effects of an increase in the money supply

through an open market operation. The A and K schedules bot.h shift to

the right, producing a momentary equilibrium at E', with output

and the exchange rate higher than initially.14 Provided that E'

lies below the C schedule as shown in Figure 3, the resulting current

account deficit causes the A and K schedules to shift further to the

right until the full equilibrium is reached at E". The medium—term

depreciation of the currency is larger than initially, and may be

accelerated by speculative arbitrage.

     Money—financed and bond—financed government spending are slightly

 tricky to analyze with diagrams, because a sustained increase in C

must require (in the absence of increased taxation) continual growth

 of M or B. The once—and—for—all increase in the money supply required

by a one—period increase in G is like the open market operation, except

 the K schedule moves further to the right in the first period, and then back

 again in the second as C is restored to its initial level. A permanent

 increase in C involves a sequence of such steps. The analysis of bond—

 financed spending is more complicated, as even the direction of the

 first—period shift in the A schedule is uncertain. The first—period

 effects of fiscal expansion are as shown in the upper panel of Table 2,

while the lower panel shows the effects of a sustained increase in C,

 recognizing that the portfolio is not in equilibrium because M or B is

 still increasing.

 Some Special Cases

     In our analysis of the general model the expected exchange rate e

was not assigned a major role, because we emphasized the medium—term

solution to the model in which the exchange rate adjusted so as to

make the stock of foreign assets constant, and      could be set equal to

e. But for the analysis of the dynamic path of the exchange rate toward

its medium—term equilibrium value (and hence of income, prices, and the

current account), the behavior of e is crucial. In this section we shall

see how the expectional and other assumptions associated with the partial

approaches can be treated as special cases of the general model.

a.   Expectations. The following scheme shows five different ways of

modelling exchange rate expectations:

      (1)    static expectations              e =
                                                    e
      (ii)   regressive expectations          e =
                                                    ee
                                                         +   (1 — O)e   (0 <   e < 1)
                                    16



        (iii) adaptive expectations                e =
                                                         Oe
                                                              +   (1 —   O)ei      (0 <   U   <   1)

        (iv)     extrapolative expectations          =
                                                         Oe   +   (1 —   &)e_1     (0 > 1)

        (v)      rational expectations with
                                                   e = e
                 perfect foresight                         t+l


 Here e is the expectation, formed at time t, of the value of e at

 time t+l, and e is some exogenously given value. The qualitative results

 we report in this paper all apply without exception if expectations are

 static, regressive, or adaptive, but instability is naturally a possibility

with extrapolative expectations. As Kouri (1976) and others have shown,

there are often a number of
                                perfect—foresight paths that are consistent
with rational expectations. He assumes that long—run perfect foresight

would rule out the unstable paths.
                                         Using perfect foresight in our general

model would undoubtedly change the dynamic path of the exchange rate, and

could change the impact effects on the exchange rate in cases where the

impact and medium—term effects are in opposite directions.

b.
       Purchasing power parity. In this case, goods markets are assumed

to be completely integrated between countries so that                        and
e =   P/P*.    Accordingly, for given * the K and C schedules are

replaced by the aggregate supply curve, which is completely unresponsive

to changes in G, M, B, B*, e, r*, *, and      *•         follows that

(i) an increase in C has no effect on either Y or e unless it is

financed by either M or B; and (ii) an increase in M by open market

operations will raise both Y and e, by shifting the A schedule to

the right. These, of course, are standard monetarist propositions

for the short run with variable aggregate supply.
                                   17




 c. Interest parity.       If capital markets are fully integrated

 through perfect substitutability between domestic and

foreign bonds (i.e., b*, b, b— *_cobr, b**, b— —co), then r =        r*   +

 (e—e)/e.   In this case, the general model retains its qualitative

comparative—statics properties (with the only exception that a3 in

equation (12) becomes unambiguously negative). Thus, in contrast to

the Mundell—Fleming model where pure fiscal expansion lowers e but

leaves Y unchanged under perfect capital mobility, a tax—financed increase

in G raises both e and Y in our model in the medium term; for even though

r is tied to r* and M is fixed, the demand for money can be satisfied at

a higher level of output through an offsetting reduction of wealth.

Hence, the link between the exchange rate and asset markets preserves

the efficacy of pure fiscal policy under perfect capital mobility.

An expansionary open market operation also increases both e and Y in

the medium term, but less than in the Mundell—Fleming model, for analogous

reasons.


d.   Full employment. Finally, if aggregate supply is fixed at full

employment (Q -, oo), the K and C schedules become vertical at the

full—employment level of output and completely unresponsive to exogenous

shocks, but the A schedule retains a negative slope. An increase in M

by open market operations as well as money— and also bond-financed

increases in G cause both e and P to rise, instantaneously as

well as in the medium term. If exchange rate expectations are

endogenous, the initial depreciation will be larger than other-

wise. Disregarding expectations effects, however, a tax—financed increase

in G leaves e unchanged in instantaneous equilibrium because it does not,

with Y fixed, affect portfolio balance immediately, but the increase in P
                               18




resulting from the rise in G leads to decumulation of foreign assets

and to currency depreciation. Thus, the medium—term effects of monetary

and fiscal policy on the exchange rate and the price level at full

employment are exactly as in the general case shown in Table 2.



IV. Conclusion

     The main purpose of this paper has been to present a simple

synthesis of Keynesian, monetary, and portfolio approaches to flexible

exchange rates. By including the key features of all of the approaches

in a simple general model, we were able to show that some of the

contrasts that have been drawn between the approaches are due to a

neglect of important feedbacks elsewhere in the economy. Even after

these false contrasts were reconciled, we showed that some of the

approaches still give different predictions about the effects of mone-

tary and fiscal policy because of differing assumptions about the inter-

national mobility of goods and financial assets. Using our general model,

we were able to show how each of these assumptions altered the effects

of monetary and fiscal policies on the main macroeconomic variables,

at least in the short and medium term.

     Although we have attempted to reflect the most influential currents

of theoretical and empirical work, we have restricted ourselves to the

simplest specifications that are consistent with the various approaches.

This simplicity was deliberate, as we wished to demonstrate as

clearly as possible the reasons for the contrasting results

from the various partial approaches, and to produce a general model

that is amenable to fairly easy exposition. The cost, of course,

is that we have not been able to deal fully with many important
                           19




issues relating to information, expectations, and dynamics.

Our current model is nonetheless larger and more complex than

that used in our fixed-exchange—rate paper, for we have added

a dynamic portfolio structure and some discussion of exchange rate

expectations. We hope that the more general model provides

sufficient insights to make the additional complexity worthwhile.

2/ For example, Frenkel and Rodriguez (1975, P. 686) write "   ... the
equilibrium exchange rate is that relative price of monies at which the

existing stocks are willingly held. This view on the role and determina-

tion of the rate of exchange is in sharp contrast with the popular notion

that the exchange rate is determined in the flow market so as to assure

a balanced balance of payments." In the same vein, Mussa (1976, p. 51) ar-

gues that "From the perspective of the monetary approach, however, all of

this discussion of elasticities is fundamentally irrelevant since the tra-

ditional theory on which it is based contains two serious conceptual errors.

First, it views the exchange rate as the relative price of national outputs,

rather then as the relative price of national monies. Second, it assumes

that the exchange rate is determined by the conditions for equilibrium in

the markets for flows of funds, rather than by the conditions for equili-

brium in the markets for stocks of assets." See also Kouri (1976, p. 281),

Frenkel (1976, p. 201), and the surveys by Magee (1976), Kreinin and Offi—

cer (1978), and Isard (1978).

3/ Note that the balance—sheet constraint (4) implies that only

two of the first three equations are independent. By restricting

ourselves to these three assets, we are neglecting international

holdings of currency and real assets, although B* could be any

aggregate of net claims on non—residents, with r* as the represent-

ative rate of return•. These assets and equations are the same as

those used by Branson (1979), except we include income as an argument

in the asset demand functions.

 exchange rate determination almost always include more endogenous

 variables than we indicate, the simpler formulation represented by

 equation (8) has often been contrasted to the monetary approach by

 proponents of the latter (see references in footnote 2).

 9/ In a second version of the interest parity approach (Frankel 1979),

 opposite signs to (9) on interest rates, and includes the differnce

 between the expected domestic and foreign

 sign.

 10/ Concerning the ambiguous effect of B on e, the currency depreciates
                                               portfolios than B and B*,
  if B and N are closer substitutes in asset

  but appreciates in the opposite case.

11/ One potential source of instability is net foreign interest receipts

(see Branson 1979). Instability may also arise if the country is a net

debtor so that B* < 0 (see Masson 1981).

12/ The signs of the k coefficients rest on the fairly plausible

assumption that the effects of exchange rate changes on private

expenditure through expectations and asset revaluation effects on the

demand for money are minor relative to the exchange rate effects on the

current account.

13/ The sign of a2 — a3 is unambiguously positive, even though the sign

of a3 is indeterminate (cf. footnote 10) .   The positive sign of

a5 presupposes that B and B* are closer substitutes in asset portfolios

than M and B*.

14/ There is in the algebra the possibility that the increased trans-

actions demand for money may lead temporarily to negative valuation

effects on the exchange rate, but this possibility can easily be ruled

out by speculative foresight.
