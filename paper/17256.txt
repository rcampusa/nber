Wage Effects of Trade Reform with Endogenous Worker Mobility
Pravin Krishna, Jennifer P. Poole, and Mine Zeynep Senses
NBER Working Paper No. 17256
July 2011, Revised March 2014
JEL No. F16

                                               ABSTRACT

In this paper, we use a linked employer–employee database from Brazil to evaluate the wage effects
of trade reform. With an aggregate (firm-level) analysis of this question, we find that a decline in trade
protection is associated with an increase in average wages in exporting firms relative to domestic firms,
consistent with earlier studies. However, using disaggregated, employer-employee level data, and
allowing for the endogenous assignment of workers to firms due to match-specific productivity, we
find that the premium paid to workers at exporting firms is economically and statistically insignificant,
as is the differential impact of trade openness on the wages of workers at exporting firms relative to
otherwise identical workers at domestic firms. We also find that workforce composition improves
systematically in exporting firms, in terms of the combination of worker ability and the quality of worker-firm
matches, post-liberalization. These results stand in stark contrast to the findings reported in many earlier
studies and underscore the importance of endogenous matching and, more generally, non-random
labor market allocation mechanisms, in determining the effects of trade policy changes on wages.

1.                                                    Introduction
Central to academic and policy discussions about the process of globalization is the question
of how greater trade openness impacts the labor market and the distribution of incomes in
society. More narrowly, the theoretical literature in trade has recently focused on the
question of whether the wage effects of trade depend upon the mode of globalization of the
firm at which the worker is employed; that is, whether workers employed at exporting firms
earn higher wages and experience different wage changes following trade liberalization than
workers employed at non-exporting firms.
                                          This theoretical literature offers a wide range of predictions concerning the
distributional impact of trade liberalization. In neoclassical settings with competitive goods
and factor markets, identical workers must earn identical wages; trade does not differentially
impact the wages of workers based on the nature of the firm at which the worker is
employed. However, product markets and the labor market may both be imperfectly
competitive. For instance, monopolistically competitive firms of heterogeneous productivity,
as in Melitz (2003), may engage in rent-sharing with homogeneous and randomly-allocated
workers, as in Egger and Kreickemeier (2009) and Amiti and Davis (2012). In this case, the
wages of workers employed in the more productive, exporting firms, which experience a
relative improvement in profits or market share after a decline in protection, may increase
compared to workers employed in firms serving only the domestic market. 1 Alternatively,
exporters wishing to improve their product quality for foreign markets could respond to a
decline in protection by paying (higher) efficiency wages in order to induce increased effort
from otherwise identical workers (as in Verhoogen (2008), Frías, Kaplan, and Verhoogen
(2009), and Davis and Harrigan (2011)). Moreover, if the labor allocation process is non-
random and characterized by complementarities between (unobservable) worker quality and
firm technology, as in Yeaple (2005), or subject to search and (ex-ante unobservable) worker-
firm-specific matching frictions, as in Helpman, Itskhoki, and Redding (2010) and Davidson,

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
1 This follows the logic of the well-known framework of Melitz (2003) with heterogeneous, monopolistically
competitive firms, where the relative profits of exporting firms compared to non-exporting firms will rise with
trade liberalization, undertaken unilaterally by the liberalizing country or on a reciprocal basis with liberalizing
partners. Likewise, the disciplining effect of product-market competition and foreign entry in product markets
after trade reform may erode mark-ups and hence rents especially in firms serving solely the domestic market
(Levinsohn (1993) and Hay (2001)). In addition, improved access to cheaper and a wider variety of imported
inputs may result in export market entry through an improvement in firm-level productivity (Amiti and
Konings (2007)) or the introduction of new final goods (Goldberg, Khandelwal, Pavcnik, and Topalova
(2010)).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   2
Matusz, and Shevchenko (2008), the opening of the economy to trade may increase
inequality by increasing the wage gap between workers employed in exporting and non-
exporting firms. Thus, the theoretical predictions concerning the impact of trade
liberalization on the wages of identical workers employed at exporting and non-exporting
firms depend variously upon assumptions about the competitiveness of the labor market, the
nature of the labor allocation process matching workers with firms, and the interplay of
these factors with the product market structure, among other things. For this reason,
empirical analysis, which allows for these various possibilities, is necessary to evaluate the
actual outcomes.
      A number of previous studies have indeed examined the links between trade and
average firm-level wages, finding a relative increase in wages for workers at exporting firms
post-trade reform (see, for example, Amiti and Davis (2012)). We argue, however, that the
analysis of average firm-level wages, although informative, is incomplete along several
dimensions. First, it cannot fully account for the impact of a change in trade barriers on
workforce composition in terms of observable worker characteristics that are not available in
most firm-level datasets. Firm-level analyses also cannot account for factors that are
observable to the managers of the firm, and hence impact wages, but are unobservable in the
data, such as the innate (time-invariant) ability of the worker and any additional productivity
that arises in the context of employment in the specific firm due, for example, to production
complementarities between the worker and the firm (match-specific ability). Finally, the
firm-level analysis is undertaken under the assumption that the assignment of workers to
firms is conditionally random (conditional on the observable characteristics of workers and
firms), thus ignoring the sorting of workers into firms based on unobservable characteristics,
and any changes in the distribution of match-specific ability across firms following trade
liberalization.
      Our paper empirically studies the question of whether trade openness affects
differently workers employed in firms with different modes of globalization, placing
particular emphasis on the possibility of the non-random matching of workers to firms. We
use a matched employer-employee dataset from Brazil for the years 1990-1998 (covering the
country’s main trade liberalization episode), which traces individually-identifiable workers
across employers over time and contains detailed information on wages and worker


                                                                                             3
characteristics. 2
                                          While our analysis is primarily conducted at the disaggregated level of individual
workers, in order to ensure the comparability of our results with earlier work, we begin by
studying the links between trade and aggregate (average) firm-level wages instead. Consistent
with earlier findings in the literature, we observe that a decline in trade protection is
associated with an increase in average wages in exporting firms relative to domestic firms.
However, as we have already discussed, this analysis is potentially problematic as it ignores
the endogenous sorting of workers based on unobservables. We test for this possibility and
find that the data indeed decisively reject the assumption of exogenous worker mobility.3 We
then evaluate the wage effects of trade reform by allowing for the non-random matching of
workers with firms based on time-invariant, worker-firm-specific productivity effects.
                                          Our main finding is that, once we use detailed information on worker and firm
characteristics to control for compositional effects and allow for the endogenous assignment
of workers to firms which may arise due to unobserved (time-invariant) firm-worker match-
specific productivity, the data indicate an economically and statistically insignificant
differential effect of trade openness on wages at exporting firms relative to domestic firms.
Moreover, we find that once we allow for match-specific productivity, the premium paid to
workers at exporting firms is also economically and statistically insignificant.4 In addition,
consistent with the models of Yeaple (2005), Davidson, Matusz, and Schevchenko (2008),
and Helpman, Itskhoki, and Redding (2010), we find that workforce composition, in terms
of innate worker ability and the quality of worker-firm matches, improves systematically in
exporting firms relative to domestic firms following liberalization.5 This finding serves to
explain the difference between the results at the firm level and those at the worker level.

2 There is a small but growing literature exploring the links between trade openness and wages using matched

employer-employee data. See for instance, Frías, Kaplan, and Verhoogen (2009) on wage differentials between
exporting and non-exporting firms following a depreciation in Mexico; Hummels, Jorgensen, Munch, and
Xiang (forthcoming) on the impact of outsourcing on wages in Denmark; Davidson, Heyman, Matusz,
Sjoholm, and Zhu (2010) on the impact of globalization on efficiency of labor market sorting in Sweden and,
Helpman, Itskhoki, Muendler, and Redding (2013) on the effect of trade on inequality in Brazil.
3 Specifically, as we discuss in Section 4, we test whether wage behavior at the worker level confirms the

maintained assumption of conditionally random worker-firm assignment (conditional on observable
characteristics of workers and firms) using a test statistic introduced in Abowd, McKinney, and Schmutte
(2010).
4 This finding is consistent with Schank, Schnabel, and Wagner (2007) who report an insignificant exporter

premium for Germany using matched worker-firm data.
5 Though our findings are consistent with the predictions of Yeaple (2005), Davidson, Matusz, and Shevchenko

(2008), and Helpman, Itskhoki, and Redding (2010), we do not attempt to distinguish between the specific
channels highlighted in these various models.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   4
average (innate or match-specific) worker ability improves systematically in exporting firms
following trade liberalization, and this change is not addressed, it will appear that trade
liberalization leads to a differential wage improvement for workers at exporting firms.
                                          Our findings imply that following trade liberalization, a given worker (with fixed innate
ability) who continues to be employed at a given exporting firm (with fixed worker-firm
match-specific ability) will not experience any differential effect on her wage relative to
another worker who continues to be employed at a non-exporting firm. Ceteris paribus, a
worker who transitions to a firm with which she is better matched will, however, earn a
higher wage because of her higher productivity there. Nevertheless, exporting firms will pay
a differentially higher average wage post-liberalization because of the improvement in the
composition of the workforce in terms of innate worker ability and worker-firm match
quality.
                                          In sum, our main result of an insignificant differential effect of trade on the wages of
workers employed at exporting and non-exporting firms suggests a different picture of the
links between trade liberalization and wages than that obtained by analyzing the data at a
more aggregate (firm) level and underscores the importance of allowing for labor market
frictions and endogenous matching in studying the effects of trade policy changes on wages.
To our knowledge, this paper is the first in the trade literature to highlight the problematic
issue of the endogenous mobility of workers across firms and its potential to lead to biased
parameter estimates regarding the link between trade and wages.6 We believe this to be the
core contribution of our paper.
                                          The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a background
discussion on Brazil’s trade policy reforms and describes the data we use. We begin our
analysis of the data by presenting, in Section 3, the empirical methodology and estimation
results for the aggregate (firm-level) analysis. In Section 4, we discuss endogenous worker
mobility and its relevance in our empirical context. Section 5 describes the results we obtain
using matched employer-employee data, and Section 6 concludes.
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
6 As we will discuss in greater detail later in the paper, our estimation methodology, which allows for time-
invariant worker-firm match effects in the specification, does not “solve” the problem of endogenous mobility
(as worker mobility may also depend upon time-varying match effects). However, by taking time-invariant
match effects into account, our specification corrects for endogenous mobility that is based on time-invariant
match productivity and thus proceeds under weaker assumptions than much of the previous literature that has
investigated these questions. Furthermore, in an additional test, we allow for a particular form of time variation
in the worker-firm effects, by allowing for the magnitude of the worker-firm match effect to change when
firms change export status, and find that our results are not affected by this modification.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   5
2.     Data and Policy Background
Our main data are administrative records from Brazil for formal-sector workers linked to
their employers. We combine this worker-level information with complementary data
sources on firm-level exporter status and industry-level trade protection during Brazil’s main
trade policy reform period. This section begins with a review of the country’s main policy
reforms of the 1990s, and then describes the data we use in the analysis that follows.


2.1    Brazil’s policy reforms
The 1990s were a period of dramatic policy reform in Brazil, providing a particularly
appropriate setting in which to study the impact of trade liberalization on wages. As
compared to the gradual process of globalization in many developed countries, Brazil’s trade
reform occurred over a relatively short period of time, and with substantial cross-industry
variation. Furthermore, many of the policy reforms were arguably unanticipated by firms and
workers and can be viewed as exogenous to changes in wages at the firm and worker level.
Appendix A.1 offers a detailed discussion of the exogeneity of Brazil’s tariff reforms.
      The second half of the 20th century in Brazil was characterized by tight import
substitution industrialization policies designed to protect the domestic manufacturing sector
from foreign competition. Special import regimes and discretionary import controls like the
“law of similars”, under which goods were banned if they too closely resembled a Brazilian
product, were commonplace. Coverage of these quantitative restrictions remained close to
100% throughout this period, leaving Brazilian manufacturers heavily protected.
      The 1990s, however, witnessed sweeping changes in Brazilian trade policy. Beginning
in 1988, the government, under the scope of a “New Industrial Policy”, reduced average
manufacturing tariffs (Moreira and Correa (1998)). These reforms had little impact on
import competition, as non-tariff barriers remained highly restrictive. Effective trade policy
changes began with the Collor administration’s “Industrial and Foreign Trade Policy” in
1990. The federal government abolished all remaining non-tariff barriers inherited from the
import substitution era and brought nominal tariffs further down (Moreira and Correa
(1998)). Final goods tariffs across all sectors fell by over 50% in just five years according to
Table 1 in Kume, Piani, and Souza (2003), from 30.5%, on average, in 1990 to 11.2%, on
average, in 1994.
      In 1994, after decades of high inflation and several unsuccessful stabilization attempts,
                                                                                              6
the Brazilian government succeeded with its macroeconomic stabilization plan (Plano Real),
designed to help correct a large fiscal deficit and lastingly end hyperinflation. The new
currency, the real, was pegged to the U.S. dollar, and began at parity on July 1, 1994.
Officially, the real was set to a crawling peg which permitted the currency to depreciate at a
controlled rate against the U.S. dollar. However, as the country’s persistent effort to control
inflation materialized, the real exchange rate actually appreciated in the first months (see
Figure 1). In response, the government partially reversed trade reforms in 1995 after
manufacturing industries lost competitiveness due to the real’s appreciation.7 Final goods
tariffs climbed slightly in subsequent years from an average of 12.8% in 1995 to an average
of 15.5% in 1998 (see Table 1 in Kume, Piani, and Souza (2003)).8


2.2               Data sources
Worker data                                The Brazilian Labor Ministry requires by law that all legally-registered
firms report to the ministry on all workers in every year. These administrative records have
been collected in the Relação Anual de Informações Sociais (RAIS) database since 1986. In this
paper, we use information from RAIS for the years 1990 through 1998, when we also have
complementary data on the export status of firms and industry-level protection rates.
              The main benefit of the RAIS database is the ability to trace individually-identifiable
workers over time and across jobs. A unique job-level observation includes a worker
identification number (which remains with the worker throughout her work history), the tax
number of the worker’s firm, the month-year of the worker’s accession to the firm, and the
month-year of the worker’s separation from the firm. The RAIS data are particularly valuable
as they offer variables beyond the available information in firm-level databases, often used in
studies like ours. In particular, the data contain detailed information on workers’ skill-levels
(as defined by occupation, education, and reported tenure at the firm in months) and average
monthly earnings for each job in which a worker is employed. Our measure for a worker’s
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
7 Prior to 1994 and the implementation of the new currency, controls on Brazil’s former currency, the cruzado,

served as yet another form of implicit import protection. In our empirical analysis, we allow for differential
impacts of exchange rate fluctuations on firms with differing trade exposure.
8 Trade policy reforms coincided with gradual foreign investment liberalizations and the privatization of state-

owned companies, both of which contributed to attracting substantial capital inflows over this time period.
Meanwhile, the government’s regional development plans also included export promotion policies as explicit
elements, helping to boost exports beginning in 1995. In each specification, we include region-specific year
dummies to capture the impact of these and other general macroeconomic trends on wages. As consistency
checks, we also include sector-specific year dummies to account for the possibility that these reforms exhibit
sector-time variation not fully captured by our time-varying controls.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                             7
annual compensation is the annual real wage in reais. We also have information on the
gender and age of the worker, and the industrial classification and municipality in which the
firm operates. Appendix A.2 offers a detailed discussion of the data, including further
information on the variables of interest.
      To create our samples for estimation, we restrict observations as follows. First, RAIS
was made available to us in the form of a random sample from the complete list of workers
across all sectors of the economy ever to appear in the national records. The sampled
workers are matched to the population data to find all firms in which these workers were
ever employed over time, creating a complete employment history of a 1% random sample
of the population of the Brazilian formal-sector labor force. Next, following earlier work
using RAIS (see, for example, Menezes-Filho, Muendler, and Ramey (2008) and Poole
(2013)), we keep only workers with valid worker identification numbers to ensure that we
can track individuals over time. As is standard in the literature, we include only prime-age
workers between the ages of 15 and 64 years, workers with a positive monthly wage, and
workers in private-sector jobs. Finally, for workers with multiple jobs in a given year, we
include only the most recent job in the sample. If a worker has multiple current jobs, only
the highest paying job is included. Our implicit assumption is that workers consider the last
and highest paying job of the year for annual job transitions.


Trade protection        In our analysis of Brazil’s trade policy, we concentrate on two trade
protection measures: the final goods tariff and the effective rate of protection (ERP). The
effective rate of protection allows us to incorporate changes in tariffs placed on inputs into a
firm’s production process as well as changes in the final goods tariffs. Our data on final
goods tariffs and ERP are from Kume, Piani, and Souza (2003), who report monthly
protection rates at the Nível 80 Brazilian industrial classification level. We match the
December levels of final goods tariffs and ERP from 1990 to 1998 with the worker and firm
data by the 2-digit industrial classification found in RAIS, following publicly-available
concordances, to identify workers and firms in industries with differential rates of protection
and liberalization experiences. Appendix A.2 provides further details on the construction of
our tariff measures.
      Figure 2 displays both the mean and median values of the effective rate of protection
across manufacturing industries for our sample period. The early 1990s experienced sharp
                                                                                              8
declines in the effective rate of protection. Mean rates fell from around 46% in 1990 to
approximately 15% in 1994, while median rates fell from 35% to 14% over the same time
period. The slight aforementioned protectionist response to the appreciation of the real
beginning in 1994 is also evident. Most strongly in the early part of the decade, the median
ERP is smaller than the average ERP, suggesting that the distribution of the effective rate of
protection is skewed to the right. Over time, as the sectoral variation narrows, the mean
ERP and median ERP converge.
      The substantial cross-industry variation in both levels and changes in the ERP is
documented in more detail in Figure 3 where we present the distribution of effective rates
across industries in 1990 and 1998, and the average annual change in ERP during this period.
Note that compared to 1990, the distribution of the effective rate of protection across
industries at the end of our sample is much more compressed around a lower mean. The
standard deviation of ERP across sectors was 0.23 in 1990 and 0.08 in 1998. We also note
substantial variation across sectors in the average annual changes in protection rates. While
across all sectors, average ERP declined 27 percentage points between 1990 and 1998, some
sectors liberalized more than others. Specifically, as we document in Appendix Table A.1,
industries with the highest pre-reform ERP experienced the most dramatic liberalization.
The manufacture of transport equipment endured the steepest declines of over 60
percentage points, while footwear manufacturing faced a mere 9 percentage point decline in
ERP over our sample period.


Export status      Brazilian firms’ tax identification numbers are common across many
databases, allowing us to match the RAIS data to complementary firm-level data sources.
Information on all export transactions is available from the Brazilian Customs Office
(Secretaria de Comércio Exterior (SECEX)). SECEX records all legally-registered firms in Brazil
with at least one export transaction in a given year. In our baseline specification, we define
an indicator variable equal to one for firms with a positive dollar value of free-on-board
exports in a given year and zero otherwise. We also test for the consistency of our results to
alternative ways of classifying exporters.
      Our data indicate that during the early 1990s, there was significant firm-level entry into
exporting. The share of exporting firms increased over 50%, from only 8.5% in 1990 to
12.9% in 1994, before leveling off. Over the sample period, approximately 10% of firms
                                                                                              9
switch export status; 9.0% of firms begin exporting, while another 6.3% of firms switch out
of exporting.


2.3                                                    Descriptive statistics


Worker data                                                                                                                     The base sample described in the previous subsection includes 2,173,888
worker-firm-year observations, 494,229 workers employed in 321,427 firms across 26 broad
industries of the economy. For our analysis of the wage impacts of trade reform, we further
restrict the data to the manufacturing sector for which we have information on trade
protection levels.9 The longitudinal nature of the data allows us to control for unobservable
time-invariant worker, firm, and match quality through fixed effects regressions. However, as
is well-documented in the literature, a proper identification of both worker and firm fixed
effects relies on worker mobility across firms. Therefore, for our worker-level analyses in
Sections 4 and 5, we group small firms with few movers together for a more precise
estimation of the firm fixed effects, following Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999). In
addition, to increase the estimated precision of the worker fixed effects, we also restrict the
sample to those workers with at least two years of data. Finally, we conduct our tests on the
largest mobility group, as firm fixed effects across unconnected groups are not directly
comparable.10
                                          Generated in this manner, the sample for our worker-level estimations (the “worker
sample”) consists of 504,424 worker-firm-year observations, characterizing 114,026 workers.
We report detailed descriptive statistics (on wages, educational attainment and occupational
composition) for the worker sample across firm-types in Panel A of Table 1. The average
worker-firm match is represented in the data for 3 years, while the average worker is
employed in approximately 1.5 different firms. Almost 40% of workers switch firms at least
once during the 9-year sample period. Approximately 27% of workers switch between
exporting and non-exporting firms; 15.1% of workers switch into exporting firms and 12.3%
switch out of exporting firms.



	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
9In consistency checks, we test how our restriction to manufacturing influences our main results.
10A connected group includes all the workers who have ever worked for any of the firms in that group, as well
as all of the firms at which any of these workers were ever employed during the sample period.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   10
Firm data Again, the base sample described in Section 2.2 includes 2,173,888 worker-firm-
year observations, 494,229 workers employed in 321,427 firms across 26 broad industries of
the economy. As in the worker-level analysis, we further restrict the data to the
manufacturing sector for which we have information on trade protection levels, and
aggregate the data to the firm-year level.
                                          Generated in this manner, the sample for our firm-level estimations (the “firm
sample”) consists of 505,369 firm-year observations. 11 We report detailed descriptive
statistics for the firm sample across firm-types in Panel B of Table 1. The average firm is
represented in the sample for approximately 5 years. Over the sample period, approximately
10% of firms switch export status; 9.0% of firms begin exporting, while another 6.3% of
firms switch out of exporting.
                                          The average number of employees in manufacturing firms is relatively small at 73. In
1990, though exporters characterize 43% of employment, they represent only 9% of firms,
pointing to a significant difference between exporters and non-exporters in terms of average
employment. Over the complete sample period, the average exporter employs 346
employees, while the average non-exporter employs only 37 workers. Average employment
decreases by more across exporting firms during the sample period than non-exporting
firms—possibly driven by labor productivity changes among existing exporters or
compositional changes due to firm entry into the export market (13% of firms are exporters
by 1998). Similarly, as new export market entrants tend to be smaller on average, average
export sales decrease over the sample.


3.                                                     Firm-Level Analysis
We begin our analysis at the firm level to ensure the comparability of our results with those
of the existing literature based on firm-level data and to highlight the importance of
introducing worker and endogenous match heterogeneity into the analysis. Our firm-level
specification is closely linked to that of Amiti and Davis (2012), who model the relationship
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
11We note that this sampling strategy produces a firm sample that may be biased towards larger employers (i.e.,
those employers with sampled workers). In unreported results, available by request, we evaluate a random
sample of firms ever to appear in RAIS in order to ascertain the importance of worker sampling on the firm
sample. Our firm-level results are robust to this alternative sample of firms. Moreover, recall that we restrict the
worker sample to workers with at least two years of data. By contrast, the firms associated with the single
observation workers remain in the firm sample, so as to minimize any potential bias from larger firms. This is
the major difference between the worker sample and the firm sample. This difference, however, does not affect
the conclusions from our firm-level analysis. These unreported results are available upon request.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   11
between unilateral tariff changes, modes of globalization of the firm, and average firm-level
wages. As we discuss in Section 3.3, we form a firm-level panel of population aggregates
from RAIS and estimate the following specification.
  ln y jt = γ 1 Protect kt + γ 2 Protect kt * Exp jt + γ 3RERt * Exp jt + γ 4 Exp jt + δtr + β Z jt + ψ j + ε jt                                                                                                                   (1)



where the dependent variable, ln y jt , is the logarithm of average wages at the firm level for

firm j at time t, Protect kt denotes the level of protection in sector k in which firm j operates,

and Exp jt is an indicator variable equal to one if firm j reports a positive dollar value of

exports at time t and zero otherwise. The level of protection for each sector is measured by
both final goods tariffs and the effective rate of protection (ERP). We use the latter measure
in our main specifications, since in an environment in which Brazilian firms face declines in
both final goods and intermediate inputs tariffs, the ERP is a more appropriate measure of
protection faced by firms.12 In each specification, we include an interaction term between
  Protect kt                                                        and Exp jt to allow for changes in protection to have different effects on exporters

and firms serving only the domestic market.
                                          As we noted earlier, the post-liberalization period in Brazil coincided with a period of
appreciation of the currency, the real, making Brazilian goods less competitive in
international markets, while making imported goods cheaper in real terms. Failing to
incorporate such fluctuations in exchange rates into our analysis could bias the estimated
effect of liberalization on wages. Henceforth, in each specification, we also include an
interaction of Brazil’s real exchange rate (RER) and the firm’s export status.13 The time-
varying, firm-level controls, Z jt , include variables available in standard firm-level datasets

such as the logarithm of employment and the occupational skill composition14 of the firm, in


	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
12 Ideally, our analysis would allow for final goods tariffs and intermediate inputs tariffs to be included
separately. However, as is highlighted in Amiti and Davis (2012), a proper identification of the individual tariff
effects requires a sufficient level of disaggregation, which our data do not allow giving rise to a high level of
collinearity. In our preferred specifications, we follow standard econometric procedure and focus on the
combined effect of the two tariffs using the effective rate of protection.
13 We also check the consistency of our results using industry-specific real exchange rates.
14 We define the firm’s occupational skill composition as the share of the firm’s workforce in four occupational

categories: unskilled blue collar, skilled blue collar, other white collar, and professional and managerial workers.
Unskilled blue collar workers are the omitted category.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   12
    addition to average worker tenure at the firm, and controls for the age 15, gender, and
    educational skill composition 16 of the firm. Each specification also includes firm fixed
    effects, ψ j , to account for time-invariant firm characteristics, and interactive region-year
    fixed effects, δ tr , to capture the average effect of policy changes that may differentially
    impact wages of firms in different regions of Brazil.17 Here, ε jt is an error term that is
€
    assumed
        €      to exhibit no serial correlation and to be orthogonal to all regressors. In each
    specification, the standard errors are clustered at the industry-year level to account for the
    possibility of within-industry, across-firm correlation in errors following Moulton (1990).18
                                              In interpreting our estimates from specification (1), we focus specifically on the
    magnitude of the differential effect of trade policy changes on average firm-level wages at
    exporters relative to non-exporters ( γ 2 ). If a decline in protection results in a differential
    increase in firm-level average wages in exporting firms, then γ 2 will take a value that is less
    than zero. The coefficient γ1 reflects the responsiveness of average wages in firms serving
                                €
    only the domestic market to changes in protection. A positive γ1 would suggest that a
                                                          €
    decline in protection is associated with a decrease in average wages in firms serving solely the
                      €
    domestic market.19
                                                                €
          Estimation results from equation (1) with tariffs as the measure of protection are
    reported in the first column of Table 2. The results suggest that a decline in tariffs is
    associated with a decline in average wages at non-exporting firms, consistent with a negative
    impact of an increase in foreign competition on these firms. We find that a ten percentage
    point decrease in tariffs leads to a decrease in average firm-level wages by 1.7% for these
    	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
    15 We define the firm’s age composition as the share of the firm’s workforce in six age categories: youth (15-
    17), adolescent (18-24), nascent career (25-29), early career (30-39), peak career (40-49), and late career (50-64).
    Youth workers are the omitted category.
    16 We define the firm’s educational skill composition as the share of the firm in three education categories: less

    than high-school, at least high-school, and more than high-school. Less than high-school is the omitted
    category.
    17 We consider Brazil’s five main geographic regions: the North, Northeast, Center-West, Southeast, and South.
    18 Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan (2004) remark that standard errors may be serially correlated in

    difference-in-differences estimations like ours. In unreported results, we show that our findings are robust to
    clustering the standard errors separately at the industry level and at the firm level.
    19 Note that when ERP is the measure of protection (instead of tariffs), γ reflects the combined effect of a
                                                                                      1
    positive impact of a reduction in input tariffs (through prices and access to enhanced variety and quality of
    inputs), as well as any negative impact of increased import competition due to a decline in output tariffs. All
    else equal, if the industries that experience a decline in final goods tariffs also experience a decline in input
    tariffs, the output tariff is likely to overestimate the actual decrease in protection facing the industry. Hence, we
                                                                       €
    expect the coefficient to be smaller in magnitude when the measure of protection is the ERP compared to the
    estimated coefficient on (output) tariffs.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       13
firms. The negative and significant coefficient on the interaction term between tariffs and
export status suggests that the wages in exporting firms increase in response to a decline in
tariffs relative to firms serving only the domestic market. The RER-exporter interaction term
suggests that a RER depreciation (a decrease in the RER as it is defined in our data)
increases wages in exporting firms relative to non-exporting firms, as expected. Our data also
report a strong, positive exporter dummy, consistent with previous studies at the firm level.
Estimated coefficients for all the (unreported) firm-level controls are statistically significant
and enter with the expected signs and magnitudes. Average firm-level wages are increasing
with the average tenure and age-profile at the firm, while they are decreasing in the share of
female workers employed at the firm. Wages are increasing in both the educational and
occupational skill composition of the firm and the size of the firm.
In the second column of Table 2, we report estimation results for equation (1) with the
effective rate of protection (ERP) instead of (output) tariffs as the measure of protection.
The estimation results suggest that a decline in ERP has no significant impact on average
wages at non-exporting firms; improved access to imported intermediates from abroad could
explain the difference between these results and those reported in the first column of Table
2 for output tariffs. The negative and significant coefficient on the interaction term suggests
that average wages in exporting firms increase relative to non-exporting firms in response to
a decline in ERP. A ten percentage point decrease in ERP increases average wages by 1.1%
at exporting firms. As this result is a key element of our paper highlighting the problematic
issue of the endogenous mobility of workers across firms and its potential to lead to biased
parameter estimates regarding the link between trade and wages, we estimate a wide array of
consistency checks which we detail in Appendix B.


4.      Endogenous Worker Mobility
Our firm-level analysis confirms findings in earlier studies regarding the differential impact
of trade reform on average wages at firms with different degrees of trade exposure.
However, the analysis of average firm-level wages, although informative, is not well suited to
examine the differential impact of liberalization on otherwise identical workers in
heterogeneous firms for a number of interrelated reasons. For instance, in addition to
observable worker and firm characteristics, the matching of workers to firms is likely a
function of worker characteristics that are unobservable in the data but that managers of the
                                                                                              14
firm can observe and reward, such as the innate ability of the worker and any additional
productivity that may result from a worker’s employment in a specific firm due to
production complementarities between the worker and the firm (match-specific ability).
Specifically, in an environment in which firms are changing the composition and quality of
their labor force in response to liberalization20, analysis conducted at the firm level will be
biased.
                  Recent contributions to the theoretical literature on trade and labor markets
emphasize the role played by observable and ex-ante unobservable worker characteristics in
determining job assignment and wages (e.g., Yeaple (2005), Davidson, Matusz, and
Shevchenko (2008), and Helpman, Itskhoki, and Redding (2010)). In this setting, exporting
firms differentially respond to liberalization by systematically changing the composition of
their workforce, for example, towards workers with higher innate ability or match-specific
ability. Therefore, when the job mobility of workers is at least partly determined by
unobservable worker-firm match quality (endogenous mobility) and thus non-random,
estimates of the differential effect of trade on wages in exporting firms in equation (1) will be
biased. This is because non-random job assignment implies a correlation between the error
term ε jt (which subsumes the unobservable characteristics associated with workers matched

to firm j at time t) and the firm’s characteristics represented by right hand side variables, and
thus a failure of the maintained assumption underlying the estimation. In other words, the
differential effect we find for exporters at the firm level could be due to compositional
differences between firms with different trade orientation and not because otherwise
identical workers are being paid different wages across firms with different modes of
globalization.
                  Having discussed the potentially problematic issue of the endogenous assignment of
workers to firms, and the central role of this process in recent theoretical contributions
studying the links between trade and labor markets, we should note here that our work does
not attempt to discern between these different models, but aims to emphasize the relevance
of endogenous worker-firm matching in the context of international trade. We now proceed
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
20In unreported results, available upon request, we provide evidence of such differential workforce upgrading
in terms of (observable) skill at exporting firms relative to non-exporting firms with trade liberalization.
Specifically, we re-estimate a version of equation (1) with the share of workers with different levels of
education as the dependent variable. While a change in ERP has no significant impact on the workforce skill
composition at non-exporting firms, a decline in ERP is associated with a relative increase in the share of
workers with high-school or more at exporting firms.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                          15
    to explicitly test for the presence of endogenous worker mobility in our data. As we describe
    in the following subsection, we use matched employer-employee data and closely follow the
    recent work of Abowd, McKinney, and Schmutte (2010) in constructing suitable tests of
    endogenous worker mobility.


    4.1        Testing for endogenous worker mobility


    We begin by considering the basic wage specification of Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis
    (1999) in which a worker’s wages can be decomposed as follows:
    ln y ijt = α i + ψ j(i,t ) + φX it + βZ jt + ε ijt                                               (2)


    where i indexes the individual, j indexes the firm, t indexes time, and ln y ijt denotes
€
    individual-level log wages. The panel of linked worker-firm data allows us to control for a
    rich array of factors that may influence a worker’s wages, such as time-varying, observable,
                                                                              €
    firm characteristics ( Z jt ) and worker characteristics ( X it ). The vector Z jt is as in the firm-

    level analysis, and the vector X it includes indicator variables for the worker’s occupation,
    age, and education, as well as the worker’s tenure at the current firm. The model also
              €                                  €             €
    includes individual fixed effects, α i , which allow us to control for any time-invariant
                                  €
    unobservable worker characteristics, and firm fixed effects, ψ j( i,t ) , for firm j at which worker
    i is employed at time t, representing firm heterogeneity.
                                       €
          It is now a well-established empirical regularity that both worker and firm
                                                 €
    heterogeneity contribute to worker-level employment outcomes, such as wages, as in
    equation (2). It is important to note, however, that the classic identifying assumption for
    equation (2) is that the idiosyncratic disturbance term in each period is mean independent of
    observable worker and firm characteristics as well as firm and worker fixed effects, as
    follows:
    E(ε ijt | α i ,ψ j(i,t ), X it ,Z jt ) = 0 .


    Often referred to in the literature as the assumption of “conditional exogenous mobility”
€
    (see, for instance, Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999), Woodcock (2011), Sørensen and
    Vejlin (2011), and Abowd and Schmutte (2012)), it implies that the assignment of workers to

                                                                                                      16
employers depends on time-varying observable worker and firm characteristics, and firm and
worker fixed effects, but not ε ijt . As we discuss in the literature review, this assumption is at
odds with many well-known models of labor markets with frictions. Importantly, in the
context of international trade, for example, in Helpman, Itskhoki, and Redding (2010),
                   €
workers are ex-ante identical and job allocation is determined on the basis of match-specific
ability that is heterogeneous ex-post. High productivity firms (exporters) screen more
intensively, due to the complementarities between firm productivity and average worker
ability, resulting in higher quality firm-worker matches at exporters. In this case, the
estimates of equation (2) will be biased due to omitted worker-firm match quality
(Woodcock (2011)). Similarly, if workers with certain observable characteristics are more
successful at generating good matches (for example, because the return from search is
higher, or due to learning) and hence earn higher wages, omitted match heterogeneity could
also bias the estimated returns to observable characteristics in equation (2).
      We test the validity of the exogenous mobility assumption using the “match effects
test” introduced by Abowd, McKinney, and Schmutte (2010). The test statistic is based on
estimated match effects computed from the average (over time) residual for a worker i at a
firm j. The test rests on the logic that the match effect, under the null of exogenous mobility,
should not predict the transitions of workers between firms. Specifically, under exogenous
mobility, an individual’s average residual from the most recently completed job, ε ijt −1 ,
(within quintiles of the residual distribution) should not predict the transition across
heterogeneous firms (say from a particular quintile of the ψ j( i,t ) distribution to another
                                                                              €
quintile of the ψ j( i,t ) distribution).
      The test is implemented as follows. First, we estimate equation (2) for the worker
                                                   €
sample described in Section 2.3. Then, for workers who switched employers between time t
   €
and t-1, the average residual within worker and firm ( ε ijt −1 ) is calculated for the complete

duration of the match (i.e., until t-1). ε ijt −1 represents the “match effect” for the firm and
worker pair (at the employer in t-1). Under the  € null hypothesis, the transition rates between
quintiles of the firm effects distribution, from the previous employer’s ψ j( i,t −1) quintile to the
                                €
current employer’s ψ j( i,t ) quintile, should be independent of ε ijt −1 . Importantly, if the null
hypothesis is rejected for our data, this would suggest that
                                                         € the estimation results from

         €                                              €                                         17
    equation (2), and by extension equation (1), are biased. We calculate the test statistic both by
    grouping small firms with less than two movers into one firm (as we describe in Section 2.3),
    and by excluding these small firms from the sample. In both cases, we conduct the test on
    the largest mobility group, since the firm fixed effects estimated for unconnected groups are
    not directly comparable with each other.
                                              Our data strongly reject the null hypothesis of exogenous mobility for the sample of
    job switchers in our data. The match effects test statistic, distributed chi-squared with 496
    degrees of freedom21, has a value χ2 = 8,600 when we group small firms and χ2 = 19,000
    when we omit these firms from the sample (and thus statistically significant at the 1% level
    of significance). This finding confirms the relevance of models of labor allocation involving
                              €                                           €
    search dynamics and sorting, and highlights the importance of allowing for the possibility of
    firm-worker match heterogeneity in wage determination.
                                              To further emphasize this point, following Abowd, McKinney, and Schmutte (2010)
    and Schmutte (forthcoming), we illustrate worker employment transitions in a series of plots.
    Figure 4 maps the conditional distribution of quintiles of the firm fixed effects for the
    previous job, ψ j( i,t −1) , given quintiles of individual average residuals from the most recently

    completed job ( ε ijt −1 ), for the sample of job changers. Under the assumption of exogenous
    mobility,
      €       the distribution of ψ j( i,t −1) should not show any variation across quintiles of the
    average residual. That is to say, the estimation strategy requires that the quality of the firm-
          €
    worker match (in the previous job) should not contain any information about the estimated
                        €
    firm fixed effects for that job. Figure 4 demonstrates that this is not the case in our data. For
    example, while job changers in the extremes of the match distribution (Q( ε ijt −1 ) = 1 and Q(

     ε ijt −1 ) = 5) are most likely to originate from the lower-middle of the ψ j( i,t −1) distribution (Q(

    ψ j( i,t −1) ) = 2), job changers in the middle of the match effect€distribution (Q( ε ijt −1 ) = 3)

€   most often originate from the first quintile of the ψ j( i,t −1) distribution.
                                                                      €
           In Figure 5, we plot the transition rates from a job in ψ j( i,t −1) quintile to a job in ψ j( i,t )
€                                                                                 €

                                             €
    transitions are not random; most workers move between jobs within the same employer

    = 496 where #Q denotes the number of quintiles.

effect quintile, which is evident from the rightward movement of the peak of the ψ j( i,t )
distribution with higher quintiles of the original job. Moreover, Figures 6a-c illustrate that
these transition probabilities vary across quintiles of the match effect distribution. Figures 6a,
                                                                                  €
6b, and 6c plot the transition probabilities for the first, third, and fifth quintiles of the match
effects distribution, respectively. The figures show the differences across job switchers in
different quintiles of the match effects distribution. For example, job switchers at the
extremes of the match effects distribution are more likely to transition within the same
employer effect quintile than job changers in the middle of the match effects distribution.
This is most notable for Q( ε ijt −1 ) = 5 in Figure 6c. By contrast, job switchers at the median
of the match effects distribution are more likely to improve their employer effect than are
workers at either the top or the bottom quintiles of the match effects distribution. This is
                 €
evidenced, for instance, by the relatively flat surface in lower-right quadrant of Figure 6b,22
where no transitions from low effect to high effect employers are seen. Importantly, the
differences between 6a, 6b and 6c indicate that there is considerable variation in transition
probabilities across the different quintiles of the match effects distribution. Taken together,
Figures 4, 5 and 6a-c clearly illustrate the failure of the exogenous mobility assumption, as
the estimated match effects contain information on job-to-job transitions, confirming the
conclusions reflected in the value of the test statistic for exogenous mobility that we report.23


5.                                                    Worker-Level Analysis with Match Fixed Effects
When match-specific productivity is important in wage determination, the Abowd, Kramarz,
and Margolis (1999) specification in equation (2) which includes only worker and firm fixed
effects will result in biased estimates of these fixed effects, as well as biased estimates of the
returns to observable worker and firm characteristics (Woodcock (2011)). For example, if
more experienced workers are likely to draw better matches, omission of the match effect
will result in an overestimation of the returns to experience. In the context of the
international trade literature, if the labor market functions in the manner described by
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
22 This is consistent with the finding in Abowd, McKinney, and Schmutte (2010) for the United States that the
likelihood for upgrading the firm effect is strongest for workers at the median match effect.
23 In results available by request, we compute the Abowd, McKinney, and Schmutte (2010) test statistics

separately for the following subsamples of job switchers: those who switched between domestic firms, those
who switched between exporting firms, and importantly in our context, those workers who make transitions
between domestic firms and exporting firms. In every case, we find a decisive rejection of the assumption of
exogenous worker mobility.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   19
Helpman, Itskhoki, and Redding (2010), the screening thresholds for match-specific ability
will be different in the post-liberalization equilibrium, shifting the distribution of worker
abilities (i.e., the quality of matches) within each firm. Given that this shift varies
systematically with the export status of the firm, specifications lacking controls for match
quality, such as the one in equation (1), will result in biased estimates of the differential effect
of trade liberalization on wages.
                                          To allow for the fact that a worker’s job assignment may not be independent of the
idiosyncratic part of the residual in equation (2), but may instead be determined by
unobserved, time-invariant, firm-worker match-specific productivity effects, as specified in a
number of recent theories of trade and labor market allocation, we now consider a more
elaborate specification of wages and augment equation (1) as follows
  ln yijt = γ 1 'Protect kt + γ 2 'Protect kt * Exp jt + γ 3 'RERt * Exp jt + γ 4 'Exp jt + Mij + δtr + φ X it + β Z jt + εijt                                                                                                     (3)


where Mij, a given worker i’s employment at a given firm j, denotes worker-firm match fixed
effects (or job-spell fixed effects). All other variables are as previously defined.
                                                      Since for the duration of a worker’s employment within a firm, neither the worker
nor the firm varies, the inclusion of match fixed effects obviates the need for the separate
inclusion of worker and firm fixed effects. This is not costly for us, as our primary interest in
this exercise lies in estimating the differential effect of trade liberalization ( γ 2 ' ) controlling
for worker, firm, and match effects rather than in estimating separately the worker and firm
effects.24 The estimated coefficient of the interaction term reflects any differential effect of a
                                                                      €
change in protection on the wages of workers employed in exporting firms relative to
otherwise identical workers employed in firms serving only the domestic market. Note that
the interpretation of γ 2 ' is different than the analogous coefficient in equation (1) as it no
longer reflects the differential change in the firm’s workforce composition based on (time-
invariant) unobservable worker characteristics or the quality of the firm-worker match.
            €
        We note that the inclusion of time-invariant match effects, M ij , on the right hand
side of equation (3) allows us to account for the endogenous assignment of workers to firms
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
24If one is interested in obtaining unbiased estimates of firm and worker
                                                                       € fixed effects, as in exercises examining
the sorting patterns of workers into firms (Davidson, Heyman, Matusz, Sjoholm, and Zhu (2010)) or
decomposing wage variation into variation arising from firm heterogeneity and worker heterogeneity (Frías,
Kaplan, and Verhoogen (2009)) inter alia, match effects should be included in addition to firm and worker fixed
effects. See Woodcock (2011) for details.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   20
due to the component of match-specific ability that is time invariant. Thus, in estimating
specification (3), the implicit assumption is that worker mobility is random conditional on
time-invariant match-specific worker ability and time-varying worker and firm
characteristics, Xit and Zjt ( E(ε ijt | α i ,ψ j(i,t ), X it ,Z jt , M ij ) = 0 ). As discussed in Abowd,
McKinney, and Schmutte (2010), accounting for endogenous worker assignment that may
occur due to time-varying match-specific effects requires knowledge of the source of the time
                    €
variation in worker’s firm-specific ability (for instance, due to firm-specific on-the-job
learning). Such features, while clearly important, have generally not been the focus of
theories linking international trade and labor markets and their estimation is outside of the
scope of the present analysis. Our specification with match fixed effects allows for an
important source of endogenous worker mobility, which may arise due to time-invariant
match-specific productivity, but clearly does not control for all forms of endogenous worker
mobility. Nevertheless, our estimation, which proceeds on the basis of a weaker exogeneity
assumption, constitutes an improvement over existing work in this area.25


5.1                                                   Worker-level estimation results
Table 3 reports estimation results from equation (3) with match fixed effects for both tariffs
(in the left panel) and ERP (in the right panel) as the measure of protection, using the
worker sample described in Section 2.3.26 In our estimation of equation (3), we cluster
standard errors at the industry-year level.27
Our estimates suggest that the inclusion of match-specific productivity effects results in
insignificant estimates of both the coefficient on the trade protection measure ( γ1 ' ) and the
coefficient measuring the differential impact of trade reform on workers employed in
exporting firms ( γ 2 ' ). Note that the point estimates of the differential effect of the change in
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   €

25 Furthermore, as we will discuss shortly, in a modified specification, we allow for a particular form of time
variation in the worker-firm effects, by allowing the magnitude of the worker-firm match effect to change when
firms change export status.
26 As we discuss in Section 2.3, given our computing capacity, the data available to us, and the questions we ask,

we consider slightly different samples between Section 4 and Section 6. Footnote 11 offers further details on
these sample differences. We note, however, that our main result from the firm-level analysis (that exporters
differentially increase wages in response to trade reform) continues to hold when we only consider the set of
firms in our worker sample.
27 However, as in the firm-level analysis, our main results hold when we cluster the standard errors at both the

industry level and the firm level to account for the possibility of serially-correlated errors.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       21
the corresponding estimates based on firm-level data, reported in Table 2.28 Further, Table 3
also indicates that once we allow for match-specific productivity, as well as a wide array of
worker and firm level controls in explaining individual wages, the premium paid to workers
at exporting firms (evaluated at mean values of ERP and RER as the coefficient on export
status, plus the coefficient on the export-ERP interaction times the mean value of the ERP,
plus the coefficient on the export-RER interaction times the mean value of the RER) is
economically and statistically insignificant.29
                                                      As we have previously discussed, our analysis cannot account for endogenous
mobility related to time-varying match-specific productivity. Indeed, while the theory on
trade and labor markets has considered that worker composition may change with export
status, it has not, to our knowledge, actually allowed for time-varying match-specific effects
between a given worker and a given firm. Nevertheless, time-varying match effects remain
an empirical possibility. To explore the hypothesis that changes in export status may result in
a change in match-specific effects, we re-estimate our main worker-level regression from
equation (3) with an interactive exporter-match fixed effect. That is, we allow the match
effect to vary by the export status of the firm; a new match is assigned for any worker-firm
match in which the firm switches export status.30 Our main parameter of interest on the
interaction term between protection and export status continues to be statistically
insignificant (see columns (2) and (4) for tariffs and ERP, respectively) when we incorporate
interactive exporter-match fixed effects,31 that is, even when we allow for match effects that
vary over time (with the export status of the firm), the differential impact of trade on the
wages of workers at exporting firms relative to otherwise identical workers at domestic firms
appears to be insignificantly different from zero.


	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
28 Note that our estimates in the baseline specification reported in Table 3 suggest that, consistent with the
evidence from Mexico in Verhoogen (2008), relative wages of workers in exporting firms increase following a
RER depreciation (significant only at 10%). A potential explanation for this differential effect could be that
RER changes are perceived as transitory by firms and that firms respond by paying existing workers higher
wages (through rent-sharing or efficiency wages) instead of changing their workforce composition. While we
find the discrepancy between the results for changes in RER and in protection potentially interesting, we do
not emphasize this result as this is not a robust finding (see Table 4). We thank Rodney Ludema for a very
helpful discussion on this point.
29 This finding of an insignificant exporter premium is consistent with the results of Schank, Schnabel, and

Wagner (2007) for Germany.
30 Identification in this model is a result of within-exporter-match changes over time in tariffs across firm-types.

As such, we can no longer identify the exporter dummy, which is constant within a firm-type-match.

                                                      In Table 4, we conduct a wide array of tests to confirm that our main results hold
across a number of specifications. The first two columns report estimation results from
specification (3) for alternative samples. As we describe in the data section, the regressions in
Table 4 draw on the complete employment history of a 1% random sample of the
population of Brazil’s formal-sector labor force. In the first column, we repeat the analysis
drawing on the complete employment history of a 5% random sample of formal-sector
males living in metropolitan areas. In the next column, we restrict our analysis to Brazil’s
main trade reform period (1990-1994) during which the average ERP continuously
decreased. Our main interaction coefficient of interest remains statistically insignificant.
                                                      Menezes-Filho and Muendler (2011) document that Brazil’s trade liberalization
increased transitions from formal manufacturing to the service sector, unemployment, and
out of the labor force. In the next two columns, we test the importance of our restriction to
the formal manufacturing sector on the results. First, we include the agriculture and mining
sectors, as important tradable sectors for Brazil for which we also have information on tariff
rates and export status, into our main analysis. Second, in a similar fashion, we extend the
sample further to include traditionally non-traded sectors, like services, which employ a large
portion of the Brazilian population.32 The results are consistent with our main analysis for
the manufacturing sector only.
                                                      Next, we replace the economy-wide real exchange rate with industry-specific real
exchange rates in order to capture differences in the relative importance of trading partners
across industries.33 Then, we include sector-specific year dummies in specification (3) in
order to account for other economic changes or reforms (such as prices, FDI inflows,
privatization, returns to skill) that might exhibit sector-level variation, and that may not be
fully captured by firm fixed effects or region-specific year dummies.34 Our results continue

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
32 We do not, however, have export status or tariff information for these sectors. Therefore, in order to
understand the implications of including all sectors of the economy in our main estimation, we follow recent
work (e.g., Topalova (2010), McCaig and Pavcnik (2012), and Kovak (2013)) and denote tariff rates for all non-
traded industries to be zero and denote all firms in these industries to be non-exporters.
33 We construct industry-specific real exchange rates using time-varying trade weights, as in Goldberg (2004).

variables in the specification.
                                                       Next, we test whether our insignificant interaction coefficient is sensitive to the
exporting thresholds we use to assign the indicator variable denoting a firm’s export status.
In our main specification, a firm is defined as an exporter if it exported any positive dollar
amount that year. There is, however, substantial heterogeneity within our sample of
exporters.35 The average worldwide export sales over our sample period is approximately
$3.9 million, while the median exported value is much lower at roughly $150,000. Consistent
with the idea of learning about potential exporting markets (Albornoz, Calvo Pardo, Corcos,
and Ornelas (2012)), there are many exporters with positive, but very small, worldwide
export sales. We note this may generate spurious entry into and exit from exporting, biasing
coefficients to zero. Therefore, in the next two columns, we consider only firms which
exported for three consecutive years and firms with worldwide export sales greater than the
10th percentile36 as exporting firms, respectively. That is, firms which switch in and out of
exporting over a short horizon or export very small quantities are considered non-exporters.
Our results continue to be statistically insignificant when we consider these changes in the
exporting cutoff. In addition, to alleviate potential concerns regarding endogeneity of the
export decision, we follow Amiti and Davis (2012) and consider a time-invariant measure of
export status. We define a firm as an exporter if it exported a positive dollar value at the
beginning of our sample (1990) and zero otherwise. Our main coefficient of interest remains
insignificant, and the point estimate is similar in magnitude.
                                                      Until now, all of our tests have relied on the extensive margin of exporting. In the
final two columns, we exploit information on the intensive export margin, as measured by
the logarithm of exports (plus one) and the logarithm of exports (plus one) per worker.
When we use the magnitude of exports to represent the relevance of exports to the firm, we
obtain yet again estimates of γ1 ' and γ 2 ' , that are insignificantly different from zero.37

and Kramarz (2004)), the United States (Bernard and Jensen (1995)), Chile (Blum, Claro, and Horstmann
(2012)) and Colombia (Eaton, Eslava, Kugler, and Tybout (2008)).
36 Over our sample period, the 10th percentile of the value of exports is approximately $5,700.

Our findings suggest an insignificant differential effect of trade policy on the wages of
workers employed in exporting firms. This finding stands in sharp contrast to results
obtained at the firm level using average firm-level wages. One reason for this difference is
simply that the use of detailed worker-level data allows us to take into account any changes
in the composition of the workforce (by controlling for both observable and time-invariant
unobservable worker characteristics) following trade policy. Also, by including worker-firm
match effects, we allow for compositional changes in terms of firms’ (time-invariant) match
quality following trade policy changes. If, following trade liberalization, exporting firms
improve their average match quality by hiring better matched workers, the coefficient on the
differential impact of trade reform on average firm-level wages at exporters from equation
(1), without controlling for match effects, would mistakenly be estimated as significant even
in the absence of any true effect.
                                                      Key to this argument is that exporters differentially increase workforce quality (in
terms of innate worker ability and/or in terms of match-specific productivity) post-trade
reform. In Table 5, we use the match effects estimated from equation (3) to confirm this
point. Specifically, we calculate the average match effect for all firms in a pre-liberalization
year (1990) and in a post-liberalization year (1998). 38 We then report the average (and
median) match effect across all firms, all exporting firms, and all non-exporting firms in the
pre- and post-trade reform years. The data document that average match quality at exporters
increased between 1990 and 1998 (from 0.136 to 0.160), meanwhile average match quality at
non-exporters decreased from -0.019 to -0.069.39 Note that the magnitude of the estimated
match effect is also larger for exporters than for non-exporters in both 1990 and 1998.
Recall that the match fixed effects in equation (3) absorb both worker and firm fixed effects
in addition to the time-invariant match quality of a given employment spell. Consequently,
our finding of an increase in the average match effect in exporting firms between 1990 and
1998 summarizes the combined effect of changes in the workforce composition in these
firms in terms of improvements in worker quality as measured by time-invariant worker-

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
38 To be clear, though estimated match effects from equation (3) are time-invariant, the firm’s average match
quality changes over time as the firm’s workforce changes.
39 More formally, when we regress estimated average match quality in a firm on the trade and export status

variables, while controlling for firm fixed effects and observable firm characteristics as in equation (1), we find
that average match quality increases at exporters relative to non-exporters with a decline in ERP, supporting
the notion that exporters differentially increase workforce quality post-trade reform. We thank an anonymous
referee for this valuable suggestion.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   25
specific characteristics, such as innate ability, and in terms of an improvement in the quality
of the worker-firm matches. 40 The relative improvement in the distribution of match-
specific ability in exporting firms is consistent with models emphasizing non-random
allocation of workers across production activities.41
                                                       This central finding serves to explain the difference between the results at the firm
level and those at the worker level. If average quality of the workforce (in terms of (time-
invariant) match-specific ability or innate worker-specific ability) improves systematically in
exporting firms following trade liberalization, as we show in Table 5, failing to control for
match effects (as is the case in the firm-level analysis) will incorrectly suggest that trade
liberalization leads to a differential wage improvement for workers at exporting firms. Our
findings imply that following trade liberalization, a given worker (with fixed innate ability)
who continues to be employed at a given exporting firm (with a fixed worker-firm match
effect) will not experience any differential effect on her wage relative to another worker who
continues to be employed at a non-exporting firm. Ceteris paribus, workers who transition to
firms with which they are better matched will, however, earn higher wages because of their
higher productivity there. Exporting firms will pay a differentially higher average wage post-
liberalization because of the improvement in the composition of their workforce in terms of
innate ability and worker-firm match quality.
                                                      A comparison of estimates obtained from specifications with and without match
fixed effects suggests that match effects matter both qualitatively and quantitatively. Table 6
compares estimates obtained from alternate specifications with only firm fixed effects
included, with separate worker and firm fixed effects included, and finally with match fixed
effects included. Note that this comparison can only be made for the sample of workers who
switch jobs during this period, as worker fixed effects cannot be separately identified from

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
40 Note that the firm fixed effect for a given firm is constant across time and cannot account for the
improvement in match quality between 1990 and 1998.
41 While our findings of endogenous labor mobility and improvement in the distribution of match effects in

exporting firms are clearly consistent with the models of Yeaple (2005), Davidson, Matusz, and Shevchenko
(2008), and Helpman, Itskhoki, and Redding (2010), we should note that there are other dimensions along
which the data are not entirely in line with the predictions of these theories. For instance, complementarities
between workers' abilities and firm productivity in Helpman, Itskhoki, and Redding (2010) imply that with the
improvement in average match quality within an exporting firm, the wages of all remaining workers in the firm
should increase. A similar cross-worker spillover effect occurs under Nash bargaining in Davidson, Matusz, and
Shevchenko (2008) as a worker with high productivity increases firm revenues and hence, wages for all other
workers, a prediction that does not find broad support in our data (as indicated by the insignificance of our
estimate of γ 2 ' ).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   26
match fixed effects for those workers who do not switch firms. Consequently, for the
purposes of Table 6, we further restrict the worker sample defined in Section 2.3, to workers
who switch employers. As expected, the inclusion of worker fixed effects lowers (in absolute
value) the magnitude of the point estimate on γ 2 ' from 0.076 to 0.050. The inclusion of
match fixed effects lowers the coefficient further from 0.050 to 0.017.


6.      Conclusion                    €


This paper, which explores the role of endogenous worker mobility for the analysis of the
effect of trade liberalization on labor markets using matched employer-employee data from
Brazil, provides striking results. Once we allow for endogenous mobility due to worker-firm
specific matches, we find, in contrast to most previous studies, an insignificant exporter
premium and also an insignificant differential effect of trade liberalization on the wages of
workers at exporting firms relative to identical workers at non-exporting firms. We also find
that workforce composition post-liberalization improves systematically in exporting firms in
terms of the combination of innate worker ability and the quality of worker-firm matches.
Endogenous matching of workers with firms is thus crucial in determining wage outcomes
for workers in open economies.
        Future work in this area will perhaps focus on these allocation mechanisms and the
associated consequences for wage determination by exploring in greater detail mobility
patterns of workers between exporting and non-exporting firms and changes in these
transition probabilities in order to better understand the mechanisms by which exporters
upgrade match quality after liberalization. We note also that the conceptual issues engaged
by this paper are quite general ones; the greater availability of matched worker-firm data sets
from other countries in recent years should allow for similar analytical explorations in other
empirical settings.

A.                                                    Policy Background and Data Appendix


A.1.                                                  Exogeneity of trade policy
In the 1990s, Brazil strongly and unilaterally liberalized trade policy; average ERP decreased
by over 50% between 1990 and 1998 (see Figure 3.2). As discussed in Goldberg and Pavcnik
(2007), these reforms were largely driven by the government’s stated goal to bring down
trade barriers to uniform levels, thereby minimizing concerns regarding the endogeneity of
tariff formation, due, for instance, to political economy pressures, as in Grossman and
Helpman (1994). Moreover, to the extent that political economy pressures are time invariant,
any remaining bias associated with the political economy of tariff formation is further
minimized in our estimation by the inclusion of fixed effects (Goldberg and Pavcnik (2005)).
For these reasons, we consider Brazil’s tariff liberalization as exogenous.


Be that as it may, we test this exogeneity assumption following Topalova and Khandelwal
(2011). In that paper, the authors perform two tests for the endogeneity of trade policy
changes in India. First, they examine the extent to which tariff changes move together at a
detailed Harmonized System (HS) categorization. Second, they examine whether changes in
tariffs over the sample period are associated with pre-determined industry characteristics. We
discuss each test in turn here.


First, we access “effectively applied” Brazilian tariff rates for our sample period across
approximately 4,500 HS-6 categories from the TRAINS database maintained by UNCTAD
to confirm the hypothesis that because policymakers were required to meet certain
benchmarks, the majority of tariff changes in a year exhibited the same pattern (up, down, or
no change). Figure A.1, replicating for Brazil Figure A1 in Topalova and Khandelwal (2011),
demonstrates that in nearly all years, the majority of tariff changes were in a single direction,
supporting the exogeneity of the Brazilian tariff reforms.42

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
42It comes as no surprise that the year 1995 is the exception. Roughly 30% of tariff lines experienced increases
and about 60% of tariff lines decreased in that year. This is consistent with our discussion in Section 3.1 that
the government partially reversed trade reforms in 1995 in response to the currency appreciation.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   30
Next, Table A.1 replicates for Brazil, to the best of our ability given data constraints, the
results in Table 2 in Topalova and Khandelwal (2011) for India. We regress changes in ERP
and the final goods tariff between 1990-1998 on pre-determined industry characteristics,
such as the logarithm of average industry wages, the share of white collar workers, and the
logarithm of industry employment in 1990, as well as growth in industry employment from
1986-1990. Our data also allow us to test for relationships between tariff changes and the
industry’s pre-period educational and gender composition (not reported), as well as the
industry’s total wage bill. All regressions are weighted by the square-root of the number of
firms in the industry as in Topalova and Khandelwal (2011). All coefficients are statistically
insignificant; none of the pre-reform industry characteristics we use are correlated with tariff
changes, supporting the exogeneity of trade policy in Brazil. In the final column, we also
confirm with our data the results in Pavcnik, Blom, Goldberg, and Schady (2004) and Kovak
(2013) that the industries with the highest pre-reform protection experienced the strongest
liberalization, which is again suggestive of the idea that Brazil’s trade policy reforms were
driven by the government’s stated goal to bring down barriers to uniform levels.


A.2.                                                  Data description
Worker data Our main data are administrative records from Brazil for formal-sector
workers in any sector of the economy linked to their employers. Brazilian law dictates that
registered establishments report to the Ministry of Labor each year on all workers. These
records are processed annually in the Relação Anual de Informações Sociais (RAIS). Worker
characteristics of interest include earnings, education, occupation, tenure, gender, and age.
Firm characteristics of interest include the sector and municipality of production.


The process for firms to report on their workers is extensive and costly. However, RAIS is
used to assess payments of the annual public wage supplement, approximately one monthly
minimum wage, to all formally-employed workers during the year. Thus, workers have a
strong incentive to encourage employers to report accurately. In practice, however, only
formally-employed workers will be properly recorded.43

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
 Goldberg and Pavcnik (2003) estimate that informal workers represent approximately 16% of Brazil’s
43

manufacturing labor force over our sample period. The literature on the impact of trade reform on the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   31
As we report in the text, a unique job-level observation includes a worker identification
number, the tax number of the worker’s firm, the month-year of the worker’s accession to
the firm, and the month-year of the worker’s separation from the firm. In practice, a unique
worker ID may be reported more than one time within a firm-year. This is in part due to a
Brazilian labor law (Fundo de Garantia de Tempo de Serviço (FGTS)) in which formally-employed
workers receive a guaranteed fund, comprising monthly employer contributions, upon
termination. If the worker is dismissed without justification, the firm is required to pay the
worker 40% of the FGTS contributions. In order to avoid these spurious transitions, we
consider only the last paying job within a year for each worker.


RAIS reports a worker’s average monthly earnings (in multiples of the current minimum
wage) for each job in which a worker is employed in each year. In combination with
information on the number of months a worker was employed during the year and deflated
minimum wage information in reais from the Brazilian Central Bank (August 1994 is the base
month), we calculate our main dependent variable—annual real earnings in reais.


Muendler, Poole, Ramey, and Wajnberg (2004) map the Brazilian classification of
occupations (Classificação Brasileira de Ocupações (CBO)) found in RAIS to the International
Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO). The CBO is a detailed, task-oriented classification
system, while the ISCO reflects a less-detailed and more skill-oriented classification system.
The skill classification is intended to incorporate on-the-job experience, informal training,
and the technological skill content of the occupation (Elias and Birch (1994)). ISCO
occupations can be grouped into four broad occupational categories to reflect the skill-
intensity of the occupation—professional and managerial, unskilled white collar, skilled blue
collar, and unskilled blue collar—following Abowd, Kramarz, Margolis, and Troske (2001).


Sectors in RAIS are identified using the classification of Brazil’s statistical office (Instituto
Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE)). This classification is roughly comparable to a 3-
digit NAICS classification and has also been used by Menezes-Filho, Muendler, and Ramey

    data.


    Trade protection Our data on protection rates are from Kume, Piani, and Souza (2003).
    They report ad valorem nominal output tariffs and effective rates of protection at the Nível 80
    Brazilian industrial classification level. ERP for sector k is formally measured as the increase
    in value-added due to the structure of tariffs relative to value-added at free trade prices, as

                   ∑a   mk kτ                    d
                                                amk (1+ τ k )

    concordance (see http://econ.ucsd.edu/muendler/brazil). For each year, we calculate the simple-
    average across Nível 80 industries within a 2-digit IBGE subsector.


    B.      Firm-Level Consistency Checks


    In Table B.1, we conduct a wide array of consistency checks for the reported results in Table
    4.1 on the differential impact of a decline in ERP on firm-level average wages at exporters
    relative to non-exporters. In addition, please refer to the working paper version (Krishna,
    Poole, and Senses (2011)) for further analyses.


    In the first column of Table B.1, we use the complete employment history from a 5%
    random sample of males in metropolitan areas instead of the 1% random sample of the full
    population. In the next column, we restrict the data to Brazil’s main trade reform period
    (1990-1994) when average protection levels consistently declined. In both cases, our main
    coefficient of interest remains significant with minimal changes in the magnitude. The third
    and fourth columns offer tests for how our restriction to the manufacturing sector
    influences our results, by including the agricultural and mining sectors and all non-tradable
    sectors, respectively. The results are consistent with our main analysis for the manufacturing
    sector only.
                                                                                                 33
The results reported in the next column suggest that our findings are also robust to replacing
the economy-wide real exchange rate with industry-specific real exchange rates. Next, we
estimate specification (1) by including sector-year indicator variables in order to account for
other concomitant economic changes or reforms that might exhibit sector-level variation
and are not fully captured by our other controls. We find that the differential impact of trade
reform on average firm wages at exporters relative to non-exporters remains.


We also test whether our results are sensitive to the exporting thresholds we use to assign
the indicator variable denoting a firm’s export status. In our main specifications, a firm is
defined as an exporter if it had any positive worldwide export sales in that year. We note this
may generate spurious entry into and exit from exporting. As such, in the next two columns,
we consider only firms which exported for three consecutive years and firms with worldwide
export sales greater than the 10th percentile as exporting firms, respectively. Our results are
robust to these changes in the exporting cutoff. We also replace the exporter status dummy
in our main specification with a time-invariant measure of export status that takes the value
one if the firm was an exporter as of the beginning of our sample (1990) and zero otherwise.
Our estimation results continue to suggest a differential positive impact of liberalization on
average wages at exporting firms relative to non-exporters.


Our results until now have strictly relied on the extensive margin of exporting. In the last
columns of Table B.1, we report results from specifications in which we include the
logarithm of the value of exports (plus one) and the logarithm of exports (plus one) per
worker as measures of the intensive export margin. Our results indicate that there is a
differential increase in wages at firms with higher values of exports and higher exports per
worker following liberalization.
