Measures of real consumption based upon the ownership of durable goods, the quality of housing,
the health and mortality of children, the education of youth and the allocation of female time in the
household indicate that sub-Saharan living standards have, for the past two decades, been growing
about 3.4 to 3.7 percent per annum, i.e. three and a half to four times the rate indicated in international
data sets.

I. Introduction

           Much of our current understanding of the factors behind growth and development, and

our continuing attempts to deepen that understanding, is based upon cross-national estimates of

levels and growth rates of real standards of living. Unfortunately, for many of the poorest

regions of the world the underlying data supporting existing estimates of living standards is

minimal or, in fact, nonexistent. Thus, for example, while the popular Penn World Tables

purchasing power parity data set version 6.1 provided real income estimates for 45 sub-Saharan

African countries, in 24 of those countries it did not have any benchmark study of prices.1 In a

similar vein, although the on-line United Nations National Accounts database provides GDP data

in current and constant prices for 47 sub-Saharan countries for each year from 1991 to 2004, the

UN statistical office which publishes these figures had, as of mid-2006, actually only received

data for just under half of these 1410 observations and had, in fact, received no constant price

data, whatsoever, on any year for 15 of the countries for which the complete 1991-2004 on-line

time series are published.2

           Where official national data are available for developing countries, fundamental problems

of measurement produce a considerable amount of unquantifiable uncertainty. As noted by

Heston (1994), consumption measures for most developing countries are derived as a residual,

after subtracting the other major components of expenditure from production side estimates of
       1
       See "Data Appendix for a Space-Time System of National Accounts: Penn World Table 6.1", February
2008. As explained in the source, expatriate post-allowance indices were used to extrapolate the price studies of
benchmark countries to non-benchmark economies. This problem has been alleviated somewhat with the 2005 ICP
worldwide study of prices that informs PWT 7.0. As I show further below, the updating of PWT data in this fashion
moves its level estimates systematically closer to my results.
       2
        This statement is based upon a purchase in 2006 of all the national accounts data records ever provided to the
UN Statistics Division by member countries. When queried about the discrepancy between the completeness of their
website and the data I had purchased, UN officials were quite frank about the difficulties imposed by the demands
from users for a complete series, and their website openly explains that much of their data is drawn from other
international organizations and extrapolations (http://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/metasearch.asp). Similar frankness
concerning the need to use extrapolations from the data of other countries to fill in gaps is present on the World Bank
data website (see http://go.worldbank.org/FZ43ELUKR0).

GDP. Production side estimates of subsistence and informal production and other untaxed

activities are, however, very poor, leading to gross errors in the calculation of consumption

levels. Thus, for example, the first national survey of the informal sector in Mozambique in 2004

led to a doubling of the GDP estimate of nominal private consumption expenditure. Where direct

surveys of consumer expenditure are available in developing countries, these must also be treated

with care, given the difficulty of collecting accurate nominal consumption data. This is best

illustrated by the case of the United States where the considerable difference between the growth

of reported expenditure in the Consumer Expenditure Survey and the NIPA (using the production

residual method) led to about a log 40 percent gap between the two series by the early 1990s

(Slesnick 1998). The problems of getting accurate reports of household expenditure, and

marrying them to appropriate price indices, should be even greater in poor countries with limited

resources devoted to collecting data from individuals with minimal education.

       The paucity and poor quality of living standard data for less developed countries is well

known and is motivating expanding efforts to improve the quality of information, as represented

by the World Bank's International Comparison Programme and Living Standards Measurement

studies. However, there already exists, at the present time, a large body of unexamined current

and historical data on living standards in developing countries, collected as part of the

Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). For more than two decades this survey has collected

information on the ownership of durables, the quality of housing, the health and mortality of

children, the education of the youth and the allocation of women's time in the home and the

market in the poorest regions of the world.

       In this paper I use the DHS data to construct estimates of the level and growth of real

consumption in 29 sub-Saharan and 27 other developing countries. These estimates have the




                                                  2
virtue of being based upon a methodologically consistent source of information for a large

sample of poor economies. Rather than attempting to measure total nominal consumption and

marry it to independently collected price indices, they employ direct physical measures of real

consumption that, by their simplicity and patent obviousness (the ownership of a car or bicycle,

the material of a floor, the birth, death or illness of a child), minimize the technical demands of

the survey. While the items they cover provide little information on comparative living standards

in developed countries, in the poorest regions of the world they are clear indicators of material

well being, varying dramatically by socioeconomic status and covering, through durables, health

& nutrition and family time, the majority of household expenditure.

       The principal result of this paper is that real household consumption in sub-Saharan

Africa is growing between 3.4 and 3.7 percent per annum, i.e. three and a half to four times the

0.9 to 1.1 percent reported in international data sources. I find that the growth of consumption in

non sub-Saharan economies is also higher than reported in international sources, but the

difference here is much less pronounced, with growth of 3.4 to 3.8 percent, as opposed to the 2.0

to 2.2 percent indicated by international sources. While international data sources indicate that

sub-Saharan Africa is progressing at less than half the rate of other developing countries, the

DHS suggest that African growth is easily on par with that being experienced by other

economies. Regarding the cross-national dispersion of real consumption, the DHS data suggest

levels that are broadly consistent and highly correlated with those indicated by the Penn World

Tables, although there are substantial differences for individual countries.

       I follow the lead of scholars such as Becker, Philipson and Soares (2005) and Jones and

Klenow (2011) and take a broader view of consumption than is typically used in the national

accounts, including health outcomes and the use of family time. These elements, however, do




                                                  3
not explain the discrepancy between my estimates and international sources. I find the real

consumption equivalent of health and family time to be growing about as fast or slightly slower

than the average product, so their removal leaves the main results unchanged. In general, I show

that the results are not unusually sensitive to the exclusion of any particular product, while a

narrow focus on the slowest growing product group of all (housing) still produces sub-Saharan

growth estimates which are double those of international sources.

       I begin in Section II below by describing the DHS data. Section III then presents an

intuitive introduction to my method, describing how I convert data on real product consumption

into money metric real consumption equivalents by dividing them by the Engel curve coefficients

estimated off of household micro data. Section IV provides a more formal exposition, while

Section V applies the technique to the DHS data, producing the results outlined above. The

analysis of Section V imposes the simplifying assumption that a single Engel curve equation

approximates global demand for a product. I relax this in Section VI, estimating Engel curves

country by country, and show that the growth results are unchanged. Section VII concludes.


II. Demographic and Health Survey Data on Living Standards

       The Demographic Health Survey and its predecessor the World Fertility Survey, both

supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development, have conducted irregular but in-

depth household level surveys of fertility and health in developing countries since the late-1970s.

Over time the questions and topics in the surveys have evolved and their coverage has changed,

with household and adult male question modules added to a central female module, whose

coverage, in turn, has expanded from ever married women to all adult women. I take 1990 as my

starting point, as from that point on virtually all surveys include a fairly consistent household

module with data on household educational characteristics and material living conditions that are


                                                  4
central to my approach. In all, I have access to 135 surveys covering 1.6 million households in

56 developing countries, as listed in Appendix A. The occasional nature of the DHS surveys

means that I have an unbalanced panel with fairly erratic dates. Thus, I will not be able to

meaningfully report a full set of country specific growth rates for the past two decades. I can,

however, divide the sample into sub-Saharan and non sub-Saharan countries and calculate the

average growth rate of each group during the period covered by the data (1990-2006). This is

what I do further below.

           The raw data files of the DHS surveys are distributed as standardized "recode" files.

Unfortunately, this standardization and recoding has been performed, over the years, by different

individuals using diverse methodologies and making their own idiosyncratic errors. This

produces senseless variation across surveys as, to cite two examples, individuals with the same

educational attainment are coded as having dramatically different years of education or

individuals who were not asked education attendance questions are coded, in some surveys only,

as not attending. In addition, there are underlying differences in the coverage of the surveys (e.g.

children less than 5 years vs. children less than 3 years) and the phrasing and number of questions

on particular topics (e.g. employment) which produce further variation. Working with the

original questionnaires and supplementary raw data generously provided by DHS programmers, I

have recoded all of the individual educational attainment data, corrected coding errors in some

individual items, recoded variables to standardized definitions and, as necessary, restricted the

coverage to a consistent sample (e.g. married women, children less than 3 years) and removed

surveys with inconsistent question formats (in particular, regarding labour force participation).

   Notes: All variables, other than log weight, height and rooms per capita, coded as 0/1. Ownership of Durables:
at least one such item in the household; Housing Conditions: constructed floor means made of other than dirt, sand
or dung. Household Time: individual variables, i.e. coded separately for each individual of that age in the
household; recent fertility and market participation refer to currently married women only. Children's Health:
individually coded for each child born within 35 months of the survey; diarrhea, cough and fever referring to the
occurrence of these for the individual in question (if alive) in the preceding two weeks; log weight and log height
referring to measurements of living children at the time of the survey.



        I use the DHS data to derive 26 measures of real consumption distributed across four

areas: (1) ownership of durables; (2) housing conditions; (3) children's nutrition and health; and

(4) household time and family economics. Table I above details the individual variables and

sample means. All of these variables are related to household demand and expenditure, broadly

construed, and, as shown later, are significantly correlated with real household incomes, as

measured by average adult educational attainment. I have selected these variables on the basis of

their availability and with an eye to providing a sampling of consumption expenditures that

would, through material durables, nutrition & health and household time, cover most of the

budget of households in the developing world. By including health and family economics, I take



                                                         6
a broader view of consumption than the typical national accounts measure. However, as shown

later, this does not drive my results, as these products show close to average growth. I have made

the decision to break measures of household time into different age groups to account for

different demand patterns at different ages as the possibilities for substitution between home

production, human capital accumulation and market labour evolve. Thus, for example, in richer

households young women are more likely to be in school and less likely to be working in the late

schooling years (ages 15-24), but, consequently, are more likely to be working as young adults

(ages 25-49). Although males are included in the schooling and children's health variables, I do

not include separate time allocation measures for adult males because male questionnaire

modules are less consistently available and male participation behavior, when recorded, is less

strongly related to household income and, hence, by my methodology, would play little role in

estimating relative living standards.

           Before turning to the analysis, it is useful to graphically depict the DHS data that drives

the results of this paper. In Figure I below I graph, for each survey x product combination, the

country demeaned values of the product consumption4 against the country demeaned values of

the survey year. To provide a money metric for the movements in the consumption of each

product, I scale each product measure so that the cross-country standard deviation of the product

consumption level equals the cross-country standard deviation of log consumption per equivalent

adult reported in the Penn World Tables.5 Thus, the vertical movement in each product

       4
         For the ln variables (rooms, height and weight) I use the urban/rural weighted survey average, whereas for
the dichotomous variables I take the logit of that average, i.e. ln(c/(1-c)), as I use the logit as my baseline discrete
choice model later in the paper. In each figure I drop the (usually 14) countries for which I have only one survey
observation on the product in question. The data of these surveys is used, however, in benchmarking the cross-
sectional standard deviation of consumption, as described shortly. I should also note that I drop the middle
observation for Nigerian height, as it is bizarrely low and throws off the entire scale of the figure. This observation
is used in the analysis below and has little influence, as there are Nigerian surveys before and after it.

measure, and σ[PWT] the PWT standard deviation of ln real money consumption levels ln(Ci) (as reported in Table

consumption measure can be interpreted as the money consumption equivalent movement

implied by a crude Engel curve calculated off of the cross-national variation in mean product

consumption.

           The figure shows two characteristics of the DHS data. First, across most products there is

simply "too much" movement in consumption, particularly for the African countries. PWT and

UN consumption growth rates for sub-Saharan Africa, shown later, are around .01 per annum.

Thus, a country (demeaned) year value of 5 in the figure should be associated with a vertical

movement of .05 for Africa, i.e. a negligible movement on the vertical scale of the graph. This is

clearly not the case, with most products showing robust growth.6 Second, while the PWT and

UN suggest that non-African consumption growth is more than double that of sub-Saharan

Africa, in the DHS the consumption movement in the African countries appears, by and large, to

be roughly equal to that of the non-African countries. A skeptic might argue that my sample of

products, however broad I believe it to be, is biased towards a set of goods whose relative prices

are falling rapidly, i.e. the LDC equivalent of dvd players in recent decades in the developed

world. This, however, cannot explain why African growth in these products matches non-

African growth.


III. Methods: An Intuitive Introduction
           I begin with an intuitive and simplified presentation of my methods, leaving the more


VI later), I divide each cit by β = σ[ci]/σ[PWT]. This can be motivated by the equation ci = β*ln(Ci). Since this
equation should contain an error term, my calculation probably overstates the implied Engel elasticity β and hence
understates the growth suggested by the data.
       6
        Some products are negatives, e.g. diarrhea, fever and cough, and growth in these cases is defined as a
reduction in their incidence in the household. While at this point this may seem arbitrary, in the formal analysis I use
the micro-data relationship between the product and educational attainment to determine the change associated with
rising consumption. For the reader's information, aside from the three health variables just mentioned, women
working when young and births and marriage at any age are found to be negatively associated with household
educational attainment (Table V later).

formal and complete exposition for later. Imagine one observed the data presented in Table II on

household ownership of bicycles in two economies. As shown in panel (a), economy A has a

higher average ownership level than B and ownership in both economies is growing. Next,

consider using micro data in the two economies in both periods to run a regression of ownership

on household educational attainment. Say this produces a coefficient of .02 on years of

educational attainment. Dividing the mean consumption levels in panel (a) by the coefficient of

.02 produces the education equivalent consumption levels reported in panel (b). If one found,

separately, that a year’s education in both economies results in, say, a 10% increase in log real

income and consumption, one could derive the money equivalent log real consumption levels

reported in panel (c). We would conclude that economy A was 10% richer than B in 1990, and

only 8% richer in 2000, while growth was 8% and 10% in A and B, respectively, between 1990

and 2000. In sum, my approach is to use Engel curves implicitly estimated off of educational

attainment data to convert physical consumption levels into money metric measures of real

consumption.

         Any reasonable reader will immediately object that a host of factors other than real

consumption determine the presence of a bicycle in a household. For the purposes of discussion,

I will divide these into two categories: (a) influences which increase demand for a given product,



                                                          9
but only at the expense of lowering demand for something else; (b) influences which change

measured product demand without reflecting substitution from other products or any changes in

underlying real consumption. Relative prices are an obvious cause of the substitution described

in (a). Demographic factors contribute to the biases suggested by (b). Thus, households with

more members, perhaps in poorer countries or rural areas, are more likely to report the presence

of a bicycle for any given level of real living standards per member. Similarly, the height and

weight of infants, for any given level of real consumption expenditure, is strongly influenced by

their age. I should emphasize that in this characterization of potential problems I exclude factors

which lower the overall real price of consumption. Thus, households living in countries where

governments provide good transport, power and sanitation infrastructure will, for a given set of

nominal goods prices, experience lower shadow prices of consumption and enjoy better measured

material outcomes. These should properly be counted as indicative of higher real consumption.

         The key characteristic of substitution between products brought about by relative price

differences is that it has no particular sign or expected value for any given product. The obvious

solution, suggested by sampling theory, is to calculate log consumption values such as those of

Table I for a wide variety of products and average these to produce an overall estimate of living

standards. To be as representative as possible, the product sample should be “stratified”, drawing

across diverse areas of expenditure, such as the durables, housing, family economics and health

areas indicated in my description of DHS data. Jackknife techniques (i.e. case-wise deletion of

observations)7 and comparison of results across product categories will give a sense of the

sensitivity of the results to the product choices.



         7
          The application of the jackknife involves calculating a statistic N times, each time deleting one of the N
observations. While its principal objective is a non-parametric estimate of the standard error, its calculation allows
one to observe and report the sensitivity of the results to individual outliers.



                                                          10
         Econometrics provides techniques that improve on the efficiency of simple sample

averages. Key among these is the recognition that different observations come with differing

degrees of accuracy. Consider, for example, the growth implied by the consumption of a product,

as presented in Table II. With β̂ i denoting the regression coefficient on educational attainment

for product i, Mitc its mean consumption level at time t in country c, and RE the association

between log real consumption and education, estimated money metric equivalent growth for

product i in country c is given by:

                          M i 2000c − M i1990c                          σˆ ( βˆi )
         (1) gˆ ic = RE                          σˆ ( gˆ ic ) = gˆ ic
                                   βˆ
                                    i                                      βˆi

The right-hand side of (1), the estimated standard error of ĝ ic , is arrived at through the “delta

method” by multiplying the absolute value of the derivative of ĝ ic with respect to β̂ i by the

estimated standard error of β̂ i .8 As the equation shows, the standard error of ĝ ic will be larger

the larger is the ratio of the standard error of β̂ i to β̂ i itself, i.e. the lower its statistical

significance.

         Let gic be the actual Engel curve consumption equivalent growth implied by the growth of

the physical consumption of product i. Because of relative price trends, say gic is distributed

normally with mean µc (the growth of log real consumption in country c) and variance σ2.

Consequently, an observation ĝ ic is normally distributed with mean µc and variance

σ 2 + σˆ ( gˆ ic ) 2 . Our interest lies in estimating µc. The probability or likelihood we observe a

sample of N product growth rates for country c is given by:



         8
          To keep the example simple, I assume Mitc and RE are known with certainty. In practice, it is the tightness
of the Engel curve relation that determines the relative variance of different product observations, as mean
consumption levels are estimated to a high degree of accuracy with even modest sample sizes, while RE affects all
products equally.

Thus, under the given distributional assumptions, the most efficient estimate of the growth rate is

a weighted average of the estimated product growth rates. The weight placed on each product is

declining in its estimated variance. If each product is estimated with the same variance, the

weights are all 1/N and we take the simple average across products.9

         A standard calculation of consumption growth, based upon price and nominal expenditure

data, would weight the growth of each product’s real consumption by its share of nominal

expenditure. Equation (3) shows that, absent such data, my approach uses the significance of the

first step estimate of the Engel curve relationship to weight the growth of real consumption

implied by dividing product consumption growth by its Engel curve coefficient. In practice, this

tends to remove extreme growth outliers as, absent such adjustments, I find African growth to be

above 7%, i.e. more than double the 3.4% I report in my variance-adjusted baseline estimates. In

addition to accounting for the error with which observations are estimated, I also improve

econometric efficiency by introducing run-of-the-mill random effects designed to account for the

role relative prices play in producing persistent differences across countries in levels and trends

for the consumption of particular products. These also change the relative weighting of



         The first order condition for σ is given by ∑ ( gˆ ic − µ c ) [σ + σˆ ( gˆ ic ) ] = ∑[σ + σˆ ( gˆ ic ) ] which,

along with (3), generally gives two non-linear equations in the two unknowns µc and σ2. When each product is
estimated with the same variance, this equation has the simple solution σ 2 = ∑ ( gˆ ic − µ c ) 2 / N − σˆ ( gˆ ic )

observations, but as they are standard and their empirical influence is trivial, I leave their

presentation for later.

         Finally, turning to the biases introduced by household demographic characteristics, these

can be removed in the micro data regressions. Following on the example earlier above,

microdata on household ownership of a bicycle can be run on demographic controls, household

educational attainment and a full set of country x time dummies. Say, for the sake of simplicity,

that this regression again produces the .02 coefficient on educational attainment described earlier,

and the country x time dummies described in panel (a) of Table III. These dummies measure

relative consumption purged of the influence of mean demographic variables and educational

attainment. My objective is a measure of relative consumption purged only of demographic

influences. Consequently, in panel (b) I report the mean household educational attainment in

each region x time period which I add to the dummies of panel (a) divided by .02 to produce the

regional educational equivalent levels of consumption reported in panel (c). Multiplying these

values by the estimate of a 10% income profile of education produces the relative incomes

reported in panel (d), which are purged of the confounding influence of demographic factors.

The key point of this example is that residual dummy variables from a multivariate regression can




                                                          13
be substituted for mean national consumption levels in calculating the education equivalent

consumption levels, thereby correcting for demographic characteristics, provided national mean

education levels are added back in, as they are part of the national education equivalent

consumption of the product.

            Broadly speaking, the type of computations illustrated in Table III, averaged across a

variety of products to reduce the error introduced by relative price effects and with the estimation

precision and random effects weighting described and alluded to above, form the basis of the

calculations central to this paper.10


IV. Methods: Product Sampling and the Measurement of Real Consumption

            (a) Model

            I begin by laying out the theoretical framework and then describe its empirical

implementation. Let some measure of the real demand by household h for product p in region r

in period t be described by the equation:
                                                     r         r       r r
            (4) log(Qhprt ) = α p + η p log(Chrt
                                             N
                                                 ) + ξ ′p log( Prt ) + β ′p X hrt + ε hprt

where α p is a constant, η p the quasi-income elasticity of demand, C hrt nominal household
                                                                                   N

                                r
consumption expenditure, ξ p′ a vector of own and cross quasi-price elasticities of demand,
     r                                                          r         r
log( Prt ) the vector of regional prices relative to some base, X hrt and β p vectors of

demographic characteristics and their associated coefficients, and            ε hprt a mean zero idiosyncratic
household preference shock. I use the term quasi in describing the elasticities, because

       10
         In practice, I calculate urban/rural estimates for each country, and weight these by survey data on the
urban/rural household population shares to produce aggregate national estimates of product consumption levels. For
the most part, I use discrete choice models rather than linear regressions to calculate regional dummies and
educational demand coefficients, so that the estimated household ownership probabilities always lie between 0 and 1.
In addition, there is a variant of my procedure where I allow demand patterns to vary country by country (instead of
imposing common global patterns), which still allows me to calculate growth rates of real consumption, but not
levels. This is explained later in the paper.



                                                        14
log(Qhprt ) need not be actual log quantity demanded, but only some measure related to that

quantity, such as the index in a probability model or an outcome of food demand such as body

weight. Homogeneity of demand of degree 0 in expenditure and prices implies that the quasi-

income elasticity of demand equals the negative of the sum of the own & cross quasi-price

elasticities:

            (5) η p = −∑ ξ pq
                          q


Equation (5) holds even when Q is not strictly speaking quantity demanded, as anything

associated with that demand should, equally, have the same homogeneity of degree 0 property.

            To reformulate (4) in terms of real consumption, we add and subtract from nominal

expenditure the expenditure share weighted movement of prices from the base to produce
                                                      r         r
            (6) log(Qhprt ) = α p + η p [log(Chrt
                                              N
                                                  ) − Θ′rt log( Prt )]

                                      + η p [Θ′rt + ξ ′p / η p ] log( Prt ) + β ′p X hrt + ε hprt
            r
where Θ rt is a vector of regional product expenditure shares.11 The second term on the right-

hand side is real expenditure, while the third term can be thought of as a region x time error term:
                                                                       r       r r
            (7) log(Qhprt ) = α p + η p log(C ) + η pε    R
                                                          hrt
                                                                       P
                                                                       prt   + β ′p X hrt + ε hprt
                              r         r
where the superscript P on ε prt
                             P
                                 is used to emphasize the role relative prices play in determining
                                  r         r
this error term. Clearly, Θ and ξ p / η p are vectors whose components sum to one and negative

one, respectively, so that when added they sum to zero. Consequently, uniform inflation drops

out of the regional error term which, when normalized by the quasi-income elasticity, is a zero-



       11
         These are actual product expenditure shares and not quasi in any way, but, as will be seen, there is no need
to actually ever compute them



                                                                15
weight average of relative price changes; something that, arguably, is homoskedastic across

products and has an expected value of zero.

            Household real consumption expenditure per adult can reasonably be thought of as being

proportional to permanent income per adult, which in turn is related to educational attainment:
                     R
            (8) log(Chrt ) = α rt + log(YhrtR )                 log(YhrtR ) = log(YrtR ~ E ) + RE Ehrt

where Ehrt is the average years of educational attainment of adult household members, RE is the

return to a year of education, and log(YrtR ~E ) is education adjusted log regional real income at

time t. It follows that average regional log household consumption expenditure at time t is given

by:

            (9) log(CrtR ) = log(CrtR ~ E ) + RE Ert

where Ert is mean regional household educational attainment and log(C rt ) = α rt + log(Yrt )
                                                                      R~ E                R~ E



is education adjusted log regional real expenditure per adult.12 Average log country expenditure

is the population weighted sum of log regional real expenditure:

            (10) log(CctR ) =      ∑S
                                  r∈r ( c )
                                              rt   log(CrtR )

where r(c) is the set of regions in country c and the Srt are the regional population shares.

Regions can be defined at any level that allows consistent aggregation across time, and in my

case will consist of the urban and rural areas of each country

            Finally, I assume that real consumption expenditure is growing at an average rate g, so

that real household consumption in country c at time t can be written as:

            (11) log( C ctR ) = log( C cR ) + g t + g c t + ε ct

       12
         Clearly, savings rates are allowed to vary across regions and time (note αrt in (8)), but there is the implicit
assumption that savings rates out of permanent income do not vary by educational attainment. This allows me to
estimate the relative real consumption expenditure of educational categories using data on their relative incomes.



                                                                16
                                                                                            R
where gc represents the deviation of the country's growth rate from the average g and log(C c )

equals log relative consumption in the base year, which in my analysis will be the year 2000.

Uncovering the base year levels log(C cR ) and average growth rate g of real country log

consumption is the fundamental objective of my analysis.

            (b) Estimation

            Estimation proceeds in two steps. In the first step, I combine all of my surveys to

estimate household demand equations, product by product, of the form
                                                   r r
            (12 ) log(Qhprt ) = a prt + b p Ehrt + c p′ X hrt + ehprt

where log(Qhprt) will usually be the index in a discrete choice probability model or otherwise the

log of some measurable continuous outcome, and where the aprts are a complete set of product

specific region x time (equivalently, survey13) dummies. Under the assumptions laid out above,

asymptotically the coefficient estimates converge to the following values:
                                     r     r                                                    r
            (13) bˆp = η p RE       cˆ p = β p         aˆ prt = α p + η p log(CrtR~ E ) + η pε prt
                                                                                               P


                                                   r
While the unconditional expectation of           ε prtP , the influence of relative prices, is zero, it takes on
particular values within any particular product x region x time grouping and ends up being

incorporated into the dummies.

            Next, I construct measures of log real regional consumption as implied by the

consumption of a particular product by dividing the product x region x time dummy by the

coefficient on educational attainment, adding the survey estimate of average regional educational

attainment, and multiplying by a separately estimated return to education:




       13
         In practice, I assign a common date (equal to the mean household survey date) to all observations within a
particular country survey. Thus, the t’s in the equation above are really country survey dates.


                                                           17
                                     aˆ          
           (14) log(Cˆ prt
                       R
                           ) = Rˆ E  prt + Eˆ rt 
                                     bˆp        
Weighted using the regional household population shares, these measures produce a panel dataset

of country mean log consumption measures, as implied by the different product consumption

equations:

           (15) log(Cˆ pct
                       R
                           )=     ∑S
                                 r∈r ( c )
                                             rt   log(Cˆ prt
                                                         R
                                                             )

These estimates are then projected on product and country dummies, time entered separately for

the sub-Saharan African and non sub-Saharan African countries, and a series of random shocks

designed to improve econometric efficiency:

           (16) log(Cˆ pct
                       R
                           ) = a p + ac + g A t A + g ~ A t~ A + vc t + v p t + u pc + e pct + eˆ pct

In (16), having removed variation in mean product consumption levels with the product constants

ap,14 I use ac to estimate log(C cR ) , the relative country consumption level in the base year (2000),

and gA and g~A to estimate the mean African and non-African consumption growth rates. The

random coefficients vc and vp explicitly allow growth to vary across countries and, due to relative

price trends, across product types, while the random effect upc takes into account the fact that

relative price differences will result in persistent differences in product consumption levels across

countries. Each random shock is independently drawn at the level of its subscript(s). Thus, vc is

an independent draw from a zero-mean normal distribution affecting the growth of country c,

while upc is an independent draw from a zero-mean normal distribution affecting the level of

consumption of product p in country c The regression residual variation has two components:

      14
       This is unnecessary for a balanced panel, but is important for unbalanced panels as otherwise mean
worldwide product consumption levels have a spurious influence on the estimates of relative country aggregate
consumption.




                                                                 18
                                             R
(a) the residual variation of the true log(C pct ) after accounting for the components modeled on the

right-hand side, e pct ; plus (b) the additional variation introduced by the use of the estimate

log(Cˆ pct
       R              R
           ) of log(C pct ) as the dependent variable, ê pct .

        By explicitly stating the likelihood I can provide the reader with a fuller description of the

role played by the different components in (16). Under the assumption that all of the errors and

random shocks are normally distributed, the probability the sample is observed is given by

                    exp[−.5(Y − Xβ )′Ω −1 (Y − Xβ )]
       (17) L =                                                   where Ω = Σ(RS) + Ι × σ[e pct ]2 + Σ̂(FS)
                                (2π )   N /2
                                               Ω
                                                   1/ 2




and where Y is the Nx1 vector of observations log(Cˆ pct
                                                     R
                                                         ) , X is the Nxk matrix of regressors

consisting of product and country indicator variables and time entered separately for the African

and non-African countries, and β is kx1 made up of the coefficient vectors ap and ac, plus gA and

g~A. The covariance matrix Ω is made up of three components: (1) Σ(RS), the covariance across

observations created by the random shock vct + vpt + upc, which will depend on the standard

deviations of the component processes, σ[vc], σ[vp] and σ[upc]; (2) Ixσ[epct]2, the orthogonal
                                                                   R
variation stemming from the residual orthogonal variation in log(C pct ) ; and (3) Σ(FS), the

covariance across observations stemming from the covariance in the estimation error

log(Cˆ pct
       R
           ) − log(C pct
                     R
                         ) . The log likelihood is maximized with respect to β, σ[vc], σ[vp], σ[upc] and

σ[epct]. Σ(FS) is fixed and is calculated from the first step covariance matrices.15


       15
          As shown in (15) and (14), log(Cˆ pct ) is computed as the ratio of normally distributed variables. In
                                           R


calculating the distribution of non-linear functions of normal variables, it is customary to make use of the "delta
method", an application of the central limit theorem. However, even the central limit theorem has its limits. As the
probability mass around zero of the random variable in the denominator increases, the central limit theorem breaks
down, the most notable example of which is the well known result that the ratio of two independent standard normal
variables follows a cauchy distribution, which doesn't even have any moments. Thus, in precisely the cases where I
want to place the least weight on a variable (because the estimate of bp has a substantial probability mass around
zero), the delta method will be a poor guide to Σ(FS). I handle this problem by using Monte Carlo techniques to
estimate Σ(FS), generating 100,000 draws from the estimated joint distribution of the aprts and bp in each product


                                                          19
            Maximization of (17) with respect to β produces the standard GLS estimate of the

coefficient vector as a weighted average of the X and Y observations:

            (18) βˆ = ( X ′ Ω −1 X ) −1 X ′ Ω −1Y

In this case, the weighting has two components. First, there is the weighting imposed by the

random shocks. Thus, for example, to the extent σ[vc] and σ[vp] are found to be large, in

estimating gA and g~A less than one-for-one weight will be placed on countries or products with

relatively large numbers of time series observations, reflecting the fact that, because of the

covariance of growth within countries or products, large samples for a given country or product

provide less information than equivalent samples drawn across countries or products. Similarly,

if σ[upc] is found to be large, less than one-for-one weight will be placed on large numbers of

product x country observations in estimating the product and country means ap and ac.16 Given

the highly unbalanced nature of my panel, these adjustments could have a large effect on the

coefficient estimates if there is a great deal of variation in growth rates and levels by sub-sample

size. In practice, they do not, as shown further below.

            The second component of weighting in (18) involves the covariance matrix of the first

step estimates of log(Cˆ pct
                         R
                             ) , Σ(FS). If one orders the observations product by product, one sees

that this covariance matrix is largely17 block diagonal, made up of the product specific matrices

Σp(FS). The inverse of a block diagonal matrix is itself block diagonal. Thus, Y-XB deviations



equation and then calculating the resulting mean and variance of the ratios, to which I then add the covariance matrix
of the estimated mean educational attainment by region.
       16
            Appendix B provides some mathematical exposition to back up this intuition.
       17
             Since the components apct and bp are estimated product by product (i.e. independent variables are entered
separately for each product), the maximum likelihood estimate of their covariance matrix is block diagonal.
 Log (Cˆ pct
         R
             ) also depends on the estimate of mean regional attainment Ert, which is common to all products. However,
the estimated variance of Ert is tiny relative to the product specific components.

correspondingly small weight on those observations.18 log(Cˆ pct

regional dummies apct to the education Engel coefficients bp (see equation 14). Since, absent

other regression components, regional dummies are generally estimated quite accurately in large

samples, this covariance matrix is large primarily when the consumption-education relation is

weak. Thus, as in the case of the simple example of the previous section,19 my estimates place

more weight on products where the estimated relationship between education and consumption is

stronger. As shown further below, this weighting is extremely important as absent this

adjustment average growth rates are found to be 4.7 and 7.2 percent for the non-African and

African economies, respectively.

            Finally, I should note that when comparing individual country levels to PWT levels, I

estimate the country levels ac as fixed effects, as described above. However, the standard

deviation of a set of point estimates is inflated by estimation error. Consequently, when I seek to

describe the standard deviation of country levels to compare with the same statistic from PWT, I

estimate the country levels as random effects uc with standard deviation σ[uc]. This choice of

specification has a negligible effect on the other coefficients estimated in the regression.




       18
         The reader will recognize that for heuristic purposes I am acting as if [Σ(RS)+Iσ[epct]2+Σ(FS)]-1 = Σ(RS)-
1
 +I/σ[epct]2+Σ(FS)-1. This is, of course, not true, so the description in the text literally applies only when the other
components are removed from the model, i.e. ignoring interactions between the component matrices. In the case of
this paper, the presence of Σ(RS) does not really affect the estimates so the interactions between the random shocks
and estimation accuracy weighting are, indeed, unimportant.
       19
         In that simple example, I focused on the calculation of a mean across product observations for a single
country. With each product estimated separately, that produced a diagonal covariance matrix, allowing me to use
simple algebra to discuss the individual product likelihoods. My actual estimates involve calculations for groups of
countries in an unbalanced panel, combined with random shocks across products and countries, all of which
produces the more complicated matrix algebra discussed above. The intuition, however, is the same.

V. Results: The Standard Deviation & Growth Rate of Living Standards

       (a) The Return to Human Capital

       As a preliminary, I use DHS data on individual earnings from work to calculate the return

to education. I focus on individuals 25 or older, whose education can be taken as completed,

reporting earnings from working for others (i.e. not for family or self). I find earnings data of

this sort for adult women in 26 DHS surveys in 14 sub-Saharan African and 10 other countries,

and for adult men in a sub-sample of 16 of these surveys in 11 sub-Saharan countries and 5 other

countries (see Appendix A). I run the typical Mincerian regression of log wages on educational

attainment, age, sex and regional controls.

       As shown in Table IV, the OLS estimate of the return to human capital is somewhat

sensitive to the number and level of regional controls. While column (1) includes the most basic

controls, a dummy variable for the nominal level of wages in each survey, column (2) includes

survey x rural/urban controls. Doubling the number of geographical controls in this fashion

lowers the return to a year of education from 11.5 to 10.8 percent. Adding random effects at the

cluster level (column 3) lowers the marginal return further, while fixed effects at the cluster level

(column 4) bring it down to 9.5 percent. These results can be rationalized by arguing that rich

people tend to live together in rich places, i.e. regions and locales (such as urban centers) which

provide higher earnings for any given level of education. As more detailed geographical controls

are introduced, the return to education is increasingly identified from within locale differences in

educational attainment and incomes, rather than cross regional income differences. However, it

is also important to note that more detailed geographical controls increase the noise to signal ratio

in educational attainment, biasing the coefficient towards zero. This is particularly relevant for

the estimates with cluster fixed effects, as these dummies account for 58 percent of the residual

(orthogonal to the individual controls) variation in individual educational attainment.

            Column (5) of Table IV controls for measurement error in individual educational

attainment by instrumenting it with the mean educational attainment of other adult members of

the same household, as well as their mean age, age2 and sex.20 As shown, when instrumented,

the estimated return on human capital jumps to 11.6 percent. When compared with the

coefficient for column (4), this suggests that measurement error accounts for about .19 of the

residual variation in individual educational attainment in that specification.21 This implies a

measurement standard error of about 1.6, i.e. that about 32 percent of the wage reporting sample,

with mean educational attainment of 9.5 years22 over or understate their educational attainment



       20
         The absolute values of the t-statistics of these four variables in the first stage regression are 45.1, 4.1, 5.7
and 6.1, respectively.
       21
         The education coefficient of column (4) using the sample of column (5) is 9.40. Divided by column (5)'s
coefficient of 11.60 this indicates a signal to signal plus noise ratio of .81. The measurement standard error reported
in the next sentence equals the square root of .19 times the variation in education orthogonal to the other controls.
       22
         The wage reporting sample is considerably better educated than the average for the adult men and women in
the male & female survey modules from which the data come (5.1 years). Most of this selection has to do with
working for others, rather than working per se. Thus, the average educational attainment of adults who report they
are working is 5.4 years, while the average educational attainment of adults who report earnings data, whether
working for themselves or others, is 6.7 years. If I rerun the specification of column (5) using all adult individuals
reporting earnings from work (including, presumably, capital income) I get an education coefficient of 13.6. Thus, a


                                                            23
by 1.6 years or more. This is large, but by no means implausible. Adjusting the coefficient of

column (2) by this estimate of measurement error produces a point estimate of an "attenuation

bias adjusted" return to education of 12.5 percent in that column. When compared with column

(5)'s point estimate, this indicates that although measurement error is a concern there is also

substantial correlation, below the urban/rural level, between individual's incomes and the

education-adjusted income level of the locales they live in.

            In what follows, I will take 11.6 percent as my "known" estimate of RE. Psacharopolous

(1994) in his oft cited survey of Mincerian regressions, finds an average marginal return of 13.4

percent in 7 studies of sub-Saharan Africa and 12.4 in 19 studies of Latin America and the

Caribbean, regions which, together, make up 3/4 of the countries in my sample. Thus, the

number I use is not particularly large or out of keeping with the existing literature.23 Readers

who have strong alternative priors can scale all of the growth rates and cross-national standard

deviations of real expenditure reported below by the ratio of their preferred number to 11.6.

However, it would take an enormous reduction in the estimated return to education, to around 3

percent, to bring the DHS-implied African growth figures in line with international estimates.


broader sample with a broader measure of income produces a higher estimate of RE and hence implies a greater
discrepancy between the DHS and international measures of growth.
       It would be nice to implement selectivity bias adjustments to correct for selection into employment.
However, these are difficult to implement meaningfully in a Beckerian framework in which family economics is part
of household demand, so that traditional labour market selection instruments like marital status and pregnancy are
seen to be correlated with the relative productivity of the individual in the household and in the market.
Nevertheless, just to report what the standard selectivity adjustments produce, I have proceeded blindly, augmenting
the earnings equation with separate male and female selection equations, including variables such as marital status,
current pregnancy (of a woman or a man's partner), and births in the past year, estimating (in an MLE framework)
separate correlations between the disturbance terms for these male/female equations and the earnings equation. I
consider two possible cases: (1) selection into participation/employment alone, whether working for others or not
(with the wage equation focusing only on those working for others, this being taken as random conditional on
employment); (2) selection into reporting wage earnings working for others. Working on the specification of column
(2), which is the easiest to implement in this framework, I find that the coefficient falls from 10.8 to 10.7 in the first
case and rises to 12.0 in the second.
       23
        In a later section I allow RE to vary by region and find that it is systematically higher in sub-Saharan Africa,
which raises the estimated growth for that region.

      Note: The reported number is the coefficient (standard error) on household mean adult educational
  attainment in years, with each equation including a complete set of country x survey x region (urban/rural)
  dummies and the following controls: (1) consumer durables & housing: log number of persons in the
  household; (2) children's health: sex, log(1+age in months) and log(1+age in months) squared (for all but
  height, weight and mortality, which are quite linear in log(1+age)); (3) household economics: age and age
  squared, as well as sex for education attendance variables (all others refer to women alone). Y elasticity is the
  income elasticity, as explained in the footnote in the text. Each equation is estimated separately.



Moreover, such a reduction would produce new puzzles, as it would imply very low growth

outside of Africa and an extremely small cross-country variation in living standards.

            (b) First Step Estimates

            Table V above reports the coefficients on household mean years of adult educational

attainment in product by product demand equations, estimated with country x survey x

urban/rural dummies and the household and individual demographic controls noted in the table.

With the exception of log weight, height and rooms per capita, the figures are the coefficients in a

logit discrete choice model with the implied quasi-income elasticities evaluated at the sample

mean probability.24


       24
         For the ln variables (weight, height and sleeping rooms), the implied income elasticity is β/RE, where β is
the coefficient. For the logit dichotomous variables, the elasticity of the probability with respect to real income is
β(1-P)/RE, where P is the mean sample value (Table I).



                                                           25
           For our purposes, the main relevance of Table V is that it establishes that each of the real

consumption variables used in this paper is significantly and substantially related to real income,

as measured by years of education. Across the different products, none of the coefficients is even

close to being insignificant at the 1% level. The income elasticities, coupled with the standard

deviation (s.d.) of mean household adult education (4.5 years) and implied s.d. of predicted log

incomes (4.5*.116 ≈ .5), produce substantial variation in predicted outcomes. Thus, a one s.d.

movement in educational attainment produces a log 28 percent higher relative probability of

owning a radio (mean value of .573 - see Table I) and a log 68 percent higher probability of

having a flush toilet (.323). Given the early age of the subjects (0-35 months), children's weight

and height move relatively less, an average of 3 and 1 percent, respectively, with a s.d. movement

in educational attainment, but are, nevertheless, very significantly correlated with household

incomes. The cumulative probability of survival for the average 0 to 35 month year old (mean

value of .930) rises 2 percent with a s.d. movement in predicted incomes, a small apparent

movement, but actually an implied fall in average cumulative mortality from .07 to .05. The

probability children and youths are in school rises 25 percent (mean value of .712) and 42 percent

(.340) with a s.d. movement in incomes, while the probability a young woman is working (.412)

or ever-married (.431) falls by 8 percent and 14 percent, respectively.

           (c) The Growth and Standard Deviation of Real Consumption

           Table VI below estimates the growth and standard deviation of living standards in my

sample of African and non-African countries. I begin by establishing, as a benchmark, the Penn

World Tables & United Nations national accounts measures of consumption growth and relative

levels.25 The two data sources are broadly in agreement, suggesting a non-African growth rate of

      25
       To make the results comparable with what follows, these estimates are based upon the 135 country x year
combinations present in my 1990-2006 DHS data.

        Notes: The u terms represent random effects allowing for variation in country and country x product levels,
 the v terms represent random variation in country and product growth rates, and e represents the error term. The
 subscripts denote the index across which the random shock or error applies (e.g. vc is random variation in country
 growth). The PWT and UN regressions do not include random product level and growth variation because the
 dependent variable is a national GDP aggregate. σ[.] represents the estimated standard deviation of the relevant
 random effect or error. PWT uses PPP measures of real consumption and the UN measures are in constant market

 assigning a weight of .5 to persons under 15. DHS measures incorporate the first step covariance matrix into the

just over 2 percent, a sub-Saharan growth rate of around 1 percent, and a standard deviation of

living standards across countries in 2000 (the base year) of between .7 and .8.26 As shown in the

lower left hand panel of the table, the DHS product data are consistent with a comparable


       26
         This is not surprising as, given the benchmark levels of expenditure, PWT extrapolates international dataset
measures of growth by GDP component, while the UN database, despite being nominally at market exchange rates,
makes ad hoc PPP adjustments to levels (as reported at http://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/formulas.asp, in the case of
economies with volatile price levels and exchange rates, an adjustment is made using relative domestic/US inflation
rates back to "the year closest to the year in question with a realistic GDP per capita US dollar figure").

standard deviation of living standards in 2000 (.713), but suggest a non-African growth rate of

3.8 percent and a sub-Saharan growth rate of 3.4 percent, the latter being three and a half times

that reported by the PWT and UN. When the DHS data are examined product group by product

group, we find greater sub-Saharan growth in durable goods (5.6 percent) and lower growth in

housing (1.8 percent), but even this measure is still double that of the international sources. The

consumption growth implied by health and family economics is slightly below the average for all

product groups. Hence, my results do not stem from the fact that I use a concept of consumption

that is broader than the typical national accounts measure.27 Finally, I note that the standard

deviation of living standards is substantially higher in housing, but the overall dispersion of these

measures by product group is not grossly inconsistent with the PWT aggregates.

            Figure II graphs the DHS point estimates of relative consumption levels in 2000 (the base

year) against the comparable estimates from the PWT. For the purposes of comparison, I show

data from PWT 6.2, the earliest to contain 2000 data for all my economies, and the latest PWT

7.0, which incorporates significant updates based upon the 2005 ICP worldwide detailed study of

prices. Several facts stand out. First, the most recent version of PWT contains a massive

downward revision of the relative consumption of Zimbabwe, producing a huge discrepancy with

my DHS estimate. In a hyperinflationary economy small differences in the timing of the

measurement of nominal expenditure and price levels can produce extraordinary errors, and I

would be inclined to favour my DHS estimates or, if necessary, the earlier PWT calculations.

Second, my DHS estimates are systematically higher than the PWT for the former centrally

planned economies which, because the material product system didn't measure non-material




       27
         Restricting my measure to durables and housing together, I get non-African and African growth rates of 4.3
(.009) and 4.1 (.009) percent, respectively.

sectors such as services, tend to underestimate GDP.28 Excluding Zimbabwe and the former

centrally planned economies, the correlation between the DHS and PWT 7.0 relative level

estimates for the year 2000 is .902. In PWT 7.0 the sub-Saharan economies are on average 97%

poorer than the non-African countries. My DHS estimates return a similar log gap of .98.29

            Figure II illustrates a third significant fact. Between PWT 6.2 and PWT 7.0 there is a

strong convergence towards my DHS calculations, as evidenced by the tighter fit around a 45o

line in the second panel. Much of this stems from the fact that no benchmark study of prices

existed for many of the countries in PWT 6.2. Regressing the change in the estimate of relative

consumption between PWT 6.2 and PWT 7.0 on the difference between the PWT 6.2 and my

DHS estimates of relative consumption, I get a coefficient of -.47 (-.39 without Zimbabwe). If,

however, I restrict attention to the 16 economies for which no benchmark study of prices existed

in PWT 6.2 (which does not include Zimbabwe), I get a coefficient of -.66. As the PWT has

developed actual data on prices for some of its economies, and improved the estimates of the

others with the detailed 2005 ICP, its estimates of living standards in the year 2000 have

converged to those I derive from the DHS. The PWT estimates of growth in the poorest regions

of the world, however, remain dependent upon the largely fabricated historical series of GDP



       28
         Thus, in the case of China, the example I am most familiar with, as surveys have been initiated to cover
previously unmeasured sectors there have been large upward revisions of GDP. I should also note that this
discrepancy is not due to my use of non-traditional consumption measures such as health and family economics. The
average gap between the DHS and PWT estimates of the relative GDP of the 7 former CPEs in Figure I is 62%. If I
recalculate the DHS estimates without health and family economics, it actually rises to 71%.
       29
          Some readers have queried whether this, coupled with my estimates of African growth, does not imply
implausible poverty in Africa prior to the base year 2000. In response, I ask that the following facts be kept in mind:
(1) the gap between the highest and lowest log country consumption per equivalent adult in 2000 in PWT 7.0 is 5.0,
or 3.5 if restricted to the 56 countries I study; (2) PWT 6.2 showed a log gap of .69 in the base year, thus the PWT
revision alone moved relative African incomes down by almost 30 percent; (3) My analysis is for 1990-2006, so all I
am arguing is that rather than losing 1% per annum from 1990 to 2000 relative to the other LDCs in my sample (as
suggested by PWT & UN) Africa kept pace with them; (4) In an absolute sense I am reporting .34 growth for Africa
from 1990 to 2000 as opposed to the .11 indicated by PWT 7.0. In sum, compared to the differences within and
across versions of PWT the relative and absolute movements I am talking about are quite small.

growth circulated by international agencies.30

           Since the key discrepancy between my results and international sources lies in the growth

rate, in Table VII I summarize this aspect of the DHS data by reporting the consumption growth

estimated by simply regressing the real consumption levels implied by each DHS product (see

equation (15) earlier) on time trends and country dummies. These numbers highlight two aspects

of my results and methodology. First, the average sub-Saharan product growth rate, at 6.9

percent, is higher than the average non-African product growth rate of 5.0 percent, suggesting




      30
         There has been a slight upward revision of growth rates between PWT 6.2 and PWT 7.0, as the analysis of
the upper half of Table VI produces slightly lower growth rates using PWT 6.2 data (e.g. growth of 1.7 percent
outside of sub-Saharan Africa and 0.9 percent within sub-Saharan Africa using consumption per equivalent adult).
This should represent revision of national accounts measures, and not PWT PPPs, as the PWT measures of GDP by
component (e.g. consumption) simply involve extrapolating levels in the benchmark year using national accounts
growth rates. Thus the inconsistency in PWT growth rates produced by the reweighting of GDP components in each
new benchmark highlighted by Johnson et al (2009) is not relevant here.

that overall African consumption growth is at least on par with non-African growth.31 Second,

these numbers show that, in producing the estimates of Table VI above my method of weighting

by including the first step covariance matrix in the GLS likelihood systematically places a lower

weight on high growth outliers. This is further emphasized in the upper left hand panel of Table

VIII below, where I calculate the aggregate consumption growth implied by the DHS data using

the same random effects model specified in Table VI, but without the inclusion of the first-step

covariance matrix in the likelihood. In this (econometrically incorrect) specification, I find

average growth rates of 4.7 percent and 7.2 percent in the non-African and sub-Saharan countries,

respectively, and a much higher cross country standard deviation of .938 in the year 2000.

       31
         For the reader who notes it, I should explain that the large negative growth implied by the market
participation of young women comes from the fact that in the micro-data regression young women’s participation is
negatively associated with household educational attainment (i.e. young women in richer households are less likely
to be working and more likely to be in school), but the trend in the African sample is for rising market participation
by young women. However, neither the African nor the non-African trend in this regression is significant.



                                                            31
       Beyond estimation without the covariance matrix, Table VIII reports additional sensitivity

tests of the DHS results. In the second upper-left column, I estimate the baseline model without

the random effects for country x product consumption levels (upc) and without the random

variation in product and country growth rates (vp and vc). Relative to this panel, we see that the

baseline model (lower-left panel of Table VI) has slightly higher growth rates. As noted earlier,

the controls for random variation in product and country growth rates (vp and vc) reduce the

relative weight on products or countries with large numbers of observations, which could be

important in my unbalanced panel. Although the estimated standard deviations of these shocks in

the baseline model are quite substantial, the variation in growth rates by number of observations

is not large enough to make this re-weighting critically important.

       The third column in the upper panel of Table VIII reports the average growth rate and

estimated standard deviation estimated from the application of the jackknife to the data, i.e.

estimating the model 26 separate times, each time removing one product from the sample. The

mean jackknife point estimates and the jackknife estimate of their standard errors are incredibly

close to those of the baseline lower left hand panel of Table VI earlier. With different relative

price levels and trends, individual products will show unusually high or low levels and growth

rates, but this distribution, with the adjustment of the 1st step covariance matrix, looks to be about

what one expects from the normally distributed errors that underlie the specification of the

baseline model. The delete-1 jackknifed growth rates range from .036 to .039 for the non-

African economies and .030 to .036 for the African sample. This variation is smaller when

growth is estimated using local income elasticities, as shown in the next section.

       The fourth column in the top row of the upper panel of Table VIII provides an alternative

calculation of means and standard errors using the bootstrap. My estimation procedure involves




                                                 32
multiple steps, with the calculations from earlier steps appearing as dependent variables or

elements of the second step covariance matrices, while the survey data themselves are collected

in clusters which are, typically, stratified by region, so the usual estimates of standard errors

could be inaccurate.32 Consequently, I bootstrap and recalculate all of the results 250 times,

randomly sampling with replacement 135 surveys from my 135 surveys, randomly sampling the

clusters within each survey (stratified by urban/rural location), and randomly sampling 26 from

my 26 products. As shown in Table VIII, the resulting point estimates are close to those

calculated using the original data, but the standard errors are between 30 and 60 % larger than

those reported in the lower left hand panel of Table VI. The bootstrapped 95% confidence

intervals for the non-African and African growth rates are .025 to .051 and .022 to .049,

respectively. Given the enormous computational time involved, it is not possible to repeat this

procedure for all of the other estimates I shall report, but this gives some sense of the degree to

which the reported standard errors might be adjusted.33

            Columns five and six of the upper panel of Table VIII re-estimate the first-step product

demand equations using cluster random and fixed effects to explicitly allow for correlation in the

error terms for households within clusters. When estimated with cluster random or fixed




       32
        Given the complexities introduced by the sampling framework and the use of monte carlo estimates of the
covariance matrix based upon the first step estimates, the standard two step formulas (e.g. Murphy and Topel 1985 or
Hardin 2002) are not easily applied here. Outside of the bootstrap calculations, in all second step tables I report
standard errors based upon the inverse of the negative hessian, while the first step covariance matrices (used in the
monte carlo calculation of covariance matrices) use the sandwich adjustment for clustering.
       33
         Lest there be any confusion, I should clarify that the difference between the third and fourth columns of
Table VIII lies in the conceptualization of the sampling problem, and not in the jackknife vs. the bootstrap. The third
column provides a non-parametric estimate of the variability induced by the sampling of products, given the first step
estimates and the survey sample. The fourth column provides a non-parametric estimate of the variability induced
by the sampling of surveys, clusters and products. I could just as easily bootstrap the third column, drawing 250
samples of 26 products from my 26 products. This produces the coefficients (s.e.) .034 (.005), .034 (.005), and .729
(.081). The jackknife, however, allows me to report the sensitivity of the growth rate to the extremes of the product
growth distribution, as noted in the text.



                                                          33
effects34, the first step quasi-income elasticities (i.e. coefficients on educational attainment) fall,

implying that any movement in physical consumption levels is associated with greater real

consumption growth. Consequently, the estimates of the growth and standard deviation of living

standards are higher, as shown in the fifth and sixth columns of Table VIII. Although the cluster

effects are always significant35, it is not clear these estimates are an improvement on those found

ignoring cluster level correlations. First, as one tunnels down to the cluster level, the noise to

signal ratio in measures of household educational attainment rises, biasing the coefficients

towards zero. Thus, it is not clear whether the smaller estimates of quasi-income elasticities of

demand are more accurate representations of reality. Second, much of the correlation within

clusters in consumption represents, in fact, the outcome of demand (for communal infrastructure)

that is implicitly paid for through the cost of housing and land. To this extent, one would clearly

want to identify the quasi-elasticity of demand using between cluster, rather than within cluster,

variation. For these reasons, I treat estimates without adjustment for cluster random or fixed

effects as my baseline, as reported in Table VI earlier.36

            The lower panel of Table VIII explores the sensitivity of the results to alternative

specifications of the probability model used in the estimation of the 1st step demands for the



       34
          For the dichotomous variables, I use Butler & Moffitt's (1982) random effects specification, modeling the
random effect as normally distributed and using Gauss-Hermite quadrature to integrate the cluster joint logit
probability, while for fixed effects I use Chamberlain's (1980) conditional logit likelihood, implicitly differencing out
the cluster fixed effects (without actually estimating them) by evaluating the likelihood of a particular cluster
outcome conditional on overall cluster characteristics. As for both logit and regression the regional dummies cannot
be directly estimated with cluster fixed effects, I employ a two-step procedure: first, estimating the income elasticity
and demographic coefficients using cluster fixed effects, and then using these estimated coefficients as an offset in a
cluster random effects specification where I calculate the regional product dummies. The covariance matrix of the
regional dummies and the estimated income elasticity are adjusted for the two-step procedure.
       35
         The estimate of random cluster variation is always significantly different from zero, while a Hausman test of
fixed versus random effects always concludes in favour of fixed effects, i.e. that there is correlation between the
random effect and the independent variables.
       36
        In all tables, when I don’t have explicit cluster random or fixed effects I always adjust the first step
covariance matrix (which is then used in the second step mle) for clustering.



                                                           34
dichotomous (0-1) variables. The plot of the probit (normal) cumulative density is, when

rescaled, very similar to that of the logit, the weibull is asymmetric with somewhat fatter upper

tails, the gompertz is asymmetric with fatter lower tails, the cauchy fattens both tails

symmetrically, and the linear probability model produces thinner (zero) tails at the extremes of

the distribution.37 A fatter (thinner) tail means that changes in mean consumption levels in that

region are associated with bigger (smaller) movements in the index determining the probability.

Consequently, the gompertz and cauchy translate the observed movements in the low levels of

sub-Saharan product consumption into higher estimates of aggregate consumption growth, while

the weibull and linear model translate these movements into lower estimates of consumption

growth. To resolve these differences, I apply the semiparametric discrete choice model

developed by Gabler, Laisney and Lechner (1993), which uses a Hermite series expansion of the

cumulative density, a flexible form that can approximate all of the other distributions used in the

table.38 As shown in the last column of the lower panel of Table VIII, this produces estimates

that are just slightly below the baseline logit results of Table VI.


VI. Estimates Using Local Income Elasticities

            The analysis above imposes the strong assumption that the return to education and the

income response of demand is the same in all of the economies. Levels of development,

however, are likely to affect both the return to education and the income elasticity of demand for

particular products, while differences in local conditions and relative prices will not only

       37
          Since the weibull and gompertz are asymmetric, the specification of a “success” (e.g. cough or no cough)
affects the results. I adjust the measurement of the variables so that a success is associated with a positive quasi-
income elasticity in the gompertz and a negative elasticity in the weibull. Thus, for example, success for the health
variables is measured as no diarrhea, no fever, no cough, and child alive. Since the weibull and gompertz
distributions are mirror images of each other, the opposite scaling simply exchanges the two sets of results.
       38
        I set their k = 3, which results in the probability being the integral of a 6th order polynomial in XB times the
normal density for XB.



                                                          35
influence levels of demand (as allowed above) but also income elasticities. Although I have

explored a variety of functional forms, including semiparametric approximations, that translate a

given coefficient on household educational attainment into different elasticities of demand at

different levels,39 it is still possible that heterogeneity across the sample accounts for my results.

In particular, if the response of demand to educational attainment is systematically higher in sub-

Saharan Africa or the return to education is systematically lower, then the estimates reported

above will overstate African growth. In this section I address this concern by estimating demand

patterns country by country and the return to education within and outside Africa. While I find

heterogeneity across the sample, it is not systematically related to the results emphasized in this

paper, i.e. with local demand coefficients I still find African growth to be the equal of non-

African growth and close to four times as fast as reported in international sources.

            (a) Methods

            If one re-estimates the household demand equation (12) earlier above country by country,

the resulting measures of regional living standards will be given by:

                                       aˆ prt    
            (14)′ ln(Cˆ prt
                        Rc
                            ) = Rˆ Ec  c + Eˆ rt 
                                       bˆ p     
where the superscript c on the quasi-income elasticity and the return to education emphasizes that

these may now vary by country. These regional (i.e. urban/rural) measures can no longer be

meaningfully compared across countries. However, the growth of product consumption within a

country, translated into income equivalents with a constant country-specific income elasticity,

can still be examined. Thus, I use population weights to produce country level measures



       39
        Thus, for example, in the logit the elasticity of the purchase probability with respect to educational
attainment is (1-P)bp, where bp is the product coefficient on educational attainment and P is the expected probability
of purchase. Clearly, this falls as the consumption probability (level) rises.


                                                          36
      Rc
ln(Cˆ pct ) (as in (15) earlier) and study the growth of these measures in the random effects

regression:

        (16)′ ln(Cˆ pct
                    Rc
                        ) = a pc + g A t A + g ~ A t ~ A + vc t + v p t + e pct + eˆ pct

Relative to equation (16) earlier, I now introduce a complete set of product x country dummies

apc to account for the differing levels introduced by the country varying bpc , and make no attempt

to compare overall country levels of consumption.

       In the PWT a fixed set of international prices is used to weight local real expenditures,

producing estimates of relative real consumption through space and time. In a similar fashion,

the simplifying assumption of common international quasi-income elasticities of demand in the

previous section allowed me to translate product consumption levels into income equivalents that

could be compared internationally and intertemporally. In the national accounts, country specific

constant price indices are used to calculate growth. From a welfare theoretic perspective, these

produce more accurate measures of growth than the PWT (as the component real expenditures

are weighted by the prices faced by the economic actors), but the resulting level measures are no

longer comparable internationally. Similarly, in this section, in calculating the income equivalent

of product consumption using local income elasticities, I produce measures of local growth that

are theoretically (if not necessarily statistically) more accurate, but at the cost of no longer being

able to compare levels internationally.

       (b) First Step Estimates

non-African countries of log earnings from working for others on education and demographic

characteristics following the specifications described in Table IV earlier.40 As can be seen, the

return to education appears to be higher in Africa in all formulations. As before I instrument with

the educational attainment of other household members to control for measurement error, which

becomes an increasingly serious concern as additional local fixed effects are added. Comparing

the last two columns of the table, the proportional attenuation bias from measurement error

appears to be roughly the same for the two groups of countries, with an implied measurement

standard error of 1.5 in both cases. I take the IV specification, with an estimated return to

education of .139 in Africa and .103 outside of Africa, as the basis for my analysis.41




      40
         As I do not have wage data for many countries, it is not possible to calculate a separate RE for each country.
The Africa/non-Africa breakdown employed above follows the results emphasized in the paper.
           41
        As shown in the table, women appear to face a negligible discount in the labour market in sub-Saharan
Africa. This is a place where selectivity bias is likely to play a major role and, indeed, adjustments along this
dimension yield the expected results. When I estimate the wage equation formulation of column (2) jointly with a
labour participation equation using marital and pregnancy status as independent determinants of participation (as
described in the footnote associated with selectivity bias in Table IV), the woman's discount rises to 29% in Africa,
while remaining at 59% for the non-African economies. However, the educational income profile, at .135 and .098
within and outside Africa, respectively, is largely unchanged.

standard deviation estimated taking into account the 1st step standard errors of the coefficients on household
educational attainment.




            Table X describes the strong heterogeneity across countries in demand patterns. For each

product I regress the first-step country level coefficients on household educational attainment on

a constant. The figures reported in the table are the constant (mean country coefficient) and the

standard error of the regression (standard deviation of the coefficients).42 As can be seen, the

standard deviations are very large relative to the mean values of the coefficients, reflecting the

degree of heterogeneity. To cite just one example, while the demand for tap water is strongly

positively associated with educational attainment in the world as a whole (mean coefficient =

.091), it is quite negatively associated with educational attainment in the Dominican Republic

(coef. = -.10), where tap water is known to be contaminated.


       42
         Since the dependent variables are estimated, I incorporate their covariance matrix in the likelihood. Thus,
the constants are adjusted for weighting based upon the precision of each estimate and the standard error of the
regression is reduced by the MLE's recognition that part of the variation in the dependent variables is simple
estimation error.

        (c) Second Step Growth Results

        Table XI presents separate estimates of growth in the African and non-African economies

based on equation (16)'. It is immediately apparent that the considerable heterogeneity in

demand patterns described above has little effect on the results. Focusing on the baseline logit

formulation, African growth is now seen to be somewhat higher than previously estimated in

Table VI (.037 vs .034) and non-African growth somewhat lower (.034 vs .038). As before, the

growth rates of durables are higher than the average, while African growth is substantially slower

in housing. Growth in the non-traditional consumption measures, health and family economics,




                                                        40
is somewhat lower than the average, particularly outside of Africa, so these do not explain the

discrepancy with international measures of growth.43

           Turning to the results reported in the lower rows of the table, we see that estimates

without adjustment for the precision of the first step estimates are nonsensical (methodologically

and practically). The variation in the significance of first step estimates of the relationship

between product consumption and education at the country level is enormous and accounting for

this substantially re-weights the observations. In contrast, removing the adjustment for random

variation in product and country growth rates has little effect on estimated growth. The estimated

standard deviations of the product and country growth rates (σ[vp] and σ[vc]) for the African

(.017 and .012) and non-African (.018 and .013) economies in the upper-left hand cell of Table

XI are substantial, but this re-weighting has little effect as there does not appear to be much

systematic variation in growth rates by the number of observations within my unbalanced panel.

A product jackknife produces means and standard errors that are close to those estimated under

the baseline assumptions, showing once again that the covariance weighted product growth

distribution approximates the normal distribution assumed in the baseline model. The gap

between the slowest and fastest delete-1 jackknife growth rates is actually smaller than in

previous section, i.e. ranging from .032 to .035 for the non-African countries and from .036 to

.039 for sub-Saharan Africa. A bootstrap of all steps of the estimation process (surveys, clusters

and products) suggests that the true standard errors might be about 40 to 60 % as large as those

reported initially in the upper-left hand column of the table. The bootstrapped 95% confidence

interval is .023 to .045 for non-African growth and .024 to .050 for sub-Saharan growth. As

before, estimates with random and fixed effects yield higher average growth rates, alternative

      43
         Removing these and focusing on durables and housing alone raises the non-African growth rate to .042 and
the African growth rate to .038.



                                                       41
functional forms produce minor variation in the results, and a flexible hermite approximation

returns growth estimates which are close to those of the baseline model.

          All of these results follow the patterns reported in the previous section. There is, without

a doubt, considerable heterogeneity across countries in demand patterns, but this averages out

completely and does not eliminate the surprisingly high growth, particularly for sub-Saharan

Africa, indicated by the DHS data.


VII. Conclusion

          Demographic and Health Survey data on the consumption of consumer durables and

housing, children's health and mortality, the schooling of youth and the allocation of women's

time between marriage & childbirth and market activity, indicate that since 1990 real material

consumption in sub-Saharan Africa has been rising at a rate three and half to four times that

recorded by international data sources such as the PWT and UN, and on par with the growth

taking place in other regions of the world. This is a miraculous achievement, given that the very

real ravages of the AIDS epidemic have deprived families of prime working age adults, burdened

them with medical and funeral expenses, orphaned their school age children and directly and

adversely affected the health of their infants. And yet, the overall health and mortality of

children is improving, their school attendance is rising, and family consumption of a variety of

material goods is growing at a rapid rate. Notwithstanding these heartening trends, it is

important to keep in mind that the DHS data also indicate that Africa is much poorer than other

developing countries, with levels of log consumption 98 percent lower than those enjoyed by the

other developing countries in the DHS sample. For all its tragic difficulties, sub-Saharan Africa

is not being left further behind by the rest of the world. It remains, nevertheless, very much

behind.

IX: Appendix A: Demographic and Health Survey Data

       Table A1 below lists the DHS surveys used in the paper. The DHS survey codes
corresponding to the living standard variables listed in Table I above are ("hv" variables come
from the household file, all others from the women's file):
   Radio (hv207), television (hv208), refrigerator (hv209), bicycle (hv210), motorcycle (hv211),
   car (hv212), telephone (hv221), electricity (hv206), tap drinking water (hv201), flush toilet
   (hv205), constructed floor (hv213), sleeping rooms (hv216), weight (hw2), height (hw3),
   diarrhea (h11), fever (h22), cough (h31), alive (b5), attending school (hv121 or hv110 if
   unavailable), working (v714), gave birth past year (v209), ever married (v502).
All "don't know" or "missing" responses are dropped from the sample. Some variables are
recoded into broad dichotomous 0/1 categories as follows:
   Constructed floor: hv213 <= 13 (dirt/sand/dung) = 0, otherwise (cement/wood/tiles/etc) = 1.
   Flush toilet: hv205 < 21 (including septic tanks) = 1, otherwise (pit/latrine/bush/etc) = 0. Tap
   drinking water: hv201 < 21 (tapped or piped) = 1, otherwise (well/stream/lake/etc) = 0.
   Diarrhea, fever and cough in past 2 weeks: yes answers 1 or 2 coded as 1 (extra detail on last
   24 hours not universal across surveys and not used), no coded as 0. Gave birth past year: one
   or more births coded as 1, none coded as 0. Marital status: currently and formerly coded as 1,
   never coded as 0.
Conditioning/demographic variables (see Table V) are constructed as follows:
   Log number of household members (number of hvidx household records); young children's
   sex (b4) and age in months (v008-b3); youth's sex (hv104) and age (hv105); married women's
   age (v012).
Because of changes in the coverage of DHS survey questionnaires over time, samples are
restricted to generate consistent samples, as follows:
   Children's health variables: children aged 35 months or less (i.e. born within 35 months of the
   survey). Women’s fertility and work variables: currently married women only.

        For the wage regressions in Table IV, I restrict myself to female and male individuals
aged 25 to 65 reporting that they work for others (v719 or mv719 = 2, "m" denotes the male
questionnaire). Annual earnings are constructed from v736/mv736 data, with the earnings of
individuals reporting annual, monthly and weekly wages multiplied by 1, 12 and 50, respectively
(individuals reporting an hourly or daily wage, numbering about 1/5 of those working for others
and reporting wage data, are dropped from the sample). As I have painstakingly recoded all the
educational data for the household files, but have not done the same for the male and female
questionnaires, I get individual age and educational characteristics by merging the individual files
(which contain the earnings data) with the household files using the individual id numbers,
eliminating cases where the individual's sex does not match across the two files or there is a
discrepancy of more than 2 years in the reported age (roughly 7 percent of cases that meet the
other wage sample eligibility criteria).

        Employment, schooling and marital status pose special problems. On women's
employment, variation in the question form has dramatic effects on average responses. The
standard questionnaire first asks women if, apart from housework, they are currently working and
then follows up with a question that explains that women may work in a variety of ways (for cash
or in kind, selling things, in their businesses, on farms or in the family business) and asks the
respondent if she is currently doing any of these. The combination of these two questions form
the basis for DHS code v714. An occasional third question on whether the woman has done any
work in the past 12 months then produces v731. The problem is that many DHS surveys vary
this pattern, omitting the first or second of the two part v714 question, inserting the words "last
week" into one or both of these questions, omitting the preliminary v714 questions in their
entirety (but including the v731 question), and even modifying the questions to focus on working
for cash only. When compared across survey years for individual countries, these changes
produce very large variation in average employment rates. Consequently, I restrict my measure
to v714 and only those surveys where the two-part question is asked in its standard form.

        On schooling, some questionnaires ask whether the household member attended school in
the past year (hv121) and others whether the household member is currently in school or still in
school (hv110). The form of this question does not seem to be important, as the differences
within surveys where the two questions overlap and between surveys when the questions change
are small. Consequently, I take hv121 when it is available, and use hv110 as a reasonable
substitute when it is not. The main problems that arise in the educational data are that (1) in
some surveys individuals who, when questioned on educational attainment, say they have never


                                                       45
been to school are automatically coded as not currently attending school, whereas in other
surveys they are not; (2) the educational attendance question is generally restricted to individuals
6 to 24, but in some surveys the age range is further restricted, while those who were not asked
the question are automatically coded as not attending. I solve these problems by coding all
individuals whose educational attainment is listed as having never attended school as not
currently attending and, in cases where problem (2) arises for 6 year olds only, coding all 6 year
olds as missing. For the Indian surveys, problem (2) arises for individuals older than 14, 17 or 18
(depending on the survey), eliminating most of the 15-24 age group. Consequently, I eliminate
India from the sample for this variable. In the case of the few surveys with missing data for 6
year olds, I deem that the age controls and the existence of data for the remainder of youths aged
6-14 allow me to keep them in the sample.

        On marital status (never vs currently/formerly), this is reported in the women's question
module which, in some surveys, is restricted to ever-married women. To code never-married
women for these surveys, I begin by identifying the additional eligibility criterion for the female
survey (usually "slept last night", rarely "usual resident", but the two variables are extraordinarily
correlated). I then code all women in the household file meeting the additional eligibility
criterion who are also listed as "not eligible" for the women's questionnaire as "never married",
and merge these records with the marriage data from the women's question module. The marital
status of women who do not meet the additional eligibility criterion is uncertain (they are
excluded from the female survey even if they are married), so they are dropped from the marital
status sample.

         Finally, I turn to educational attainment. The DHS questionnaires ask respondents for
their educational attainment, measured as grade level achieved, not the number of years attended.
The DHS "recode" takes this raw data, converts it into a broad categorical variable (hv106 =
none, primary, secondary, tertiary), a measure of years at that level (hv107), and total years of
attainment (hv108). Unfortunately, the procedures used by programmers to generate these
conversions over the years have varied, with, for example, the number of years of education
falling in each hv106 category varying even within countries. Most fundamentally, there are
extraordinary errors and inconsistencies in reaching the final years of attainment (hv108), with, to
cite some examples, those responding "don't know", a code of 8 in many surveys, credited 8 years
of education; reaching tertiary education (not counting years there) being credited anything from
10 to 19 years base (sometimes, within the same country); upper secondary systems that require
10 formal levels to reach being coded as 6 years; etc. Working with the DHS questionnaires,
original "raw" non-recode data generously provided by the DHS programmers, and summaries of
educational systems and their history found on websites hosted by UNESCO,
education.stateuniversity.com, jstor, and the education ministries of different countries, I have
recoded all the educational attainment data to represent years of formal attainment within each
country's educational ladder, taking the level of entering 6 year olds as the starting point. In
cases where systems change over time (e.g. an old system primary lasted 6 years and a new
system primary lasts 8 years, so "completed primary" has different meanings), I use the timing of
institutional reform, an individual's birth cohort, and sample information on the distribution of
years of attainment by age group (e.g. those with uncompleted primary up to a certain birth
cohort indicate no more than 6 years) to impute an appropriate estimate of years of completed
education to different birth cohorts.

X: Appendix B: Random Variation and Observation Weights

       In equation (16) I allow for random variation in the level of consumption at the product x
country level (upc) and the trends of particular products or countries (vp, vc). In this appendix I
explain the claim in the text that these random shocks affect the weighting of observations in the
estimation of the product and country fixed effects ap and ac and the time trends gA and g~A.

       I begin by describing the solution to a standard problem. Consider the panel regression:
        (B1) Yit = X it β + ui Z it + ε it
where i denotes the panel data group and t the within group observation, ui is a group specific
shock multiplied by the variable Zit, and Xit, β and Zit are 1xk, kx1 and 1x1, respectively. The
covariance matrix for the Ti observations for group i is given by:
        (B2) Σ i = σ ε2 I Ti + σ u2 Z i Z i/
where ITi is the identity matrix of dimension Ti, and Zi is the column vector of Zit observations for
group i. Letting Xi and Yi denote the corresponding matrices of Ti observations for Xit and Yit,
following standard GLS results the maximum likelihood estimate of β is given by:
                                          −1                                    −1
                                                       ~ ~   ~ ~

                     ~                     ~
               where X i = Ω i−1 / 2 X i , Yi = Ω i−1 / 2Yi , Ω i−1 / 2 Ω i−1 / 2 = Σ i−1 and

                                                                                      .

        The dependent variable in (16) is indexed by three characteristics (product x country x
time) and there are multiple random shocks on the right hand side. Some intuition into how the
random shocks relate to the estimation of different coefficients can by arrived at by linking the
three characteristics to the standard i x t notation and considering segments of the problem in
isolation. With regards to the random effects upc, let i denote the product x country grouping and
t denote the time dimension, with Zit equal to the constant 1. Further, considering only the
estimation of either the country or product fixed effects (ac or ap), let X be the k mutually
exclusive 0/1 indicator variables for the product or country categories. Since the X variables are
orthogonal to each other, the cross-product matrices are diagonal and, applying (B3), we see that
the estimate of the coefficient for the kth group is given by:
                                               −1
                                                                                               σε
        (B4) βˆk =  ∑ (1 − θ i ) 2 Ti            ∑ (1 − θ i ) 2 ∑ Yit  with θ i = 1 − 2                  ,
                     i∈S ( k )                      i∈S ( k )     t∈S ( i )              (σ ε + σ u2Ti )1/ 2
where S(k) is the set of i (product x country) groupings appearing in category k and S(i) is the set
of t (time) observations for grouping i. The OLS estimate of the kth fixed effect equals (B4) with
θi equal to 0 for all i. As θi is larger for groups with a larger number of observations Ti, we see



                                                             47
that relative to OLS the GLS estimate places less than a one-for-one weight on observations from
larger groups. This explains my claim regarding the influence of upc on the country or product
fixed effects in equation (16) (ac and ap).

        Regarding the random variation in trends, vp and vc in (16), let i be the country or product
(respectively), t the cross of the remaining categories (i.e. product x time or country x time), and
Zit and Xit the year of the observation (say, yrit). Thus, in this case I am considering (B1) as a
univariate regression on a time trend (without a constant) with random variation across groups in
the trend. Applying (B3) we find that
                                                −1
                                                                                                            σε
    (B5) βˆ yr =  ∑ (1 − θ i ) 2 ∑ yrit2          ∑ (1 − θ i ) 2 ∑ Yit yrit  with θ i = 1 −                          1/ 2
                                                                                                                                  .
                   i             t∈S ( i )           i             t∈S ( i )                     2                    
                                                                                                     σ ε + σ u2 ∑ yrit2 
                                                                                                                t∈S ( i ) 
The OLS estimate of the time trend equals (B5) with θi equal to 0 for all i. If the magnitude of
the yr observations is roughly the same across i groups, the sum of their squares will be roughly
proportional to Ti, so θi will be larger for groups with more observations. Once again, we see
that relative to OLS the GLS estimate places less than a one-for-one weight on observations from
larger groups. This explains my claim regarding the influence of vp and vc on the estimation of
the time trends gA and g~A in equation (16).

        I introduce the random variation upc to allow for permanent differences in consumption
levels brought about by relative price differences, and the variation vp and vc to allow for the fact
that different products (because of global price trends) and countries have different trend growth
rates. In the actual estimation of (16) all of the random shocks and coefficients are estimated
simultaneously, which introduces interactions not explored in the equations above, but I believe
these examples provide some intuition as to how these effects influence the coefficient estimates.
