                                           ABSTRACT

       We examine the relationship between market structure and the persistence of U.S. dollar-
based sectoral real exchange rates for fourteen OECD countries. Our empirical results based on
disaggregated data suggest that differences in market structure significantly determine the rates at
which deviations from sectoral purchasing power parity decay. Specifically, industries with a larger
price-cost margin are found to exhibit slower parity reversion of their sectoral real exchange rates.
Further, as the degree of intra-industry trade activity increases, sectoral real exchange rate
persistence becomes more pronounced. These findings imply that an imperfectly competitive market
structure contributes to the well-documented persistence in real exchange rates.
