               FINANCIAL CAPACITY, RELIQUIFICAIION, AND PRODUCTION
               IN AN ECONOMY WITH LONG-TERN FINANCIAL ARRANCEMENTS


                                      ABSTRACT


     This paper characterizes     a multi-periodproduction economy in which

borrowers   and lenders enter long-term financial contracts.        A key feature is

that aggregate production and borrowers' capacity to absorb debt         -    their
"financial capacity"   -
                           are jointly determined   endogenous   variables,    in the

spirit of Gurley and Shaw (1955)       Expectations of future economic conditions

govern financial capacity, which in turn influences current capacity util-

ization.    Further, diaturbances   in the present may persist into the future

by influencing borrowers' net asset positions.        Finally, borrowers      may sub-

stitute future for current production by preserving their assets in hard

times, behavior akin to reliquification     as described    in Eckstein and Sinai

(1986).

1. Introduction.


       Understanding how small disturbances can          induce   large output fluctuations

is   an ongoing quest in macroeconomics. Recent work,             beginning with    Bernanke

(1983),   resurrects the view that financial       factors may play      a part.1    The

underlying     theoretical arguments evolve from extending agency theories of

finance to interternporal equilibrium settings.            Two related kinds of results

arise   relevant to explaining business fluctuations, First, mechanisms which
magnify the effects of exogenous disturbances on real activity may emerge as a

consequence of the agency problems.          Second, accelerator effects on investment

demand may arise because the agency costs introduce a wedge between the price

of internal and (uncollateralized) external finance.

       To keep the problem manageable, most of these analyses abstract from

settings where borrowers and lenders may enter ongoing relationships.                  This

feature Is    a   limitation, however.      It is well understood that gains often

exist from contracting over multiple periods.            Further, long—term arrangements

are characteristic of real—world financial markets.

       This   paper   presents a tractable intertemporal equilibrium model of

saving, investment and production, where borrowers and lenders are              free to
enter long—term agreements.         These contracts may be an arbitrary finite number

of periods in length.         Part of   the motivation   is to demonstrate that the

qualitative results        developed in settings with one—shot financial contracts

may. extend to environments where multi—period arrangements             are possible.      A

more important objective, however, is to demonstrate that this kind of

environment enriches the description of how real—financial interactions may

contribute to business volatility.

       In models of single—period contracting, the net stock of financial assets



1See Gertler      (1988)   for a survey.
                                         —2—



the   borrower begins with is typically a key determinant of the agency costs of

external finance.     Indeed, Sernanke and Gertler (1987,    1989) exploit this

relationship to motivate an investment—accelerator mechanisiu.2 An implication

of having multi-period financial relationships is that beliefs about future

economic conditions can affect current agency costs of finance, as well.           One

reason this possibility arises is that borrowers may offer as collateral

claims on future earnings.     As a net result, in the framework presented here,

output in any period depends positively on the ceiling level of indebtedness

that borrowers can absorb at the end of that period.        The ceiling, in turn,

depends on borrowers' collateralizable expected future profits, defined below.

This feedback between aggregate real activity and borrowers' financial

capacity is reminiscent of the arguments in Gurley and      5Mw (1956).
      A second type of behavior emerging here is that borrowers may adjust

production to self-insure against fluctuations in their wealth.          In

particular, they may cut back production by more than is essential during hard

times in order to preserve financial resources for future use.        The desire to

smooth wealth fluctuations may arise because accumulating wealth reduces

subsequent agency coats of finance.     Substituting future for current

production by preserving assets in bad times corresponds to "reliquification,

behavior which Eckstein and Sinai (1986) describe as important in amplifying

business downturns.

      Section 2 presents the basic setting, amulti—period production          economy

with borrowing and lending.    The   single period version of the   model is a

variant of Grossman and Hart (1983) and Farmer (1985),      frameworks   in which
asymmetric information   makes underemployment   possible in bad states of nature.

The setting differs from Leach (1988), who also allows for multiple production




2See Calomiris and Hubbard (1987) for a related theoretical analysis, and see
Fa.zzari, Hubbard and Peterson (1988) for empirical support.
                                              —3—



periods,   because long—term contracting is permitted.           The motivation and

details also      differ; here the concern is with financial contracts, whereas

Leach studies employment contracts.

       Section 3 presents a solution to the multi—period financial contracting

problem posed in section 2      ,   then   constructs and   analyzes equilibrium.     Using

insights   from Green (1987), a solution is found by collapsing the multi—period

contracting problem Into a (backward) recursive sequence of one period

problems which determine the borrower's end—of—current—period wealth as a

function   of   the period's state realization.      One difference from Green's

problem is that borrowers cannot consume negatively; another is that they have

finite horizons.       The upshot is that the long-term contract must satisfy a

 financial capacity constraint,' a ceiling on the borrower's interim

indebtedness that is needed to let her credibly guarantee her final wealth

will be non-negative.

       Overall, the environment is rigged so that in the absence of

informational asymmetries production each period depends only on current

economic conditions.       The agency problem not only increases the sensitivity of

the equilibrium to exogenous disturbances, it also introduces temporal

dependence.       Anticipated future economic conditions may affect current

production because they determine borrowers' current financial capacity, and

also   because they influence borrowers' gains from smoothing wealth
fluctuations. Current behavior persists Into the            future by affecting

entrepreneurial      wealth.
       Sections    2 and 3 illustrate the main arguments in a setting with          only   two

production    periods.    Section 4 demonstrates that the qualitative results of

the previous sections extend to the N period case.             It also discusses some

quantitative differences.       Section 5 provides concluding remarks.

2.   The Economic Setting

        This economy lasts for three periods, denoted zero, one and two.

Investment occurs in periods zero and one; production occurs in periods one

and two.        There are a countable infinity of people, all who live the entire

time.     Two kinds exist.         A fraction ip   are     "entrepreneurs' and   a   fraction       (l—ij)

are "lenders."        Entrepreneurs differ from lenders by having access to an

investment       technology described below. Both types care only about consuming
in the second period and are risk neutral. Each person thus maximizes the
expected value of her period two wealth.
        There    is one type of     commodity, which        is   perfectly divisible.     Every

person begins time with              units of it.         In each period except the last, two

options are available for allocating the commodity.                     First, one may store it

as inventory.        A unit stored in period t—l yields                 units in period            where
                                                                    r                         t,


the gross return              is exogenous.   Second, one aay convert the good into
                          r
capital for use in a risky technology that produces output in the subsequent

period.     In the last period, individuals simply eat the commodity.

        Each entrepreneur operates        a   "project" Cone project per entrepreneur)

which employs the risky technology.             All projects are identical cx ante and

work as follows: In period t—i, the entrepreneur installs capital for use in

period t.        Investing a unit of the endowment good at t—l yields                   units of

period t capital, which fully depreciate after one period's use.                        Let             be
                                                                                                   i1
the quantity of the endowment good invested at t-l and K                    the amount of period

t capital.        Then,



                                          K =                                                       C2. 1)




The   technology parameter            is deterministic, though it say differ            in value
across time.
        Output    in period t depends on a productivity disturbance                   and on the

quantity of capital employed in production.                          The random variable                is

independent and identically distributed over time and has the following

realizations of         across projects are mutually independent, implying there is

no aggregate risk (per project).

     Let qJ be project output in period one given that productivity state j

arises (j =    g,b);   quI period two output given that state j occurs in period

one and state k occurs in period two (k =                      g,b);    x    and            the

state—contingent       amounts of capital used as input in periods one and two,

respectively; and      K    the period two capital stock selected after state j

arises in period one.         Then the production technology is given by

The function   c()     is twice continuously differentiable, strictly increasing

and strictly convex, with c(0) = 0, c'(O) = 0, and c'(z)                               -*   w as z- =.

     Output in each period            is a strictly increasing and strictly concave

function of the quantity of capital Input.                          While the entrepreneur must select

the capacity level of capital before the productivity shock is realized —                                      It
takes time to install capital — she Is able to determine capacity utilization
                                              —6—


after this event.    Employing a unit        of   installed capital costs    c'()    units of

endowment at the margin, where c'() is increasing in the total quantity of

capital employed.    For this reason, the entrepreneur may choose to operate at

less than full capacity when the bad productivity state arises (see below). 3

       Assume further   that

                                         >   rio                                        (2.Sa)

                                                                                        (2.Sb)


Condition (2.6a) ensures that capital input is always higher in the good state

than in the bad, while (2.Sb) makes the incentive problem connected with

investment finance interesting (again,            see below).

       Information is structured as follows: The distribution of the project

specific productivity shock is common knowledge.                However, the realizations of

both      and project output each period are the private knowledge of the

respective entrepreneur.       On the other hand, investment and capacity

utilization each period are publicly observable.

       Lenders' behavior is simple to characterize.             They allocate their

period zero wealth between loans to entrepreneurs and inventory storage.                  They

repeat the process in period one and consume in the final period.

       The behavior of entrepreneurs     is more complex.         Let the random variable
—
    be the period two wealth of    a                                            Jk
                                       representative entrepreneur and        '.1    be her

period two wealth contingent on states j and k arising in periods one and two

respectively.    The entrepreneur's objective is to maximize



3The product ton costs could reflect the use of intermediate inputs or a
variable factor such as labor. The key feature of the technology is that it is
always optimal to use less input in the bad productivity state than in the
good one.

below).

        If the entrepreneur needs to borrow, she will enter into a financial

contract      with lenders in period zero.               In general, the contract will specify

the state—contingent         values of all the publicly observable variables over the

project's lifetime and the state-contingent payoffs for each party.                                Further,

an optimal contract will account for the possibility that the entrepreneur may

want to misreport the sequence of productivity states.                             The customary way to

address       this issue is to restrict attention to the class of contracts where

the entrepreneur has no incentive to lie.                       Let s(z) be the reported
                                                           —8—


productivity state for period t, given that state z was the true realization.

To induce truth—telling, the entrepreneur's payoff wsi(i)                         2(k)    from

misrepresenting any sequence of productivity outcomes (j,k) cannot exceed her

gain from honest reporting                w.        Thus, a constraint on the contract is that

       Another restriction is that the entrepreneur's final wealth in any state

cannot be negative:



                                                          a 0                                             (2.9)




The entrepreneur may be a net debtor in the interim time.                          This differs from

single period contracting, where accounts are settled immediately at the end
of each period.                Debts may be rolled over under long—term contracting.                     The

maximum amount will depend on beliefs about the entrepreneur's                            future project

returns, as discumsed below.

       All individuals act competitively.                        Think of each entrepreneur as picking

a contract in period zero to offer lenders.4                          Formally, the contract maximizes

the entrepreneur's expected wealth (eq.(2.6)) subject to eqs.                            (2.1) —     (2.5)
and (2.7) —          (2.9),      and to the feasibility requirement that physical quantities

                                                                                     Jk
such   as output be non—negative.                   The decimion variables are W          ,   K,   i,
                                                                                                          j

                                                                                                         K2,

i1,   qJ , qJk   ,   xJ   ,   and yJk
                                    ,   for   j =   g,b   and k = g,b.

       Once a solution to the contracting problem is found,                       it is       easy to

characterize the intertemporal competitive equilibrium.                          Since each

entrepreneur is identical cx ante, each chooses the same contract.                                 All



4One
     could introduce the fiction of competitive intermediaries facilitating
loans between entrepreneurs and lenders. Since these institutions would earn
zero profits and would not use any resources, the analysis that follows can
still proceed safely without reference to them.

contracts therefore assign the same state—contingent values for project output

and Investment.      Thus,     f         denotes per capita output in period t then the

weak law of large numbers implies,


                                     =
                                         1L   irq + r(W0   -   ji)                            (2. iQa)

                                                                     i)                       (2. lOb)
                                     kj                        J




In both eqs.     (2.lOa) and (2.lOb), the two terms on the right are per capita

output from project investment and inventory storage respectively.

       When informational asymmetries are absent, the only connection between

and        is that output in the first period affects the quantity               of'   storage in

the second.      There is no interdependency between period one and period two

output from investment.             This Is because capital depreciates after one

                                                                            The presence of
period's use and because productivity shocks are i.l.d..

informational asymmetries changes the situation.                     At the aggregate level,

first period output depends on the perceived state of the economy In period

two.       In turn, second period output (including output from project Investment)

depends on the performance of the economy In period one.                     The sections that

follow derive and elaborate these results.



3. Eqi.zlllbriuzn Under The Optimal Financial Contract

       The way to solve the long—term contracting problem posed In section 2 is

to apply the logic of dynamic programming.                 Following Green (1987), Imagine

                                                                                  asset position
setting up an account balance which records the entrepreneur's

as it evolves over time.             This account balance will be the state variable in

the programming problem.             The period zero entry is the initial endowment W0.

Let    W   denote the entry at the end of period one contingent on state                  j   (i.e.


the contract adds      W   —
                               W0
                                    to the entrepreneur's account In period one if state
                                                 —10—


J   arises).    The period two entry is the entrepreneur's final state—contingent

payoff    w    (so that   W— W      is the amount the contract adds to her account in

period two contingent on state k occurring).

      The optimal long—term contract is found by working backwards and first

deriving the optimal contractual arrangement for period two from the vantage

of period one, given state j having occurred in period one.                       This amounts to

solving a one period contracting problem, assuming the entrepreneur has an

initial asset position of W.           The solution yields a value function V(w)

which expresses the entrepreneur's expected period two payoff as a function of

W.    Once V(W) is obtained it is then possible to find the complete solution

by moving back to period zero and solving a contracting problem which picks

for j =     g,b to   maximize the entrepreneur's expected final wealth.

      This section first derives the value function and then subsequently

solves the complete programming problem.                It concludes by analyzing the

optimal financial contract and the associated real equilibrium.

      3a.   Construction of the value function.               Suppose an entrepreneur is

about to enter period two with an account balance of                 W    resulting from the

realization of productivity state j in period one.                   Her expected final period

wealth conditioned on this event is by definition




                             E{W2
                                         =   J}    =          kwJk                           (3. 1)



The problem here is to find a contract which maximizes                   (3.1).    The contract

must offer lenders a competitive return, implying



                       jIC(kyik —   c(y)     —   W)     =
                                                            r2(K/O
                                                                     —   W)                  (3.2)



The left side of eq.       (3.2) is the expected payment the contract offers lenders

(after using eq. (2.4a) to eliminate             qJ1        The right side is the opportunity
                                               —11—


cost of the funds borrowed (after using             eq.      (2.1)   to eliminate i1).

      Only contracts which induce truthful reporting receive consideration,

following the discussion in section two.                The issue arises here because the

entrepreneur may want     to   pretend times are          bad when     actually the good

productivity state is realized.          By doing       so,    she may be able to substantially

lower her obligation to outside lenders.                The relevant Incentive constraint            is



                                         a        + Ayib                                          (33)



An entrepreneur who falsely pleads hard times must set capacity utilization at

yib   in order to mimic the bad     state.        Her gain is the unreported            income


(the difference between    yib      and yJt)), plus            the   contractual payment Wjb.


Eq.   (3.3) requires that this gain from deception not exceed the payoff from

honestly revealing the good state            W.     It is not necessary            to introduce a


symmetric constraint to dissuade the entrepreneur from dishonestly claiming

times are good; it is easy to show this constraint would never bind.

       The formal contracting problem is to choose K,                   y    and        for k =   g,b,
to maximize (3.1) subJect to (3.2),            (3.3),     the capacity constraint         (2.4b), the

                 constraint on final wealth (2.9),                   and the feasibility
non—negativity

requirement that K, qik,       Jk   a   0.   The solution follows.

       The entrepreneur will always operate at full capacity in the good state;

it would only be wasteful to install more capital than needed in good times.

Eq.   (2.4b) thus holds with equality:



                                                  y                                               (3.4)



       Input choice for    the    good state            is    given     by

                                    —   c'(y)] — r2/e2 = 0                                        (3.5)
                                                   —12—


The first term in eq.           (3.5) is the expected marginal benefit from increasing

y:     the probability of the good state times the gain in output from employing

an additional unit of capital in that state.                       The second term is the marginal

cost     given that increasing capacity one unit requires investing 1/92 units of

the numeraire good.            Let y    be the value of yjg which satisfies eq.                     (3.5).

Note that it is unaffected by the incentive constraint                                (3.3);     is thus the

                                                                   Jg   5
unconstrained optimal (first-best) choice of                      y
       Input choice for the bad state depends on whether the incentive

constraint (3.3) is binding.             Let    y' be   the value of              y     arising when the

incentive constraint            is relaxed (i.e., the first-best value of yTh.                        Then

from (2.4a), yb satisfies


                                        1 —     cI(yb*) =     0                                          (3.6)



where eq.         (3.6) incorporates the restriction that                   ?    equals   unity (see eq.

(2.2).     )     In the unconstrained optimum        yD       adjusts until the change in output

at the margin equals zero.             The cost of financing capital investment is

irrelevant to the decision because there is excess capacity                                n   the bad

state.          Condition (2.5a) guarantees that            ytl   < y9 =         K.    Nonetheless,

operating at          y    might not be feasible.        The problem is that the bad—state

input choice affects the gain from falsely announcing bad times.                                  Unreported

contrast, yib is state—dependent when the incentive constraint is binding,
as will be seen shortly.

                                         WJb =                                                  (37)


Reducing       is desirable because it lowers the entrepreneur's                     incentive to


misreport the good state as the bad.

    A condition uniquely determining             y      follows from using eqs. (3.2) and

(3.7) to eliminate W        and Wjb from the incentive constraint (3.3):



         [R2(y,y)
                     +
                         r2W)/ir

                                   Jb   =         ,   otherwise


where       is given by eq.    (3.5); and where the function R(a,b) is the

entrepreneur's expected net gain from operating her project in period t, with

a and b being the input levels for the good and bad states respectively.                        It

is given by


                                   —    c(a)]    + sb[b —       c(b)]   —
             R(a,b) =                                                       (r/8)a              (3.9)



Eq. (3.8) (when it holds) restricts          y        below yb" to      ensure that the

entrepreneur's payoff from honestly revealing the good state is at least the

same as her gain from falsely announcing the bad state.6

        Whether the incentive constraint is binding depends on the entrepreneur's

beginning—of-period      account balance.        A rise in          enlarges the amount that

the entrepreneur can commit to lenders should the bad state occur, which

consequently raises the payoff that she can obtain in the good state.                       W   thus

increases while          remains fixed at zero.             This relaxes the incentive

           If    is below a threshold value, the entrepreneur cannot obtain funds

to operate her project because she cannot offer lenders a competitive return.

This value, J, is obtained by setting                          y   = 0 in eq.          (3.8);   and is given by

The number       —   14   is interpretable        as the entrepreneur's period one "financial

capacity," since it reflects the maximum in—debt she can be at the end of

period one       in order to function in period two.                         According to eq.          (3.11),

financial capacity equals the present value of "collateralizable" expected

profits, R2(y',O), the expected net project yield when the incentive problem

 R (y9 ,O) is "collaterizable" because it is the secure portion of expected
future profits, the amount that can be guaranteed no matter how bad the
incentive problem gets. This is because a contract offered when the incentive

problem is severest sets yi9 at y9 (as always) and yb at zero.                                         Fixing yb at
zero guarantees the contract                is

        3b. Solution to the long—term contracting problem.                     We now move back to

period zero and solve a contracting problem for period one which determines

the     entrepreneur's end—of-period—one state—contingent account balance                      W   (for
j   =   g,b).    Once this is done,         it is simple    to characterize the optimal

long—term contract.

        First, express the entrepreneur's expected discounted final period payoff

in terms of the value function


                                                 =     irV(&)/r                                    (3. 16)
                                  E{W2/r1r2}


Next, note that lenders must receive a competitive return, which requires



                            m(x — c(x)          —    W] =   r"0     —   WI                         (3. 17)


where     eqs. (2.1)       and (2.3a) are used to eliminate
                                                            i0          and    qJ•U Eq. (3.17)


10Farmer        (1925)   derives the result that the interest rate affects capacity
utilintion         In this kind of   environment.

embeds the result that the quantity of capital K                       installed in period zero for

use   in period one will equal the quantity of input x9 employed in the good

productivity state, in analogy               to   the optimum for period two (see the previous

section).     Thus,              -        is the amount borrowed at time zero.
                                     W0

      As before, restrict attention to contracts where the entrepreneur has no

incentive to lie.          This requires


                                          V(W)        + V(W1')                                 (3.18)


where the payoffs are measured in terms of period one wealth.                       Similar   to
                             b
the previous case, Ax            Is the unreported income the entrepreneur earns from

lying about the good state.12                It does not enter the value function on the

right side of eq. (3.18) additively with                    W1'.   This is because the entrepreneur

cannot use    Axt'     to improve the terms of her period two contract in the same way

she can use     Wi',   else she would reveal her dishonesty.

      Another restriction is that the entrepreneur must be able to honor any

liability she incurs at the end of period one.13                       (She Incurs a liability if WI

is negative).          This requires



period budget constraints (3.2) and (3.17), then she automatically satisfies
her lifetime budget constraint (2.7).

12The   entrepreneur may         secretly store unreported earnings.             Her gain measured

              one wealth is thus          = Ax
in   period                      r2Ax /r2

13Here It is assumed that contracts are enforceable so that the entrepreneur
must honor any liability she can feasibly absorb. This contrasts with
sovereign lending, where contracts are unenforceable and borrowers are thus
able to renegotiate debts (Bulow and Rogoff (forthcoming)). The Bulow—Rogoff
scenario may be relevant as well to domestic lending situations where the
punishments that courts can inflict on delinquent borrowers are sufficiently
limited. Constraining the ability to enforce contracts here would strengthen
the basic points made since it would further increase the importance of
borrower net worth.

                                        V(Wb) a   0                                          (3.19)




(Eqs.    (3.18) and (3.19) ensure that v(W5) a          0.)      If this condition is not

satisfied, the entrepreneur cannot obtain funding to operate her project in

period two, and thus cannot pay off her debt.                  Because it essentially requires

that       a W, eq. (3.19) may be termed the "financial capacity constraint" (see

the previous section, especially eq.           (3.11)).14

        The multi—period contracting problem thus collapses to choosing               W      and

       for j =   g,b,   to maximize (3.16) subject to (3.17) —          (3.19),   plus the

requirement that        x   be non—negative.      There are    two key differences from the

one period problem presented in section 2.               First, the entrepreneur's net

financial position can be negative at the end of any production period except

the last.        This implies that the contract may offer lenders contingent claims

on the expected future project rents as a device to improve the entrepreneur's

current incentives.          Second, even though the entrepreneur is risk neutral over

period two consumption, she is effectively risk averse at time zero over

period one wealth, for a certain range.               The entrepreneur's objective is

strictly concave in              over a certain interval due to the role of period one

wealth in reducing agency costs for period              two.     She may thus prefer to smooth

the realizations of         W,    holding everything else constant.

        The optimal arrangement works as follows:               Like before, capital input in

the good state is set at its first best value; here denoted                 x,    and given by



14The condition that       wealth be non—negative — here eq. (2.9) — is
commonly known as a "limited liability constraint" (see Sappington (1983)).
The financial capacity constraint, in comparison, is a restriction on interim
wealth; it requires that the entrepreneur's interim wealth be sufficient to
guarantee that she can feasibly satisfy any given constraint on her final
wealth.
                                                        —19—



                                       —    c'(x ))            —    ne     =   0                               (3.20)



Further, when the incentive constraint is relaxed, capacity usage in the bad

state is fixed at its first best optimum, xb, given by



                                           1 — c Cx        )    =   0                                          (3.21)



        If the incentive constraint binds, capacity utilization in the bad                                    state
is distorted, also as before.                   In this case,           the following three conditions


Jointly govern the values of xb and


                                  V(W(Wb,x)) —          V(Wb)       —      = 0,                       (Ic)     (3.22)



and   either,

                                      V(Wb)        0,                                                 (fc)     (3.23)

The implicit function for the good state payoff, W(Wl),xt),                               is    obtained from

manipulating         eq.   (3.17); and     is    given by



                               W(Wb,xb)     [R(x9,xb)               + rW                                       (3.25)


where
         R1(,
                •)    is   the expected gain from operating a project in period one,

defined by eq.          (3.9).                   is decreasing in                  and increasing in x".

        Eq.   (3.22) is the incentive constraint modified by using                              eq.    (3.25) to

eliminate W.           It is portrayed as the (Ic) curve in Figures 2 and                              3.    The
                                                 —20—


curve is downward sloping in the region of the equilibrium.15                     This is because,

 in this region, both a rise in x" and a rise in               W1'    increase the entrepreneur's

gain from falsely claiming bad times.

         Eqs. (3.23) and (3.24) cannot hold simultaneously.                 The former applies

when the financial capacity constraint,               eq.   (3.19). is binding.     It is

portrayed as the (fc) curve in Figures 2 and 3.                  We know from before that the

value of W" which satisfies this restriction equals minus the present value of

expected period two profits contingent on yb equaling zero, —
                                                                                 R(y9,0)/r2
(= W).      Since this minimum depends only on anticipated period two gains and

not xb, the (fc) curve is horizontal.

         The financial capacity constraint need not bind, however.                 The

entrepreneur say prefer to set                above W since she is risk averse over a

certain range of period one wealth realizations.                     The benefit of raising W' is

to narrow the spread between it and             W9.   The cost is the decline in



15At any equilibrium point where the (ic) curve is binding, the slope of this
curve is negative. Further, the equilibrium is
                                                unique.
     The (ic) curve's slope has the sane sign as the term Os V8(l_ct(xb)_l,

where 8 =             <   1   (see eqs. (2.5b) and (3.10)). 0 may be positive at x' =
if   v9 is sufficiently greater than unity.             However, 0 is always negative at
any equilibrium point below x
     First suppose the intersection of the (ic) and (fc) curves defines the
equilibrium, as in Figure 2.  The (ic) curve intersects the horizontal axis at
     =   R(x,0)   +
                      r1W
                              a   W.   Because the (ic) curve must cut the (fc) curve
from above, its slope must be negative at the intersection. To see that the
equilibrium is unique, note that any other intersection must lie to the right
of the first one since the (ic) curve is monotone. However, a second
intersection to the right of the first is impossible.  It is easy to verify
that 0 would have to be negative at this point, which is not feasible since
the slope of the (ic) curve has to be positive here.
     Now suppose the intersection of the (ic) and (we) cui'ves defines the
equilibrium, as in Figure 3.  At this point, V8(l_c1(xb)_1 =           < 0
(from eq. (3.24)). Thus 0 < 0; and therefore the slope of the (ic) curve is
negative at the equilibrium.  It is easy to verify that the equilibrium is
unique, using the sase kind of reasoning as in the previous case.

required by the incentive condition.        Eq.   (3.24) reflects this tradeoff; and

in this case, It replaces eq. (3.23) as a restriction on xb and          Il'.   The

 in analogy to the short-term contracting problem studied earlier. It follows

 that period one output per capita must be lower than            its first   best value as

 well (see eq. (2.lOa)).

      An outcome of the multi-period setting Is that output may exhibit

 positive serial correlation, due to the link between

to rarely arise. In the real world, lenders are typically risk averse,
possibly making them unwilling to perfectly insure borrowers against aggregate

reinforcing.     The anticipated rise in future unencumbered profits raises the

maximum liability that the entrepreneur can absorb in the event of          a   current

bad outcome.     This lowers W", allowing     w to rise,   further reducing the

entrepreneur's    incentive to cheat.      The Cfc) curve moves downward, dominating

a simultaneous downward shift by the Cic) curve, so that xb increases on net.

Conversely, a rise in r2 reduces both the shadow value of good state wealth

and financial capacity, which in turn lowers x".           In both cases, the effect of

the disturbance persists into the second period, due to the impact on the

average   entrepreneurial account balance.

financial capacity constraint. These         improvements are mirrored in rightward
shifts    of the Cic) curve andJor downward shifts of the       (fc) curve, either   of

which increases xb.     After a point, the intersection of the Cic) and (ws)

Correspondingly,       lies above   W.   Entrepreneurs now accumulate wealth in the

bad state at the cost of production being lower than otherwise. 19         This

behavior resembles reliquification; and it arises here because the dynasic

agency problem introduces a penchant for wealth-smoothing by making an

entrepreneur's expected earnings a concave function of her account balance.

overall increase In per capita account         balances   implies that per capita output

in period two will go up as well.           Interestingly, when    is initially very

low,    the reliquification effect (the inward movement of the (we) curve) may be

sufficiently strong to make xb fall. However, as             nears W, the marginal gain

from reliquification declines, so that xb responds positively to rises In

Increase in r          moves the (Ic) curve inward and the (ws) curve outward, in the

end reducing both current and future output per capita.            Finally, the effects

of changes in the period two parameters 82 and r2 are indeterminate in this

case. Unlike the earlier case, the net impact on incentives is indeterminate;

this is because V(Wb) is no longer fixed.

        With enough improvement in the economic situation, the incentive

constraint will not bind. For example, if U          or 8   increases sufficiently or

     declines sufficiently, then x' converges to its unconstrained optimum          xt'

4. Extension         to the N Period Case

        First Imagine adding a period at the beginning, so that time starts in

period "minus one."           There now exist three production periods: zero, one and

two. The algorithm for solving the long—term contracting problem here follows

closely the one for the problem with two production periods, presented in

section 3.           Let V°(W) be a value function which expresses the entrepreneur's

expected final consumption under the optimal contract as a function of U, her

wealth entering period zero.           The period zero value function V°() has the

same general properties as the period one value function V(), derived in

sect ion 3a.          a minimum, W0, below which the entrepreneur is too
                     There   is

                                                                      = 0.

Over the interval                        the function is strictly concave with a slope
                           1W0,W0),

exceeding unity because increments of                                in this range reduce period one
                 20                 o
agency costs.             Finally, V ()           is    linear with a slope of unity when        14   is

                                           the
greater than or equal to              '            threshold value of period zero wealth at

which agency costs vanish.

      The three period contracting problem collapses to finding the

state—contingent values for period zero wealth,                                and 14, to maximize the

entrepreneur's      expected final wealth.                     This programming problem is

qualitatively similar to the one presented earlier for the two period case

since V°(.) has the general form of V(').                             The same can thus be said about the

solution.     These conclusions extend easily to the N period case.                           By using
backward induction, it is straightforward to show that the value function at

any (admissible) period minus               t, V_t(.),             has the sane general form as the

period one value function V(S).

      Quantitative differences              may arise, of course.                Extending the number of

production periods increases the entrepreneur's financial capacity; that is,

the minimum initial account balance she needs to operate in period minus                                t,


      declines as t rises.21              The minimum for the case of three production

periods,         is given by



                              =   —
                                      fR(x,0)/r                +                                        (4.1)

As before,    financial                     (in        this                -
                              capacity                         example,        14, equals the present
                                                                                  )




      =   V/[l_V8(i_ct(xb)]           > 1, where                   is given by eq. (3.14). Further, V0
is negative in this region, reflecting a diminishing effect of additional
wealth on agency costs.

      optimal contract thus may call for partial "debt-forgiveness" in the
event of a   string
                  of bad project outcomes; this arises simply because the
maximum liability the entrepreneur can bear declines as the project nears the
terminal period.

value of collateralizable future project rents, defined in section 3a.

Lengthening the horizon increases this present value, as a comparison of eqs.

(3.11) and (4.1) indIcates.

     Less clear is   tfie   temporal behavior of   W,   the wealth level at period

minus t required to ensure functioning at the unconstrained optimum in each

subsequent production period.        This value for the three period case, W, is

given by



           =          —                     +           —   R(y,y)]/rr              (4.2)



It follows from eqs. (3.12) and (4.2) that           the present value of the
                                           W0 equals

sum of the minimum levels of wealth that would alleviate the Incentive problem

each period under single period contracting.22          If these minimum levels are

positive each period then W          rises as the horizon Increases; more initial

wealth is needed to perfectly ensure that the entrepreneur's account balance

can remain sufficiently in surplus in the event of a sustained string of bad

project outcomes.    Conversely, if they are negative then          declines.   In

this case, lengthening the horizon reduces the entrepreneur's         incentive to

deviate from the first best.         This Is because the expected gain from honestly

operating at the unconstrained optimum each period always exceeds the expected

gain in unreported Income, obtained from falsely pretending times are bad

(see eq. (4.2)).



6. Concludinm Remarks

     This paper characterizes a multi—period production economy in which

borrowers and lenders enter optimal long—term financial contracts.          A key

feature of the equilibrium is that aggregate production and borrowers'

                        —     their   "financial capacity" -   are
capacity to absorb debt                                              jointly determined

endogenous variables, in the spirit of Gurney and Shaw (1955).            Expectations

of future economic conditions govern financial capacity, which in turn

influences current capacity utilization.         Further, disturbances in the present

may persist into the future by influencing borrowers' net asset positions.

Finally, borrowers may substitute future for current production by preserving

their assets in hard times, behavior akin to reliquification.

     The exact determination of financial capacity and of how it may feed

back into the real equilibrium is of course more complex than this paper

portrays.   A major omission is role of financial intermediaries.           Certainly,

secular movements in financial capacity are also tied to the development of
                  23
intermediation.        And breakdowns in intermediation   are, likely   a key aspect of

depressions.   Nonetheless, the factor emphasized here, collateralizable future

profits, may be relevant as well to explaining the kind of short run variation

in financial capacity needed to make the general story apply to ordinary

business fluctuations.      Finally, while the analysis makes no attempt to model

growth, it does suggest that the evolution of productivity           (profitability) in

an economy and of financial capacity may be intimately—connected processes.
