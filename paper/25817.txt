                                          ABSTRACT

We show that the pattern of positive pre-announcement market drift is present not only for
FOMC announcements, as documented by Lucca and Moench (2015), but also for other major
macroeconomic announcements such as Nonfarm Payroll, ISM and GDP. This commonality in
pre-announcement returns leads us to hypothesize that there are two kinds of risks associated with
pre-scheduled macroeconomic announcements. The first risk arises from the uncertain content of
the news itself and is directional in nature, while the second risk is associated with the
“heightened uncertainty” in anticipation of a pre-scheduled announcement, relating in particular
to its potential market impact. Theoretically, we show that it is the resolution of this second risk
prior to an announcement that leads to the positive pre-announcement drift. Moreover, our model
shows that this second risk can be captured by VIX and the positive pre-announcement drift
occurs in the absence of increases in conventional risk measures. We further provide direct
evidence on the heightened uncertainty and its later resolution prior to the macroeconomic
releases including FOMC. In addition to the pre-scheduled announcements, heightened
uncertainty can also be triggered unexpectedly. Indeed, we find abnormally large returns on days
following large spike-ups in VIX, with magnitudes comparable to the pre-announcement returns.

1.       Introduction

In a recent paper, Lucca and Moench (2015) find that over the 24-hour time window before
the scheduled announcements by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the return
on the S&P 500 index is on average 49 basis points from 1994 to 2013, more than ten times the
daily average return of 4 basis point on the same index. Moreover, by conventional measures
of risk—return volatility, skewness, kurtosis, etc.—markets exhibit no additional risk during
this period. The implication of these striking results in the asset pricing context very much
depends on whether they are special to FOMC or part of a more general phenomenon.
     We start our analysis by examining in detail equity returns ahead of other macroeconomic
announcements.1 In order to properly capture the pre-announcement returns, we define the
pre-announcement period to be from the market close (4 pm) of the previous day to 5
minutes before the scheduled release of the macroeconomic news, including FOMC. Since
most of these releases occur before or near the market open (e.g., 8:30, 9:15 or 10:00am),
we use index futures, which are traded overnight, to obtain the market return over this
period as the pre-announcement return. Covering a list of widely followed macroeconomic
indicators, we find that Nonfarm Payroll (NFP), ISM, and GDP also exhibit significant
positive pre-announcement returns.2 Compared with return on non-event days over this time
window, which is −0.85 basis points and insignificant, the pre-announcement returns around
macroeconomic data releases are both statistically and economically significant: 10.10 basis
points for Nonfarm Payroll, 9.14 basis points for ISM, and 7.46 basis points for GDP over the
sample period of 1994 to 2018. They are smaller than the pre-FOMC return, which is 27.14
basis points by our measurement over our sample period, but comparable in magnitude.3
     Therefore, the pre-announcement market drift is not unique to FOMC. It is also present
among other important macroeconomic news. This commonality in pre-announcement re-
     1
     Lucca and Moench (2015) also looked at nine macroeconomic announcements and found no significant
equity return on the day before the announcement, from market close to market close. Since many macro
announcements occur early in the morning before trading starts in the equity market, the period immediately
before the announcement is the overnight period. The daily returns considered by Lucca and Moench do
not include this period, which turns out to be critical in capturing pre-announcement returns.
    2
      Obviously, we do not expect substantial pre-announcement equity returns for all news. Some of them
may well be inconsequential for the market, hence deemed unimportant for our purpose. In fact, even for
the same indicator, such as FOMC and NFP, we do not always observe pre-announcement returns.
     3
     While Lucca and Moench (2015) also include the 2-hour window from 2 pm to 4 pm (on the day before
FOMC), which does contribute to the positive pre-FOMC drift (9.29 basis points with a t-stat of 1.58), we
use the market close as the starting point of the pre-announcement window in order to provide a unified
framework to examine the pre-announcement returns for other macroeconomic news.



                                                    2
turns suggests a more general and richer risk-return relationship behind the observed return
patterns surrounding major macro announcements, including FOMC.
    We then hypothesize that the pre-announcement drift is a result of heightened uncertainty
prior to the announcement and its resolution. In particular, we propose that market-moving
news carries two risks: the first risk is associated with the news realization itself, directional
in nature, and the second risk is associated with the potential magnitude of the news’ market
impact, which we also refer to as uncertainty for distinction.4 Each risk carries its own risk
premium, yielding a positive price drift when the risk is resolved. If the uncertainty about a
news’ potential impact is resolved before its actual release, a positive return will be realized,
which is separate from the news realization itself. Because this uncertainty is not directly
tied to the actual news release, conventional risk measures may not accurately capture the
level of this uncertainty. Consequently, we will observe an upward price drift during this
period without a higher read in conventional risk measures. However, as we show in Section
6 through a simple model, the VIX index can provide a good measure for the uncertainty.
    The risk dynamics proposed above lead to two sets of new predictions. First, there
should be a decrease in VIX accompanying the pre-announcement return for important
macro announcements (including FOMC, Nonfarm Payroll, ISM, and GDP), reflecting the
dissolution of the heightened uncertainty associated with the announcement. Second, prior
to the pre-announcement period, there should be an accumulation of uncertainty about
the announcement. During this accumulation period, there should be an increase in VIX,
accompanied by a downward price drift. We empirically test these predictions and find the
evidence to be overall consistent.
    Since not all announcements bring the same level of uncertainty, we focus on the an-
nouncements yielding the highest 30% pre-announcement returns, which we call the high-
return group. This group corresponds to announcements with relatively higher levels of
heightened uncertainty. For FOMC, the pre-announcement return is 97.08 basis points for
the high-return group, and we observe a drop in VIX by 1.04 percentage points during the
same period, both highly significant. Given that the pre-announcement period return is
smaller for Nonfarm Payroll, ISM, and GDP compared to FOMC, we pool them together
in our tests and refer to them as Macro. For the high-return group of the Macro news, we
find a pre-announcement return of 82.97 basis points, together with a drop in VIX of 0.55
   4
     Due to the lack of a better terminology, our use of “uncertainty” here is in an intuitive sense and mainly
to differentiate from the first type of risk. It does not necessarily imply that we are using it in the sense of
Knight (1921) or Savage (1954).


                                                       3
percentage points, both statistically significant. In terms of magnitude, they are comparable
to that for FOMC.
   The uncertainty concerning an announcement is accumulated over time prior to its dis-
solution during the pre-announcement period. We consider the window from -6 days to the
pre-announcement day (market close to market close) to be this accumulation period. Not
knowing the actual length of the accumulation period, which can vary from announcement
to announcement, picking such a fixed window inevitably weakens our results. Nonethe-
less, we find that VIX increases substantially during this accumulation period, accompanied
by a significant decrease in price. In particular, for the high-return group of FOMC, VIX
increases by 1.88 percentage points while return is −81.80 basis points during the accumula-
tion period. For the high-return group of Macro announcements, the change in VIX is 0.90
percentage points and the return is −40.40 basis points over the accumulation period.
   As an additional test to avoid potential bias by looking only at the high-return group, we
further use the change in VIX during the accumulation period to forecast the return over the
pre-announcement period and find significant results for both FOMC and Macro announce-
ments. For example, an one standard deviation increase in the lagged change in VIX from
-3 days to -1 day would result in a 9.15 basis points increase in the pre-announcement return
for FOMC announcements. That is, announcements that bring higher level of heightened
uncertainty are indeed associated with larger drift at the pre-announcement period. By
comparison, lagged VIX changes can not predict future return on Non-Event days that do
not have pre-scheduled news releases. These out-of-sample tests provide strong support to
the heightened uncertainty explanation of the pre-announcement returns.
   Heightened uncertainty can also be triggered unexpectedly by adverse market conditions.
As an additional “out-of-sample” test of our hypothesis, we investigate whether there is a
premium for such unexpected heightened uncertainty. For this, we select days on which VIX
suddenly spikes up. To match the FOMC frequency, we choose a constant cutoff value in
the daily increase of VIX so that there are on average eight days of heightened VIX per
calendar year. By construction, these heightened VIX days are marked with adverse market
conditions, such as large price drops, as investors anxiously await the next trading day. Akin
to the result on scheduled news, we find disproportionately large returns on the S&P 500
index after sudden spikes in VIX. Using data from September 1994 to May 2018, we find
that the next-day return is on average 57.22 basis points per day with a t-stat of 3.24.5
   5
       The average VIX is around 20% on announcement days as well as normal days. By contrast, the average


                                                     4
   Overall, these results provide compelling evidence that the pre-announcement returns for
macro news releases, including FOMC, Nonfarm Payroll, ISM, GDP, are a manifestation of
an intertemporal risk and return relationship with multiple sources of risks resolving over
different time windows. Not all trading days are created equal and some have inherently
higher exposure to risks than others. As long as we focus our attention on such high-impact
days, either pre-scheduled (e.g., FOMC and Macro releases) or stochastically triggered (e.g.,
heightened VIX), we will be confronted with this pattern of seemingly large abnormal returns,
which are in fact the premium for heightened uncertainty on these days.
   Although we have little direct information about the exact nature of the underlying
uncertainty, VIX provides a natural proxy. Our results clearly show that the underlying
uncertainty is time varying, its dynamics can be quite rich, driven by both deterministic and
stochastic news arrivals, and its relationship with return/risk premium can be complex. A
more coherent model of risk and return is needed in order to explain the observed return
patterns rather than a simple static return-risk relationship using conventional risk measures.
   To further demonstrate this point, in the last part of the paper, we construct a simple
asset pricing model with two risks: the macro news itself, denoted by ε, which is directional
(with zero mean), and how much the news will impact asset payoff. We refer to the second
risk as uncertainty and denote it by σ, which is always positive but random. The asset
payoff D is then given by D = σ ε, depending on the realization of both risks. Each risk
carries its own premium in equilibrium. If how much the news may impact asset payoff
(i.e., σ) is learned before the announcement, then the resolution of this uncertainty will
lead to a positive pre-announcement return. Indeed, we show that VIX provides a measure
of this uncertainty, which declines together with the pre-announcement return, while the
corresponding return volatility, as a common measure of risk, remains low. We show that
at high levels of uncertainty, the pre-announcement risk premium is higher and the pre-
announcement return volatility is lower than their post-announcement counterparts. The
model also implies a heightening of uncertainty as reflected by an increase in VIX and a
price drop prior to the realization of high pre-announcement returns. In the paper, we first
hypothesize the risk-return dynamics from the model in its reduced form to formulate the
testable predictions before our empirical analysis, and return to the formal model at the end.
   Despite what the model delivers, we by no means claim that VIX is an accurate measure

VIX is 33% on days after heightened VIX. One might be tempted to explain the next-day average return
of 57 basis points as larger return for higher risk. In the data, however, the contemporaneous correlation
between VIX and return is known to be significantly negative, making our finding even more striking.


                                                    5
of uncertainty in a more general context. It is entirely possible that VIX is merely a partial
reflection of some underlying uncertainty when it rises and dissolves.6
    Although our proposed explanation of the pre-announcement returns is both theoreti-
cally and empirically coherent and supported by several sets of “out-of-sample” tests, open
questions remain. For example, our empirical analysis does not reveal the precise nature of
the uncertainty around announcements, what drives its resolution, and how.7 These ques-
tions are important but beyond the scope of this paper, especially with the data we have.
We provide some further discussion in the model section.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The remainder of this section provides a brief
discussion of the related literature. Section 2 presents a reduced form risk-return dynamics
surrounding macro news and its testable predictions. Section 3 describes in detail the data
we use. Section 4 and Section 5 present our main empirical results and related discussions.
Section 6 introduces an illustrative model that can generate the observed risk-return patterns
around important macroeconomic announcements as well as VIX hikes. Section 7 concludes.

Relation to the Literature
Our analysis demonstrates three important points in analyzing the risk and return patterns
generated by macroeconomic news. First, the risk and return dynamics surrounding these an-
nouncements involves three phases/periods, the accumulation period, the pre-announcement
period, and the announcement or post-announcement period. The risks concerning an an-
nouncement accumulates over the first period and then resolve, possibly separately, over the
following two periods. Second, the right choice of the time window for each period is im-
portant in order to best capture the corresponding risk and return properties. For example,
using windows encompassing different periods may miss or mix the risk and return patterns
we want to identify. Third, we need to consider return and risk jointly. In particular, since
   6
     For example, Han (2018) shows that VIX squared can emerge as an endogenous measure of uncertainty
in a model of dynamic information acquisition and asset prices. Fisher, Martineau, and Sheng (2018) find
a positive correlation between VIX and their “macroeconomic attention index” based on news articles at
the daily frequency. One can also try to construct other empirical measures of uncertainty. For example,
for FOMC, Bauer, Lakdawala, and Mueller (2019) use the standard deviation of LIBOR as a proxy for
monetary policy uncertainty, and find this measure of uncertainty declines substantially on the day of FOMC
announcements. These explorations are beyond the focus of this paper and left for future work.
   7
     Recent evidence about news consumption provides a possible interpretation. Using a dataset on the
clicks on news articles, Benamar, Foucault, and Vega (2018) find that investors’ demand for information is
stronger when the market’s response to Nonfarm Payroll surprises is larger. Their evidence suggests that high
uncertainty leads to more learning by investors, which could be one of the underlying reasons of uncertainty
reduction ahead of announcements.


                                                     6
an announcement may involve additional risks in addition to the news realization itself, we
need to go beyond the more conventional risk measures.
   Lucca and Moench (2015) first document a significant equity return during the 24- hour
pre-announcement period before FOMC releases.8 We complement their results by showing
that pre-announcement return has a broad presence among high-impact macroeconomic
news releases. Prior to our paper, Lucca and Moench (2015) and Ai and Bansal (2018)
have also examined macroeconomic announcements. But they focused merely on the return
over the day prior to the releases and found no pre-announcement returns.9 As many of
these announcements are made prior or around market opening, both papers have missed
the overnight return immediately preceding the news releases. This turns out to be critical.
By zooming in on a more precise pre-announcement window, i.e., from 4 pm in the previous
day to 5 minutes before the announcement, we do find a robust and economically important
pre-announcement drift for Nonfarm Payroll, ISM, and GDP releases.
   The commonality of equity premium before FOMC and other important macro announce-
ments calls for a coherent explanation for both. Because the pre-macro-announcement re-
turns have escaped discovery until now, more research has focused on explaining the pre-
FOMC return alone, with special attention paid to its unique features. For example, Cieslak,
Morse, and Vissing-Jorgensen (2019) propose that information about the Federal Reserve’s
“unexpected accommodating” monetary policy is leaked ahead of the FOMC announce-
ment, which causes a pre-announcement equity market rally. Jiang, Pan, and Qiu (2019)
propose informed trading ahead of FOMC announcements to deliver a premium as propri-
etary information is incorporated into prices. While explanations based on leakage and/or
informed trading can potentially explain pre-FOMC returns, they face two challenges. First,
the leakage story has difficulty in explaining the other side of the phenomenon, the lack
of pre-announcement return volatility. If directional news about the market were leaked
and incorporated into prices, pre-announcement volatility becomes unavoidable. Second,
leakage seems less relevant for most of the other macroeconomic announcements, which are
   8
    Also see Gilbert, Kurov, and Wolfe (2018) and Lucca and Moench (2018) for the robustness of the pre-
FOMC announcement returns. International evidence on pre-announcement equity return for other central
banks is mixed. While Guo, Jia, and Sun (2019) find positive evidence for the People’s Bank of China,
Brusa, Savor, and Wilson (2018) find no evidence for the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, and the
European Central Bank.
   9
     Lucca and Moench (2015) use the close-to-close equity return on the day prior to the macroeconomic
announcements. Ai and Bansal (2018) use the last five regular trading hours prior to the announcement,
which for their set of non-FOMC announcements, including Nonfarm Payroll, PPI, GDP, and ISM, actually
belong mostly to the previous trading day.


                                                   7
less prone to potential leaks. Indeed, Bernile, Hu, and Tang (2016) and Kurov, Sancetta,
Strasser, and Wolfe (2019) find little evidence of informed trading on the day before FOMC
and macroeconomic announcements.10
    Our paper is closely related to the recent literature on announcement day equity returns.
For example, Savor and Wilson (2013) examine returns on days of CPI, PPI, employment,
and FOMC announcements; Ai and Bansal (2018) analyze returns on days of Nonfarm
Payroll, PPI, FOMC, GDP, and ISM releases; Ernst, Gilbert, and Hrdlicka (2019) study
returns on days of FOMC and a range of macroeconomic announcements. While we em-
phasize the importance in distinguishing the pre-announcement and the post-announcement
periods, they all use daily data, so their announcement-day returns include both pre- and
post-announcement returns. Although our sample of announcements does not overlap per-
fectly with theirs, we find that pre-announcement returns are typically a large fraction of
the announcement-day returns.11 In addition, the post-announcement return typically ex-
hibits significantly higher volatility. It is the large pre-announcement return together with
no abnormal volatility that requires better understanding, hence the focus of our study.
    Parallel to the empirical literature on announcement-day returns are recent theoretical
models aiming at explaining them. In a representative agent model, Ai and Bansal (2018)
characterize the class of preferences under which an announcement is accompanied by positive
risk premium. In Wachter and Zhu (2019), investors learn from the announcement about
whether a rare disaster event has occurred. In both models, a positive equity premium
is realized after the announcement, not before.12 For this reason, their models explain the
announcement-day (post-announcement) returns but not the pre-announcement returns that
Lucca and Moench (2015) and we document.
    The key contribution of our theory is the introduction of an additional risk, referred to as
uncertainty, which is about the magnitude of the announcement’s market impact. Because
  10
     These two papers find evidence consistent with informed trading only until about 30 minutes before
scheduled macro announcements, but not before. This evidence on informed trading is so close to the actual
announcement that it is difficult to explain the returns hours before the announcements. Bilyi (2018) proposes
a model of disagreement to explain the pre-FOMC drift. However, any explanation based on disagreement
will also imply substantial pre-announcement trading volume, which is opposite to what the data shows.
  11
     For Nonfarm Payroll, ISM, and GDP, the announcement-day return (from 4pm of the previous day to
4pm of the announcement day) is about 12 bps in our sample, of which 9 bps are realized from 4pm of the
previous day to 5 minutes before the announcement. Ai and Bansal (2018) find that the announcement-day
return of Nonfarm Payroll, PPI, GDP, and ISM is on average 9.28 bps in their sample, which is quite similar
to the announcement-day return in our sample.
  12
    To connect to the pre-announcement return observed in the data, Ai and Bansal (2018) suggest infor-
mation leakage. It then faces the same challenges as the other leakage explanations discussed above.


                                                      8
uncertainty is not directional, its resolution need not lead to a substantial increase in return
volatility, but nonetheless carries a risk premium. Not only does heightened uncertainty
explain the positive pre-announcement stock returns in the absence of high volatility, it also
leads to a set of sharp and coherent predictions on the risk and return dynamics during the
three phases surrounding an announcement: the accumulation period, the pre-announcement
period, and the announcement or post-announcement period.13 Using VIX as a measure
of uncertainty, we provide convincing empirical evidence in support of these predictions.
As an additional “out-of-sample” test, we also find consistence evidence when heightened
uncertainty rise stochastically rather than deterministically.
   To the best of our knowledge, we are the first in the literature to model and empirically
test the join dynamics of VIX and pre-announcement returns for pre-scheduled news releases.
The dynamics of VIX around FOMC announcements are studied sporadically earlier. Carr
and Wu (2006) find that VIX peaks on the day before FOMC announcement, although their
evidence is at the daily level and hence does not distinguish pre- and post-announcement
VIX drops. Using intraday data on FOMC days, Fernandez-Perez, Frijns, and Tourani-Rad
(2017) find that VIX starts to decline before the announcement and continues thereafter.
We make two contributions relative to these papers. First, we connect VIX dynamics with
the corresponding returns. Second, we show that the same VIX and return dynamics apply
more broadly around other important macroeconomic announcements.
   The connection between VIX and stock returns across different types of announcements
paints a coherent picture of uncertainty and equity risk premium. In this aspect, our paper
is also related to the literature on the interaction between VIX and expected stock returns.
Previous literature has shown that equity returns are predicted, over monthly to annual
horizon, by the variance risk premium (Bollerslev, Tauchen, and Zhou (2009) and Zhou
(2018)) and simple variance swap (Martin (2017)). Cheng (2019) provides a dynamic model
of VIX and characterizes the VIX premium embedded in VIX futures. The main connection
of our paper to this literature is the evidence that a sufficiently large spike-up in daily VIX
is already a strong predictor of positive equity returns on the next day, which is indeed a
risk premium, realized as heightened uncertainty dissolves.
  13
     Laarits (2019) also proposes a two-risk model for the pre-FOMC return. He hypothesizes that the
nature of each FOMC announcement depends on the state of the economy (good or bad), which is observed
by investors before the announcement. He then explores the exact nature of the FOMC announcements by
examining FOMC transcript, stock-bond correlations, and FX returns, among others. Our model is aimed
at a broader set of announcements/news, not tied to a particular one, and leads more general and richer
predictions on the corresponding risk and return behavior.

In this section, we formulate an empirically testable hypothesis, linking the pre-announcement
risk-and-return patterns explicitly to heightened uncertainty and its later resolution. The
formal development of the hypothesis is given in Section 6.
      Our hypothesis can be best illustrated via a simple asset pricing model that contains
two types of risk. The first kind of risk is directional in nature and captures the actual
macro-economic news, while the second kind of risk captures the potential impact of this
news on asset payoff. Key to our hypothesis is the presence of this second kind of risk,
which we refer to as uncertainty for distinction. The resolution of these two risks can occur
at different times, and their resolution over time leads to positive expected returns, or risk
premia. We demonstrate that the resolution of heightened uncertainty (the second kind of
risk) followed by the resolution of the news itself (the first kind of risk) can generate return
and risk patterns similar to those around the times of FOMC and other macroeconomic
announcements, as well as times of sharp rises in VIX.
      More formally, let Pt be the asset price at time t. We hypothesize the following process
for Pt :

          Pt = Ft − a Vt − b Ut ,                                                                           (1)

where Ft represents the asset’s fundamental, e.g., its expected future payoff, and a and b are
two positive constants, reflecting the risk premia associated with the two risks, denoted by
Vt and Ut , respectively.14 The first risk, Vt , can be measured by the variance of news at t.
The second risk/uncertainty, Ut , is about the magnitude of the news’ impact on asset payoff.
      As indicated by Equation (1), news impacts asset price not only through its impact
on asset payoff Ft , but also through its influences on the levels of the two risks, Vt and
Ut , respectively. Accompanying an increase in each risk, the asset price decreases. This can
happen, for example, as the risk/uncertainty, Ut , accumulates and builds up in anticipation of
the pre-scheduled announcement of market moving news. Likewise, accompanying a decrease
     14
      The price process in (1) is canonical in asset pricing models. Using the classic Gordon model, the price
of an asset can be written as Pt = Dt (1 + gt )/(rt − gt ), where Dt is the current dividend, gt its expected
growth rate, and rt the discount rate. If there are two separate risks, measured by Vt and Ut , we can express
the discount rate by rt = rF (1 + a Vt + b Ut ). Take the log of the price equation and expand in gt , Vt and
Ut , we have: pt ' dt + (1 + 1/rF )gt − log rF − aVt − bUt (to the first order). This is (1) if we replace Pt by
pt and Ft by dt + (1 + 1/rF )gt − log rF . We use price levels here rather than its logs to be consistent with
the formal model in Section 6.



                                                      10
in each risk, the asset price increases. In particular, this price appreciation can happen at
the resolution of the uncertainty.
    Important for our hypothesis is the fact that these two risks, Vt and Ut , are of different
origin, and the difference in the timing of their accumulation and resolution leads to unique
and testable patterns in asset return and risk. More specifically, we have the following return
and risk dynamics:

       Rt = Pt − Pt−1 = ∆Ft − a ∆Vt − b ∆Ut .                                                            (2)

To test the implications of the above hypothesis, we need empirical measures for both the
news risk Vt and its impact uncertainty Ut . While Vt can be estimated using returns, Ut
may not. However, as we show in the model in Section 6, VIX provides a good proxy for
uncertainty of Ut .15
    We further map out the timing by considering four dates/times, t = −1, 0, 1, 2, with the
news announcement pre-scheduled to occur at t = 1:

Window [1, 2): The announcement (or post-announcement) window when the news is re-
       leased and Vt drops.

Window [0, 1): The pre-announcement window when uncertainty Ut is mostly resolved.

Window [−1, 0): The accumulation window, with t = −1 representing a suitable earlier
       date when uncertainty Ut starts accumulating.

Correspondingly, in the return space, R2 is the return on the news announcement, R1 is the
pre-announcement return, and R0 is the return over the accumulation period.
    In the risk space, Ut rises during the accumulation window and then drops during the
pre-announcement window as the uncertainty dissipates. Thus, ∆U0 = U0 − U−1 > 0 and
∆U1 = U1 − U0 < 0. On the other hand, Vt stays constant during both the accumulation
and pre-announcement windows, and decreases only during the announcement window when
the announcement arrives and the news risk is resolved. Hence, ∆Vt = 0 for t = 0, 1 and
∆V2 = V2 − V1 < 0. This risk dynamics then leads to the following predictions:
  15
     If return realization/variance is mostly driven by the news’ impact on asset fundamental, we can then
use the variance of realized returns as a proxy for Vt . On the other hand, VIX squared or the price variance
swaps can be used as a proxy for Ut .




                                                     11
Prediction 1 During the pre-announcement period, there is an increase in asset price (Pt )
and a decrease in uncertainty (Ut ). That is, R1 > 0 and ∆VIX1 < 0. There need not to be
a higher return variance (Vt ) accompanying this positive return.

Prediction 2 During the accumulation period, there is an increase in uncertainty, which
leads a build-up in VIX, and a decrease in asset price. That is, ∆VIX0 > 0 and R0 < 0.

We omit the predictions for the announcement date (R2 > 0, ∆V2 < 0), which is the focus
of standard event studies. Our focus is on the pre-announcement return and VIX dynamics.
     Macro announcements are pre-scheduled. Thus, the timing of the corresponding height-
ened uncertainty is deterministic, which makes the predictions simpler. However, our hy-
pothesis on price and risk dynamics also leads to predictions on return and VIX behavior
when the timing of the heightened uncertainty is stochastic. In particular, we have the
following prediction:

Prediction 3 When there is an unanticipated spike in VIX at date 0, reflecting a heightened
uncertainty, it will be followed by an increase in asset price as the heightened uncertainty
resolves itself. That is, for a large, positive ∆VIX0 , R1 > 0 and ∆VIX1 < 0.

     We will test the above predictions using macro announcements, FOMC and others, as well
as VIX spikes, capturing both deterministic and stochastic arrival of heightened uncertainty.


3.     Data

We use several data sources in our analysis. We obtain transaction-level data on E-mini
S&P 500 index futures from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Prior to September
1997, when E-mini was not available, we use transaction-level data on the standard (“big”)
S&P500 index futures from the CME. For daily returns on the S&P 500 index, we use
data from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP). We obtain the intraday VIX
values from the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). The intraday VIX data start
from January 1992, and contain only VIX values within the regular trading hours for most
of our sample period. For calculations involving VIX values during the off-hours, we rely
on the transaction level data on VIX futures from CBOE which start from May 2004 and
contain off-hours transaction data from December 2010. For daily closing of VIX, we use
the time-series published on the CBOE’s website.



                                             12
    The FOMC announcement times are based on the time-stamp of Bloomberg and Dow
Jones news wires. We follow the same methods of Lucca and Moench (2015) and Fleming
and Piazzesi (2005), and extend the sample period to May 2018. The announcement times
for CSI are based on the time-stamp of Bloomberg. We focus most of our analysis on
the sample from September 1994 to May 2018. During this period, there are in total 190
scheduled releases of FOMC statements. From September 1994 to March 2011, 131 releases
are consistently made within a few minutes around 2:15 pm, with only one exception, March
26, 1996, on which the release time was pre-announced to be in the morning because of
the Chairman’s other duties. From April 2011 to January 2013, seven releases are around
2:15 pm and eight releases are around 12:30 pm, one hour and forty five minutes earlier
to accommodate the Chairman’s press briefings at 2:15 pm. From February 2013 to May
2018, all of the 43 FOMC releases are around 2:00 pm. For the period before 1994, there is
no official announcement and market participants need to inferred policy decisions through
Fed’s open market operations, usually on the day after the FOMC meeting,
    In addition to FOMC announcements, we also consider the release of other major U.S.
macroeconomic indicators. These economic indicators are: total Nonfarm Payroll employ-
ment (NFP), the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index (ISM), Gross Do-
mestic Production (GDP), industrial production (IP), personal income (PI), housing starts
(HST), initial claims for unemployment insurance (INC), producer price index (PPI), con-
sumer price index (CPI), and the preliminary release of the Consumer Sentiment Index
(CSI). Except for ISM and CSI, all other economic indicators are public indexes released by
government agencies at either 8:30 am or 9:15 am (only for IP). ISM an CSI are economic
indicators released by private institutions. ISM is released at 10:00 am, while CSI’s release
time varies from 9:35 am to 10:00 am during our sample period. We exclude macroeco-
nomic announcement days that coincide with FOMC announcement days to avoid potential
confounding effect.
    Most of these macroeconomic indicators are released in the morning, often not within
the regular trading hours of US equity markets (9:30 am - 4 pm). We therefore rely on the
S&P 500 index futures, which are traded almost around the clock, to obtain the returns from
the market close on the previous trading day (4 pm) to five minutes prior to the exact time
(ann−5min) of these announcements.16 Using the market close as a natural starting point,

  16
    Due to data limit, prices of standard S&P 500 futures contracts are not available at non-regular trading
hours. Therefore, the pre-announcement returns for macro-announcements that are released before market
opens are only available after September 9, 1997, when E-mini S&P 500 index futures started trading.


                                                    13
our construction of the pre-announcement window is consistent with the one for FOMC and
allows for a unified comparison of the pre-announcement drift across different releases.
   To calculate market returns over a given time horizon [t1 , t2 ], we first pick the most active
S&P 500 index futures contract as the one with the highest trading volume on the trading
day of t2 , and then calculate the return as the percentage change of the last transaction
price of this futures contract before time t2 , relative to the last transaction price of the same
contract before time t1 .17 For the period after September 9, 1997, when trading data for
E-mini S&P 500 futures are available, we use the E-mini S&P 500 index futures contracts.
Before that, we use the standard S&P 500 futures contracts. From January 1986 and May
2018, we have missing futures trading data on eight trading days. One of these eight trading
days, January 29, 2014, is a scheduled FOMC release day. For these eight trading days, we
rely on the transaction level S&P 500 index data obtained from TAQ.
   For FOMC, ISM and CSI, the release time are within the regular trading hours and we
use the intra-day value of VIX provided by CBOE to calculate the change in VIX during
both the pre-announcement and announcement windows.18 For other announcements whose
releases fall outside the regular trading hours, we calculate the change in VIX based on
VIX futures, using method similar to how we calculate returns from S&P 500 index futures
prices. The VIX futures data are available for non-regular trading hours only after December
2010. For this reason, the number of news releases that we can calculate VIX changes are
significant fewer for announcements released outside of the regular trading hours.
   In addition to pre-scheduled FOMC and macroeconomic releases, we also consider days
with unexpected heightened uncertainty. For this, we first select days on which the daily
increase in VIX larger than a constant cutoff value and define the next trading day as the
heightened VIX (HVIX) days. To match the FOMC frequency, we choose a constant cutoff
value so that there are on average approximately eight days of heightened VIX days per
calendar year. The daily increase in VIX at day t is calculated as the difference between
VIX at day t and the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) of past VIX up to day
t−1. More details on the selection of heightened VIX days are discussed at Section 5. For our
baseline results, we use the heightened VIX days selected based on an EWMA decay factor
  17
     We choose the most active futures contract as the one with the highest volume, which is usually the
nearest-term contract and occasionally the next contract during rolling forward weeks.
  18
     The VIX tick data provided by CBOE starts to provide intra-day VIX values from 10:00 am to market
close (varying from 4:00 pm to 4:15 pm) since April 1992. The data set extends the coverage to 9:30 am
since January 2004 and 3:15 am since April 2016.



                                                  14
η equals to 0.3 and a cutoff value equals to 3%. Lastly, we consider the remaining trading
days, i.e., neither pre-scheduled FOMC and macroeconomic release days nor heightened VIX
days, as the Non-Event days.
   Tables 1 reports the summary statics of pre-announcement returns from September 1994
to May 2018. For FOMC and Macroeconomic release days, we report the pre-announcement
returns from 4 pm on the previous day to 5 minutes before announcement time based on
the S&P 500 index futures. For heightened VIX (HVIX) and Non-Event days, we report the
close-to-close daily returns on the S&P 500 index.
   The average pre-announcement return for FOMC is 27.14 basis points with a t-stat
of 5.95. Our calculation of the pre-announcement returns for FOMC is lower than those
reported in Lucca and Moench (2015). This is due to two reasons. The first reason is that
our pre-announcement window starts from 4 pm on the previous day, shorter than the 24-
hours window used by Lucca and Moench (2015). Our calculation does not include the small
run-up from 2 pm to 4 pm on the day prior to the announcement. The second reason is that
the pre-announcement returns for FOMC are on average smaller for the period after 2011
and we extend the sample period in Lucca and Moench (2015) to 2018.
   We also find significant pre-announcement returns for Non-farm Payroll, ISM, and GDP
announcements. The average pre-announcement return is 10.10 basis points for NFP with a
t-stat of 3.63; 9.14 basis points for ISM with a t-stat of 2.10; 7.46 basis points for GDP with a
t-stat of 2.08. These drifts are robust to potential outliers. After removing the top 1% highest
returns and the bottom 1% lowest returns, the average drift is 9.80 basis points for NPF,
10.31 basis points for ISM, and 6.09 basis points for GDP. All pre-announcement returns
remain statistically significant at the 5% level. Compared with FOMC, the magnitudes of
the pre-announcement return on these macroeconomic announcements are indeed smaller.
Though with smaller magnitudes, these drift are quite large economically. The average
return on Non-Event days, by comparison, is not statistically significant.
   The daily close-to-close return on HVIX days is on average 57.22 bps with a t-stat of 3.24,
larger than the pre-announcement return on FOMC and macroeconomic announcements.
After removing the top 1% highest returns and the bottom 1% lowest returns, the average
return on HVIX days is 54.73 bps and remains statistically significant with a t-stat of 3.73.

     announcement days. The pre-announcement window is from 4 pm on the pre-announcement day to five minutes before indexes’
     releases. The macroeconomic announcements include: total nonfarm payroll employment (NFP),the Institute for Supply Manage-
     ment’s manufacturing index (ISM), Gross Domestic Production (GDP), industrial production (IP), personal income (PI), housing
     starts (HST), initial claims for unemployment insurance (INC), producer price index (PPI), consumer price index (CPI), and the
     preliminary release of the Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI). Macroeconomic announcement days that coincide with FOMC days are
     excluded for all other macroeconomic announcements. HVIX are the next trading day following days with unexpected spikes in VIX.
     Non-Event refers to all trading days that are not FOMC, macroeconomic, and HVIX days. For HVIX and Non-Event days, the daily
     close-to-close percentage returns (in basis points) on the S&P 500 index are reported. The sample period is from September 1994 to
     May 2018.
4.         FOMC and Macro Announcements

Our theory predicts that FOMC is not unique and all pre-scheduled news releases that bring
large impact to the market should share similar pattern of return and uncertainty. For
this reason, we examine FOMC and other important macroeconomic news together in this
section. As detailed in Section 2, to understand the asset-pricing implications of the pre-
scheduled announcements of market moving news, we break the time window prior to the
news announcements into two separate periods. During the accumulation period, we expect
to observe a gradual buildup in uncertainty accompanied by a downward drift in market
prices. During the pre-announcement periods, we expect uncertainty starts to get resolved,
resulting a positive drift in market prices. The separation of these two periods is critical
for our empirical tests because return and uncertainty are expected to behave oppositely
during the two time windows. In this section, we first discuss the join dynamics of return
and uncertainty during the pre-announcement period at section 4.1 and then discuss the
accumulation period at section 4.2.

4.1.         Pre-Announcement Drift and VIX Drop
The Prediction 1 of our model predicts that there is a positive drift in market price and a
negative drop in uncertainty before all pre-scheduled announcements with high-impact to the
market. To test this prediction, we report the average returns and changes in VIX around
FOMC and ten other pre-scheduled major macroeconomic announcements from September
1994 to May 2018 in Table 2. In order to have a consistent comparison across all announce-
ments, we define the time from the market close of the previous day to 5 minutes before the
scheduled release as the pre-announcement window. We define the announcement window
as the period from 5 minutes before to 5 minutes after the index releases.
      The pre-announcement returns for Nonfarm Payroll, ISM, and GDP are statistically
significant: 10.10 basis points for Nonfarm Payroll, 9.14 basis points for ISM, and 7.46 basis
points for GDP. Compared with the FOMC result, which averages to 27.14 basis points by
our measurement, the magnitudes of pre-announcement returns around macroeconomic data
releases are smaller but significant and comparable in magnitude. The smaller magnitudes
could be due to the fact that these pieces of news are not as impactful as FOMC and bring less
uncertainty to the market.19 For the same reason, many other less impactful macroeconomic
     19
          FOMC is also unique in being released in the afternoon while other macroeconomic announcements are

     This table reports the returns (in basis points) and changes in VIX (in percentages) around FOMC and other macroeconomic releases.
     The pre-announcement window is from 4 pm on the previous trading day to 5 minutes before index release [4pm, ann−5min], the
     announcement window is from 5 minutes before index release to 5 minutes after index release [ann−5min, ann+5min]. The returns are
     percentage returns based on futures prices. For the day prior to the announcement day. The macroeconomic announcements include:
     total nonfarm payroll employment (NFP), the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index (ISM), the Gross Domestic
     Production (GDP), industrial production (IP), personal income (PI), housing starts (HST), initial claims for unemployment insurance
     (INC), producer price index (PPI), consumer price index (CPI), and the preliminary release of the Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI).
     Announcement days that coincide with FOMC days are excluded for all macroeconomic releases. For FOMC, ISM and CSI, the release
     time are within the regular trading hours and we use the intraday value of VIX provided by CBOE to calculate change in VIX. For
     other announcements with release time fall outside of the regular trading hours, we calculate change in VIX based on VIX futures.
     The VIX futures data during non-regular trading hours start from December 2010. The sample period is from September 1994 to
     May 2018.
announcements do not have significant pre-announcement returns. Indeed, measuring market
impact by the absolute market return during the announcement window, all of the three
macroeconomic announcements (NPF/GDP/ISM) with significant pre-announcement return
are among the news releases with the highest market impact.
    In addition to the positive price drift, we also find evidences that there is a significant
drop in VIX during the pre-announcement window, reflecting that the dissolution of the
heightened uncertainty risk happens prior to the actual news releases. For FOMC, the
average drop in VIX during the pre-announcement window is 0.22 percentage points, sta-
tistically significant with a t-stat of −3.18. Since not all FOMC announcements bring the
same level of heightened uncertainty, we also consider the announcements with the highest
30% pre-announcement returns, which is referred to as the high-return group. The results
are reported in Table 3. For the high-return FOMC announcements, the pre-announcement
return is 97.08 basis points and the corresponding drop in VIX is −1.04 percentage points,
both highly significant. Associated with relatively higher levels of heightened uncertainty,
the high-return group serves as a “turbo” version of the average FOMC results and paints a
sharper picture of our theory predictions.
    Given that the pre-announcement return is smaller for Nonfarm Payroll, GDP and ISM
compared to FOMC, we pool them together in our tests and refer to the group as Macro.
For this group, the average pre-announcement return is 9.01 basis points and statistically
significant with a t-stat of 4.41. The corresponding change in VIX, though, is on average
only 0.03 and statistically insignificant. This weak result on VIX is likely due to the fact
that Macro announcements are on average less impactful and bring lower uncertainty to the
market, the same reason why they have smaller pre-announcement returns. Also, as many
of the Macro announcements fall into the non regular trading hours, the lack of precise
VIX data could also contribute to the weak result. To mitigate these issues, we focus on
Macro announcements with the highest 30% pre-announcement returns, corresponding to
those with relatively higher levels of heightened uncertainty. For this high-return group, the
average pre-announcement return is 64.74 basis points and the average drop in VIX is 0.55
percentage points, both highly significant. The magnitudes of the pre-announcement returns
and the changes in VIX are also in proportion to those of the high-return group of FOMC.
    To the best of our knowledge, we are the first in the literature to show that the pre-

released either before or near the open of the regular trading hours. As such, the pre-announcement window
for the non-FOMC news largely consists of non-regular trading hours. The lack of liquidity in the after-hours
market may also contribute to the weaker and less precise results.


                                                     19
announcement drift is not unique to FOMC and has a broad presence in major macroe-
conomic announcements. We propose a new risk-based explanation that connect the pre-
announcement drift with the dissolution of heightened uncertainty during the pre-announcement
period. The overall empirical evidences are consistent with our theory prediction that the
pre-announcement drift, as a premium for heightened uncertainty, will occur whenever there
is a heightened uncertainty, and hence exist for both FOMC and Macro announcements.
Compared with FOMC, the magnitude of the pre-announcement return for macro announce-
ments are indeed smaller, but still comparable to FOMC and economically important.
   Several existing papers also have investigated macroeconomic announcements but do not
find significant pre-announcement returns. The key difference of our approach is that we
look at a time window immediately before these announcements, that is, from 4 pm on the
previous trading day to 5 minutes before news releases. As macro announcements are made
at 8:30 am, 9:15 am, and 10:00 am, all before or close to the market opening time, our
pre-announcement window includes the critical overnight returns before announcements. By
comparisons, Lucca and Moench (2015) use the daily return on the previous trading day and
Ai and Bansal (2018) use the return for the last five regular trading hours, which also fall
mostly on the previous trading day. To mitigate the concern that overnight returns might
be quite noisy, we base our return calculations on the transaction prices of S&P 500 futures,
which are traded almost around-the-clock and have good liquidity during the non-regular
trading hours.20

4.2.    Uncertainty Build-Up Prior to the Pre-Announcement Period
The Prediction 2 of our theory predicts that there should be an accumulation period when
uncertainty concerning an announcement gradually builds up. For this accumulation period,
we should observe an increase in uncertainty, captured by an increase in VIX, accompanied
by a downward price drift. We discuss the dynamics of uncertainty and return during the
accumulation period in this subsection.
   A challenge of our empirical tests is that we do not know the exact time of the accumu-
lation period. As FOMC and Macro announcements are pre-scheduled, investors can trade
  20
     Lucca and Moench (2015) use the intra-day tick data on the S&P 500 index; Ai and Bansal (2018)
use the prices of S&P 500 SPDR, an exchange-traded fund. Although with different data sources, we
think the key driver for our results is the definition of the pre-announcement window. In fact, using the
same data source as Ai and Bansal (2018) and adopting their approach of combining the four non-FOMC
macroeconomic indicators (NFP, GDP, ISM, and PPI), we find that the average return over our definition
of the pre-announcement window is 11 basis points with a significant t-stat of 3.81.

well in advance. As a result, the real impact on the market price and uncertainty is masked
over a relatively long time window. Moreover, not all announcements bring the same level
of uncertainty to the market and the accumulation period differs from announcement to

                                               21
announcement. For our empirical tests, we consider two time windows for this accumulation
period, one is from −3 days to the pre-announcement day (−1 day) and the other is from
−6 days. Using a fixed window across all announcements inevitably introduces noises in our
measurement and weakens the results. To compensate, we focus on the high-return group
for both FOMC and Macro announcements, which correspond to cases with more heightened
uncertainty. The results are reported in the bottom pattern of Table 3.
   During the first accumulation period from −3 days to −1 day, VIX increases by 1.22
percentage points for the high-return group of FOMC, which is statistically significant with
a t-stat of 2.32. The corresponding return during this accumulation period is −51.90 basis
point, as predicted, but not statistically significant with a marginal t-stat of −1.59. For the
high-return group of Macro announcements, VIX increases by 0.23 percentage points during
the accumulation period and the corresponding return is -14.50 basis points, as predicted.
But neither is significant. When we extend the accumulation period to −6 days to −1 day, all
results become significant. In particular, for the high-return group of FOMC, VIX increases
by 1.88 percentage points and return is −81.80 basis points during the accumulation period,
both statistically significant. For the high-return group of Macro announcements, the change
in VIX is 0.90 percentage points and the return is −40.40 basis points over the accumulation
period, both statistically significant. In other words, there are indeed subtle but significant
price depression and uncertainty build-up during a relatively long accumulation period.
   One potential concern of our results is that we use the pre-announcement return, which
might contain forward-looking information, to identify announcements associated with high
uncertainty. Could it be the case that there is always an increase in VIX prior to days with
large returns? To address this concern, we provide a set of placebo tests to show that Non-
Event days, with returns comparable to announcement days, do not experience heightened
uncertainty. We match each pre-scheduled announcement with a nearby Non-Event day
based on their close-to-close returns. The matched days are chosen from all non-event
trading days between two adjacent announcements so that the overall market conditions
are also similar. The results are reported in Table 3. Unlike pre-scheduled announcements,
these matched Non-Event days do not have significant price depression and VIX build-up
during the accumulation period. Put differently, the build-up in uncertainty is unique to
pre-scheduled announcements and is not a mechanical result that always precedes days with
large positive returns.
   As an additional test to avoid potential bias by looking only at the high-return group,


                                              22
we run a set of predictive regressions by using the changes in VIX during the accumulation
period to forecast future returns over the pre-announcement period. We find that lagged VIX
changes can indeed positively predict future pre-announcement return for FOMC and Macro
announcements. That is, announcements that bring higher level of heightened uncertainty
are associated with larger drift later at the pre-announcement period. By comparison, lagged
VIX changes can no longer predict future return on Non-Event days without pre-scheduled
announcements.
   In Table 4, the pre-announcement returns on FOMC and macro announcements are
regressed on lagged cumulative changes in VIX:

      Rt = a + b ∆VIX[t−3, t−1] + t ,                                                       (3)

and

      Rt = a + b ∆VIX[t−6, t−1] + t ,                                                       (4)

where the independent variable is demeaned so that the intercept can be read as the average
event day pre-announcement return. For both FOMC and Macro announcements, the lagged
cumulative changes in VIX is a significant predictor of future pre-announcement returns on
announcement days. For FOMC days, the regression coefficient is 3.66 with a t-stat of
2.20 for the cumulative changes in VIX from −3 days to −1 day. Given that the sample
standard deviation of the cumulative 3-day change in VIX is 2.50%, this result indicates that
one standard deviation increase in the lagged change in VIX results in a 9.15 basis points
increase in the pre-announcement return. Extending the lagged accumulation period to −6
days, the coefficient drops to 2.48 and no longer statistically significant. For Macro days, the
regression coefficient is 0.43 and not statistically significant for the accumulation period from
−3 days to −1 day. However, extending the accumulation period to −6 days, the coefficient
increases to 3.63 with a t-stat of 2.50. Though the length of the accumulation period differs
for FOMC and Macro announcements, the overall results are consistent with the hypothesis
that lagged changes in VIX can predict future pre-announcement returns on event days.
   We also provide a placebo test by running the above predictive regression on Non-Event
days, with the independent variable being the daily close-to-close S&P 500 index returns.
These Non-event days do not include pre-scheduled FOMC, high-impact macroeconomic
announcements (Non-farm Payroll, ISM, and GDP), or HVIX days. Without heightened
uncertainty, the lagged change in VIX should not predict future returns. Indeed, the re-

   Pre-announcement returns (in basis points) on FOMC and Macroeconomic (NFP, ISM,
   and GDP) are regressed on lagged changes in VIX (in percentage). Non-Event refers to all
   trading days that are not FOMC, NFP, ISM, GDP, and HVIX days. For Non-Event days,
   close-to-close returns on S&P 500 indexes (in basis points) are regressed on lagged changes
   in VIX (in percentage). The regressands are demeaned so that the intercept reflects the
   average event day returns. The sample period is from September 1994 to May 2018. The
   reported t-stat’s use Newey-West standard errors, adjusting for serial correlations.

gression coefficients are −0.61 and 0.33 for the respective accumulation periods, both are
statistically insignificant.
   To better illustrate the join dynamics of return and uncertainty, we plot the cumulative
return and the cumulative changes in VIX from −3 days to the announcement day (day
0), with Figure 1 for FOMC and Figure 2 for Macro announcements. Consistent with our
theory, for the high-return groups of both FOMC and macro announcements, there is a build
up in VIX during the accumulation period from −3 days to −1 day, followed by a drop in
VIX during the pre-announcement period from −1 day up to the announcement time.21
   Consistent with the VIX pattern, market prices drift downward as uncertainty builds
up during the accumulation period, and subsequently drift upward as uncertainty releases
during the pre-announcement period. The fact that both the high-return groups of FOMC
and macro announcements show similar pattern also confirm our theory prediction that
the pre-announcement drift is not unique to FOMC and should exist for all high impact
macroeconomic announcements.
  21
     The cumulative changes in VIX are based on the intra-day VIX tick value provided by CBOE. For
majority of our sample period, this dataset only covers the regular trading hours from 9:30 am to 4 pm.
For this reason, we do not plot the VIX values during the non-regular trading hours. The time 2:15 pm is
plotted as the announcement time for FOMC announcements. The announcement time is not plotted for
macro announcements as Nonfarm Payroll and GDP announcements are released at 8:30 am (before market
open) and ISM announcements are released at 10:00 am.

     For comparison, we also plot the the announcements with the lowest 30% pre-announcement
returns, refereed to as the low-return group, in the bottom panels of Figure 1 and Figure 2.
By construction, these announcements have negative pre-announcement returns and are as-
sociated with relatively lower levels of heightened uncertainty. Indeed, we do not observe
similar level of VIX build-up during the accumulation period, suggesting that uncertainty
associated with these announcements do not rise as sharply as the high-return groups. With-
out the build-up of heightened uncertainty during the accumulation period, there is also no
dissolution of uncertainty during the pre-announcement window.


5.     VIX Spikes

In addition to pre-scheduled announcements that naturally bring heightened uncertainty to
the market, heightened uncertainty can also be triggered unexpectedly by adverse market
conditions. Prediction 3 of our hypothesis predicts that there is a premium for such unex-
pected heightened uncertainty days as well. That is, although the heightened uncertainty
is triggered by a mechanism different from pre-scheduled announcements, they should have
similar premium as uncertainty dissolves. In this section, we first discuss how we select
these heightened uncertainty days based on VIX spikes in Section 5.1; then compare our
method with several alternatives based on extreme movements in price and volatility in Sec-
tion 5.2; and discuss the connection between heightened VIX days and the pre-scheduled
announcements in Section 5.3.

5.1.    Capturing Heightened Uncertainty using VIX Spikes
Heightened uncertainty can be triggered by severe, adverse market conditions, including
sudden drops in market price or sudden increases in market volatility. While both indicators
will be investigated later in the section, the main measure to be used in our investigation
is the CBOE VIX index. Computed from the prices of S&P 500 index options, VIX has
been widely monitored as the “fear gauge” of the overall financial markets. Unlike market
volatility, measured directly from the cash market, the information contained in VIX is con-
sidered to have a risk aversion component and is also believed to be forward looking (see, for
example, Pan (2002) and references therein). For these reasons, this index, among all market
indicators, offers the best opportunity for us to identify days of heightened uncertainty.
     Our sample starts from January 1986 to May 2018. For the early period from 1986
through 1989, when VIX was not available, we use the old VIX index (VXO). The sample

                                             27
average of VIX is 19.84%. To compare with FOMC and Macro announcements, we also
report results for the sub-period from September 1994 to May 2018. The main variable in
this section is the time-series of daily changes in VIX:

       ∆VIXt = VIXt − VIXt−1 .                                                                           (5)

It has a sample mean that is slightly negative but close to zero, and its full-sample stan-
dard deviation is 2.16%. The events surrounding the 1987 stock market crash significantly
affect its distribution, resulting in extreme values in its skewness and kurtosis. Taking out
October 1987, the sample standard deviation is 1.51%, skewness is close to 1 (with a t-stat
of 2.77), and kurtosis is 24 (with a t-stat of 6.09). Overall, this is a distribution marked by
large movements in the tails, with sudden spikes in VIX being more frequent and larger in
magnitude than sudden reductions in VIX. Our objective in this section is to use the tail
events associated the sudden spikes in VIX to capture heightened uncertainty in financial
markets and measure the premium for heightened uncertainty.
    We define day t+1 as of heightened VIX (HVIX) if ∆VIXt is larger than a pre-determined
constant cutoff value. As shown in Table 5, we experiment with different cutoff values,
ranging from 0% to 4%. With higher cutoff values, fewer days are selected, making the
events rarer. To smooth out the potential noise in daily changes in VIX, we also compare
the level of VIX relative to a exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) of its recent
past. More specifically, day t + 1 is defined as a heightened VIX day if:

       VIXt − µt−1 ≥ cutoff ,                                                                            (6)

where
                        t−1
                        X
       µt−1 = (1 − η)          η τ VIXt−τ −1 ,                                                           (7)
                        τ =0

with η serving as the decay factor. When η = 0, the simple version of daily change in VIX,
VIXt − VIXt−1 , is used. As shown in our results, this simple daily change in VIX does a
pretty good job in capturing heightened uncertainty, especially after 1990s. For the early
sample that includes the late 1980s, it helps to smooth the past VIX with a fast decay factor
such as η = 0.3.22
  22
      Using the exponentially weighted moving average of past VIX to select heightened VIX days is equivalent
to assuming an ARIMA(0,1,1) model for the VIX process. For the sample from January 1986 to May 2018, η
is estimated to be 0.14 with a standard error of 0.01. We therefore also report the results based on η = 0.15
in Table 5. However, it worth emphasizing that our results are robust to a wide range of values of η.

     VIX changes are calculated
                          P asτ VIXt − µt−1 ≥ Cutoff, where µt−1 is the exponentially weighted moving average of past VIX up to day
     t − 1. µt−1 = (1 − η) t−1
                             τ =0 η VIXt−τ −1 , with η serving as the decay factor. Daily returns on the S&P 500 index at day t + 1 are
     reported. “N Days” measures the average number of such “Heightened VIX” days per year. The sample period is from September
     1994 to May 2018 for the top panel and January 1986 to May 2018 for the bottom panel. The sample standard deviation of daily
     changes in VIX is 1.59% for the first sample from September 1994 to May 2018 and is 2.16% for the second sample period from
     January 1986 to May 2018.
   Our results are summarized in Table 5, which reports the average daily returns on the
S&P 500 index on the days after heightened VIX. Also reported are their t-stat’s. Overall,
these returns are significant both economically and statistically and are quite stable over
different specifications. In the bottom right panel, with η = 0.3 and cutoff value of 3%, the
average occurrence of heightened VIX is 7.6 days per calendar year, matching the FOMC fre-
quency. The average return associated with this heightened uncertainty is 48.04 basis points
with a t-stat of 2.71. Akin to the FOMC result, these disproportionately large returns are
realized on only a few days in a year. More importantly, these returns occur after heightened
uncertainty, when the “fear gauge” spikes up and the market price drops precipitously. We
therefore argue that these returns are the premium for the heightened uncertainty.
   One might question whether this premium can be captured in practice given that the
closing time for CBOE’s S&P 500 index options is at 4:15 pm, 15 minutes after the close of
the cash market at 4 pm.23 For this, we use the intraday tick data on CBOE VIX, which
is available after January 1992. As reported in Table 6, the results based on intraday VIX
measured at 3:30 pm or 3:45 pm are similar to those using the VIX Close. For example,
for the cutoff value of 3.0%, there are on average 6.5 heightened VIX days per year using
daily changes in VIX measured at 3:45pm, and 7.0 days per year using daily changes in VIX
Close. The average daily returns are 46.94 basis points and 43.32 basis points, respectively,
and both statistically significant.
   Our result indicates that using information as early as 3:45 pm, we can identify whether
heightened uncertainty has been triggered, and it leaves plenty time to buy S&P 500 index
futures or other cash products on the index at 4 pm to capture the average next-day return
of 46.94 basis points. This, however, is not money on the table, but premium for heightened
uncertainty. On the day of heightened VIX, the market price is severely depressed, reflecting
investors’ reluctance to bear the market risk. Only on the next day, when the heightened
uncertainty is resolved (or partially resolved), does market price start to recover, yielding the
46.94 basis points average return. Indeed, the change in VIX on the next day is on average
−1.15% and statistically significant. Extending this analysis to FOMC days, the same
mechanism of heightened uncertainty takes place. Prior to the announcement, investors are
unwilling to jump in because of heightened uncertainty. Only when this uncertainty is slowly
resolved does market price start to recover, yielding the 27.14 basis points pre-FOMC return.
  23
     Using the tick data on the CBOE VIX, we find that the pre-2003, the VIX Close is timed at 4pm, and
post-2003, the VIX Close is timed at 4:15pm.

     Daily changes in VIX are used to measure sudden changes in VIX, using Intraday VIX measured at 3:30 pm, 3:45 pm, 4:00 pm, and
     the CBOE close, respectively. Reported in ’Ret’ are the average daily returns after days of heigtened VIX, defined as a day when
     the daily change in VIX is above the ’Cutoff’ value. Also reported are the T-stat’s for the average returns. ’N Days’ measures the
     average number of such Heightened VIX days per year. The intraday data on CBOE VIX starts from 1992 and the sample period is
     from January 1992 to May 2018. The sample standard deviation of daily changes in VIX (close-to-close) is 1.54%.
5.2.    Can Heightened Uncertainty be Captured by Extreme Movements in
        Price and Volatility?
Given the close connection between market price and VIX, it is natural to question whether
heightened uncertainty can be captured by sudden drops in price. Table 7 examines this
possibility. After large price drops, the stock market does on average yield positive returns on
the next day, but the statistical significance of the results is weak. For the sample after 1990s,
the performance of this signal does improve. Overall, both signals, large price drop and large
VIX increase, capture the same information of heightened uncertainty. Indeed, the premium
of heightened uncertainty is realized out of the initial large price drop that accompanies the
heightened VIX. In terms of serving as a signal, however, VIX has more of an advantage,
partly because it is not as noisy as stock market returns. Moreover, although the correlation
between daily returns and daily changes in VIX is close to −70%, the information contained
is not entirely identical. Our result shows that VIX does perform better in capturing the
heightened uncertainty.

   Daily returns on the S&P 500 index are used. Intraday volatility is measured using 5-minute
   S&P 500 index returns and coverted to annual volatility. The heightened uncertainty days
   are picked if daily returns fall below the ‘Cutoff’ values or daily changes in volatility increase
   above the ‘Cutoff’ values. ’N Days’ measures the average number of such extreme days per
   year. The sample is from January 1986 to May 2018. The sample standard deviations are
   1.13% and 9.42%, respectively, for daily returns and daily changes in volatility.

   Another natural comparison is between VIX and volatility. Unlike VIX, which can be
measured daily or even intraday using S&P 500 index option prices, market volatility needs

                                                    32
to be calculated using time-series of stock market returns. To obtain daily measures of
volatility, we use intraday 5-minute returns on S&P 500 index futures. Table 7 shows that,
after large increase in volatility, the next-day returns are on average negative but statistically
insignificant. In other words, although the daily correlation between VIX and volatility is as
high as 77%, they contain very different information for the purpose of capturing heightened
uncertainty. In particular, the volatility component in VIX is not helpful in identifying
heightened uncertainty.
   Compared with VIX, the volatility measure using the intraday returns is noisier. But
the result in Table 7 cannot simply be explained by noise, as the sign of the average returns
is opposite to the results using increase in VIX or decrease in price. In fact, if we reverse
the sign of the signal by focusing on the extreme days when volatility suddenly drops, we
find next-day returns are on average positive. Moreover, extreme days captured this way
have very little overlap, less than 10%, with the extreme days captured by heightened VIX.
Overall, the contrast of the informational content in these two measures shows that it is the
fear or risk aversion component in VIX that is important in driving our result. It also raises
the question as to whether volatility is a reliable risk measure.24

5.3.    Connection with Pre-scheduled Announcements: Buildup and Release
        of Heightened Uncertainty
Although the heightened uncertainty are triggered unexpectedly by adverse market condi-
tions on HVIX days, the underlying mechanism that drives the join dynamics of return and
uncertainty is similar to pre-scheduled FOMC and Macro announcements. In the case of
HVIX days, uncertainty, proxied by VIX, increases quickly and then dissolves. Coupled
with this pattern of VIX, there is an initial drop and then an increase in market prices.
These patterns of reversal in VIX and return provide a direct mechanism over which the
premium for heightened uncertainty arises. In particular, it is the resolution of uncertainty
that gives rise to the significant increase in price; it is also the initial spike up in uncertainty
that gives rise to the initial decrease in price.
   To draw a direct comparison between heightened VIX days and pre-scheduled announce-
ments, we plot the patterns of cumulative returns and VIX in Figure 3. As a parallel to
  24
     Indeed, prior to important news announcements such as the FOMC days, markets are usually quiet with
low trading volume and low volatility, documented in the literature as “quiet-before-the-storm” by Bomfim
(2003) and Jones, Lamont, and Lumsdaine (1998).

pre-scheduled announcements, we label the selected heightened VIX days as Day 0.25 Sim-
ilar to the high-return groups of FOMC and Macro announcements, we see a clear pattern
of significant increase in price coupled with large reduction in VIX on Day 0. The average
return is 57.22 basis points and the average changes in VIX is −1.11 percentage points on
Day 0, both highly statistically significant.
      A more interesting comparison is what happens prior to Day 0. In the case of heightened
VIX, the substantial increase in VIX on Day −1 helps us identify the days of heightened
uncertainty. What happens over one day in the case of heightened VIX might take many
days to develop in the case of FOMC and other macro announcements since investors are
aware of the announcement well in advance and can plan accordingly. Over the window from
−6 days to −1 day, the average build up in VIX is 1.88% for the high-return group of FOMC
and 0.90% for the high-return group of Macro announcements. The build-up in VIX is much
subtler compared to the 6.28% build-up picked up by the heightened VIX days during the
same accumulation window. This is not surprising because, by construction, the heightened
VIX days are days when investors are caught off guard by the adverse market conditions.


6.        An Illustrative Model

In this section, we construct a simple asset pricing model, which captures two types of
risks. One risk is a directional news on the asset payoff; the other risk, also referred to as
uncertainty for distinction, is the magnitude of the impact of news on the asset payoff. The
resolution of these two risks occur at different times. We demonstrate that the resolution of
heightened uncertainty, followed by the resolution of the news itself can generate the return
and risk pattern similar to those around the times of FOMC and other macroeconomic
announcements as well as times of sharp rises in VIX, as outlined in Section 2.

Setup
Consider an economy with three dates, t ∈ {0, 1, 2}. There is a unit mass of identical,
infinitesimal, and competitive investors, who are endowed with zero unit of a riskless bond
and one share of a risky asset, also referred to as the stock. Each unit of the bond yields a
terminal payoff of 1 at t = 2. Each share of the stock pays a terminal dividend D at t = 2.
     25
     We plot the case for heightened VIX days selected based on exponentially weighted moving average of
past VIX with the decay factor η equals to 0.3. The pattern is robust to different choices of values for η.




                                                    35
D is given by:

        D = D̄ + σ ε                                                                         (8)

where D̄ is a positive constant, and σ and ε are two independent random variables. In
addition, σ 2 follows an exponential distribution with a mean of λ > 0, and ε follows a
standard normal distribution. D̄ then gives the expected dividend.
   In the context of this paper, ε captures the realization of a market-moving news, and σ
captures the size of its impact on asset fundamentals, which is uncertain ex ante. Heightened
uncertainty prior to news is represented by a high ex ante variance of σ. The resolution of
this uncertainty can occur before the realization of ε, the news itself.
   Let Et [·] and Vt [·] denote the conditional mean/expectation and variance of a random
variable at time t (t = 0, 1), respectively. The conditional mean and variance at t = 0 also
give the unconditional mean and variance, respectively, for which we drop the time subscript
for convenience. We then have:

        E [σ 2 ] = λ,   V [σ 2 ] = λ2 .                                                      (9)

Thus, a larger value of λ corresponds to a higher unconditional mean and variance of σ 2 .
   Both the bond and the stock are traded in a competitive financial market, at dates 0, 1
and 2. We will use the bond as the numeraire and denote the price of the stock at date t
as Pt , t ∈ {0, 1, 2}. Since the bond is the numeraire, its price is always one and its return is
zero.
   The time line for the economy is summarized as follows:

t = 0: Investors observes neither σ 2 nor ε. Based on the probability distributions of σ 2 and ε,
        they trade the stock (against the bond) by submitting competitive demand functions.

t = 1: Investors observe σ 2 but still not ε. With the resolution of uncertainty about the
        variance, they trade in the market again.

t = 2: The news ε is realized and dividend D is paid on the stock, and investors consume
        their terminal wealth.

   In addition, we assume that all investors have CARA utility over their terminal wealth:

        − exp{−αW2 },                                                                       (10)

where α > 0 is the risk aversion coefficient and W2 is the wealth at t = 2.

                                               36
   For the model to be well-defined, the following parameter condition is needed:
               2
      λ<          .                                                                        (11)
               α2
Since both the mean and variance of σ 2 are increasing in λ, condition (11) imposes upper
bounds on both of them. For now on, we assume (11) holds without repeating it.
   Several comments are in order before moving forward. First, our model is intentionally
simple, aimed at capturing two important risks, news risk and the uncertainty about its
impact, and their intertemporal resolution. Our main goal is to show qualitatively how such
a simple model can lead to the possible return and volatility dynamics observed in the data.
One can extend it into a fully intertemporal model to allow richer dynamics for the two risks.
Second, since we mainly care about the price implications of the model, we have abstracted
away from potential heterogeneity among investors and the actual trading between them.
One may add different types of heterogeneity, such as heterogeneous endowment shocks or
signals on σ 2 , and still obtains similar pricing implications. Third, assumptions on probabil-
ity distributions and investor preferences are made mainly for tractability. Thus, our results
are not meant to be robust but only illustrative.

Equilibrium
We solve the model backwards. Because investors are identical, we can solve the problem
of a generic investor, without loss of generality. We denote by Wt the wealth of a generic
investor at the end of date t, and denote by θt the investor’s demand of the risky asset at
date t.


Solution for date 1. An investor’s consumption at date 2 is:

      W2 = W1 + θ1 (D − P1 ).                                                              (12)

At date 1, the final dividend D is normally distributed with a known variance σ 2 . So the
investor’s problem is:

      max J1 ,                                                                             (13)
          θ1


where

     J1 = −E1 [exp {−α [W1 +θ1 (D−P1 )]}] = − exp −α W1 +θ1 (D̄−P1 )− 12 ασ 2 θ12 . (14)

                                              37
The investor’s demand function is then given by:
                   D̄ − P1
         θ1 =              .                                                                           (15)
                     ασ 2
From the market clearing condition θ1 = 1, the equilibrium stock price at t = 1 is:

         P1 = D̄ − α σ 2 .                                                                             (16)


Solution for date 0. Substituting the date-1 equilibrium strategies into J1 , we get:

         J1 = − exp −α W0 + θ0 (D̄−ασ 2 −P0 ) + 12 ασ 2 ,

where we have also used W1 = W0 + θ0 (P1 − P0 ).
    Recall that at t = 0, investors have an exponential probability distribution over σ 2 with
mean λ and variance λ2 . So the investor’s expected continuation value is:

    The following proposition summarizes the equilibrium stock prices.

Proposition 1 The equilibrium stock price at dates 0 and 1 are given by (21) and (16),
respectively.

   In order to capture the uncertainty about σ, we consider a forward-looking variance swap,
which pays (D − P1 )2 at t = 2. Its price, denoted by vt , is given by:
                0
           Et [Jt+1 vt+1 ]
      vt =        0
                           , t = 0, 1, v2 = (D − P1 )2 ,                                        (22)
             Et [Jt+1 ]
       0                       0
where Jt+1 is a shorthand for Jt+1 (Wt+1 ), and J2 = − exp{−αW2 }. We then have the
following result for the price of the variance swap:

Proposition 2 The equilibrium price of variance swap at dates 0 and 1 are given by:
                                                                     1 2 2

                                                                       α λ
      v1 = σ , v0 =                         , E [v1 − v0 ] = −                   < 0.           (23)
                              1 − 12 α2 λ                        1   − 21 α2 λ

The price of the variance swap can be viewed as equivalent to VIX squared as a measure of
uncertainty.

Return and Volatility
An immediate implication from the model is that there is a positive return or risk premium
realized from the stock at date 1, as the uncertainty about σ resolves:
                                                              
                        αλ             2           λ
      E [P1 − P0 ] =             − αE[σ ] = α               − λ = −α E [v1 − v0 ] > 0,          (24)
                     1 − 12 α2 λ                1 − 21 α2 λ

where we have used the fact that E [σ 2 ] = λ. The associated return variance at date 1 is:

      V [P1 − P0 ] = α2 V[σ 2 ] = α2 λ2 .                                                       (25)

Likewise, the price drift and variance at date 2 are:

      E [P2 − P1 ] = E [D − D̄ + ασ 2 ] = αλ,                                                   (26)

      V [P2 − P1 ] = E [(P2 − P1 )2 ] − [E[P2 − P1 ]]2 = E [(D − D̄ + ασ 2 )2 ] − α2 λ2
                          = E [σ 2 + α2 σ 4 ] − α2 λ2 = λ + α2 λ2 ,                             (27)

when the news (ε) is realized. Here, we use the unconditional moments because they match
the empirical tests.
   The following proposition summarizes the stock’s return and its variance in the two dates.

Proposition 3 The date-1 return is higher than the date-2 return, i.e., E [P1 −P0 ] > E [P2 −
                   1
P1 ] when λ >      α2
                      .   The date-1 return variance is always lower than the date-2 return variance,
i.e., V [P1 − P0 ] < V [P2 − P1 ].

Price Dynamics Hypothesis in Section 2
The solution of the model easily maps back to the reduced-form formulation of price and
risk dynamics hypothesized in Section 2. In particular, for (2), we have

      P2 − P1 = (D − D̄) − (−ασ 2 ),                                                  (28a)
                | {z } | {z }
                    ∆F2        a ∆V2
                                  1 2       
                          2
                                  2
                                     α λ
      P1 − P0 = − α σ − λ − αλ −               .                                      (28b)
                  | {z }         1 − 12 α2 λ
                    a ∆V1   |     {z         }
                                          b ∆U1

That is, at t = 2, there is direct news about the asset payoff, which implies a reduction in
the variance of the asset payoff from σ 2 to zero. At t = 1, there is no directly news about
the asset payoff, but there is information about its variance (jumping from the prior λ to
σ 2 ), which reduces the uncertainty about the return variance as captured by ∆U1 . In our
model, this change in uncertainty is given by the change in the price of the variance swap
(i.e., v1 − v0 , up to a constant multiplier).

Empirical Evidence
As shown above, our model delivers directly the price and risk dynamics hypothesized in
Section 2. It also yields the corresponding predictions.
   In the case of macro announcements, we can identify the announcement period as from
date 1 to 2, when the macro announcement (ε) is made, the pre-announcement period as
from date 0 to 1, when the uncertainty (about σ) is resolved, and the accumulation period
as from date −1 to 0, when uncertainty (λ) hikes up. Proposition 3 and 2 then immediately
leads to Prediction 1 and 2 when VIX is used instead of the price of variance swap.
   In the case of VIX spike, we can apply the model similarly. An unanticipated increase in
VIX corresponds to an increase in λ, the uncertainty about σ 2 . This will then be followed
by a positive return as σ 2 realizes and the uncertainty about it resolves, accompanied by
a decrease in VIX and a relatively low return volatility. Prediction 3 follows from the
above propositions. In this case, the VIX spike is stochastic, different from the case of
announcements with deterministic timing, and the resolution of the fundamental risk (i.e.,
about ε) is gradual over time, not necessarily within a given time frame.
   Our empirical analysis of the return and risk (including both VIX and return variance)
patterns around macro announcements (FOMC, NFP, ISM and GDP) and VIX spikes are
clearly supportive of the model’s predictions.

                                                  40
     Although our model is overly simplified, it can be extended into a richer intertempo-
ral model with more dimensions including investor heterogeneity, learning and information
asymmetry. These extensions may lead to additional testable implications to shed more light
on the nature of the underlying uncertainty and its resolution mechanism that are driving
the price patterns.


7.     Conclusions

In this paper, we provide compelling evidence that FOMC days are not unique in yield-
ing the disproportionately large returns. We document, for the first time in the literature,
economically and statistically significant pre-announcement returns for the pre-scheduled re-
leases of macroeconomic indicators such as Nonfarm Payroll, ISM, and GDP. Motivated by
this commonality in pre-announcement returns, we propose a simple risk-based explanation.
In particular, we argue that there are two different risks: the news itself and the uncer-
tainty associated with the news’ impact. We hypothesize that pre-scheduled announcements
naturally bring heightened uncertainty to the market during a relatively long accumulation
period and this heightened uncertainty starts to dissolve at a condensed pre-announcement
period prior to the actual news releases. While the accumulation of the heightened uncer-
tainty depress market prices, its dissolution leads to significant positive return during the
pre-announcement period. Using CBOE VIX as an empirical gauge for uncertainty, the
joined pattern of uncertainty and return are overall consistent with our model predictions.
In addition, we show that heightened uncertainty can also be triggered unexpectedly by
adverse market conditions. The next-day return following days with large VIX spike-ups
are significant and with magnitudes comparable to the pre-announcement returns on news
release days. That is, as long as we focus our attention on such heightened uncertainty days,
either pre-scheduled or stochastically triggered, we will be confronted with this pattern of
seemingly large abnormal returns which are in fact the premium for heightened uncertainty.
