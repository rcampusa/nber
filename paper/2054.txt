                 A Test of International CAPM




                           ABSTRACT




     We propose and implement a Wald test of               the
international capital asset pricing model.    Ex post asset
returns are regressed on asset supplies. CAPM reequires that
the matrix of coefficients from a regression of n rates of
return on n asset supply shares be proportional to the
covariance matrix of the residuals from those regressions.
We test this restriction in the context of a model that
aggregates all outside financial assets for each of ten
countries.     We do    not find strong support for the
restrictions of CAPM.

1..     Introduction


        The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is a popular description of

investors' behavior, but one which has received mixed support empirically. As

applied to international asset markets, it implies that demand for foreign

bonds depends on real exchange rate risk and real rates of return.     In this

paper we propose a simple Wald test of CAP?1, and apply the test to a ten

country asset pricing model.

        Our test is closely related to a test of CAPM implemented by Frankel

(1982..1983a,1983b,1984) in several recent papers. Unlike previous tests of the

model, the Frankel procedure allows completely unrestricted movements in

expected returns and in "betas" (the covariance of an asset's rate of return

and the market rate of return).     It also formulates a natural alternative

hypothesis to CAPM, thus allowing a statistical test of the restrictions

imposed by CAPM. The technique we employ retains almost all the desirable

properties of the Frankel test but eliminates perhaps its biggest difficulty
-—    the fact that if the market consists of n assets, n2 parameters must be

estimated with an extremely complex, nonlinear maximum likelihood procedure.

We replace Frankel's likelihood ratio test with a Wald test. The Wald test

requires estimation without imposing the restrictions of the CAPM model ——

which in this case implies that only least squares regressions are employed.

Because estimation is easier, we can extend the empirical model to include

larger collections of assets.

       As a general model, one might estimate a system of equations in which the

expected return of any asset is a linear function of the shares of all assets
                                     -2—


in the market portfolio. CAPM constrains the matrix of coefficients from

these regressions to be proportional to the variance-covariance matrix of the

regression errors of the system. The Wald test looks to see if the matrix of

coefficients that comes from the unconstrained estimation is proportional to

the estimated covariance matrix of the residuals. This procedure requires

only the output from OLS regressions. Furthermore, since there are

closed-form expressions for OLS estimates and for the Wald statistic, our

results are completely reproducible The same cannot be claimed for Frankel's

technique, which employs.a "hill-climbing" method to find the maximum of the

complicated restricted likelihood function. There, the estimated coefficients

will depend on such things as the size of the steps taken in climbing the

hill, and the degree of precision set for the estimates.

     We apply the Wald test of CAPM to an international asset pricing model.

There are ten assets which represent aggregate bonds held by the public in ten

currencies of denomination. In some ways this model performs better than

previous smaller-scale models. When we have a priori convictions about the

signs of coefficients they usually turn out to be correct in the estimation.

In a joint test of the significance of all the restrictions of CAPM, we find

we cannot reject the model at the 5 percent level. However, the CAPM

hypothesis imposes a very large number of restrictions, so, given the limited

data set (141 monthly observations), the test seems to have low power. A test

of a subset of the restrictions of the hypothesis strongly rejects the CAPM

model.

     Section 2 of this paper reviews the CAPM hypothesis and discusses the

relative merits of the likelihood ratio and the Wald tests. In Section 3, we
                                              —3-


 use the Wald method to test international CAPM. First we use the data set of

 Frankel and Engel (1984) so that we can directly compare our test to

 Frankel's. Then we use the Wald test on a larger model over a longer time

 period. The concluding section discusses the limitations of these tests, and

 outlines the possibilities for future research. In the Appendix, we present

 the formulas for calculating the Wald statistic.



2.      Testing CAPM


        It is useful in     developing   our test to review the capital—asset-pricing

model.1 A well-known relation that emerges from CAPH is that for any asset i,


(1)          Et(r—r0) = itEt(rmt—rot)

where

             r1 = real      return on asset i from time t to t+1

             r0 = riskiess real rate of return
             rmt =   real   return on the market portfolio.

The coefficient it is, in general, a time-varying coefficient that is defined

as


(2)          it =    Covt(r1,   rmt)/Vart(rmt).


        Using equation (2), we could rewrite (1) as the "security market line"


(3)          Et(r—r0) = p Covt(r1, rmt)

where
                                                  —4-



(4)            p =      Et(rmt_r0t)/Vart(rmt).

The coefficient p is known in the finance literature as the market price of

risk --   it       represents the tradeoff between the expected return on the market

portfolio and the variance of return on that set of assets. A critical

assumption is that this "price" is constant over time. In a representative

investor model, this variable can be shown to be equal to the investor's

coefficient of relative risk aversion, which might plausibly be constant. In

reality, the variable could change over time if investors do not have constant

relative risk aversion, or if there are significant income redistribution

effects. However, the assumption of constancy of p seems quite innocuous

compared to some other common assumptions made to test CAPM (see Frankel

(1982,1984) for a discussion of these).

      Since there is no asset that is riskless in real terms, to implement (3)

empirically, it is useful to rewrite expected returns relative to the return

on asset 1:



(5)
               E(r—rit) = p Cov(r—rit, rmt)
               = p
                        Cov(r—r1, r1) + p Cov(r1—rit, rmt—rlt).

The return on the market portfolio is a weighted average of returns on each of

the individual assets:

                             n
               r
                   mt
                        =    ZA.r.
                               jt jt
                            j=1

where
                        =   ratio   of the value of outstanding shares of asset j   to   the
                                           —5—


                  value of all assets.

Therefore, we can write

           Covt(r1t_r1, rmt_rit) =
 (6)

                                   r_r1).

One can see that Covt(r.-ri, rmt_r1t) could vary over time either because

supplies of assets (the As) change, or because the underlying stochastic

process of returns is time-varying, meaning that Cov(r1t, r) is not

constant. We assume only the As move over time.

        Let z. r. -       r1.   and then use (6) to recast (5) as


(7)        Etz.t =    Cov(z., ri) + p       ZX.Cov(z., zt).

In matrix form we have


(8)        Etzt = p Cov(zt, r1) +


where

           z vector of asset returns relative to asset 1, j=2,...n

             =   vector   of asset shares, j=2,...n

             =
                 Et(zt—Etzt)(zt—Etzt)'.
If expectations are rational

           z = Etzt   +

where     is a vector of forecast errors. So, (8) may be written as a system

of regression equations
                                                 -6-



(9)         z, = c + BAt +


       Equation (9) could be a general equation that says the return on an asset
is related to the supplies of all assets in a linear way. Note, however, that

the variance-covariance matrix of                is Q. Therefore, the restriction that

CAPM places on the general system (9) is that the matrix of regression

coefficients B be proportional to the covariance matrix of the residuals.

Frankel's method of testing CAPM is to compare the likelihood of the system (9)

without imposing any restrictions on B to the likelihood obtained from

estimating (9) under the restriction that B be proportional to 7. The

likelihood ratio test will fail to reject CAPM if the estimated likelihood with

the restriction imposed is not significantly smaller than the likelihood from

the unrestricted regressions.

       The effect on the expected return of asset i (relative to asset 1) of an

increase in the share of asset j is given by the coefficient b3. The CAPM

hypothesis is that this multiplier is proportional to the covariance of the

return on asset i to the return on asset j (each expressed relative to the

return on asset 1), with the constant of proportionality being the market price

of risk. That is,2


(10)                 =   p   ,   V   i   ,   j
where
                     ,th   element of B
            b1 =
                =
                    ..th   element of Q.

Since the unconstrained estimation of (9) provides estimates of B and Q, by
                                      —7—


 taking the ratios of corresponding elements of the matrices we obtain

 (n-i)2 separate estimates of p. We can then construct a Wald statistic that

 tests the proposition that all of the ratios are equal.

     The Wald-test is equivalent (to the first order) to the likelihood-ratio

test in large samples, but does not require calculation of the restricted

estimates. Estimation of (9) unrestricted requires only n-i ordinary least

squares regressions, each with n-I. right-hand-size variables. Calculation of

the Wald statistic, which is discussed in the Appendix, requires some

relatively simple matrix manipulations involving the data and the estimated

residuals from the regressions. The price for this increased simplicity is

that, if the null hypothesis is true, the unconstrained estimates of B are

less efficient than the estimates of B with the constraint imposed.



3.   Testing International CAPM


     A hypothesis of considerable interest in international finance is that

international investors are risk neutral and have rational expectations. If

this hypothesis were true, speculators would drive the expected real returns

on all assets into equality (see Engel (1984)).   If anticipated real returns

differ among assets, there may be a lack of efficient speculation, but there

may alternatively be a risk premium separating their returns.

     The capital asset pricing model outlined in Section 2 provides a

framework for assessing the possibility of risk premia driving a wedge between

anticipated real returns on assets from different countries. This section

takes the approach of aggregating the obligations of each of the countries
                                     -8-


included in the study and considering the real returns on those assets. If

the expected interest rates do differ on these assets, a risk premium is a

likely suspect if the restrictions of the CAPM model cannot be rejected.

Otherwise, we might need to explore the possibility that expectations are not

rational or that asset markets are not fully efficient.

     We wish to have as our measure of asset supplies the amount of debt held

by the public denominated in each currency. The measured asset stocks for

each country are essentially the cumulated value of that country's government

deficits. We must correct this figure, however, to allow for foreign exchange

intervention by the country's central bank, intervention into that country's

currency by other central banks, and debt originally issued in foreign

currencies.

     The real returns for each asset are calculated as [(1+i)(1+d)/(1+jr)1-1,

where I is the interest rate, d is the rate of depreciation of the currency

relative to the dollar, and ii is a dollar inflation index,   it is calculated as

a weighted average of inflation rates of CPIs in all the countries (converted

into dollars) with the weights equalling GNP shares.

     The first set of regressions uses the data for six countries that were

used by Frankel and Engel (1984). That data set includes asset supplies for

the U.S., Germany, Japan, Canada, France and England from June 1973 to August

1980. The interest rate used in calculating real returns is the return on one

month Eurocurrency assets.

     Table 1 reports the OLS regressions that correspond to equation (9). In

these regressions, dollars are taken as the numeraire asset. A cursory glance

at these estimates suggest that the relation between asset supplies and
                                     -9—


returns -is weak. Few of the coeff-ic-ients are significantly different from

zero. Furthermore, four of the five diagonal coefficients, which we expect to

be positive, are negative. The only positive diagonal coefficient --   for   the

yen --   is   not significant.

     Even though the unrestricted model does not fit the data well, -it is

still possible that we could be unable to reject the restriction that all p's

are equal. Table 2 presents estimates of the covariance matrix 2. A quick

check reveals that there are, ir fact, wide variations in the b../w... Again,

this does not necessarily invalidate the restriction because the coefficients

could be estimated with a low degree of precision.

     The Wald statistic for the test that all p's are equal is x2(24)=45.36.

This rejects the null hypothesis at the 1 percent level.

     The estimated p's are not very close to 2, so, not surprisingly, the test

of the hypothesis that all the p's are equal to 2 can easily be rejected at

the 1 percent level. The statistic in this case is X2(25)=45.45. This

corresponds to the test in Frankel and Engel. They also reject the null

hypothesis and report a likelihood ratio test statistic of 2(25)59.O. Thus,

even with a limited number of observations the Wald statistic and the LR

statistic are quite close.

     The next set of regressions uses asset supplies and returns -From ten

countries from April 1973 to December 1984. This collection includes the

original six countries plus Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Switzerland.

The asset supply data comes from Giavazzi and Giovannini (1986). The interest

rates are government bond yields which, along with the exchange rate and price

data, are collected from International Financial Statistics.
                                       -10-


     The regressions corresponding to equation (9) are reported in Table 3,

and Table 4 contains estimates of 2. We tested each by equation for

autocorrelation of the error terms using the Breusch (1978) and Godfrey (1978)

test, allowing for serial correlation up to a twelfth order AR or MA process.

Only in the case of the Canadian regression did we find even remote evidence

of correlated residuals, so we made no corrections for this problem.

     We also tested for heteroskedasticity using the White (1980) test. Here

we did find evidence of a problem --   five   of the tests were significant at the

5 percent level. However, no statistic was significant at the 1 percent

level. A general correction for heteroskedasticity in this model might be

quite difficult because, under the null hypothesis, the coefficient matrix

would vary over time if the variance matrix did. OLS regressions do not yield

consistent estimates of the residuals. Given the somewhat weak evidence for

heteroskedasticity, we attempt no correction, while recognizing this may

render our test statistics inconsistent.

     The results reported in Table 3 are somewhat more encouraging than those

from the smaller model. Six of the nine diagonal elements have the postulated

positive sign. None of the three that are negative is significantly different

from zero. Moreover, we cannot reject the restrictions of the CAPM

hypothesis. The statistic for equality of all the p's is x2(80)=100.98. The

statistic for the test that all the p's are 2 is x2(81)=1O1.04. Neither can

reject at the 5 percent level of significance. This is the opposite

conclusions from the one reached using only six assets.

     There is, however, evidence that the test has low power. We are testing

a very large number of restrictions. Tables 3 and 4 reveal that the point
                                           —11—


estimates of the p's vary greatly. We must conclude that they are est-imated

with low precision. For example, we are also unable to reject (at the 5

percent level) the hypothesis that all p's are zero. This would imply that

the risk-neutral uncovered interest parity formulation holds.

     One way to increase the power of the test is to test only a subset of the

restrictions. When we test for equality only of the diagonal p's, we test

only eight restrictions. This hypothesis is easily rejected at the 1 percent

level.




4.   Conclusion


     The evidence presented in Section 3 does not provide strong support f or

international CAPM. However, it does apply a methodology that might be useful

in future work in this area. There are still several weaknesses of tests of

this nature, several of which are discussed by Frankel and Engel. In our

conclusion, we will concentrate on a problem that they did not discuss in

great detail.

     This type of test of CAPM requires that the vector of asset shares

contain correctly measured shares of all assets available to investors.

Aggregation of assets is only strictly correct if the assets lumped together

are perfect substitutes -in   investors'   portfolios. There are several reasons

why the data set used here, though very carefully constructed, may fall short

of the ideal.

     To begin with, the aggregation of all obligations of a government into a

single asset is clearly inappropriate. For example, long-term bonds and
                                        —12—


short-term bonds certainly have different risk characteristics.

     The vector of assets described here contains no measure of real assets.

For example, Frankel (1984) uses measures of the value of the housing stock

and other tangible assets, and the value of corporate equities in his study

using U.S. data. This, too, suffers from too much aggregation. All stocks

are collected together as a single asset, when, in fact, CAPM was originally

formulated as an explanation of how risk and return characteristics of stocks

differ.

     Clearly, a good test of an international version of CAPM will require

many right-hand-side variables. We have claimed as an advantage for the Wald

test the simplicity of its estimation technique and the ease with which

results can be reproduced. We also believe that it has a large advantage in

terms of the size of the model that can be handled. There are some problems

of dimensionality with the Wald test.     It requires, if there are n assets,

estimation of n-i regressions, each with n-i regressands. Furthermore, the

calculation of the Wald statistic requires inversion of a matrix with (n-1)2-i

rows and columns. Although these might require a large amount of calculation,

there are very efficient programs written for OLS estimation and matrix

inversion. On the other hand, the constrained likelihood estimation could be

very time consuming and expensive. At each iteration on the parameter

estimation a n(n-i)/2 x n(n-i)/2 matrix must be inverted (as opposed to a

one-time inversion of a slightly larger matrix in calculating the Wald

statistic). If n is very large, the maximization routine may require many

iterations to achieve convergence. Furthermore, the matrix inversion

technique imbedded in most maximization routines is unlikely to be as
                                     —13-


efficient as one that can be called separately for the one-time inversion

required for the Wald statistic.

     We believe there is still promise in testing international CAPM. Much

work is left to be done in assembling good data sets. The principle of the

Frankel technique seems correct, but, because of dimensionality problems, and

the difficulty of estimating the constrained likelihood function, there does

not seem to be much hope of applying his method directly to large systems.

The Wald test, though, offers a more feasible alternative.

       If 0 is a vector of parameters, and we wish to test the hypotheses

             h(9) =    0        i=i,...,p

the Wald statistic provides a test of the closeness to zero of the vector


             h(0) =
                      (h1(0),    h2(0) ...   h(0))'
where the      represents the estimated values of parameters.

     If there are s parameters, let H.. be the sxp matrix
                                     9
          H..  (ah.(o)/ao.].

            0
Furthermore, let B represent the estimated information matrix of the
                       0
parameters. Then, if there are T observations, the Wald statistic, given by

               =   T(h(0)]'(H'B:1H]1[h(9)],
                                009
is asymptotically distributed x2(r).

       In our case, we want to test the hypothesis that the              are equal

for all I and j.       If there are n assets, there are n—i regressions, and

(n-i)2 coefficients in the B matrix. This implies that there are (n-1)2—1

independent constraints to be tested. There are many different ways to write

these constraints (for example b11/c11 = b12/,i12, b12/w12 = b13/w13, etc., or

b12/w12 =    b11/11,       b13/w13 = b11/w11, etc.) but the calculated value of the

Wald statistic, in this instance, is independent of the way the constraint is

written. We choose to express the constraints relative to the last element --

that   is,


             b1/w1 - bn...i,n_i/Wn...i,n...i    =   0.

In the tests we report in Section 3, the elements in our h(6) are obtained by
                                           —15—


 reading across B in rows ——    (with   n=6) the first element is b11/w11 -
                                                                                          b55/w55,
then b12/w12 -                                    ...                 -
                  b55/co55, b13/w13 -   b55/55              b54/w54       b55/w55.
     Each row of H.. contains the derivative of every constraint with respect

to one parameter. The first (n-i)2 rows of H contain the derivatives of

constraints with respect to the elements of the B matrix. Again, the

parameters are taken from B row by row. There are only n(n—1)/2 independent

parameters in Q. The next n(n-1)/2 rows of H.. are comprised of the
                                                        0
derivatives of the constraints with respect to the elements of Q.                    If     is

expressed in lower triangular form, the elements of Q are taken row by row

(i.e., with n=6, WU, 21 22                         w55).        It is useful to write the

matrix H as


          H =
                [:I
where H1 is (n—i)2 x E(n—1)2—i] and H2 is [n(n—1)/2) x [(n—i)2—l).

     The inverse of the information matrix is given by


          B1——      11
                    0
                        V22

In this matrix, if E is the estimated covariance matrix of the right-hand-side

variables, then

          Vii =     x

The matrix V22 is the covar-iance matrix of the estimates of .                   The element

corresponding to the covariance of Wpq and rs is given by WprWqs +
                                                                                     ps"qr
(see Rothenberg (1973), pp. 87—88).

     From above, the expression for the Wald statistic can be rewritten as

          T(h(9)]'[HV11H1 +     HV22H2][h(e)].
Notice that the statistic requires only the estimated coefficients, the

covariance matrix of the residuals, and the covariance matrix of the asset
                                     —16-


shares. All calculations for the test statistic, as well as for the

estimation, involve only simple linear algebra.

     If one had a prior belief that the coefficient of relative risk aversion

were some number, the test would be altered slightly For example, Frankel and

Engel impose the condition p=2, and test the restriction B=2I. The equivalent

set of restrictions for the Wald test are

                     = 2 V i, j.


Section 3 reports this test as well. There are now (n-i)2 independent
restrictions, so h(D) is a (n-i)2 vector and H. is [(n-i)2 +   (n(n-1)/2)]   x
                                              0

     Section 3 also considers a test of the first—type, but only on the

diagonal elements:

          b/w1 = bn_i,n_i/Wn_i,n_i     V i.

This examines oily a subset of the restrictions imposed by CAPM, paying

attention to effects of increased value of outstanding shares of an asset on

its own return, but ignoring cross-effects.

                                   Foot notes


1.   This discussion draws on Frankel's (1983b) presentation of his CAPM test.

2.   There is a possibility that      =   0,   i   j,   so that the ratio b1/w is

undefined. Under most plausible assumptions of the underlying forces that

determine the forecast errors, this would be an event with probability zero.

Nonetheless, this may be a justification for testing equality only of the

ratio of the diagonal elements, as is done in Section 3. One might consider

writing the constraints in such a way as to avoid possible division by zero,

such as b11w12 =
                   b12w11, b12w13 = b13w12, etc. However, unlike the test for
equality of the p's. the calculated test statistic will depend on the way the

constraints are written. The statistic for the test b11w12 =
                                                                   b12w11, b12w13 =

b13w12, etc. will not be the same as the one for b11w12 =      b1211,   b11w13 =

b13w11, etc.
3.   The discussion of the Wald test draws on Silvey (1975).
