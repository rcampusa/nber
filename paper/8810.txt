                                             ABSTRACT

        The purpose of this paper is to examine the causal impact of alcohol and illicit drug use on
suicidal behaviors among college students. Every year, more American youth die from suicide than from
all leading natural causes of death combined. Substance use has been identified as a leading risk factor
in suicidal behaviors. We use instrumental variables to estimate a structural model of suicidal thoughts
and attempts. A reduced form equation is also estimated which directly relates the determinants of alcohol
and drug use to suicidal behaviors. Data come from the Core Institute’s Alcohol and Drug Surveys of
College Students. The results are consistent with a causal mechanism from alcohol and illicit drug
consumption to suicide thoughts and attempts.

A.     INTRODUCTION

       Every year, more American youth die from suicide than from all leading natural causes of

death combined. In 1997, 13 percent of deaths in the 15-24 year old age group were the result of

suicide, making suicide the third largest cause of death among youth behind accidents and

homicides (Hoyert et al. 1999). In the 1999 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a national survey of

high-school students, 9 percent of respondents reported a suicide attempt, and 18 percent

reported having seriously considered suicide in the past year. Community surveys indicate that

between 12 and 25 percent of school-age youth engage in suicide ideation, ranging from

nonspecific thoughts about suicide to suicide planning with intent to die (Brent 1989). Suicide

ideation is a leading risk factor in completed suicide; moreover, clinicians believe that suicide

ideation is psychologically harmful in and of itself.

       The current prevalence of suicide among youth reflects long-term growth in this

outcome. Between 1950 and 1990, the suicide rate among 15-24 year olds in the United States

tripled. For this reason, many schools, communities, and states have made youth suicide

prevention a top public health priority. Most efforts at the school and community level focus on

identifying suicidal youth and targeting known risk factors for suicidal behaviors. School and

community-based suicide prevention efforts are implemented in a variety of ways, such as

through gatekeeper systems (e.g., systems directed by teachers, clergy or community leaders),

peer support groups, suicide education, and formal screening programs. Because there is a dearth

of evaluation literature in this area, however, no credible evidence exists to suggest that any of

these programs are effective in reducing suicidal behaviors (O’Carroll et al. 1992).

       Similarly, there is no evidence that state-level policies intended specifically to prevent

suicide among youth are effective. In a survey of youth suicide prevention efforts, Metha et al.




                                                  2
(1998) report that nearly all 50 states have developed, and distributed widely, educational

materials intended to prevent suicide. Many states also report sponsoring research on adolescent

suicide and creating task forces to address youth suicide. Other states have plans for suicide

prevention, or state-sponsored screening programs to identify suicidal youth. However, Metha et

al. show that these state policies are uncorrelated with state-level suicide rates.

       The absence of known effective policies to reduce suicidal behaviors and the seriousness

and high prevalence of these behaviors necessitate additional research so that public policies can

begin to effectively address the problem. Previous research has identified several risk factors

that are associated with suicidal behaviors and one of the most important of these factors is

substance use and abuse. There is a strong, empirical link between substance use and suicide

ideation (suicidal thoughts or plans), suicide attempts, and completed suicide among youth

(Crumley 1990). What remains unknown, however, is whether or not substance use has a causal

effect on young people's risk of attempting suicide, completing suicide, or engaging in suicide

ideation. Previous research has not established a causal relationship between substance use and

suicidal behaviors because it has either failed to consider the potentially confounding effect of

other causes of suicidal behaviors (e.g., depression), or because it has failed to recognize that

causality may in fact run from suicide ideation to substance use and abuse.

       If substance use is a causal determinant of suicidal behaviors, then policies designed to

reduce the consumption of alcohol and illicit drugs may succeed in reducing suicidal behaviors

as well. There is considerable evidence from the health economics literature that policy makers

can influence substance use among young people through alcohol and illicit drug policies such as

higher taxes and restrictions on availability (Leung and Phelps 1993; Grossman et al 1998;

Pacula 1998; Saffer and Chaloupka 1999; Dee 1999). Researchers also have demonstrated that




                                                  3
these policies, through their impact on youthful substance use, lead indirectly to higher

educational attainment, reductions in violence, and reductions in deaths from motor vehicle

accidents (Cook and Moore 1993; Markowitz 2001; Wagenaar 1993).

       In this paper, we examine the causal role of alcohol and drug consumption in determining

suicidal thoughts and attempts by young adults. A structural model is examined to provide

evidence for or against a causal relationship between substance use and these suicidal behaviors.

A reduced form equation is also estimated which directly relates the determinants of

consumption to suicidal behaviors. Data come from the Core Institute’s Alcohol and Drug

Surveys of College Students (Core). It is particularly important to study college students

because even though suicide rates are higher among college-age youth compared to high-school

age youth, almost all suicide prevention efforts have been targeted at high-school age youth

(O’Carroll et al. 1992).

       We find that substance use is strongly associated with suicide ideation and suicide

attempts among college students. This relationship is consistent with a causal explanation in

several cases. For example, drinking, as measured by the number of alcohol beverages

consumed in a week and by binge drinking, increases the likelihood of suicide ideation even after

controlling for unobserved heterogenity. Evidence for a causal relationship is less robust, but

still suggestive, when suicide attempts and illicit drugs are considered. The reduced form models

suggest that higher beer prices reduce suicide ideation, with the implication that substance use

policies such as higher beer taxes may be useful in reducing suicide ideation among college

students.

B.     SUBSTANCE USE, PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS AND SUICIDAL BEHAVIORS

       Suicidal behaviors are thought to be caused by multiple psychiatric, biological, familial,

and situational factors. These factors may operate through distal, or indirect, channels, as well as

proximally, or directly. Substance use and abuse are considered to be both distal and proximal

causal factors for suicidal behaviors. Substance use disorders, like many other psychiatric

conditions, often lead to a deteriorating life course, including social isolation, depressed mood,

low self-esteem, loss of opportunities at school and work, and estrangement from family and

friends (Deykin and Buka 1994; Workman and Beer 1990). In this sense, substance use

disorders act as a distal causal factor, building a foundation of stresses and adverse events that

may lead to suicidal behaviors (Moscicki 1995). At the same time, substance use also can be a

proximal causal factor for suicidal behaviors. Substance use tends to increase impulsivity and

decrease inhibitions, making one more likely to act on suicidal tendencies. Additionally,

substance use can lead to personal crises, such as expulsion from school or a relationship

conflict, which could precipitate suicidal behaviors (Deykin and Buka 1994).

       Numerous researchers have assessed the empirical relationship between substance use

and suicidal behaviors among young people. In samples of high-risk youth, there is a strong

correlation between clinically defined substance dependence and abuse and suicidal behaviors.

For example, Deykin and Buka (1994) find that among 300 chemically dependent youth (ages

15-19), 31 percent of males and 75 percent of females reported suicide ideation, and 28 percent

of males and 61 percent of females reported a suicide attempt. Retrospective studies of

completed adolescent suicides demonstrate that 12 to 44 percent of females and 27 to 42 percent

of males met diagnostic criteria for a substance use disorder before their deaths (Marttunen et al.

1991; Shaffer et al. 1996). Substance use also is associated with suicidal behaviors in non-




                                                  5
clinical samples of youth. Workman & Beer (1990) report that alcohol problems are positively

correlated with suicide ideation in a sample of high school students (N=126). Wagner et al.

(1996) find that in a sample of 1,050 secondary school students (ages 12-21), alcohol and illicit

drug use concurrent with some substance related impairment (e.g. problems at school due to

substance use) is a strong predictor of having attempted suicide. Felts et al. (1992), using a

sample of 3,064 high school students, find that substance use is associated with suicide ideation

and attempts.

       Despite this strong correlation in both clinical and general population samples,

researchers have not established that substance use and abuse have a causal effect on

adolescents’ risk of attempting suicide, completing suicide, or engaging in suicide ideation

(Crumley 1990). Substance use and abuse often are correlated with other, sometimes hard to

measure, causal factors for suicidal behaviors, making it difficult to establish causation. In

particular, many researchers report that in addition to substance use disorders, other psychiatric

conditions have been linked to suicidal behaviors among youth. Deykin and Buka (1994),

Shaffer et al. (1996), Runeson (1990), Crumley (1990) and many others find that depressive

disorders are one of the most common psychiatric comorbidities associated with suicidal

behaviors. In a study of teenagers who completed suicide, approximately 61 percent appeared to

have experienced a clinically significant mood disorder at the time of death, and approximately

35 percent appeared to have had a substance use disorder (Shaffer 2000). Suicidal youth also

have been found to suffer from conduct problems, anxiety disorders, borderline personality

disorder, and, in rare cases, schizophrenia (Crumley 1990; Runeson 1990; Deykin and Buka

1994; Shaffer et al. 1996). Many of these psychiatric conditions are correlated with substance

use and therefore may confound empirical estimates of the causal effect of substance use on




                                                 6
suicidal behaviors.

        Some research has addressed this problem and found that even after controlling for other

psychiatric disorders, substance use remains a strong, independent predictor of suicidal

behaviors. Wagner et al. (1996), for example, note that while co-morbid depression and conduct

problems increase the probability that a substance abusing youngster attempts suicide, substance

abuse also independently increases the probability of attempting suicide. Cutler et al. (2001) find

that among adolescent respondents in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health,

substance use is a statistically significant predictor of suicide attempts, after controlling for

depression. Similarly, using data on adolescents and adults from the National Comorbidity

Survey, Borges et al. (2000) report that alcohol and illicit drug use are statistically significant

predictors of suicide attempts, even after controlling for comorbid psychiatric conditions.

Despite controlling for psychiatric comorbidities, the estimates provided by these studies may be

still be confounded by other unobservable factors that affect both substance use and suicidal

behaviors. In addition, these papers do not directly address the issue of causality, which hinders

the design of effective prevention programs that target high-risk youth.

        Other literature, however, has provided indirect evidence that state-level substance use

policies are related to completed suicides among youth. Two recent studies based on state-level

data suggest that a higher minimum legal drinking age (MLDA), through its impact on teenage

alcohol use, reduces the number of completed suicides among young people. Jones et al. (1992)

find that the suicide rate among 15-24 year olds is 9.7 percent greater among youth living in

states where they can drink legally compared to youth of the same age who live in states where

they cannot drink legally. Similarly, Birkmayer & Hemenway (1999) find that the suicide rate

among 18-20 year olds is 8 percent higher in states with a minimum legal drinking age (MLDA)




                                                   7
of 18 years old compared to youth living in states with a MLDA of 21 years old.

       One limitation of these studies is that they only estimate the reduced form model, which

links state-level policies directly to state-level suicide rates; this method does not directly address

the question of causality. Furthermore, although these two studies provide interesting evidence

about the potential role of state-level substance use policies in suicide prevention, this

information is less relevant today because the MLDA is now uniformly 21 years old in all states.

The relationship between other substance use control policies and suicidal behaviors has not

been investigated. For example, there is no information on how changes in the price of beer can

be used as a tool to prevent suicidal behaviors among youth, even though alcohol taxes are the

most widely-used alcohol control policy.1 Moreover, there is no research available on the impact

of any substance use policy on suicide attempts and suicide ideation, two risky behaviors which

often precede completed suicide.



C.     EMPIRICAL MODEL AND METHODS

       Our empirical model of suicidal behaviors is based on those found in existing literature.

In general, suicidal behaviors (SBi) are a function of alcohol and/or illicit drug use (Ai ),

observable characteristics that affect suicidal behaviors such as age, gender, and race (X i ),

and unobservable characteristics that affect suicidal behaviors such as personality traits or

mental disorders (ui ). The subscript i refers to individuals, and εi represents a random

disturbance term:

1)     SBi = α0 + α1Ai + α2Xi + α3ui + εi.

       Following standard economic theory, a youth's demand function for alcohol or illicit

drugs can be written as follows:



                                                   8
2)     Ai = β0 + β1Pj + β2SBi+ β3Yi + β4ui + ωi,

where Pj represents the full price of illicit drugs or alcohol in location j, and the vector Yi

represents observed, individual characteristics that determine alcohol or illicit drug use.

These characteristics may be the same as the determinants of suicidal behaviors, which are

represented by the vector Xi . Similarly, the vector u i represents unobserved individual

characteristics some of which may determine both substance use and suicidal behaviors,

and ωi is a random disturbance term.

       Suicidal behaviors (SBi ) are included in the demand equation to account for the

possibility that alcohol and illicit drug use may be a consequence of, as well as a precedent

to, suicidal behaviors. About half of youths who commit suicide are intoxicated at the time

of death (Moscicki 1995). This evidence suggests that while substance use may cause

suicidal behaviors, suicidal behaviors also may be a motive for alcohol and drug

consumption. A person who wants to commit suicide may drink alcohol or use drugs to

facilitate suicide. In this case, the suicidal impulse has caused the person to use

substances.


Estimation Issues

       If there are common unmeasured characteristics (u i ) that determine both suicidal

behaviors and substance use (α3 ≠ 0 and β 4 ≠0 in Equations 1 and 2), then the coefficient on

substance use in the suicidal behaviors equation will be correlated with the error term. For

example, suppose depression is the only underlying cause of both substance use disorders

and suicidal behaviors. If a measure of depression is not included as an independent

variable, estimates of Equation 1 will produce biased and inconsistent estimates of the

effects of substance use on suicidal behaviors.


                                                   9
       The second potential source of endogeneity stems from suicidal behaviors being a

determinant of substance use (β 2 ≠0 in Equation 2). All previous studies on suicidal

behaviors have ignored the possibility that substance use is endogenous in the suicidal

behaviors equation. In this case, substance use would be correlated with the error term in

the suicidal behaviors equation (Equation 1) because all of the exogenous variables that

determine suicidal behaviors (including the error term) also determine substance use. This

can be seen by substituting Equation 1 into Equation 2.

       We begin to address these problems by first treating substance use as exogenous and

by obtaining two OLS estimates of the effect of substance use on suicidal behaviors. The first

estimate is obtained from a model that includes a limited set of covariates, and the second

estimate is obtained from a model that includes an extensive set of individual characteristics.

The addition of a rich set of explanatory variables allows us to gauge the sensitivity of the

estimated effect of substance use to the inclusion of several variables thought to be significant

confounders of the relationship between substance use and suicide behaviors.

       We then use two-stage least squares (TSLS) to estimate Equation 1. Variables measuring

the price of beer and the choice of college residence serve as instruments for substance use.2 We

believe these variables are valid instruments because there is little reason to believe that they are

predictors of suicidal behaviors, holding consumption constant.

       Assuming that the exclusion restrictions are valid, the success of the TSLS procedure

depends on how well the identifying instruments predict alcohol and illicit drug use in the first

stage (Bound et al. 1995). This issue has been the subject of a significant amount of recent

research concerned with estimating the effects of substance use taxes, prices, and control policies




                                                 10
on the demand for substances. The findings from this research support our use of beer prices as

instruments (Leung and Phelps 1993; Grossman et al. 1998; Pacula 1998).

       We also use living arrangements of respondents as instruments; specifically, we use

variables indicating whether or not the student lives in on-campus housing but not in a

fraternity or sorority, in a fraternity/sorority, or in on-campus housing but type of residence

unknown. The omitted category is off-campus housing. Campus residence is hypothesized to

predict alcohol and drug consumption, but not suicidal behaviors. The rationale for using these

variables is that choice of residence may affect substance use, because in a college atmosphere,

where fraternities and sororities are centers for social activity and have relatively frequent

parties, on-campus residents may have easier access to drugs and alcohol relative to those who

live off-campus. Peer influences may also differ according to living arrangement. However, it is

possible that the living arrangement is not a valid instrument. There may be some unmeasured

factor that governs the suicidal impulses and choice of living arrangements.

       In sum, the efficacy of the TSLS procedure we implement depends on two conditions: the

strength of the empirical relationship between the instruments and substance use, and the validity

of the exclusion restriction related to campus living arrangement. Below we report on tests that

address these points.



D.     DATA

       The data come from the University of Southern Illinois’s Core Institute (a center for

alcohol and drug studies) which conducts annual surveys of college students that focus on

drinking, drug use, and outcomes associated with drinking and drug use. The survey used in this

paper was administered to approximately 30,000 students in 1991 at private and public colleges




                                                 11
across the United States. Because we are interested in substance use and suicidal behaviors

among young adults, we limit the analysis to survey respondents between the ages of 17 and 24.

       Two variables measuring suicidal behaviors are constructed from questions relating to

outcomes of alcohol or drug use. Specifically, respondents are asked how often in the past year

had they “seriously thought about suicide” due to alcohol or illicit drug use. A similar question

asks how often in the past year the respondent “seriously tried to commit suicide” due to alcohol

or illicit drug use. In our analysis, we use dichotomous indicators of whether or not the

respondent thought about suicide and whether or not the respondent tried to commit suicide.

Because the incidence of suicidal thoughts and attempts is fairly low, results using the number of

times the respondent thought about or attempted suicide are very similar to those shown below

using the dichotomous indicators. Table 1 presents rates of suicide ideation and attempts among

Core respondents.

       Substance use is measured with five different variables. The first is the average number

of drinks the respondent consumes in a week. The second is a measure of heavy alcohol use and

is an indicator for whether or not the respondent had five or more drinks in a sitting in the past

two weeks (termed binge drinking). The third is an indicator for whether or not the respondent

used marijuana in the past year. The fourth is an indicator for whether or not the respondent

used any drugs other than marijuana in the past year. The list of other such drugs includes

cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, sedatives, hallucinogens, inhalants, ecstasy, and steroids.

Lastly, an indicator for any illicit drug use (marijuana or any other illicit drug) is used. Most

multi-drug users report using marijuana along with the other drugs, and only 3 percent of

respondents report using drugs other than marijuana, but not marijuana. Means of the substance

use variables are presented in Table 1.




                                                 12
       The socioeconomic and demographic information on respondents in the Core survey

includes the respondent’s gender, age, class (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, graduate, and

non-matriculated), grade point average, race, marital status, employment status, and parental

history of alcohol and drug problems. These variables, along with three indicators of the region

of the country in which the college is located, are included in all models. Means are presented in

Table 1. While these variables represent a wide variety of personal characteristics, they do not

account for the presence of psychiatric disorders which are important correlates of both

substance use and suicidal impulses. Since the Core data do not contain any measures of

psychiatric disorders, all models include the number of days in the past year on which the

respondent used tobacco. Many studies have shown that smoking is a strong correlate of

psychiatric disorder, but tobacco use is not expected to have a direct impact on suicidal behaviors

(Brown et al. 2000, Breslau et al. 1998, Choi et al. 1997). Thus, this variable may be a good

proxy for psychiatric disorders, as well as other personality traits correlated with both suicide

behavior and substance use.3 Note that the omission of psychiatric disorders will not bias the

substance use coefficients in the TSLS models so long as these disorders are not correlated with

the instruments.

       The price of alcohol is measured by the real price of beer in 1982-84 dollars in the state

in which the college is located. We use the price of beer instead of the liquor or wine price

because beer is the most heavily consumed alcoholic beverage, and because beer is the beverage

of choice among college students. The money price of beer is taken from the Inter-City Cost of

Living Index, published quarterly by the American Chamber of Commerce Researchers

Association (ACCRA various years) for between 250 and 300 cities. The specific beer price

collected by ACCRA is the price of a six-pack (six-12 ounce cans) of Budweiser or Miller Light.




                                                 13
In addition to obtaining information on the prices of a variety of consumer goods, the ACCRA

constructs a city-specific cost of living for each city with an average for all cities in a given

quarter and year equal to one.

        The Core Survey used in this paper was conducted during the fall semester of 1991.

Since the suicide questions pertain to the previous year, the beer price matched to the survey data

is a four-quarter average of the prices in the first two quarters of 1991 and the last two quarters

of 1990. Before averaging, each quarterly ACCRA beer price is converted to a real price by

dividing it by a quarter- and city-specific cost of living index. This index is the ACCRA city-

specific cost of living index multiplied by the quarterly Bureau of Labor Statistics’ CPI for the

U.S. as a whole (1982-84 = 1). Quarterly state prices are then computed as population weighted

averages of city prices, and annual prices are obtained by averaging these prices over the four

relevant quarters.

        It is worth mentioning that the real price of beer is likely measured with error because the

price data pertain to the state in which the respondent attends college rather than to the city in

which the college is located. In addition, the cost of living index reflects expenditure patterns of

middle-income households. These patterns may differ from those of college students.


E.      RESULTS

        Table 2 shows rates of the suicidal behaviors by substance use status. In all cases,

respondents who drink or use drugs are much more likely to have suicidal tendencies than those

who do not use substances. For example, Table 2 shows that 8.15 percent of college students

who report binge drinking thought about committing suicide and 2.34 percent report attempting

suicide. The corresponding rates for those who do not binge drink are 3.05 percent and 0.87

percent, respectively. Similar comparisons hold for students who drink any positive quantities,



                                                  14
who use marijuana and who use other illicit drugs. It is important to note that these results

establish a correlation between substance use and suicidal behaviors, but do not address the issue

of causality.

        Table 3 shows the impact of drinking, as measured by the average number of drinks

consumed in a week, on suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts in a multivariate analysis. OLS

estimates are listed in columns (1), (2), (4) and (5), and TSLS estimates are shown in columns

(3) and (6). In all cases, standard errors are calculated taking account of the correlation among

individuals living in the same state (Huber 1967). As previously noted, we estimate two models

by OLS. The first excludes three important correlates of suicidal behaviors and substance use:

maternal history of alcohol/drug problems, paternal history of alcohol/drug problems and the

number of days in the past year on which the respondent used tobacco. A comparison of the

results from models with and without these three variables included indicates how much

influence these family and individual factors have on the substance use coefficients. If the

substance use coefficient changes only slightly when these three additional variables are included

in the model and if these three variables are strong predictors of suicidal behaviors, it may be

reasonable to conclude that there is relatively little unobserved heterogeneity left in the error

term. On the other hand, if the substance use coefficient changes dramatically after the inclusion

of these variables, this finding suggests that the error term contained important characteristics

that could be accounted for by measures of family history of substance abuse and mental illness.

In the end, however, using this informal test, we cannot conclude definitively whether or not a

significant amount of heterogeneity remains in the error term.

        The OLS estimates in Columns 1 and 4 confirm the results from Table 2 and show that

drinking is positively related to suicidal behaviors. When the model is extended to include




                                                 15
parental substance use and the respondent’s tobacco use, the estimated effects of drinking fall by

a third for suicidal thoughts, but do not change when attempts are considered. Columns 3 and 6

show the TSLS estimates. Both estimates are positive and of comparable magnitude to the OLS

estimates, although only the estimate associated with suicidal thoughts is statistically significant.

       At the bottom of Table 3, we report the results of tests related to the efficacy of the TSLS

procedure. The partial F-statistic associated with the excluded instruments is 16.95 and highly

significant.4 An F-statistic of this magnitude provides evidence that the correlation between our

instruments and drinking is sufficiently strong. Overidentification tests indicate that our

exclusion restrictions are valid. We also implemented a second, less formal test, to check the

validity of the exclusion restrictions related to living arrangements, since the theoretical

argument for excluding these variables is not as strong as the argument for the beer price. To

implement this informal test, we obtained OLS estimates from a model that includes the living

arrangement variables. Holding substance use constant, an F-test indicated that these variables

have no effect on suicidal behaviors.5

       We note that the standard errors of the TSLS estimates are relatively large—

approximately 4 times the size of the OLS standard errors—and that this imprecision warrants a

cautious interpretation of our results. For example, the Hausman test cannot reject the

consistency of OLS even though the TSLS estimate of the effect of drinking on suicidal thoughts

is 50 percent larger than the OLS estimate. However, given the large value of the partial F-

statistic, and the valid overidentification test, we believe that the TSLS procedure is valid. More

importantly, the positive sign on the OLS and TSLS estimates suggest that drinking has a

positive causal effect on suicidal behaviors. There is no evidence that once the potential




                                                 16
endogeneity of drinking is accounted for, the positive relationship between drinking and suicide

thoughts and suicide attempts is diminished.

       The results of binge drinking, marijuana use, other drug use and any drug use are shown

in the different panels of Tables 4. The five substance use measures are included separately in

each model because of collinearity, particularly in the TSLS models, arising from the fact that

the substance use measures are highly correlated and are predicted with the same set of variables.

In Table 4, only the coefficients on the substance use measures and the related test statistics are

displayed. The results of the individual characteristics do not change across the models and

therefore are omitted from Table 4 for brevity. Panel A of Table 4 includes the indicator for

binge drinking; Panel B includes the indicator for marijuana use; Panel C includes the indicator

for other drug use; and Panel D includes the indicator for any drug use.

          As with drinking, the OLS models all show that binge drinking and drug use are

positively related to suicide thoughts and suicide attempts. Moreover, TSLS estimates of the

effect of these substances on suicidal behaviors are positive and have roughly similar magnitudes

as the OLS estimates, although many of the TSLS estimates in Table 4 are not statistically

significant. In addition, the partial F-statistics on the excluded instruments are relatively large;

30.93 for binge drinking, 13.2 for marijuana use, 7.34 for other drug use, and 12.01 for any drug

use. The overidentification tests support the validity of the exclusion restrictions.

       Still, we are concerned about the imprecision of the estimates. Ideally, the efficacy of the

TSLS procedures would be such that we could confidently interpret the insignificant estimates as

indicative of the absence of a true effect. However, this ideal is rarely achieved in practice. The

magnitude of the estimates, and the similarity of the TSLS estimates to the OLS estimates,

suggest that there is a true causal effect. In addition, although we know that the problem of weak




                                                  17
instruments tends to bias TSLS estimates toward the OLS estimates, conventional tests to detect

this problem suggest that our instruments are reasonably strong, and that this is not the

explanation. Finally, the consistency of the results across substances and outcomes is

theoretically justified and provides additional evidence to support the conclusion that substance

use is a causal determinant of suicidal behaviors.



Individual Characteristics

        Many of the student characteristics are also important determinants of suicidal behaviors.

The impacts of these characteristics do not vary with the substance that is included in the model

or the type of estimation technique used. There is a difference, however, in a few of the

characteristics that predict suicidal thoughts versus suicide attempts. Being older and having a

higher grade point average both reduce the probability of suicidal thoughts and attempts, while

being female increases these probabilities. Being black or Hispanic generally has no impact on

suicidal behaviors, although being of another race increases the probabilities of these behaviors.

Class levels generally have no impact on suicidal behaviors. Note, however, that the impact of

class level may be subsumed by age. Part time students are more likely to engage in both

suicidal behaviors. Being married lowers the probability of suicidal thoughts while being

divorced increases both thoughts and attempts. Employment status has no impact on either

behavior. Having parents who have problems with alcohol or illicit drugs will increase suicidal

thoughts and attempts. Lastly, tobacco use is positively associated with suicide thoughts and

attempts. Recall that it is not expected that tobacco use has a direct impact on suicidal behaviors;

rather, it is included to proxy for psychiatric disorders, as well as other personality traits

correlated with both suicidal behaviors and substance use.




                                                  18
Reduced Form Models

       Table 5 present results from the reduced form models, which show the direct impact of

the beer price and living arrangement variables on suicidal behaviors. The reduced form is

derived by substituting equation 2 into equation 1. These models are presented with and without

the three dummies for the region of the country in which the respondent lives because as the

results show, the coefficients on the beer price are highly sensitive to the inclusion or exclusion

of these regional dummies.

       The coefficient on the beer price in Table 5 is always negative, but is only statistically

significant when the regional dummies are excluded in column 2. In addition, the coefficients on

the campus living arrangements are all positive, but are not statistically significant at

conventional levels. Even though the impact of higher beer prices and campus living

arrangements are measured imprecisely, the signs are consistent with a causal explanation of

alcohol and drug use on suicidal behaviors. As discussed previously, there is no reason to

believe that higher prices or living arrangements have a direct impact on suicidal behaviors,

rather these variables work through the consumption of drugs and alcohol. The negative beer

price coefficient is consistent with the notion that higher prices lower consumption, which in turn

lowers suicidal behaviors. Similarly, the positive signs on the on campus living arrangements

indicate that students living on campus are more likely to engage in suicidal behaviors due to

their higher drug and alcohol use than those living off campus.



F.     CONCLUSION

       In summary, our results are consistent with a causal mechanism in which alcohol and




                                                 19
illicit drug use increases the likelihood of suicidal thoughts and attempts. This evidence comes

from TSLS estimation, where statistically significant instruments and valid overidentification

restrictions generate coefficient estimates that are similar to OLS coefficients. The reduced form

equation shows indirect evidence of causality by linking the determinants of drug and alcohol

use directly to the suicidal behaviors. Although these are measured imprecisely, these results

indicate that raising the price of beer, and living off campus will reduce the number of suicidal

thoughts and attempts by college students.

       These findings have important implications for policy. Suicidal behaviors are leading

risk factors for completed suicide and are thought to interfere with functioning even when they

do not result in completed suicide. However, there has been little previous research on how

public policy can be used to effectively prevent these risky, prevalent behaviors. This paper

suggests that those policies that prevent substance use also may prevent suicidal behaviors. In

this study, we identify beer prices and college living arrangements as potential policy tools,

although future research may identify other such policies. This research is a first step towards

expanding policy makers’ ability to prevent suicidal behaviors, and their tragic consequences,

among college students.

        1
            Sloan et al. (1994) do find that higher beer prices are associated with lower adult state-

level suicide rates after controlling for a range of time-varying state characteristics and state

fixed effects.
        2
            We experimented with models which include as additional instruments the price of

cocaine and an indicator for whether the state had decriminalized the possession of small

amounts of marijuana for personal use. These instruments are excluded since they have no

empirical correlation with the substance use measures. This is most likely due to measurement

error in the prices (Manski et al. 2001).
        3
            One drawback to these models is that there may be a multicollinearity problem present

due to the correlation between smoking status and use of drugs and alcohol. Models were tested

that exclude the tobacco use variable and results do not change.
