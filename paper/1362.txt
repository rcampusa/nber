                               ABSTRACT


        A strong and negative Correlation between married women's
 labor force participation and fertility has been witnessed in

 Japan in past decades. Relative to empirical studies of a traditional
 single equation on female labor supply, there exist few econometric

 studies dealing explicitly with a possible interdependency between
 married women's labor supply and fertility behaviors in urban
                                                               Japan.
        Using the recently published 1980 Population Census of
 Japan, we have estimated a simultaneous_equation model of married
 women's labor force participation
                                   and fertility in urban Japan.
 Our model shows very satisfactory
                                   results to explain the negative
 correlation between those variables based on a method of 2SLS.

 Estimated labor supply elasticities for married women with
                                                            respect
 to their fertility rates, wife's labor earnings, and male labor

earnings are —0.67, 0.23, and —1.76 at the sample means, respectively.
On the other hand, estimated elasticities
                                          of fertility with respect
to married women's labor force
                               participation and family income are
—0.31 and 0.23, respectively. We find some of these elasticities
for Japanese married women very comparable to those of married
women in the United States.

 I. INTRODUCTION

 In her recent papers on female labor force participation in Japan,

 M. Anne Hill (1982, 1983, and l98) elucidates two important points:
 The first, a logit model explains Japanese female labor supply
 behavior for both grouped and disaggregated data well.

The second, a ratio of female employees to the total female
population over 15 is the most suitable measurement for female

labor force participation rate, rather than a commonly used
measurement, the total female labor force divided by the total
population in Japan. The second point reflects the fact that
the proportion of female self-employed and family workers is

nearly 36% of their total labor force in Japan in 1980.

       The present paper extends the Hill's single—equation logit
model (Hill 198L) to a simultaneuous—equation model of "married"

women's labor supply and fertility in "urban" Japan.
The interdependency between married women's labor supply and their

fertility has been emphasized in many studies of household behavior
in the United States (Cain and Dooley 1976, Fleisher and Rhodes

l979a, Gregory et al. 1972, Link and Settle 1981, Schultz 1978,
and Schultz 1974). The Hill's labor supply model is a traditional

single equation. The model applied for female labor supply
behavior in Japan would, therefore, yield biased and inconsistent
                                —2—



estimates of the structural parameters of their labor supply
because married women as employees are almost 60% of total

female employees in non-agricultural and forestry industries

in recent years.'
       Our paper diverges from the Hill'S studies (1982 and 19814)
                                earlier, we assume that two behavioral
in many respects. As mentioned
variables, i.e., married women's labor force participation and
fertility, are jmuitafle0USly determined in the model.

Our 5jflitaneou5equati0 model is applied to the recently
                                                           and 19814)
published 1980 population Census of Japan while Hill (1982
used the 1970 Census. We focus mainly on married women living

in urban Japan whereas females without urban—rural differentials
in Japan were studies in the Hill's papers (1982 and 19814)
        There are advantages in our model, which uses cross—sectional

market averages. As being illustrated by Cain and Dooley (1976)
                           jfferentiating married women from
 and Link and Settle (1981) ,

 all females and also urban Japan from all Japan will represent
                                of married women, which results in
 a relatively homogeneous group
 consistent estimates of the structural parameters in our model.
 Variations in tastes and transitory wages within a given

 geographical area can be averaged out. The averages of married
                                           therefore, be related
 women's labor supply and fertility may,

 to an observed average (permanent) wage (Mincer 1962)
                                —3—



As opposed to previous studies summarized by Hill (1982) on

Japanese female labor supply, our estimates will circumvent

a simultaneous equation bias by explicitly treating both married
women's labor supply and fertility as endogenous variables in
the model.3 Last but not least, our estimates will permit

comparisons with the estimates obtained in similar models in
the United States, e.g., Cain and Dooley (1976).

       The plan of this paper is as follows. Section II describes
our statistical model and briefly mentions theoretical predictions
of the data used in the model. Section III reports the empirical

results. Finally, section IV gives a summary of the findings of
this paper.

II. THE SPECIFICATION OF MODEL
The central feature of our model is that the variables
are cross—Sectional market averages.           The market averages of

married women's labor force participation rates in prefectures

have their values limited between zero and one. Based on
                                                      model of
a cumulative logistic probability function, the logit
married women's labor force participation function is defined

as follows (Pindyck and Rubinfeld 1976):


                           1
      P. =   F(Y.)   =                          ,                 (1)
       1        1                -AX.1
                         1 + e

where P is the probability of being an employee for a married
woman in the i—th prefecture; F() is the cumulative logistic

probability function; and X is a vector of right-handSide
variables.
       On the assumption that the expected value of married women's

labor force participation follows a logit function, the logit
                                          (1) is rewritten as
transformation probability P in equation
follows (Neter and Wasserman 1974)

married women in cities ("Shi" in Japanese) of the i-th prefecture,
whose ratio is denoted MARLFP.,.

and their statistics in the above model, respectively.
                              for the variables in each equation
The theoretical predictions

are extensively discussed in the literatures (Ben—Porath 1973,
Cain and Dooley 1976, Cain and Weininger 1973, De Tray 1973,
Fields 1976, Fleisher and Rhodes 1976 and 1979a, Gregory et al.

1972, Michael 1973, and Willis 1973). We breifly, therefore,
outline the rationales.
        In the logit labor supply equation (14) (hereafter,

 simply the labor supply equation), wife's expected market
                          will have a positive effect on married
 monthly income (WIFINC)
                                   because those women who are

                                   increase, when the individual
 markets as their expected wages

 xc1uding wife's monthly income reflects an income effect and

 hence increasing the reservation wages for married women.

 variable for a completed fertility of married women4, will inhibit
 married women from joining labor markets because the bearing and
 raising of children is women's time—intensive household work. The effect

 of male unemployment rate (UNEMPL.) is left open, although a negative
 discouraged worker effect seems to dominate a positive added worker

 effect in Japan (Furugori 1980) and in the United States (Bowen
and Finegan 1969, Cain and Dooley 1976, Dooley 1982, Fields 1976,
and Fleisher and Rhodes 1976 and 1979b).   An industry mix variable
 (INDMIx.) measures the relative importance of industries in each

prefecture representing employment opportunities (Bowen and
Finegan 1969, Cain and Dooley 1976, Fields 1976, and Fleisher and
Rhodes 1976 and 1979b). As opposed to the industry mix variables

defined by the above authors, we decided to use the male proportion
of the national cities' employees in each industry as the weight
rather than the female proportions.5 We are rather interested to

see if male employment opportunities exclude the opportunities
from married women in the labor markets, although the former will

conceivably exclude the employenmt opportunities from primary
"single" women in Japan. Therefore, the expected sign of
our INDMIX1 will be positive if there exist spill—over employment
opportunities for married women because of a gross complement
for male employment in nature. Female educational attainment

(FEMEDU1) is expected to be negatively associated with married

 rate (INFANT.) on married women's fertility is ambiguous,

 depending in part on the costs associated with infant deaths

 (both pecuniary and psychic costs) and the gross price elasticity of
 demand   f or surviving children (De Tray 1974).6 FERT8O. would
 fall as INFANT. decreases if the gross price elasticity is greater

 than one. The effect of family income excluding wife's income

 (FAMINC.) on FERT8O, is ambiguous since we don't include a proxy
variable to control the quality of children' in the fertility
equation. The famous debate on the "observed" vs. "pure" income
elasticities of demand for numbers of children rests on the quantity—

quality substitution of children in household production (Becker
and Lewis 1973)

       As concluding remarks on our model, both the labor supply
and fertility equations are estimated by the Two-Stage Least
Squares (2SLS).8 In this model, the labor supply equation is
exactly identified while the fertility equation is overidentified.

Although the labor supply equation can be estimated by its reduced
form, we did not attempt to estimate the reduced form because
the left-hand-side of the labor supply equation is the log-odds ratio,
which would result in a clumsy computation.   The asymptotic
t—statistics are, therefore, used to test the significance of
the variables in the right-hand—side of both equations (Maddala

1974, and Fleisher and Rhodes 1976). Finally, the evaluation

for the labor supply equation is made by its F-statistic rather
than R2 because the equation is the logit transformation of

the probability of married women's labor force participation
(Hill 1982)

  III.   EMPIRICAL RESULTS
  The model of simultaneous
                            equations (4) and (5) in the previous
  section was applied to the data for 47 "urban" prefectures
                                                             in
  1980 and also 47 prefectures with no urban-rural differentjajs
  for a comparative
                   purpose. Those equations were estimated with
 weighted data by a method of
                              two-stage least squares (2SLs).
 Table 3 reports the estimates of the structural coefficients
                                                               for
 the labor supply and fertility equations for the urban
                                                        data as
 does Table 4, but only the estimates of the labor
                                                    supply for
 the data with no urban-rural differentials
                                              The variables of
 wife's income (WIFINC.),
                          family income (FAMINC.), and male
 earnings (MALINC.) are deflated by the indexes of the cost of
 living in cities with prefectural
                                     government in 1980.


3-1. Labor Supply

The logit model of the married women's labor
                                             supply equation
(Equation (1) in Table 3) is
                             strongly Supported by the large
F—statistic (19.52) at the 1% significance level.
       The estimated coefficient on the wife's income variable
(WIFINC.) is Positive and
                             statistically significant at the 1%
significance level. To recover the partial derivative of
                                                          WIFINC.,
we multiply the coefficient, 0.012, by 0.1860 (=
                                                 O.247x(l—0.247)),
which results in about 0.002. The point estimate
                                                  of elasticity

of   t4ARLFP with respect to WIFINC is about 0.23 at the sample
                                                          labor
mean. Our gross wage elasticity of urban married women's
supply is almost half of Hill's estimate of all females', 0.44

(Hill 1984). Our smaller estimate might result from the fact
                                         while Hill uses all
that we use only married women employees
female employees. In general, a single female is more likely to
                                 markets than a married woman.
be a paid—employee in labor
Another possible explanation is that Hill's gross wage elasticity
might be overestimated if a relevant fertility variable is
significant in a female labor supply equation since the Hill

equation does not include this fertility variable.9


         Compared with gross wage elasticities for married women

 in the United States, our estimate is much smaller than those
 estimates by various authors in Keeley (1981). Keeley reports

 1.28 for a mean of gross wage elasticities obtained by eleven
 different studies. In a similar                    equations' context,

 backgrounds, if the labor supply curve is the cumulative
 distribution of subjective wages of individuals, the small gross

 wage elasticity of married women's labor supply in urban Japan
 can be reasonable. Since the response of groups with very low

 labor force participation rates to wages will be smaller than
 the response of groups with labor force participation rate close

 to 50 percent (Ben—porath l973) As listed in Table 2, the mean
 labor force participation rate for married women (employees only)
in urban Japan is only about 25 percent in 1980.

       The effect of family income variable (FAMINc.) is significant
but positive, whose sign is puzzling. We, therefore, attempted to

re—estimate the model by using the variable of male average earnings
in industries (MALINc.) and report its result as Equation (14) in
Table 3. The estimates coefficient turns out —0.013 and is

statistically significant at the 1% significance level. The point
estimate of income elasticity at the sample mean is about —1.762.
Since the income elasticity for married women in the United States

ranges from —2.l.to 0.58 (Keeley 1981) and the elasticity is —1.2
in Cain and Dooley (1976), our estimate of the income elasticity
seems close to the lower (negative)
                                      boundary. We consider it
reasonable for the strong negative effect on married women's
labor supply because married women in urban Japan are typically

secondary workers compensating the husband's income.11
                                       — 16 —




                                                               is negative as
       The effect of the fertility variable (FERT80)
expected and almost significant in Equation (1) in Table 3.

This fertility variable becomes statistically significant when
                                                        Generalized
we estimated the labor supply equation by the method of
                                           of GLS, which is a result of the
Least Squares (GLS). The result
second stage,is reported as Equation (3) in Table 3. The point
elasticity of MARLFP with respect to FERT8O is about -0.670 at

the sample mean. Although the significance of the fertility variable
is a little sensitive to the model specification1 we certainly cannot

negate the possibility to explain the strong negative correlation
between married women's labor force participation and their fertility

in past decades.
         The variables of industry mix (INDMIX)1 female education
                 enrollment of children under 6 in nursery schools or
 (FEMEDU1) , and
indergartefl5 (KINDER) all are statistically significant at
the 1% significance level. The strong positive effect of INDMIX
                                   between male and married women
suggests the gross complementarity
                         12 An increase in the level of education

 for married women, as hypothesized earlier, substantially reduces
 the probability of their joining labor markets as employees.13
 As far as KINDER1 is concerned, the rapid increase in the numbers of

 nursery schools and kindergartens in past years, as often argued
                                 — 17 —




  and published in Japanese
                           government publications, seems to have
 encouraged married women to join labor
                                        markets (see those Japanese
 government publications in reference)   .   The point estimate of
 elasticity of MARLFP with respect to KINDER is about 0.667
                                                             at
 the sample mean. We found
                            this elasticity almost three times
 larger than the gross
                       wage elasticity of MARLFP. The availability
 of nursery schools and kindergartens seems a
                                              very necessary
 condition for married women to participate in their
                                                     labor markets.
       For comparative purposes, we estimate the same simultaneous_

 equation model for prefectural data with no urban—rural
differentials. The second stage results for prefectural
data are reported as
                     Equation (5) (logit equation) and Equation (6)
(GLs equation) in Table 4. The variables of male earnings
                                                           (MALINc.),
fertility in prefecture (PRFERT.), and enrollment for children
under 6 in nursery schools
                           or kindergartens in prefecture (PRKIND.)
are significantly important in Equation (5). To recover those
partical derivatives at the sample means, we multiply the
                                                          estimated
coefficients by 0.1943. The point elasticities at the
                                                       sample means
are are about -1.590, -0.625, and
                                  0.470 for MALINC, PRFERT, and
PRKIND, respectively. These elasticities are slightly smaller than
those obtained from the urban data. The variable of wife's
                                                            income
(WIFINC.) is significantly
                           positive in GLS equation (6) in Table 4.

3—2. Fertility
Fertility rate is measured by the number of live births per 1,000

for a completed fertility of married women, although the children
                            is commonly used in the study on
ever born per married woman

       The variable of wife's income (WIFINC) is insignificant,
although this variable is usually assumed to be one of the major

labor earnings are frequently found to be significant and negative

 to the income elasticities for white women ever married
 from 0.18 to 0.30 in Cain and Weininger (1973).

 about 6.8 births per 1,000 married women. The point estimate of

 elasticity of FERT8O with respect to MARLFP is about —0.306 at
 the sample mean, whose value is very comparable to those values
 in Cain and Dooley (1976) ranging from -0.15 to —0.63. Our
                                                             estimate,
 therefore, strongly supports the inclusion of married women's
 labor market activities in fertility equation and does not reject

 the possibility for a simultaneous
                                      relationship between married
women's fertility and labor supply behaviors in household.
         The variables of male unemployment rate (UNEMPL.) and female

education (FEMEDU.) are also statistically significant and those
signs are as expected. The
                            strongly positive coefficient on UNEMPL.
indicates that married women in urban Japan tend to have children
when its opportunity costs are low. This finding is the
                                                         same
as the U.S. married women's
                            fertility experience (Cain and
Weininger 1973). On the other hand,

                 1
                   is consistent with the view that married women's
level   of education is a proxy variable for the importance of their

knowledge ot and access to birth control techniques (Cain and
Weininger 1973) .   Also,
                        the negative coefficient may reflect
tastes of educated parents for other goods, e.g., quality of
children, and the cost of parents' time in household production

(Hashimoto 1974 and Schultz 1974)

       In   short, the results from our fertility equation indicate

significant interactions between fertility and other socioeconomic
variables such as married women's labor supply, family income,
female education, and male unemployment.    One of the most important

findings is the significance of married women's labor force
participation in our j1u1tafleOuS_equatb0n model. Another
noteworthy finding is that the point estimates of elasticities

at the sample means are very close to the elasticities found
for the U.S. married women, e.g., the income elasticity of fertility
                                                              for

the U.S.); and the elasticity of fertility with respect to

women's labor supply (ours —0.31

R-square (0.286) and F—statistic (2.66) suggest the necessity

 IV.    SUMMARY

 In    this paper we have estimated
                                      a simultaneous_equation model
 of married women's labor force
                                  participation and fertility in
 urban Japan, using the prefectural data in the 1980
                                                     Population
 Census of Japan. Among the few studies done on the above
                                                           Issue,
 we find that there is a significant
                                     interdependency between married
 women's labor supply and fertility behaviors based on

 the estimation method of 2SLS.       Our model seems very satisfactory
to explain the strong and negative correlation between married
women's labor force participation
                                  and fertility in urban Japan.
        Labor supply elasticities of married women in urban Japan
with respect to their fertility rate, wife's labor
                                                    earnings, and
male labor earnings are —0.67, 0.23, and —1.76 at the
                                                       sample means,
respectively. On the other hand, elasticities
                                                of fertility with
respect to married women's labor force
                                        participation and family
income are -0.31 and 0.23 at the
                                  sample means, respectively.
These estimated elasticities for Japanese married women look
very comparable to those of married women in the United States.

        5The definitions of the industry mix variable is listed in
 Table 1. The variable is constructed by using these industries:
 agriculture, forestry and hunting, fishery and aquaculture, mining,
 construction, manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, finance
 and insurance, real estate, transportation and communication,
 utilities (electricity, water and steam), services, and government.
        60'Hara (1975) theoretically shows that a mortality decline
 will induce parents to choose a smaller number of children if
 the substitution of quality for quantity (numbers) of children is
 sufficiently great to outweigh the tendency to substitute quality
 for other goods.

        7De Tray (1973) uses public school expenditures per child
in dollars per county in the United States as a proxy variable
for quality per child.

           the first stage, married women's labor force participation
rate and fertility rate are regressed on the exogenous variables
stated above and number of children per married woman. We, however,
decided not to include the variable of number of children per married
women as one of the explanatory variables in the
                                                 second—stage
equations although the variable is common and often used in these
studies. The reason is that the number of children aged between
1 and 6 per married woman are strongly and positively associated
with our fertility variable, i.e., the number of live births per
1,000 married women. We tend to consider that this strong
correlation might result from the secular trend rather than
a behavioral relationship between fertility and surviving children.
       9Hill (1984) also includes these following variables in
the model: male wage rate, non—wage income, children under 5
per married woman, and that fraction of the total labor force,
employed in agriculture.
       10
         These estimated are obtained from the data of white
married women.

         Hill (1984) reports —0.52 for the income elasticity
for female employees in Japan.
       '2This complementarity may not necessarily indicate
the relationship within a given firm of a typical industry but,
rather reveal the relationship in different sized firms in a given
industry. Married women are usually employed in small sized firms,
whose products are in turn used in a larger firm where a major
proportion of the employees are male.

       '3using the data from the National Longitudinal Surveys of
work experience, Shapiro and Shaw (1983) also found a strong
negative effect of married women's years of education on
the probability of their joining labor markets. The estimate of
educational attainment in their model explains about 17 - 28% of
the observed change in white married women's labor force
participation rate from 1967 to 1978.
