        Labor standards in less developed countries became a hot button issue in discussions of trade
and economic development in the 1990s. Standards rose to the top of the public agenda not because
workers were unionizing in mass numbers nor because management had turned over a moral leaf nor
because the International Labor Organization had asserted itself in the global economy. Labor
standards came to the fore because non-governmental groups in advanced countries – the human rights
vigilantes of our title – galvanized consumers to demand that multinational firms and their suppliers
improve working conditions and pay living wages in developing countries.
        How did human rights vigilantes bring labor standards to the center of public discourse? Will
the anti-sweatshop activists create a permanent global movement for workers rights or will public
interest dissipate over time? Can concerned citizens in advanced countries pressure firms to improve
the economic condition of workers in poorer countries or will their activities inadvertently make things
worse? Which appellation best characterizes the human rights vigilantes – white hats or Don Quixotes?
        We analyze these questions in terms of a “market for standards” in which consumers, stimulated
by vigilante intermediaries, demand that corporations improve working conditions in supplier factories.
Section 1 presents evidence that a consumer demand for minimum labor standards exists and explores
the nature of that demand. Section 2 examines the incentives that exist for firms to respond to this
demand and considers how industry structure influences the nature of the response. Section 3
introduces the human rights activists of our title and assesses their role as intermediaries who expose
sweatshop abuses and trigger consumers to demand changes in corporate behavior. Section 4
examines the major anti-sweatshop campaigns of the 1990s and their achievements. Section 5
considers the arguments that anti-sweatshop campaigns risk doing more harm than good by raising costs
and deterring investment in poor countries; and assesses the limitations of activist consumer-based
campaigns. Section 6 concludes with a summary of our conclusions as to when and how human rights
vigilante efforts actually do good.


                              1 Consumer Demand for Labor Standards
        “[I] had a hard time making up my mind how bad a company had to be before I could bring
myself to give its products the old heave-ho.” – Joe Queenan, My Goodness
                                                                                                             2
           The sine qua non of activist efforts to improve labor standards around the world is that
consumers care about the conditions of the workers who make the items they consume. If consumers
do not care or do not associate the conditions with their consumption, human rights vigilantes could not
pressure firms to improve working conditions. The extent to which consumers care and their willingness
to act on their concerns is, as the above commentator indicates, uncertain. Indeed, many consumers
would just as soon not know about poor conditions since that knowledge reduces the utility of their
consumption. Activists inform consumers about the conditions of production in ways that resonate with
moral concerns, and develop campaigns to turn concern into improvements. From this perspective, the
activists are entrepreneurs who identify latent market demands and find ways to meet those demands.
           In this section we present survey evidence that consumers care about labor standards and will
buy products made under better conditions in preference to those made under worse conditions. That
many corporations respond to the activist-induced pressures, at least rhetorically, shows that they
believe such a demand exists.


                                             Survey evidence
           You are offered two identical t-shirts with your favorite logo. One was made in good
conditions in some third world country. The other was made in a fire-trap factory by people paid near
starvation wages. Which t-shirt would you buy ... when the t-shirts cost the same? ... when the shirt
made under good conditions costs a bit more?
           Surveys that ask questions of this form invariably find that the vast majority of people report
they would choose the garment made under better conditions, even if it cost a bit more. Exhibit 1
summarizes the results from surveys undertaken by Marymount University’s Center for Ethical
Concerns; by the University of Maryland’s Program on International Policy Attitudes; and by our
project.
           The Marymount surveys were conducted in 1995, 1996, and 1999. In each survey, three of
four consumers said they would avoid shopping in a store if they knew the goods were produced under
bad conditions while not quite two of three say they would be more inclined to shop in stores combating
sweatshops. The greater response to knowledge about bad conditions than good conditions suggests
that consumers respond more to information that reduces their utility than to information that increases it
-- consistent with Kahneman and Tversky’s (1979) prospect theory that shows people weigh potential
losses more heavily than potential gains. An average 85 percent of respondents in the Marymount
                                                                                                         3
survey said they would pay $1 more for a $20 item if they could be assured that it was made under
good conditions.
        The 1999 Program on International Policy Attitudes (PIPA) survey presented arguments
for and against making labor standards part of the trade agenda (University of Maryland 2000). By
covering a spectrum of trade-related issues, this survey put attitudes toward labor standards into a
broader context. The survey found that most Americans favor linking labor standards to trade.
Roughly three of four respondents said they felt a moral obligation to try to help workers faced with
poor conditions and approximately the same proportion reported that they would pay $5 more for a
$20 garment if they knew it was not made in a sweatshop.1 Most respondents found convincing
arguments for minimum standards -- that harsh conditions are immoral and that standards eliminate
unfair advantage through exploitation -- while far fewer were convinced by arguments against standards
-- that they reduce jobs in affected countries and impinge on national sovereignty.
        People also differentiated among labor standards. More were concerned about child labor and
safe conditions than about the right to unionize. Most consumers did not expect workers in foreign
countries to earn US wages (82 percent) and just over half favored lowering trade barriers after being
informed about the costs of protectionism. This compares to only 36 percent who favored lowering
barriers to clothing imports absent the information. Two-thirds favored free trade as long as society
recompensed workers whose livelihood was hurt by trade, say with adjustment assistance and training.
Nearly 90 percent said that “free trade is an important goal for the United States, but it should be
balanced with other goals, such as protecting workers, the environment, and human rights—even if this
may mean slowing the growth of trade and the economy.”
        Most striking, the largest majority on any trade question (93 percent) agreed that “countries that
are part of international trade agreements should be required to maintain minimum standards for working
conditions.” Thus, Americans support international labor standards in both their private consumption
behavior and in the public sphere.


                                               Our survey
        To illuminate further the consumer demand for labor standards, we surveyed a small number of
randomly chosen persons in the United States in fall 1999.2 The survey used a split sample design that
posed different questions to different respondents to see whether responses varied with the wording or
presentation of questions. The results parallel those of the Marymount and PIPA surveys. Most
                                                                                                               4
respondents said that they cared about the treatment of the workers who made the clothing they bought
and that they would be willing to pay more for an item if they knew it was made under good working
conditions (see exhibit 1). On average, consumers said that they were willing to pay 28 percent more
on a $10 item and 15 percent more on a $100 item (including as zeros consumers who said that they
were unwilling to pay extra for the assurance). Eighty-four percent of a different sub-sample said that
they would purchase a different t-shirt rather than one “with a nice logo” that local students said was
made under poor labor conditions. Nearly two-thirds said that they would not buy the t-shirt made
under poor conditions at any price.3 The third who said they would buy it if the price was lowered
wanted a mean discount of $4.38. On the other side, consumers said that they would pay an average of
just $0.87 for knowing the product was made under good conditions (including 0s for persons who said
they would not pay the extra amount, or who refused to answer).4 The greater response to the utility-
reducing information about bad conditions than to the utility-increasing information about good
conditions again fits with prospect theory.
        At the heart of any economic analysis of consumer tastes is the demand curve -- the relation
between the number of consumers who would buy products at different prices. Our survey allows us to
estimate the demand curve for labor standards, taking account of the potential difference in
responsiveness to products made under good conditions and those made under bad conditions. We
asked some respondents “how much more would you be willing to pay for items made under good
working conditions” for items worth $10 and $100. We asked others if they would buy a $10 t-shirt
made under poor conditions if its price was lowered to $9 ... $8 ... $7 ..., and how much they would
pay for the t-shirt if it was made under good conditions.
        Panels A-C of Exhibit 2 show that both designs give qualitatively similar results: high elasticities
of demand for products made under good conditions but low elasticities of demand for products made
under bad conditions.5 The willingness to pay for items made under good conditions has elasticities
ranging from -3.7 to -4.9. The 20 percent to 30 percent of consumers who are unwilling to pay
anything extra produce an immediate loss in revenue that these estimates indicate cannot recovered by
those willing to pay more. In addition, there is a sharp drop-off in purchases as the price of the item
rises. By contrast, roughly two of three consumers say they would not buy the item made under bad
conditions under any circumstance and the demand for t-shirts produced under bad conditions is
inelastic (-0.29) among the third who said they would buy them at a discount.
                                                                                                                  5
        The implication is that firms can lose greatly from having their products identified as being made
under bad conditions but have only limited space to raise prices for products made under good
conditions -- unless consumers see competing products as made under bad conditions.6 The differential
consumer response to information about good and bad conditions helps explain, we argue later, the
behavior of activists and firms in the market for standards.


                                     Do consumers act as they say?
        “I still shop at those brand-name stores, but I feel really guilty about it.” Founding member of a
New York City high school Student Committee Against Labor Exploitation (Business Week,
September 11, 2000)


        Readers may question whether people will do what they say on a survey. Economists want to
see behavior not intentions. The best way to find out how many people would in fact pay extra for a
product made under good conditions is to conduct a “Standards Experiment,” by offering the product
for sale along side a similar product with no or negative information on working conditions, and seeing
what happens. Unfortunately, no one has done this.7 But experimental data and market behavior in
other domains suggests that people care enough about the conditions of others to behave as they say
they would in the surveys.
        The Dictator’s Game is perhaps the experimental economics game closest to the standards
problem. Two players are given envelopes. One has $100 in it while the other envelope has $0. The
person with the $100 can simply keep the money and say tough kazoo to the person who got $0. The
economically rational decision is to do just that. But behavior is different. Only about 20 percent of
players keep all the money. The vast majority share some with their unlucky partner, albeit offering less
than if the second player could veto the division (as in the “Ultimatum Game”). Another game that
comes close to the standards problem is the Lost Wallet Game (Charness, Haruvy, and Sonsino 2000).
One person finds a wallet, which has more value to its owner than to the finder. The owner may or may
not give a reward for finding the wallet. The greater the value of the wallet to the owner relative to the
finder, the more likely is it that the finder will return it, even though this will mean less money than if the
finder kept the wallet. The implication is that people gain some utility from being “fair” to someone who
values something more than themselves.8 Thus, at least in laboratory situations, people behave in ways
that lend believability to the responses from surveys on standards and purchasing behavior.
                                                                                                                 6
        Going outside the laboratory, the fact that people contribute to charity and volunteer time for
charitable activities shows that they sacrifice income for social goals. Charitable giving and volunteering
is greater in the US than in other advanced countries, presumably because the US does not have a large
welfare state. In the charitable sector, moreover, much giving and volunteering comes in response to
requests from activists (Freeman 1997). Again, people behave as if they care for more than their own
immediate consumption and thus could be expected to consider labor standards in their purchase of
goods, as they say they would in surveys.
        Finally, the response of many companies to allegations of worker mistreatment also suggests
that consumers act in accord with survey responses. If consumers did not care about conditions, firms
would simply ignore the allegations as irrelevant to their bottom lines. Firm behavior is also consistent
with the finding that consumer demand for good and bad conditions is asymmetric since, as we will
document shortly, firms rarely address labor standards issues unless forced to do so by bad publicity.
Inelastic consumer demand for goods produced under abusive conditions gives companies an incentive
to respond to negative publicity, elastic demand for “worker-friendly” products means that firms see
little advantage in marketing their products on that basis unless it costs them little or nothing to do so.


                             2 Firms and the Market for Labor Standards
        “Their image is everything. They live or die by their image. That gives you a certain power over
them.”--Charles Kernaghan, National Labor Committee (The New York Times, June 18, 1996)


        Some well-known firms have responded to activist campaigns alleging that they or their
subcontractors mistreat workers. Levi’s adopted the first code addressing sweatshop issues after
allegations of abuse among its suppliers in Saipan. Wal-Mart followed after its products were linked to
child labor in Bangladesh. Nike initially rejected responsibility for conditions in its supplier factories but
then took steps to improve conditions in order to blunt unceasing criticism from activists. Alternatively,
Reebok has tried to avoid being tarred by the same brush as Nike by creating a human rights award to
honor activists fighting for democracy and against child labor and other abuses. Critics argue that
Reebok is hypocritical and has done little to upgrade working conditions in its factories but, so far, the
strategy has worked since activists have not targeted Reebok as aggressively as they have Nike.
        Allegations of sweatshop abuse generally arise in the apparel and footwear sectors, which are
labor-intensive, geographically mobile, and highly price-competitive (ILO 2000). Companies in these
                                                                                                             7
sectors focus on product design and marketing, while contracting out most or all of the actual
production. Large retailers with a prominent market presence, such as Wal-Mart and The Gap, or
firms with high brand name recognition and recognizable logos, such as Nike and Levi’s, are the most
vulnerable to activist campaigns since they sell their “image”, which can be tarnished by campaigns.
Indeed, Klein (1999) argues that these companies are the victims of their own success because they
increasingly base their marketing not on the utility of the products they sell, but on the “statement” the
product makes about the person consuming it. In addition, many of the targeted firms market heavily to
teenagers and young adults, where demand for branded clothing and footwear is often faddish. No one
wants the statement they make by wearing Nike shoes or Gap jeans to be that they are indifferent to
young women their age or younger slaving in a stifling factory for 12 hours a day. If it becomes gauche
to wear a given label’s apparel because it was made in a sweatshop, retailers could lose sales quickly.
Nor does it matter to the corporation whether the motivation is genuine concern for the workers who
make the product or simply the desire to be cool with one’s friends. In either case, “Brand image, the
source of so much corporate wealth, is also, it turns out, the corporate Achilles’ heel” (Klein 1999,
343).
        The move to “lean retailing” also affects the corporate response to anti-sweatshop campaigns.
The apparel industry has gone lean, holding low inventories of existing products and using information
technology to tailor items to market preferences as quickly possible (Weil 2000). This makes potential
supply disruptions, say because of revelations of child labor in a contract facility, especially costly to
firms. The premium on speed and the advantages of the North American Free Trade Agreement and
other hemispheric trade preferences has led US apparel firms to source more production in Mexico, the
Caribbean, and Central America., which also makes it easier for activists to uncover abuses.
        Offsetting the incentives to act pre-emptively are the costs of enforcing higher labor standards,
which the consumer surveys suggest will be difficult to fully pass on. In addition to any direct costs of
improving working conditions, the US retailer must also pay for monitoring compliance throughout its
supply chain. That means monitoring thousands of contractors around the world, who may, in turn,
subcontract jobs to thousands more, including home workers in some cases. Exhibit 3 shows the chain
of production for infant and children’s apparel between one US retailer, JC Penney, and workers in one
country, the Philippines. Through this chain JC Penney contracts with over 2,000 suppliers in more than
80 countries. And this is not unusual. Nordstrom has over 50,000 contractors and subcontractors,
                                                                                                              8
while the National Labor Committee estimates that Walmart has used 1,000 factories just in China and
that Disney licenses products in over 30,000 factories around the world.


                                   The firm’s response to campaigns
        Given an anti-sweatshop campaign, how will a profit-maximizing retailer or marketer respond?9
Absent a campaign, we assume that the firm cares nothing about labor standards and leaves it to the
contractor to balance the costs of improved work conditions against the potential productivity gains.
This gives the starting level of standards So. An activist campaign forces firms to re-assess the costs of
supplying standards against the potential loss of consumer demand. Increasing standards means that the
firm will require contractors to abide by a code of higher minimum standards and monitor compliance.
        Exhibit 4 shows how a campaign can change the price that consumers will pay for a product,
and the cost per unit of product of raising standards to different levels. Absent a campaign to inform
consumers about conditions, the firm charges Po while producing at base level standards So. A
campaign that fails to engage consumers, such as the unsuccessful effort against Disney, leaves the price
unchanged. By contrast, a successful campaign reduces the price the firm gets for producing under bad
conditions and raises the price if they produce under good conditions. On the basis of our survey
results, we assume that the slope of the price curve is kinked around the level of standards, S*, that
consumers would accept. Firms suffer large reductions in price for below-S* standards but gain only
modestly from above-S* standards.
        Given the new price curve that the campaign has produced, the firm will assess the benefits and
costs of raising standards. In the exhibit the cost curve starts at 0 and then rises linearly. The firm
maximizes profits by picking the level of standards where the price received for the good inclusive of
standards most exceeds the cost of standards. With curve C1, the costs of improving standards are so
high they cannot be recovered so the firm will not raise standards. In this situation the activist campaign
has failed in two ways. It has failed to raise standards and it has probably reduced the employment or
earnings of workers in contract facilities because the firm will reduce orders since it makes less money.
        With cost curve C2, by contrast, the maximum profit occurs at the kink point.10 The campaign
has attained its goal S* by presenting the firm with a stark choice: fail to meet S* and suffer price cuts to
sell the same amount (or alternatively, suffer reductions in sales at the same price) or enforce higher
standards throughout their supply chain with only modest possible gains in price.
                                                                                                               9
        Finally, with cost curve C3, the firm will produce standards in excess of the kink point. Here
the marginal cost of standards is so modest that the firm can potentially make more money by producing
high standards than it did before the campaign. For example, a firm that improved health and safety
among its suppliers, as Nike and Reebok did by moving to water-based adhesives in shoe production,
might publicize this in its advertisements, potentially gaining extra sales while also lowering injury rates
and improving worker effort or morale.
        The diagram directs attention to three determinants of the success of activist campaigns: the cost
of producing the standards; the level of standards at which the price curve changes shape; and the twist
in the price schedule when consumer concerns are stimulated. The asymmetry in demand reflected in
the price schedule explains why activists emphasize transparency of information while firms try to control
information about conditions as tightly as possible. Information about bad conditions is highly costly,
while information about good conditions raises revenues only modestly. This means that full disclosure of
the location of plants and independent monitoring of compliance with standards become issues of
conflict. If consumers responded more to information about good conditions, activists and firms would
have common ground on which to work.
        The model also highlights the dilemma activists face in their campaigns. On one side, to rouse
interest, activists must highlight the evils of low labor standards and stress how far current standards are
from S*, or some higher value the activists seek. On the other side, they need business and governments
to improve conditions, which requires some compromise with these groups. If activists are too
moderate or compromise too readily, they will not gain the support of consumers. But if their demands
are too radical, they will alienate business and government. By being either too “
activists can fail, since in either case firms will get greater profit from maintaining standards than from
working with suppliers to upgrade them.
        In sum, consumer demand for labor standards represents concerns that can readily show up in
the marketplace. But since consumers have no direct information about the conditions of work, their
demand for standards is a latent one that would typically remain beneath the surface but for the work of
the human rights vigilantes. The vigilante activists are catalytic agents, stimulating consumers through
their campaigns, and pressuring firms to improve conditions. Without them, there would be no anti-
sweatshop movement.


                                       3 Who Are the Vigilantes?
                                                                                                         10
        “And who appointed you to defend the workers making sneakers for my firm or the consumers
of my sneakers?” – Business executive facing student anti-sweatshop campaign
        Human rights vigilantes are self-appointed advocates, motivated by moral concerns, rather than
elected representatives of workers or consumers. They are a varied group, with differing expertise and
modes of operation. In a 1999 directory of US anti-sweatshop organizations, Global Exchange listed
40 different groups involved in anti-sweatshop campaigns in the United States. Web search yielded
several additional groups, including some outside the clothing area (coffee farmers, rug makers), as well
as groups outside the United States. A more extensive search would undoubtedly yield many more.
        Appendix A lists 43 US-based groups identified from these sources. Most are small rather than
mass membership organizations, and most are relatively new. Slightly more than half were formed in the
1990s and nearly 80 percent have existed only since 1980. Most groups concentrate on a particular
group of workers, either geographically, ethnically, or by industry or company. Some groups started as
anti-apartheid campaigners while several formed to protest human rights abuses and American policy
toward repressive regimes in Central American. For these groups, anti-sweatshop campaigns are the
next phase in their fight for peace and social justice.
        The groups constitute an ecology with varying orientations from moderate to militant. Some
have a religious base -- the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility, which was a key actor in the
efforts to reduce foreign investment in South Africa, and the NY State Labor-Religion Coalition are
cases in point. Others, such as the National Labor Committee (NLC) and United Students Against
Sweatshops (USAS), have an activist-left orientation. Yet others such as Verite, an organization that
monitors conditions of subcontractors for firms, or Co-op America, are apolitical do-gooders. As the
groups vary along many dimensions, the classification in Appendix A is by no means perfect.
        These organizations also play a variety of roles in the “market for standards.” Some, like
Corporate Watch or Jeff Ballinger’s Press for Change, focus on providing information about abuses.
Some seek out other key players to negotiate standards and a few provide monitoring services. Some
groups are vertically integrated, like the Council on Economic Priorities, which negotiated a standard
with various stakeholders and created an agency to oversee enforcement, and the International Labor
Rights Fund, which plays a role in all three functions.
        Morton Winston (forthcoming) of the College of New Jersey and Amnesty International has
categorized the groups into Confronters – who take a confrontational and adversarial approach to
corporations in the belief that only the threat of reduced profits will induce them to improve conditions;
                                                                                                         11
and Engagers, who seek to persuade firms to do “the right thing”. While the two groups often appear
to be at loggerheads, in fact both are necessary for the market for standards to function. Confronters
keep consumers riled up with their exposes, and gain support by generating strong campaigns. But they
cannot readily compromise with firms. Engagers broker agreements with firms but lose credibility by
compromising with “the enemy”. Without the confronters, firms, governments, and international
agencies could easily ignore moderate desires for improved standadrds. Without the moderates firms,
governments, and agencies would declare it impossible to meet militant demands and would reject them
out of hand.
        Thus, we have a classic mixed strategy type game. In equilibrium, there should be an
evolutionarily stable strategy division of activists between the two groups. When the marginal return to
confrontation is higher, more activists should adopt a confrontation strategy; when the marginal return to
engagement is higher, more activists should adopt strategy until the marginal returns from each are
equated. In the current phase of the movement, however, Winston (forthcoming) points to the risk of a
backlash among corporations if confronters refuse to recognize progress, relentlessly criticize
corporations that inevitably fall short, and “ensure that no good deed goes unpunished.” Fear of
becoming a target can then deter a company from taking even the first steps -- adopting a code or
allowing external monitoring.
        Among confronters, the NLC has been highly effective due to the skills of Charles Kernaghan
and to luck in the form of the Kathie Lee Gifford case, which we summarize shortly. Global Exchange
has also generated considerable media attention with its campaigns. In terms of providing “muscle” for
campaigns, church and student groups are the most important. Religious groups link anti-sweat
activities to congregations while the United Students Against Sweatshops (USAS) has spurred students
around the country to protest poor labor standards related to college licensed products. Student
activism has in fact taken center-stage in the anti-sweatshop movement, as USAS has successfully
pressured companies to make public the names and locations of subcontractors and spearheaded the
Worker Rights Consortium.


                                         The student activists
        “Clothing bearing our university logos ought to be produced under healthy, safe and fair
working conditions” USAS, College Clothes From the Concrete Prison, July 1999, p 1
                                                                                                          12
        The growth of anti-sweatshop activism among students has been sudden and sharp – an
example of the spurt phenomenon that often characterizes social movements (Freeman 1999). In 1995
there was no student anti-sweatshop movement in the United States. The AFL-CIO’s first Union
Summer in 1996 generated some student interest, but it was the United Needle and Textile Workers
Union (UNITE) that did most to catalyze student anti-sweatshop activity. UNITE hired a young
bachelor’s graduate, Ginny Coughlin, to coordinate their anti-sweatshop activity in 1995. Two years
later, the union hired 11 summer interns, all of whom had been active in a campaign against Guess jeans,
to work on anti-sweatshop activities. One intern, Tico Almeida, returned to his campus, Duke, and
initiated an anti-sweatshop campaign. When Duke agreed to demands that the university insist that its
licensees produce items under safe working conditions, with freedom to organize, and independent
monitoring, The New York Times carried the story (March 8, 1998, A16). In spring 1998, at a
conference in New York, 50 students involved in university-based anti-sweatshop campaigns started
USAS . Their major demand was that the Collegiate Licensing Company, the licensing agent for some
160 universities, implement stronger codes of conduct for its suppliers. By 2000, USAS had chapters
on nearly 140 campuses, ranging from highly elite universities with a tradition of student protest to small
liberal arts schools.
        What kinds of students become involved in anti-sweatshop activities? How much time and
effort do they give to anti-sweatshop campaigning? What motivates their efforts? To answer these
questions we surveyed nearly 100 USAS members in summer 1999.11 Forty-two percent of our
sample classified themselves as leaders and 31 percent viewed themselves as critical people in their
campus anti-sweatshop activities. Nearly three-fourths said they had helped initiate or participate in
their local campus campaign. In terms of demographics, the sample is divided nearly evenly between
men (53 percent) and women (47 percent) and is dominated by whites (84 percent) and non-black
minorities (15 percent). Seventy-five percent of the activists are social science majors (some joint
majors), usually sociology or political science; 18 percent were humanities majors and the remaining 7
percent were science or mathematics majors.
        Panel A of exhibit 5 shows the family background of student activists. Many come from
relatively well-to-do families: 36 percent report their family income as exceeding $100,000 -- more than
twice the 16 percent of all first year college students with that family income; while just 8 percent report
a family income of less than $40,000 compared to 35 percent of first year college students. The parents
of activists are more progressive than most Americans, and many parents are themselves activists. As a
                                                                                                               13
result of this concordance of attitudes, the activist students receive considerable support from their
parents. In fact, among parents the proportion who support student activists exceeded the proportion
critical of their activity by more than among professors or friends of the students not involved in the anti-
sweatshop movement. These student activists are not Lewis Feuer’s generation rebelling against their
parents. Rather, they are the product of a generational transmission of political attitudes and activity.
        Panel B of exhibit 5 shows that the students have a history of activism. Over half were involved
in campaigns in high school, and 84 percent had done activist work prior to their involvement with
USAS. Nearly a third had been members of trade unions and 9 percent had been involved in Union
Summer. The vast majority viewed themselves as politically committed activists rather than as as
apolitical do-gooders. Indicative of their values, the activists said that raising the well-being of third
world workers and greater unionization in the United States would make them happier than getting all
A’s in their classes.
        Panel C shows the time students gave to the anti-sweatshop campaign, to other extra-curricular
activities, and to their studies. The activist students spend about 6 hours a week on anti-sweatshop
work, with a small number giving over 20 hours a week to the campaign. In addition, the activists
spend 13 hours on other extra-curricular activities, so that their total time spent on non-academic
pursuits exceeds the time spent studying. Forty per cent hold jobs and work around 11 hours per
week. Nearly half say that if they were not involved in the anti-sweatshop movement, they would
devote the time to another cause.
        The final panel of exhibit 5 shows that students see the main cost of activism as lower grades,
but they see little effect on their romantic life, and believe that their activism has increased their self-
confidence, and communication and leadership skills.
        Exhibit 6 compares the attitudes of student activists to those of first year college students in the
UCLA/ACE annual American Freshman survey on identical questions.12 The activists are more
“liberal” than freshmen on most issues: they have a more open view toward sex, are less likely to
believe that race discrimination is a thing of the past, and are more likely to believe that the wealthy
should pay more taxes. At the same time, they are more tolerant of views with which they disagree –
only 38 percent believe that colleges should prohibit racist or sexist speech compared to 64 percent of
all freshmen. The activists are also more favorable to disobeying laws when the laws contravene their
convictions and more likely to believe that individual actions can change society. Finally, the activists
are markedly less interested in being well off financially or in raising a family than the freshmen and more
                                                                                                         14
interested in influencing political outcomes and becoming community leaders. In short, their attitudes
show that they are indeed “listening to a different drummer” than other college students.


                               4 What Activists Produce: Campaigns
        “Look, I don’t have time to be some kind of major political activist every time I go to the mall.
Just tell me what kind of shoes are okay to buy, okay?” --Teenage girl, St. Mary’s Secondary School,
Pickering Ontario (Klein 2000, 399)


        Human rights vigilantes produce campaigns for labor standards in the global economy. In so
doing, they hope to stimulate the concerns reflected in this young woman’s statement and help her find
             .” Their targets are simultaneously consumers like her and the corporations that sell her
shoes. The tools they use in their campaigns are the same as those used by other international advocacy
networks to pressure targeted actors to change: information politics, symbolic politics, accountability
politics, and leverage politics (Keck and Sikkink 1998, 16-25). Most anti-sweatshop campaigns
explicitly combine elements of the first three. Over time, the cumulative effect of many campaigns allows
activists to leverage their influence with governments and international institutions such as the
International Labor Organization (ILO), which have greater resources to act against sweatshop abuses.
        The first challenge facing an anti-sweatshop campaign is to obtain accurate, credible information
about labor conditions in factories producing brand name goods. Getting such information is difficult,
given the long production chains that often link manufacturers or retailers to workers in less developed
countries (exhibit 3; Verite). In addition, managers of export processing zones and unsympathetic
authoritarian governments often restrict access to facilities, making information-gathering in some cases
even more difficult (Klein 1999, 203-04; 212-13).
        The second challenge is to package the information in a way that strikes a moral chord among
consumers and generates enough publicity to put labor conditions on the public agenda. This is also no
easy task. Human rights vigilantes do not have large PR budgets nor automatic access to major media.
In a world plagued by catastrophes, wars, and multiple injustices, they compete for attention with other
compelling issues as well as with the weekly entertainment, sports, and scandal reports. Often this
means that the campaigns need to personalize the message through a spokesperson who becomes the
symbol of exploitation or through the closeness between the consumer and the product, as with college
                                                                                                         15
logo products. The type of abuse highlighted also matters, with child labor and unsafe working
conditions attracting more sympathy than restrictions on union activities.
        A campaign that succeeds in the first two tasks must then get firms or governments to undertake
corrective policies. The typical firm’s first response to a campaign is to claim ignorance; then it will
announce it has developed a code to prevent such occurrences in the future. In most cases, however,
the firm resists independent monitoring of code compliance, which might force it to expend real
resources. This is the point where activists turn to accountability politics, using the firm’s own promises
to pressure them to follow words with deeds. Writing about the corporate responsibility movement in
The Nation recently (October 2, 2000), William Greider noted that, “An enduring truth, a wise friend
once explained to me, is that important social change nearly always begins in hypocrisy.” Thus, anti-
sweat campaigns usually must generate several rounds of publicity and pressure to have any hope of
producing a change in behavior.
        At this writing, the anti-sweat activists have exposed bad conditions in some factories and
elicited promises of reform but have shied away from pointing consumers to shoes and sweatshirts that
are “okay.” Activists are cautious here for two reasons. First, a campaign that reduces sales will harm
the very workers the campaigns are designed to help, so activists generally eschew calls for consumers
to boycott products. Second, if activists endorse a given product, and someone finds that somewhere
in the world the firm or one of its subcontractors workers is abusing workers (highly likely given the long
supply chains), the activists risk losing their credibility.


                                   The 1990s anti-sweatshop campaigns
        Sweatshops have characterized apparel production since industrial revolution days, and so too
have campaigns to improve labor conditions in the industry. Many economists point out that low-wage,
labor-intensive production of items like apparel is often a taking off point for development in poor
agrarian countries with abundant labor and little capital. But low wages alone do not a sweatshop
make. Though much debate focuses on wages, there are other practices, such as forced labor or
safety conditions or denial of legally-mandated benefits that campaigns also address.
        Many of the issues are the same, but a major difference between anti-sweatshop campaigns at
the turn of the 21st century and those at the turn of the 20th century is that sweatshops then were largely
local whereas today they are found mostly in poor developing countries.13 This means that US-based
activists cannot lobby the US government to improve labor standards. Instead, they must target US-
                                                                                                           16
based corporations who operate or source in developing countries or pressure the world trading
community to demand changes in less developed countries. This strategy, as well as many of today’s
human rights vigilantes, have roots in the anti-apartheid campaign (see box 1). Anti-apartheid activists
first pressured firms through the Sullivan Principles and then turned to pressing governments to impose
economic sanctions on the apartheid regime. It is perhaps no coincidence that anti-sweatshop
campaigns gathered steam in the 1990s after apartheid was formally buried.
        Exhibit 7 summarizes the 1990s anti-sweatshop campaigns. They begin in 1992, when Levi
Strauss adopted the first known code of conduct addressing sweatshop abuses in response to a
Department of Labor investigation into illegal wage and other practices at supplier factories in the US
territory of Saipan (Varley 1998, 12). This code included criteria for source country selection, as well
as terms of engagement for suppliers. A year later, Levi’s announced that it would withdraw from
China because the human rights situation was unacceptable; but Levi’s never completed the withdrawal
and, in April 1998, reversed course and announced it was expanding operations in China.
        Shortly after Levi’s announced its code, a television broadcast showing children in a Bangladesh
factory sewing Wal-Mart label garments led that retailer to develop “Standards for Vendor Partners.”
But Wal-Mart also soon found itself back in the spotlight. In Spring 1996, the NLC’s Kernaghan
revealed that clothing endorsed by television personality Kathie Lee Gifford sold at Wal-Mart was
made under exploitative conditions in Honduras. Kernaghan had a powerful symbol for this campaign in
15-year old Wendy Diaz, a Honduran orphan who had worked long hours at low wages at the plant
since she was 13 to support herself and three younger brothers. Her story struck a particular chord
because the Kathie Lee labels advertised her commitment to children and pledged a share of the profits
to children’s causes. Gifford initially denied the allegations, then condemned the sweatshop practices
and pledged to ensure that her clothing line was never again made under such conditions. After other
Gifford-endorsed clothing was discovered being manufactured in a New York City sweatshop,
Secretary of Labor Robert Reich enlisted her into his “No Sweat” campaign to combat sweatshops in
the United States.
        Around the same time, activists pressured The Gap to allow independent monitoring by a local
NGO of a contract facility in El Salvador. Under similar pressure in 1997, Phillips-Van Heusen (PVH),
whose CEO sits on the board of Human Rights Watch, recognized a union at a joint venture facility in
Guatemala, a first in that country's apparel export sector (Varley 1998, 141-49). With the sweatshop
issue in the headlines, President Clinton joined with Reich, Gifford and others in August 1996 to create
                                                                                                          17
the Apparel Industry Partnership (AIP) to combat sweatshop practices internationally. Although many
multinational corporations and US retailers sourcing abroad had responded to activist pressure and bad
publicity by adopting corporate codes of conduct, the codes varied widely in the issues they addressed
and did not seriously address issues of compliance. The AIP brought together apparel manufacturers
and retailer/importers, unions, and NGOs in an effort to develop an industry-wide code and a credible
monitoring mechanism to verify compliance.
        When the AIP released its draft code and principles for monitoring in April 1997, anti-
sweatshop activists had divergent views on its value. Global Exchange’s Medea Benjamin blasted it as
a “lousy agreement,” primarily because it did not include a living wage, while UNITE President Jay
Mazur, an AIP member, called the code “unprecedented” and “a step in the right direction”
(NewsHour transcript, April 14, 1997). Continuing negotiations on implementation quickly bogged
down, however. In November 1998, the AIP unveiled plans to create a Fair Labor Association to
oversee implementation and monitoring of the code. UNITE, and the other union member, the Retail,
Wholesale and Department Store Union, and the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility
rejected the FLA as too weak and left the organization. These groups complained that the code failed
to require payment of a living wage; had weak language with respect to union rights in nondemocratic
countries; and had a weak monitoring and verification mechanism.
        Nearly two years later, the FLA still had no union representatives and had filled only five of the
six board seats allocated for labor, human rights, and consumer groups. To maintain the balance
required by the FLA’s charter, only 5 corporate representatives sat on the board and, overall,
corporate membership had increased only to 12 from the original 9, including Kathie Lee Gifford, Nike,
Reebok, Philips-Van Heusen, and Levi’s (www.fairlabor.org, last visited October 11, 2000). More
than 140 universities affiliated with the FLA, but this led to more troubles for the organization.
         Activist university students began coalescing around the anti-sweatshop issue in 1997 and
formed an organization, the United Students Against Sweatships (USAS) shortly after to pressure their
schools to require codes of conduct for all licensees producing college-logo apparel. Student activists
condemned the universities for joining what they viewed as the ineffective FLA and created the Worker
Rights Consortium (WRC), with a stronger code and alternative “verification model” (exhibit 8). USAS
pressured universities to join the WRC instead of the FLA. By June 2000, more than 50 universities
had signed on, though some, such as Brown University and the University of Michigan, affiliated with the
FLA as well.
                                                                                                              18
         In a separate effort, the Council on Economic Priorities (CEP), which has for many years
provided information on the social and environmental policies of companies, developed SA 8000 in
consultation with corporations, unions, and NGOs, including representatives from developing countries.
The CEP also established an agency, recently renamed Social Accountability International (previously
known as CEPAA) to accredit auditors of the SA 8000 standard. As of end-2000, SAI had
accredited 5 auditors who had in turn certified some 60 manufacturers or business service organizations,
more than half in China, as in compliance with SA 8000. At least one of the plants in China was
decertified, however, after an NLC report alleging a variety of violations was confirmed by SAI auditors
(Business Week, October 2, 2000). The organization also has 7 retailer “members,” including Avon,
Toys R Us, and Dole Foods; who are expected to encourage their suppliers to seek certification.
         Another organization, Verite, established in 1995, provides firms with independent monitoring of
working conditions through human rights inspections of factories worldwide, particularly in China and
Asia. Though hired by firms, Verite retains the right to publish the results of its inspections if the firm
does not rectify problems in six months (Rothstein 1996). The Ethical Trade Initiative is a European
effort that combines elements of the FLA and CEPAA, though it does not plan to create its own
monitoring mechanism. Rugmark is another European initiative that a US group has replicated here, to
label hand-made carpets as child-labor free.14
         Arguments over codes of conduct among activists and between them and firms have highlighted
three key issues in using workplace codes to improve labor conditions: what goes into the code, the
disclosure of plants covered by the code, and who monitors the code (exhibit 8). The most divisive
issue regarding the content of codes is whether to include a living wage: SA 8000 and the WRC do, the
FLA does not. The idea of a living wage resonates with many people, but it is difficult to define and
many corporations oppose it, which could deter broad acceptance of codes that include this provision.
The WRC has said that, while a living wage is crucial to their code, universities are not required to
implement that provision pending research on how to measure it. A second area of disagreement has
been over how to ensure freedom of association in countries such as China where the state restricts this
right.
         Regardless of content, codes can gain broad public support only if they have a credible
monitoring mechanism. For outside NGOs or any other independent organization to monitor adherence
to codes, there must be transparency in the names and locations of subcontractors. Initially major
manufacturers refused to identify their subcontractors, claiming it was a trade secret. The failure of the
                                                                                                           19
FLA to require such disclosure contributed to the decision by USAS to develop the Worker Rights
Consortium as an alternative. The students’ persistence on the disclosure issue was rewarded in fall
1999 when several firms agreed to make this information public, including Nike, which released a list of
41 plants producing licensed apparel for Duke, North Carolina, Georgetown, Michigan, and Arizona
(www.nikebiz.com/labor/disclosure.shtml; last visited January 1, 2001).
         Equally divisive is the issue of who does the monitoring. Firms prefer monitors from the
business community, such as PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and Ernst andYoung, whom they pay
and with whom they often do other business. Activists prefer monitors from local NGOs
because they believe workers will feel more comfortable talking to them and, therefore, more likely to
be honest in discussing problems at the plant. They are suspicious of business monitors and are fearful
of Potemkin Village audits of the kind that Andrew Young performed for NIKE in 1997 with a
whirlwind tour of factories that concluded all was well. Such skepticism appeared justified when the
Transnational Resource and Action Center posted on its Corporate Watch website (www.
corpwatch.org) a leaked Ernst and Young audit that concluded that Nike violated a number of
Vietnamese labor laws. A recent report by O’Rourke (2000) identified a number of problems with
company-arranged audits by PwC, especially in the areas of freedom of association and health and
safety. O’Rourke concluded that PwC’s methodology was flawed, biased toward management, and
that the auditors themselves were inadequately trained.
         The FLA and CEPAA address these problems by requiring that companies use an auditor that
has been certified by them as qualified to do independent verification of compliance. Both organizations
require monitors to consult with local NGOs and encourage NGOs to apply for accreditation but critics
argue that the accreditation procedures are too expensive or too complex for most NGOs to master. In
an interesting variation, the FLA allows agents to be accredited to monitor particular parts of the code,
without being expert in all of them. Although the FLA does not explicitly encourage member companies
to use teams of monitors, with expertise in different areas, this provision at least envisions such a
possibility.
         But USAS objects to the fact that the traditional accounting firms can be certified under these
programs and believes that the FLA approach leaves too much control in the hands of the corporations
(see exhibit 8). Realizing that even the best monitoring system cannot certify with 100 percent certainty
that even one factory is in compliance with a code 365 days a year, the WRC rejects the typical
monitoring and certification model because it conveys a “good housekeeping seal of approval,” even
                                                                                                             20
when problems remain in some areas. Their verification model enforces compliance through complete
disclosure of plant locations and information on conditions in them, backed by a system of local NGOs
prepared to receive worker complaints.
        Indicative of the depth of these conflicts, in spring 2000 NIKE ended licensing agreements with
Brown and the University of Michigan and cut off personal and corporate contributions to CEO Phil
Knight’s alma mater, the University of Oregon, after these universities joined the WRC. Nike objected
to the unwillingness of USAS to include corporations in the negotiation of WRC principles and
procedures and also criticized the “ambiguous living wage” provision and “gotcha monitoring”
(www.nikebiz.com/media/n_uofo.shtml; last visited September 1, 2000).


                            Assessing the effectiveness of the campaigns
        In their analysis of transnational advocacy, Keck and Sikkink (1998, 25) identify five levels of
potential effectiveness:
•   “issue creation and agenda-setting;”
•   “influence on discursive positions of states and international organizations”
•   “influence on institutional procedures”
•   “influence on policy change in ‘target actors’” (states, international organizations, corporations or
    other private sector actors)
•   “influence on state [or corporate] behavior.”
        Examining selected anti-sweatshop campaigns from this perspective shows that activists have
succeeded in getting the sweatshop issue on the agenda of corporations, governments and international
organizations; and have influenced the discursive position of states and international organizations, and
firms as well. Most major visible retail marketers have adopted corporate codes of conducts
addressing various labor standards.15
        But the effects on behavior are weaker. Exhibit 9 provides a summary of various campaigns
together with a crude measure of their achievements, using a 1 (little or no effect) to 5 (very effective)
scale. We have given low scores even to relatively successful campaigns in part because some targeted
firms backed off from their early responses or were subsequently found to have done less than they
promised. For instance, Kernaghans’s revelations about Kathie Lee apparel raised questions about
Wal-Mart’s earlier commitment to enforcing its code of conduct. Subsequent allegations about Wal-
Mart contractors in China, Saipan, and elsewhere suggest changes in behavior remain elusive. Phillips-
                                                                                                              21
Van Heusen canceled its contract with the unionized plant in Guatemala, forcing its closure. PVH
claimed it did so because it lost a major contract and had excess capacity, but critics questioned the
significance of the business lost and wondered why PVH could not have reduced capacity at a
nonunionized plant. Independent monitoring at The Gap facility in El Salvador continues and Liz
Claiborne, a member of the FLA, also signed an agreement for independent monitoring of a supplier
there. Levi Strauss expanded its operations in China despite a worsening human rights environment and
initially resisted joining the FLA or allowing any external monitoring at its facilities. In 1998, however,
Levi’s approached Oxfam about establishing a pilot monitoring program in its Dominican Republic
operations and subsequently joined both the FLA and the Ethical Trade Initiative in Europe (Oxfam
1998-99).
        In contrast to these partial or sometimes temporary successes is the failed NLC campaign
against Disney and its licensees in Haiti. With its focus on children and family values, Disney looked
like a good follow-on to the Kathie Lee campaign. Instead, Disney was perhaps the NLC’s biggest
failure. Although Disney sent its own investigators to check out the facilities in Haiti and reportedly
pressured them to make some improvements (see www.cleanclothes.org), one Disney subcontractor
in Haiti withdrew, causing the shutdown of the plant. Disney alternated between flatly denying the
allegations or simply not responding. Although Kernaghan staged protests outside a Disney store in
New York, consumers did not respond and the pressure did not force any substantial change in
Disney’s operations (Los Angeles Times, July 25, 1996). One possible reason this campaign failed is
that children are the ultimate consumer and many parents cannot say no when their child desperately
wants the latest Disney product that all their friends have. Another possible explanation is that it was
difficult to embarrass Disney CEO Michael Eisner as a hypocrite because he lacks visible links to human
rights and charitable causes that other targets have had.16
         The narrow membership of the FLA and SAI; the difficulties in getting the FLA monitoring
system up and going; the split between the FLA and Worker Rights Consortium, and the development
of SA 8000 in competition with both highlight two weaknesses of the anti-sweatshop campaigns. The
limited membership of the umbrella groups, combined with Nike’s reaction to the WRC and Disney’s
stonewalling of Kernaghan, suggest that most firms still view the activists as a minor rather than serious
threat. The proliferating number of groups risk consumer confusion and frustration, which could further
exacerbate the problem of generating enough demand to force changes in corporate behavior (Freeman,
1998; Liubicic 1998).17
                                                                                                           22
        Could these divisions be reduced and the various participants in the anti-sweatshop activity
advance under a common banner? The example of environmental groups interested in promoting
sustainable forestry suggests that under some circumstances different activists and firms can coalesce
around a common standard overseen by a single accreditation agency. In 1993 environmental groups,
forest companies and retailers, negotiated a code and developed the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)
for certifying compliance (see box 2). Some environmentalists have criticized the FSC for cooperating
too closely with industry groups, but large American timber companies formed the rival Sustainable
Forestry Initiative because they regard FSC standards as too stringent. Nevertheless, the FSC has
succeeded in getting commitments from major retailers selling more than 20 percent of the lumber
products used in home repair and remodeling in the United States and an even higher share in Europe.
“Industry executives say the movement is quickly reaching critical mass, and could soon make it a
liability for wood products producers not to have the FSC imprimatur” (Wall Street Journal,
September 26, 2000, 1)
        However, there are important differences between consumer desire for clothing made outside of
sweatshops and the desire for sustainable forestry. Self-interest among firms operated as an important
motivator in sustaining the FSC campaign, in ways that it has not in the anti-sweatshop area . Several
wood products retailers identified a competitive advantage in being “green” and thus were willing to
make commitments to buy FSC-certified products.18 Individual consumers also often see gains to
themselves from environmental improvements, whereas the beneficiaries from improvements in
sweatshops are the workers in those factories. The sustainable forestry campaign also suggests that
vigilante pressure works better when there are a relatively small fixed number of market leaders whose
actions can be readily monitored. Sweatshop activists have focused on major firms, but the wide supply
chain in apparel makes it hard to pin down key decision-makers. Moreover, in both forestry and
apparel, a successful campaign can disadvantage small suppliers. In the forestry case, this presumably
creates no new environmental problem, but in the sweatshop case, success may displace home-workers
or others in the informal sector who cannot enter the formal economy for cultural, child-rearing or other
reasons.19
        The anti-sweatshop activists also have a more difficult task than anti-apartheid activists in an
earlier era. In contrast to ending apartheid, success in eradicating sweatshop exploitation is more
difficult to measure: exactly what defines a sweatshop and what does it mean to clean them up?
Success is measured in incremental steps and requires constant vigilance to guard against backsliding.
                                                                                                             23
The anti-apartheid activists had strong union and non-governmental groups in less developed countries
with which to work, and the ANC to press for changes on the ground. Indeed, in contrast to the anti-
sweatshop activists, who are leading the worldwide campaign against sweatshops, anti-apartheid
activists played a more secondary role, supporting the ANC in its efforts to overturn the minority
apartheid regime in South Africa.


                 5 Risks and Limitations of the Activist Consumer-based Model
        Most developing country governments, multinational corporations, and trade economists, and
many development experts argue that anti-sweatshop campaigns are likely to do more harm than
good.20 How valid are their concerns? How much good can even the most successful activist-initiated,
consumer-based campaign do in improving labor standards in poor countries?


                                The risk that doing good will do harm
        “Bad jobs at bad wages are better than no jobs at all.” Paul Krugman 21
        “Empleo si, pero con dignidad.” Nicaraguan Maria Elena Cuadra, Movement of Working and
Unemployed Women.22


        The argument that anti-sweatshop campaigns risk harm to workers in less developed countries
begins with the fact that sweatshop jobs are better than jobs in rural agriculture or the informal sector,
particularly for the young women who make up the bulk of the sweatshop work force. Studies of
wages and employment show that foreign-owned and export-oriented factories in developing countries
offer higher pay and better conditions on average than those of domestic firms producing for the local
market (Varley 1998). Wages in footwear and apparel may be at the bottom of manufacturing, but they
are generally higher than the minimum wage level in many developing countries and better than
conditions in agriculture (US Department of Labor 2000). While there are situations where workers are
mislead by employer promises, subject to forced labor, or paid less than they are promised, workers
choose sweatshop jobs because those jobs are the best alternatives available to them.
        Critics of human rights vigilantes fear that the campaigns will discourage exports from less
developed countries and reduce foreign investment in those countries, which would lower the demand
for labor and reduce worker well-being. Some believe that the activists are motivated by protectionism
or are misguided followers of those who are. The evidence in earlier sections rejects this assertion. The
                                                                                                           24
human rights groups, students, and church groups who make up the activist community do not compete
with low paid workers in developing countries. If they succeed in their campaigns, they will raise the
prices of the goods they consume rather than raise trade barriers. USAS, which has close ties to the
apparel union UNITE, has opposed firms shifting production of college logo clothing to US factories as
a means of improving standards (Moore 2000, 10). The NLC’s Kernaghan has also criticized firms that
“cut and run” rather than clean up and monitor a substandard facility.
        But motivation aside, anti-sweat campaigns could still have adverse effects on developing
country workers. Even if anti-sweatshop campaigns do not call for consumer boycotts of targeted
goods, negative publicity could deter trade and investment and reduce the number of jobs available in
countries with already high levels of unemployment and underemployment. Or campaigns could have
the perverse effect of pushing production out of the formal sector into areas of the economy with even
lower standards and less visibility. Demands for living wages in anti-sweatshop campaigns run the
greatest risk of backfiring, since such demands could price workers in less developed countries out of
some markets. This is particularly the case if the living wage target is determined by outside activists
with strong ideological stances rather than by local NGOs or unions who can better weigh the danger to
jobs of large imposed increases in wages. In terms of our analysis, an “excessive living wage” would
place the cost curve for making improvements far above the price line, so that firms would fight this
demand, or close shop.
        To date, however, the danger that anti-sweat shop campaigns will harm workers in less
developed countries has been more rhetoric than reality. One reason is that the activists are aware of
the dangers and try to avoid them. Indeed, the wide range of groups in the activist community almost
guarantees that if some group pushes demands that are counter-productive another group will modify
them or take corrective action.
        Campaigns against child labor provide an example of this. The ILO’s International Program on
the Elimination of Child Labour works to replace child labor with better opportunities. In two cases,
involving the Bangladesh garment industry and Pakistani-produced soccer balls, external pressure led to
joint initiatives involving industry, government, and the ILO that required the provision of educational
alternatives for displaced child workers and turned a potential harm into a positive outcome. In
Bangladesh, more than 12,000 children were moved from work to school and their share of the
workforce in the garment sector has fallen from an estimated 30 percent to just 5 percent five years later
(ILO 2000, 55). In Pakistan, thousands more children also have better opportunities as a result of
                                                                                                            25
outside intervention and assistance. Similarly, consumers buying Rugmark-labeled, child-free carpets
pay a premium that, in addition to paying the costs of certification, goes to build schools for affected
children. In the absence of ready alternatives, NLC campaigns that target child labor concentrate on
increasing the pay for children, rather than on getting firms to produce goods child-free.
        Activist debates over living wages also give considerable attention to the dangers of unintended
adverse consequences. A 1999 anti-sweatshop symposium at the University of Wisconsin warned that
campaigns “may produce serious negative feedback loops. These could include the following: Firms
may concentrate their production of college apparel in high-wage countries, moving more of their other
operations to the lower-wage economies. ... Firms could maintain production in the low-wage
economies, but create small high-wage enclaves within them (which would have) little positive effect on
the rest of the local labor market. Setting the wage too high relative to local market conditions could
create difficulties for monitoring. This is because a strong incentive would be created to circumvent the
wage mandate. For example, workers could sell a share of their high-wage jobs under the table to their
relatives or friends; so that, in fact, multiple workers are employed at a single ‘living wage’ job.” The
conclusion was that any campaign had to take account of local market conditions and base its decision
on “What would be the wage bargained for by workers if they were allowed to organize and bargain
collectively in a free, democratic environment?”23
        Fears that anti-sweatshop campaigns could reduce foreign investment and jobs in less advanced
countries seem in any case beside the point in a world where the overwhelming trend is toward
expansion of manufacturing, particularly apparel and shoes, into less developed countries. The income
gaps between those countries and advanced countries are so great that it is difficult to imagine a
scenario where anti-sweatshop activism could reverse this trend, even if, contrary to the evidence, the
activists wanted to accomplish as much. The danger is much more that firms will shift their operations
from less developed countries with higher and more expensive standards to similar countries with lower
and less expensive labor standards. As an example, in the banana industry, lower-cost labor in Ecuador
--in part the result of low unionization rates -- threatens workers in Colombia. But such threats are
likely with or without activist campaigns.


                                  Limits of the market for standards
        Assume that human rights vigilantes ran a completely successful anti-sweatshop campaign,
inducing all their targets to have verifiable codes of conduct and avoiding adverse unintended
                                                                                                          26
consequences. By itself, how much would this raise living standards in the targeted countries? Sadly,
not by much. Consumers appear to care largely about the ways in which the things they personally
consume are produced, so that virtually all campaigns focus on standards in export sectors in less
developed countries, rather than in sectors with the worst labor conditions or on conditions in less
developed countries more broadly. 24 In total, exports by low income countries of apparel and footwear
are only 2 percent of world exports, 14 percent of total low-income country exports, and 3 percent of
their GDP.
        Moreover, since the major stick behind the campaigns is the threat to corporate reputations or
brand names, activist campaigns target well-known firms, rather than producers of generic and
unbranded products, who may produce goods under poorer conditions than better-known firms. The
high-end retailer/marketer who uses a relatively smaller number of more stable suppliers is also more
likely to be able to enforce compliance with standards. Lower-end retailers, such as Wal-Mart,who are
more interested in price than quality or design often use middle-man buyers to locate suppliers, making it
hard to enforce their codes of conduct. The college apparel market targeted by USAS is smaller yet.
        In short, human rights vigilantes cannot greatly improve living standards in poor countries under
any realistic scenario -- only sustained economic growth can do that -- though they may be able to bring
some modest gain in well-being to some workers.


                                       What about the workers?
        “In the end the only ones who can stand up for workers’ rights are workers themselves” Medea
Benjamin25


        Anti-sweatshop campaigns in advanced countries would be unnecessary if workers in less
developed countries were free to defend their own well-being by forming trade unions or other such
organizations. At best activists in advanced countries interceding for workers is a second best
alternative to workers defending their own rights, negotiating with management appropriate standards,
and jointly monitoring implementation. In industries with high labor turnover, external monitors cannot
readily inform workers about codes of conduct, nor provide the day-to-day scrutiny of facilities that
workers can (Frost 2000; Bernard 1997).
        More broadly, Keck and Sikkink (1998) found that having allies within the targeted country
was a factor in many of the successful cases of transnational advocacy that they studied. Vocal support
                                                                                                            27
for economic sanctions by black leaders in South Africa, even though they were the ones expected to
suffer the most economic pain, was an important factor in the success of the anti-apartheid campaign.
         In contrast, anti-sweatshop campaigns have made little or no headway in pressing for freedom
of association in less advanced countries, which would give exploitated workers a voice. The WRC,
the FLA and SA 8000 codes include respect for freedom of association and collective bargaining rights,
but implementation of these codes is difficult absent major changes in the developing countries
themselves. Even corporations concerned with standards typically leave union rights out of their codes
of conduct (ILO 1998; Varley 1998) Business is anti-union because unions will alter authority relations
within firms and shift revenues from owners to workers (ILO 2000, 61-63). The government of many
less developed countries, including China, oppose independent unions, because unions are an
independent source of power on a political scene otherwise dominated by a single party or narrow elite.
These attitudes make unionization extraordinarily difficult to attain, even in countries that nominally
accept the freedom of association standard of the ILO. At the same time, activists are likely to have
trouble arousing consumer concern over the freedom to unionize, according to the PIPA poll in exhibit
1.
         Campaigns where unionism was a key issue, as with the PVH plant in Guatemala, have not been
sustained for long. By shifting orders to a nonunion firm, multinationals can readily undo the effects of
successful organization, or they can accede to other demands but not to demands for organization. At
the Gap’s Mandarin factory in El Salvador, the main source of contention was the unwillingness of
management to allow formation of a union and the firing of union organizers. After the campaign
publicized violations in the company’s code of conduct, the Gap worked to improve conditions and
even guaranteed a minimum number of orders, offsetting lost orders from elsewhere that resulted from
negative publicity (Varley 1998, 302). In addition, the Gap allowed independent monitoring, but there
is still no union in that plant.
         In fact, although some human rights vigilante groups, like the NLC and USAS, have close ties
to trade unions, there are serious tensions between the vigilante groups and unions (Compa, 2000).
The anti-sweat NGOs are not elected by workers. They are accountable to consumers, funders, and
other Western supporters. Some trade unionists fear that the vigilantes demands for corporate codes of
conduct and independent monitoring will inadvertently serve as a weak substitute for unions. On the
other side, the NGOs feel that they can accomplish something, while it is unrealistic to expect free and
independent unions to operate in many third world countries.
                                                                                                           28
         In a September 1998 workshop organized by the British-based NGO Labour Rights Network
(the NGO representatives to the Ethical Trade Initiative), representatives from developing countries
stressed the importance of involving local NGOs and unions from the beginning in anti-sweatshop
campaigns to ensure that they address local priorities and interests. They agreed that while “Codes
could be useful as a means of exerting leverage on management, the key issue was workers’ own level
of organisation and ability to carry out collective bargaining. ... The ideal combination is for NGOs to
play a supporting role by providing training and services and campaigning for the respect of trade union
rights, and encouraging more traditional unions to take up previously unrepresented groups and gender
issues.” 26
        Of the other human rights vigilante groups, USAS has been particularly attuned to the need to
gain support from workers groups on the ground. The Workers Rights Consortium eschews the usual
monitoring agencies and emphasizes the need to engage and strengthen local workers’ organizations and
NGOs by providing financial and technical assistance.

        The goal of anti-sweatshop campaigns is to improve conditions for workers in less developed
countries. But they cannot do this directly. Their effectiveness depends on catalyzing other economic
agents: firms, governments, international agencies, and the sweatshop workers themselves. To what
extent and under what conditions have campaigns succeeded?
        A priori, there are a range of possible outcomes from anti-sweatshop campaigns: (1) the
campaigns could make things worse by generating negative publicity that causes sales or prices to drop
for the products of sweatshop workers; (2) the campaigns could have no effect at all if firms do not
view the threat of a consumer backlash as credible; (3) the campaigns could catalyze firms to improve
standards when the consumer threat is credible relative to the cost of improvements; or (4) the
campaigns could catalyze firms, governments, and international agencies to undertake broader
sustainable improvements.
                                                                                                          29
        Our analysis rejects (1) and (2) but indicates that the activitists have had some limited success in
catalyzing consumers and firms to change their behavior to improve sweatshop conditions. Activist
campaigns have succeeded in getting most major, visible retailers and marketers to develop their own
corporate codes of conduct addressing various labor standards. They have induced some, such as the
GAP and NIKE, to improve labor conditions in their overseas factories, at some expense. The April
2000 Starbucks agreement to market Fair Trade certified coffee, which gives farmers a premium over
the prevailing market price, would never have been done had not human rights vigilantes developed a
social climate where such actions are seen as in the corporate interest. Similarly, the fact that Nike and
Reebok eliminated toxic chemicals in the production of athletic footwear is, at least in part, a response
to activist pressures. And while many activists attack the FLA because it is much weaker than they
would like, its creation, and that of SA8000, are also a product of their campaigns. Some campaigns
have indeed shifted the price curve facing firms so that the firms have chosen the “improved standards”
solution (see exhibit 4). So far, however, the successes are ad hoc and often temporary.
        The limited direct effects of campaigns are not the end of the story, however. The anti-
sweatshop activists have had gotten sweatshop issues on the international agenda and, together with
unions and other groups protesting the policies of the World Trade Organization (WTO), have
convinced key governments and international agencies that they must deal with labor standards to
maintain support for liberal trade policies. This pressure has contributed to a variety of efforts by agents
with more reach and power than the activists to empower workers and better enforce labor standards.
        On the government side, the insistence of the Clinton administration that new multilateral trade
negotiations address labor standards issues is a response to activist and US union pressures. Without
these pressures, new “fast-track” trade negotiating authority likely would have been approved by
Congress without attention to this issue (Elliott 2000). Congress also would not have raised the US
contribution to the ILO campaign to eliminate child labor from $2.1 million in 1995 to $45 million in
2001 (Congressional Record, December 15, 2000, H12128). While the US cannot dictate the place
of labor standards in the next round of world trade negotiations -- China and other less advanced
countries are adamantly opposed-- the fact that the debate is not whether but how to strengthen
enforcement of core labor standards (as defined by the ILO, World Social Summit, and others) is an
important outcome from a decade of activism.
        On the international agency front, activists have put labor rights on the world agenda in a big
way. In 1999, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan unveiled a new “Global Compact,” calling on the
                                                                                                         30
business community to respect nine core principles in the areas of human rights, worker rights, and
environmental protection. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development recently
added language on worker rights to its guidelines for multinational corporations and The World Bank
has a child labor program and is focusing more attention on gender discrimination issues. Maybe with a
bit more pressure, the International Monetary Fund will endorse transparency in labor markets, as it
does in capital markets and the World Bank will drop its ambivalence about the role of unions in
development.
        The major beneficiary of activist pressures to strengthen enforcement of standards is the
International Labor Organization. As a result of the desire of employers and key governments to divert
pressures to incorporate labor standards in the WTO and other trade agreements, the ILO is receiving
both more attention and more resources to deal with “core” labor standards, especially child labor.
Yes, the 2000-2001 $56 million budget for the ILO’s Program to Eliminate Child Poverty is minuscule
in comparison with the revenues and expenditures of almost any multinational firm. The ILO also does
not have anything like the financial resources to push its child labor program that the IMF or World
Bank have to push their programs of financial reforms or economic rectitude. But this is a huge increase
over previous budgets, with much of the increase funded by the United States. In addition, the ILO
codified the consensus definition of “core” labor standards in its 1998 “Declaration on Fundamental
Principles and Rights at Work” and is also receiving increased funding from the US and other
governments to beef up the monitoring of and technical assistance for the enforcement of core
standards.
        The best example of how activism has galvanized the ILO and produced a better outcome for
workers than activists could have attained by themselves is in the child labor area. In the mid-1990s,
activists exposed the use of child labor in the Bangladeshi garment industry and in the soccer ball
industry in Pakistan and pressured retailers to address the problem. The initial industry response in
Bangladesh was to throw the children out on the street and it was only after the ILO and UNICEF
intervened that a constructive solution was found. Manufacturers in Bangladesh and Pakistan agreed not
simply to stop employing children but to cooperate with and assist in the funding of programs to put
them in schools or other rehabilitative training, and to allow the ILO to monitor the results.
        Finally, the upsurge of labor activism in some poor Asian countries, notably Cambodia and
Indonesia, shows how external pressure and support, in these cases from activists, governments, and
the ILO, can empower workers (Time, July 10, 2000, “Hell No, We Won’t Sew”). In a bilateral trade
                                                                                                             31
negotiation with Cambodia, the United States responded to activist and union pressure to promote labor
standards by using its market power as a carrot, rather than a stick. As part of a bilateral textile trade
agreement, US negotiators offered to expand Cambodia’s export quota by 14 percent if “working
conditions in the Cambodia textile and apparel sector substantially comply with [local] labor law and
standards.”27 In the first review in December 1999, US officials concluded that “substantial
compliance” had not been achieved but, in recognition of the progress that had been made, it offered a
5 percent quota increase to be implemented when Cambodia completed an agreement with the
International Labor Organization (ILO) creating an independent monitoring program (USTR press
release, 18 May 2000). The ILO agreed to the plan after gaining a commitment from US officials to
fund a parallel program to provide technical assistance and training to the Cambodian labor ministry and
the quota increase was granted in May 2000. In response to worker protests following conclusion of
the bilateral agreement, the secretary-general of the Cambodia Garment Manufacturers Association
complained, “All the attention gives the workers the comfort level that they are calling the shots”
(Financial Times, April 7, 2000). In this case, activist pressure contributed to empowerment of the 15
to 20 percent of Cambodian workers in the apparel sector, at least some increased access to the US
market, and increased bureaucratic capacity to enforce labor standards for all workers.
        Despite signs of movement, activists have been least successful is in moving the core labor
standard of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining from rhetoric to reality. These
“enabling rights” would allow sweatshop workers to decide for themselves what issues to pursue,
trade-offs to make, and battles to conduct with their employers and would probably do more for
improving labor standards than anything else. The activists are a key voice directing attention to
violations of the rights of workers who seek to exercise their rights overseas, but they ultimately must
rely on workers and institutions in those countries to take the lead, much as the African National
Congress and COSATU did in South Africa.28
        Still, these cases show that activist pressure can catalyze more powerful actors on the world
scene and contribute to improvements in whole sectors, rather than single plants. Such agreements are
likely to be more sustainable than standard anti-sweatshop campaigns because the ILO and Western
governments provide financial and technical assistance and because the ILO monitors implementation.
        Finally, while anti-sweatshop campaigns do risk reducing the flow of resources to less
developed countries, they can also increase those flows. At the consumer level, this can occur when
consumers pay for improvements in labor standards through higher prices or when the campaigns
                                                                                                            32
squeeze oligopolistic profits on branded goods. In some sectors, such as soccer balls which are
overwhelmingly sourced in Pakistan, or in cases where campaigns cover the bulk of firms in a sector,
they have the potential to improve the terms of trade for the less developed country (Brown, Deardorff,
and Stern 1993). At the national or international level this can occur through an increase in expenditures
in technical assistance or funding of programs, for instance to move children from work to school. But
to have a bigger effect, the anti-sweat activists would have to tackle issues that go beyond poor labor
conditions in particular factories or in particular products – such as debt relief and reduction of trade
barriers to developing countries -- that they have thus far not put at the front of their agenda.
        In sum, by putting labor rights and the living standards of workers in poor countries on the
agenda of powerful economic agents and governments and international agencies, human rights
vigilantess have catalyzed something that has the potential for improving the well-being of workers in
poorer countries. There is nothing in economic analysis, however, that guarantees a positive result nor
that guarantees the bad outcomes that critics of the activists fear. It depends on the smarts of the
activists and their campaigns.

                          Box 1 Precedents in the anti-apartheid campaign


        An early attempt to use grass-roots pressure to influence corporate policies in foreign countries
was the anti-apartheid campaign of the 1970s and 1980s.29 Seeking to put pressure on the minority
white South African government to reform, anti-apartheid activists first tried to convince foreign
investors to withdraw from South Africa. When that failed, the Reverend Leon Sullivan developed a
code of conduct to encourage corporations in South Africa to treat black workers equally and to set an
example by promoting them to management positions. To induce companies to either withdraw from
South Africa or accept the Sullivan Principles, activists used threats of boycotts, shareholder pressure
by church organizations, and protests by college students calling on their universities to cleanse their
endowments of investments in companies operating in South Africa. The Sullivan Principles were
ultimately adopted by hundreds of companies and resulted in improved working conditions in affected
facilities. But the ultimate goal of the activists remained the end of apartheid in South Africa and the
Principles had little impact on the white regime’s commitment to or ability to sustain apartheid.
        As unrest and violence escalated in the mid-1980s, increasing numbers of foreign investors
withdrew from South Africa, but this was due more to the deteriorating economic and political situation
in South Africa than to pressure from anti-apartheid activists. In particular, the decision by Chase
Manhattan not to rollover loans to South Africa in mid-1985, following the government’s declaration of
a state of emergency, appears to have been driven by an assessment of the risks involved in investing in
South Africa rather than activist pressures in the United States. That decision in turn triggered a financial
crisis in South Africa.
        Frustrated by the intransigence of the white regime, American activists turned their attention to
the US Congress. Civil disobedience by protestors over the course of many months in front of the
South African embassy in Washington raised the profile of the issue and contributed to passage of
legislation imposing economic sanctions against South Africa in 1986. In 1987, Sullivan gave up on his
code and called for additional sanctions, including mandatory corporate withdrawal from South Africa.
Although economic sanctions did not cause the financial crisis, public pressure and sanctions
complicated its resolution and contributed to the realization in South Africa that fundamental political
reforms would be needed to achieve sustainable growth (Hufbauer, Schott, and Elliott, forthcoming).
After more than two decades of sustained activism with limited success, the financial crisis coupled with
                                                                                                               34
the end of the Cold War contributed to rapidly accelerating reforms and the fall of the white minority
regime in 1994.
        Besides providing precedent and people, the anti-apartheid story contains potential lessons for
the anti-sweatshop activists. First, it underscores the fact that corporations typically respond only to
external pressures that tangibly affect their bottom line. Most multinationals in South Africa were willing
to adopt the Sullivan Principles because it was a relatively inexpensive way to protect their reputation
while maintaining profitable operations. The accelerated pace of withdrawal in the mid-1980s was
largely due either to conditions in South Africa that increased risk or reduced profitability, such as the
financial crisis, or to government actions that had similar effects, such as the denial of credits for taxes
paid in South Africa.
        Second, perhaps the most important roles that the anti-apartheid activists played were in terms
of symbolic and leverage politics. Anti-apartheid activists within South Africa supported and gained
politically from the imposition of sanctions. The support of external activists bolstered the ANC and
their allies psychologically and, when the white regime finally came to the table, sanctions gave the ANC
leverage in negotiating the terms of the transition. In addition, by influencing the American and
Commonwealth governments, the activists contributed to the sense of isolation and growing
hopelessness about the future among whites in South Africa.
                                                                                                           35
                Box 2 Environmental labeling and the Forest Stewardship Council


        The FSC is an independent nonprofit NGO that accredits certifying organizations who, in turn,
monitor member companies and certify forest products as being in compliance with the FSC’s code of
ten principles for sustainable forestry. It was founded in October 1993 when the World Wildlife Fund
joined with the Rainforest Alliance (a New York-based NGO with its own certification scheme) and
representatives of forest companies and retailers, including B&Q (Britain’s largest home improvement
retail chain), to negotiate a code and procedures for certifying compliance.30 The organization is
transparent and democratic, with a governing body composed of three separate “chambers” with
representatives of social, environmental, and economic interests. Although more radical environmental
groups criticized the FSC for having corporations as members, several of the most prominent
environmental activist groups joined, including Greenpeace International, the Sierra Club, and various
chapters of Friends of the Earth. With their support and that of a few large retailers, FSC quickly
became the market leader in forest product certification. It created a standard code, established
credibility through independent monitoring, and provided consumers with readily available information
by creating an easily recognized logo to mark certified products.31
        In its first seven years, the FSC accredited nine “certification bodies” in six countries, has seven
applications pending, and has certified nearly 20 million hectares in 33 countries, including 1.8 million in
the United States. To keep up the pressure on the demand side, NGOs convinced Ikea, the world’s
largest furniture retailer with 1999 sales of $8.5 billion, and Home Depot, the largest do-it-yourself
company with 1997 sales of $24 billion, to phase-out wood products from old-growth forests that have
not been certified.32 In 1998, under pressure from its customers, the largest forestry company in British
Columbia, MacMillan Bloedel, announced that it would no longer clear-cut old-growth forests in coastal
BC. The following spring, two other BC forestry companies followed suit (Hoberg 1999). In addition,
there are a number of national initiatives to form “forest and trade networks,” which have evolved from
“buyers’ clubs” with the aim of “span[ning] the industry from forest owner to architect, manufacturer to
retailer,” to promote FSC certification (www.panda.org/tradefair2000/ network.htm; last visited June 9,
2000). As of June 2000, there were networks in North America, Australia, the Nordic countries and
eight other European countries involving more than 500 member companies.
        The FSC example shows that activist-inspired, consumer-based campaigns can contribute to
changes in market behavior, but it also underscores the limitations to such campaigns. First, as the
                                                                                                            36
WWF concedes, the area of certified forest is “modest” and the supply of certified products is
“limited.” The 20 million certified hectares compares to an average 11.3 million hectares lost each year
to deforestation out of a total 3.5 billion hectares of global forest cover. Only around 3 million hectares
are certified in tropical forests areas of the developing world, where deforestation is of the most
concern. 33 Second, the market impact of certification is difficult to assess because there are no data on
the volume or share of wood products from certified forests. Third, FSC credibility depends on the
ability to verify the chain of custody, which is most easily done when there are relatively small numbers
of large buyers and sellers. Small forest owners complain that certification is too expensive and the
standards inappropriate for them. Fourth, the impact of certification is limited because slash and burn
agriculture and the use of wood for fuel are much greater threats to forests in many countries.

Find arguments for/against labor standards convincing
    Standards will eliminate jobs                                                                         37
    Standards interfere with national sovereignty                                                         41
    Low standards give unfair advantage                                                                   74

Do not expect workers in foreign countries to make US wages, but expect countries to permit
wages to rise by allowing unions / stopping child labor                                                   82

1990            Charles Kernaghan becomes director of National Labor Committee (NLC), founded in 1981
                to oppose Reagan administration policies in Central America.

1992            Levi Strauss develops first code of conduct for suppliers following DOL suit against
                contractors in Saipan over wages, etc.; a year later, Levi’s announces plans to withdraw
                from China because of human rights situation there.

1992            Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) introduces bill to bar imports of goods produced using child
                labor; reintroduces in each Congress until 1997 when he substitutes legislation calling for
                beefed up enforcement of existing law barring imports of goods produced with forced labor,
                including bonded or other forced child labor.

1993            Wal-Mart publishes “Standards for Vendor Partners” after televised revelations regarding
                child labor use by suppliers in Bangladesh.

August 1993     Clinton administration negotiates side agreements on labor and environment to accompany
                North American Free Trade Agreement.

March 1995      Criticized for “de-linking” human rights from most-favored nation trade status for China
                in 1994, Clinton administration releases “model business principles” to encourage MNCs
                to adopt voluntary codes of conduct in operations around the world.

August 1995     Department of Labor closes down sweatshop in El Monte California after discovering
                immigrant Thai workers being forced to work in slave-like conditions; incident gives
                momentum to Secretary Robert Reich’s campaign to combat sweatshops in US.

December 1995   Under pressure from NLC, People of Faith Network over working conditions in El
                Salvador, The Gap agrees to independent monitoring of contractor facility.

Spring 1996     NLC’s Kernaghan reveals Wal-Mart clothing endorsed by television personality Kathie
                Lee Gifford is produced under exploitative conditions, including child labor; Gifford vows
                to remedy situation; second scandal involving Gifford-endorsed clothing produced in
                American sweatshops in New York leads to collaboration with Labor Secretary Reich on
                his “No Sweat” campaign.

August 1996     President Clinton, Secretary Reich announce creation of Apparel Industry Partnership,
                bringing together retailer/importers, unions, and NGOs to address sweatshop issue.

March 1997      Management in a Phillips-Van Heusen (PVH) contract facility in Guatemala recognizes
                union, a first in that country’s apparel export sector.

April 1997      AIP report outlines “Workplace Code of Conduct” and “Principles of Monitoring”.

August 1997     Duke University students form group called Students Against Sweatshops; in subsequent
                months, movement grows on campuses across country eventually becoming United
                Students Against Sweatshops (USAS).

October 1997    Council on Economic Priorities, following consultations with companies and NGOs,
                releases plan for “social audit” dealing with worker rights, creates agency to accredit
                compliance monitors.

April 1998      Levi Strauss announces its return to China, arguing that the human rights situation has
                improved sufficiently “that the overall environment now is such that the risks to our
                                         Financial Times, 8 April 1998).

Spring 1998     Under pressure from student group, Duke University releases code of conduct for
                suppliers of apparel licensed by Duke to display the university name or logo; code calls
                for independent monitoring of compliance, through the AIP if appropriate, and requires
                suppliers to disclose names and addresses of all contractors and plants involved in
                production of Duke-licensed apparel.

Summer 1998     UNITE commits interns and resources to helping establish USAS on national basis.

EXHIBIT 7 (continued)

August 1998        Joint NLC-USAS delegation visits Central America to meet workers, NGOs.

November 1998      AIP agrees on creation of Fair Labor Association and accreditation of independent
                   monitors to monitor compliance with code.

December 1998      PVH closes unionized plant in Guatemala, saying it lost a major contract and has excess
                   capacity; production will continue at nonunion plants elsewhere in Guatemala.

January 1999       UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, at World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland,
                   announces new “Global Compact” calling on the business community to respect basic
                   principles on human rights, worker rights, and protection of the environment, but with no
                   means for monitoring of compliance. NGOs followed a year later with a ACitizens’
                   Compact” that rejects “partnership” between the UN and the business community and
                   calls on the UN to make the principles mandatory with provisions for monitoring.

Early 1999         USAS criticizes universities for signing on to FLA model for monitoring without
                   consulting them; students hold sit-ins to demand stronger code at Duke, Georgetown,
                   Wisconsin, North Carolina, and, for 226 hours, Arizona. In April, USAS releases detailed
                   report on inadequacies of FLA code and monitoring process and gives universities until
                   October 15 to seek improvements.

October 7, 1999    Under pressure from USAS and universities, Nike discloses locations of 41 factories
                   producing licensed apparel for Duke, UNC, Georgetown, Michigan, and Arizona.

October 19, 1999   After rejection by FLA of their suggestions and passage of the 6-month deadline with no
                   other action by universities, USAS announces alternative Worker Rights Consortium and
                   calls on universities to withdraw from FLA. Brown University is the first to respond,
                   announcing that it will join the WRC but also remain in the FLA; others, including Phil
                   Knight alma mater University of Oregon follow.

December 1999      Liz Claiborne agrees to independent monitoring at supplier facility in El Salvador; report
                   published in full on International Labor Rights Fund website (see appendix).

December 9, 1999   Philadelphia City Council calls on area colleges and universities to join WRC.

Spring 2000        Nike retaliates against Brown and the University of Oregon for joining WRC, terminates
                   contract to provide hockey products in one case and ends personal and corporate
                   philanthropic relations in the other.

1
  Comparing the Marymount and PIPA surveys, we see that a higher premium on a $20 item, $5
versus $1, reduces the number of people who say they would buy the product made under good
conditions. In this range, moreover, the demand would appear to be modestly inelastic. Total
revenues would rise with the increase in price from $21 to $25, but, since purchasers would fall
from 85 percent of persons to 75 percent, revenues would still be maximized at the $20 price.
2
    Springfield Telemarketing conducted the survey for us.
3
    We did not ask if they would take the good if we paid them.
4
  Due to a coding problem, this estimate may be too low and we are having the survey firm check
the responses here. When corrected, the number may be somewhat higher than that in the text,
but only moderately so.
5
  Some respondents refused to answer these questions and some gave inconsistent answers –
saying, for instance, that they would buy the cheaper product no matter what and then saying they
would pay extra for the product made under better conditions. We made the conservative
assumption that anyone who refused to answer or who gave an inconsistent response would not
pay a premium for a product made under good conditions or would buy the product under poor
conditions. But had we deleted these observations, our results would be qualitatively the same.
6
 Since we did not specify the conditions under which the alternative product was made, this is an
inference from responses to the two sets of questions. The design that would provide a test of
this inference would be to ask consumers to compare a product made under good conditions with
one made under positively bad conditions (at varying prices) and a product made under good
conditions with one made under unknown conditions. Our analysis compared bad conditions
with unknown conditions and good conditions with unknown conditions.
7
 Under pressure from Global Exchange and other activist groups, Starbucks agreed to sell “Fair
Trade” coffee beginning in Fall 2000, with guarantees that the coffee comes from cooperatives
where farmers earn a reasonable price. This could provide the natural experiment.
8
 The most famous experimental game, the Prisoner’s Dilemma differs from the standards
problem since it requires both persons to cooperate, but it shows the same thing: that many
people do not follow the pure maximizing strategy. The rational response in a fixed period PD
game is to defect, but in fact people frequently choose to cooperate.
9
 With suitable interpretation of variables, votes rather than prices, for instance, the same model
applies to the potential catalytic effect of activists on governments.
10
  Beyond that point the marginal increase in price is less than the marginal increase in cost while
before that point the marginal increase in price exceeds the marginal cost.
11
   We distributed 45 surveys at the USAS National Organizing Conference in July and sent
emails to an additional 140 activists listed on the USAS listserver or suggested by respondents.
We obtained 39 responses from persons at the Conference and 55 from those sent the email
instrument, giving 94 responses and an overall response rate of slightly over 50 percent.
12
  The questions were identical because we asked the activists questions from the American
Freshman survey regarding attitudes and goals.
13
     But sweatshops are also coming back in the United States; Weil (2000) and Duong (2000).
14
   This is a model not addressed here, in which activists try to organize alternative markets by
linking consumers in rich countries to producers in poor countries who are paid premium prices
for indigenous products such as coffee, tea, bananas, or local handicrafts. In addition to its work
with the FLA, the International Labor Rights Fund is one such group; others are listed in the
appendix..
15
   An ILO report (1998) on corporate codes and social labels surveyed 200, while the Investor
Responsibility Research Center (Varley 1998) collected 121 codes from a survey of the S&P 500
companies and 80 retailers. Activists recognize that their main success has been in putting labor
standards on the world policy agenda. In our survey of USAS activists, 94 percent rated their
campaign as very or somewhat successful in increasing public awareness and 90 percent rated
their campaign as very/somewhat successful in increasing student activism.
16
  PVH’s Bruce Klatsky demonstrates a strong personal commitment to human rights through his
work with Human Rights Watch and Kathie Lee Gifford demonstrated concern for the well-being
of children through her charitable contributions to children’s causes.
17
  For an alternative view of the benefits of “open standards” and competition among monitoring
agencies, see Sabel, O’Rourke, and Fung (2000).
18
  Of course, given the paucity of such products in the market today, there is little cost attached to
the promise and the true test will come when more final consumers have the choice before them.
19
   Concerns about the effects of codes on homeworkers were raised by Southern NGOs in a
workshop organized by NGOs participating in the Ethical Trade Initiative in the United Kingdom
(see www.cafod.org.uk/policyviews.htm). Concerns have also been raised about the impact of
the agreement to create stitching centers for the production of soccer balls in Sialkot, Pakistan.
Shifting production from homes to centralized locations facilitates monitoring of the agreement
to end child labor, but makes it difficult for some adult women to earn income because they
cannot leave home (see the Clean Clothes Campaign website at www.cleanclothes.org).
20
  For example, Columbia University Professor Jagdish Bhagwati argued in The Financial Times
(May 2, 2000) that, “[A] minuscule minority of students who are captive to unions such as the
apparel industry's UNITE, have used the language of ‘social responsibility’ towards the poor
countries, to advance an agenda, both illegitimate and narrow, that will in fact harm the very
countries and workers they claim to assist.” Bhagwati also served on the steering committee of
the Academic Consortium on International Trade, which in September 2000 delivered a letter
from academic economists to the presidents of universities targeted by USAS expressing similar,
though less virulent, concerns.

might assuage our consciences, but it is no favor to its alleged beneficiaries.”

 Most child labor, for example, occurs in agriculture, construction, and domestic services,
where anti-sweatshop campaigns cannot readily reach.

  IKEA asked its suppliers of solid wood products to ensure that none of their wood came from
uncertified old-growth forests by September 2000. A second phase will extend the same
requirement to suppliers of other wood products, including paper, cardboard, and furniture made
with particleboard, but no target date has been set. See Greenpeace, November 24, 1999

   The FSC website (www.fscoax.org) has a list of certified areas; see also UN Food and

developing countries, the World Wildlife Fund joined the World Bank in an alliance to promote
sustainable forestry management globally, with a target of 200 certified hectares by 2005, evenly
divided between temperate and tropical forests.
