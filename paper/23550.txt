The Consequences of Educational Voucher Reform in Chile

                                          ABSTRACT
In an effort to boost student achievement and reduce income-based gaps, the Chilean government
passed the Preferential School Subsidy Law (SEP) in 2008, which altered the nation’s 27-year-
old universal school-voucher system dramatically. Implementation of SEP increased the value of
the school voucher by 50 percent for “Priority students”, primarily those whose family incomes
fell within the bottom 40 percent of the national distribution. To be eligible to accept the higher-
valued vouchers from these students, schools were required to waive fees for Priority students
and to participate in an accountability system.

Using national data on the mathematics achievement of 1,631,841 Chilean 4th-grade students
who attended one of 8,588 schools during the year 2005 through 2012, we address two research
questions (RQs):

1.Did student test scores increase and income-based score gaps become smaller during the five
years after the passage of SEP?

2.Did SEP contribute to increases in student test scores and, if so, through what mechanisms?

We addressed these RQs by fitting a sequence of multi-level interrupted time-series regression
models, supplemented by other descriptive analyses. We found that:

1.On average, student test scores increased markedly and income-based gaps in those scores
declined by one-third in the five years after the passage of SEP.

2.The combination of increased support of schools and accountability was the critical mechanism
through which the implementation of SEP increased student scores, especially in schools serving
high concentrations of low-income students. Migration of low-income students from public
schools to private voucher schools played a small role.

We interpret these findings as more supportive of improved student performance than other
recent research on the Chilean policy reform.

             The Consequences of Educational Policy Changes in Chile



       Debates about the merits of market-based strategies to improve student achievement have

a long history in both the USA and internationally. In 1962, University of Chicago economist

Milton Friedman argued that a universal voucher system would improve both the quality and the

efficiency of the U.S. K-12 education system. Under his proposal, parents of school-aged

children would receive a voucher that they could use to pay part, or all, of the cost of enrolling

their child in a private school. Competition among schools for students would improve the

quality of American education.


        Writing almost decade later, Christopher Jencks (1970) argued that vouchers do

indeed have the potential to improve educational outcomes, especially for economically

disadvantaged children, but only if the system has a very different design than that which

Friedman described. Jencks proposed a system in which vouchers provided to low-income

families would have greater value than those given to higher-income families, and the

admission and dismissal procedures of participating private schools would be highly

regulated.

       Over subsequent decades, economists developed a number of theoretical models that

describe how universal vouchers would influence both the distribution of students among schools

and the distribution of student achievement. These models highlight the potential importance of

the density of nearby educational options, the role of peer groups, the value of the vouchers for

families with particular characteristics, and rules regarding the admission and dismissal




                                                     1
procedures of participating schools.1 To date, however, there have been no opportunities in the

United States to examine the importance of these design elements in large-scale universal

voucher systems empirically.2 For such evidence, we must turn to Chile.

Educational Vouchers in Chile

        In 1981, Chile introduced a universal educational voucher system for students in both its

elementary and secondary schools. At the same time, the central government transferred the

administration of public schools to municipal governments. Since economists from the

University of Chicago advised the Chilean government, it is not surprising that Chile’s voucher

system bore similarities to the design that Friedman had proposed. Key elements included:

     a. Three types of schools served children, including public schools funded by voucher

        receipts, private schools financed by voucher receipts (henceforth, private voucher

        schools), and private schools that did not participate in the voucher system and that were

        financed by fees parents paid. Both for-profit and not-for profit organizations operated

        private schools.

     b. The financial value of the voucher did not depend on family income.

     c. Private voucher schools could decide which students to admit. Public schools were

        obligated to accept all students.

 A number of studies have examined the impacts on student achievement of targeted voucher programs in the
United States. See Epple, Romano, & Urquiola (2017) for a review of the evidence up to 2014, and Abdulkadiroğlu,
Pathak, & Walters (forthcoming), and Dynarski et al. (2017) for newer evidence. None of the U.S.-based voucher
programs is universal.

     d. Public schools and private schools had substantial flexibility in hiring teachers and

         deciding how much to pay them.

     e. A national system of standardized assessment of students’ academic skills (SIMCE) was

         implemented to provide parents with comparative information about the achievement of

         students enrolled in different schools.

         The basic design of the voucher system in Chile remained in effect through 2007, with

two notable exceptions. After the restoration of democracy to the country in 1990, the salaries of

public school teachers were increased and uniform salary schedules, which based pay on

seniority and credentials, were restored. These changes, reflected in a new “Teacher Statute,”

affected only public-school teachers. In 1993, the Chilean government responded to fiscal

pressures by introducing a system of “shared financing,” under which private voucher schools

were permitted to charge all parents fees in addition to the value of the voucher. The percentage

of private voucher schools that charged fees rose rapidly, and more than half did so in 2007. The

average fee for schools serving elementary-school students in that year was $30 per month, with

a maximum of $121 per month. The value of the voucher was discounted for schools charging

fees greater than one-half the value of the voucher.3

         The introduction of the voucher system elicited a number of responses. The percentage of

students enrolled in public schools declined markedly, from 78 percent in 1980 to less than 50

percent in 2007. The percentage of students, especially those from middle-class families,

enrolled in private voucher schools grew substantially. Many low-income parents also enrolled

   Elacqua et al. (2016) and Bellei & Vanni (2015) provide descriptions of the voucher system and of changes in
Chilean educational policies over the last three decades. Elacqua (2012, p.450, footnote 18) explains that the value
of the voucher was discounted by 10 percent for schools that charged fees that were one-half to one times the value
of the voucher. The discount rate was 20 percent for schools that charged fees greater than the value of the voucher.

their children in private voucher schools. However, this did not result in an increase in school

integration by socioeconomic status because private voucher schools tended to specialize. Some

charged substantial fees and enrolled students from middle-class families.4 Others charged either

low or no fees and served students from low-income families primarily (Contreras, Sepulveda,

and Bustos, 2010). The net effect was that school segregation by socioeconomic status increased

substantially in the first two decades of the voucher system. Moreover, student achievement in

mathematics and Spanish language, as measured on national tests, did not increase (Hsieh and

Urquiola, 2006; Elacqua, 2012; Valenzuela, Bellei, & de los Rios, 2013; Epple, Romano, &

Urquiola, 2017).

         At the turn of the 21st century, student achievement in Chile was low relative to that of

students in other countries participating in international test-score comparisons (Gonzales et al.,

2000), and family-income based gaps in student achievement were large. These patterns

contributed to the impetus for the substantial educational reforms that the Chilean government

enacted in 2008.

Changes in the Voucher System

         With the primary goals of decreasing inequality in student achievement and segregation

among schools by socioeconomic status, the Chilean national government passed the Preferential

School Subsidy Law (SEP) in January 2008. This landmark legislation made the Chilean

educational voucher system more like the regulated compensatory voucher model that

Christopher Jencks had proposed. SEP recognized explicitly that it costs more to educate

students from low-income families well, especially in schools serving large percentages of

                                                                4
children living in poverty. Under SEP, the vouchers provided to “Priority students,” basically,

those whose families were in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution, were worth 50

percent more than those provided to other students. In addition to the higher-valued vouchers,

schools serving large percentages of Priority students received per-student concentration

bonuses, the size of which increased as the percentage of Priority students in the school’s student

body increased.

       To be eligible to receive the higher-valued vouchers and concentration bonuses, schools

had to agree to participate in the SEP program. One program requirement was that schools could

not charge fees to Priority students, although private voucher schools could do so for non-

Priority students. A second requirement was that participating schools had to agree not to select

students based on their academic skills, nor expel them on academic grounds.

       A third requirement was that schools had to participate in an accountability system that,

for the first time, made schools responsible for the use of financial resources and student test

scores. The Chilean Education Ministry classified schools participating in SEP as Autonomous,

Emerging, or Recovering, depending on their students’ scores on the national assessment and

other performance indicators. Schools in the lower two categories had less autonomy in

allocating their SEP resources than did autonomous schools. Schools in lower-ranked categories

received support from the Education Ministry in drafting their progress plans and technical

assistance in carrying them out. Struggling schools that failed to improve their students’

mathematics and reading scores after receiving assistance risked losing their license or their

eligibility for the higher-valued vouchers provided to Priority students.




                                                     5
         When SEP was launched in 2008, it covered preschool through 4th grade, and one

additional grade was added to the coverage in each subsequent year.5 Almost all public schools

and about two-thirds of private subsidized elementary schools chose to participate in SEP in

2008.6 Those that did were free to use the extra resources they received for serving Priority

students to improve the education of all students. Consequently, SEP may have benefitted non-

Priority students.

Research Questions

         As Epple, Romano, & Urquiola (2017) explain, it is difficult to produce unbiased

estimates of the causal impacts of changes in a national program. Several recent studies, which

to our knowledge are unpublished, used different strategies in attempting to do so. These studies

informed our work. Carrasco (2014) used a comparative interrupted time-series approach to

estimate the impact of SEP on the mathematics and Spanish language achievement of 4th-grade

students in Chile. He did so by comparing “the deviation from prior outcome trends among a

‘treatment group’ that received the extra SEP funds to the analogous deviation from a

‘comparison group’ that did not receive these extra resources” (p.9). He found that four years of

SEP participation increased 4th-grade students’ mathematics achievement by 0.18 standard

deviations “compared to students in schools that did not participate in the policy” (p. 10). One

critical assumption underlying the validity of Carrasco’s approach is that the deviation from prior




5 It is noteworthy that the introduction and later expansion of SEP occurred during two different political
administrations, with differing political views.
6
  In 2011, the government modified SEP in several ways: (a) extending benefits to middle-school students; (b)
increasing the value of vouchers Priority students received; and (c) allowing schools greater flexibility in using
government funding. In previous years, schools could not spend more than 15 percent of the SEP resources on
personnel and had restrictions on the number of extra-hours they could pay their teachers. These constraints were
removed in 2011.



                                                               6
outcome trends for the comparison group provides an unbiased estimate of the counterfactual–

that is, what the deviation in outcome trends would have been for schools participating in SEP

had they chosen not to do so. Since schools weighed the benefits and costs of deciding whether

to participate in SEP, this assumption may not be valid.

       Neilson (2015) examined how SEP influenced the distribution of student achievement

within the context of a demand-and-supply model of school choice. In Neilson’s model,

spatially differentiated schools compete for students by offering particular combinations of

quality and price. Families make schooling choices by comparing the quality/price combinations

offered by schools in their neighborhood. Neilson used detailed data on school fees and

locations to fit his hypothesized statistical model. He then used the obtained parameter estimates

to simulate how the changes in school prices that SEP provided to low-income families affected

schooling choices and the distribution of student achievement. He found that SEP increased the

test scores of low-income students by 0.20 standard deviations and closed the income-based

achievement gap by one-third.

       As is often the case with highly structured approaches to policy analysis, Neilson made

several decisions in developing and fitting his statistical model that may have influenced his

results and their interpretation. One was to characterize SEP in terms of a policy that changed the

schooling prices that low-income families faced. This depiction allowed Neilson to incorporate

the impact of SEP into his supply-and-demand model. However, it meant downplaying the

accountability requirements that schools participating in SEP were subject to, and that may have

had a marked impact on the performance of their students. A second decision was to assume that

peer effects were not important. This assumption reduced the complexity of Neilson’s supply-

and-demand model substantially. However, recent studies using compelling research designs


                                                    7
(e.g., Carrell & Hoekstra, 2010; Carrell, Hoekstra, & Kuka, 2016) demonstrate that peer groups

have substantial and lasting impacts on classmates’ academic success.7

       Navarro-Palau (2016) used two sources of variation in schooling options to analyze the

impact of SEP on the enrollment choices and mathematics and Spanish language achievement of

groups of 4th-grade students, defined by their mother’s education level. The first is the timing of

the introduction of SEP. The second is exogenous variation in the timing of school entry

stemming from the age cutoff in Chile for entry into first grade. Using a regression-discontinuity

and difference-in-differences framework, she found that the greatest impact of SEP on school

choice occurred among Priority students with relatively well-educated mothers. Passage of SEP

increased the percentage of children with mothers who had completed high school that enrolled

in private voucher schools that did not charge fees, but did not increase the percentage of Priority

students with less-educated parents who did so. Navarro-Palau found that the impact of SEP on

student achievement was modestly positive, with the greatest gains going to Priority students

enrolled in public schools.

       One of the strengths of Navarro-Palau’s paper is the distinction she makes between

private voucher schools that charge fees and those that do not. We go a step further and

distinguish between for-profit and not-for-profit private voucher schools that charge fees and

those that do not. This distinction matters because legislation passed in 2015 mandates that only

not-for-profit organizations are eligible to operate private schools that receive vouchers. A

second difference between our paper and Navarro-Palau’s is that we explicitly incorporate

characteristics of the nested structure of the data into our statistical modeling, with students




       7
           Neilson (2015) noted that he is developing a version of his model that will include peer group influences.


                                                               8
clustered within schools and years, and schools being observed for as many as 8 years. As we

explain below, this model structure allows us to test quite detailed hypotheses about differences

between the pre-SEP and post-SEP periods in the distribution of school performance trends.

       In our research, we addressed two research questions:

RQ1: Trends in Student Test scores? Did student scores increase and income-based score gaps

become smaller during the five years after the passage of SEP?

RQ2: Role of SEP? Did SEP contribute to increases in student test scores and, if so, through

what mechanisms?

Research Design

Dataset

       We analyzed administrative data that the Chilean government collected annually on

school characteristics and student enrollments, family characteristics as reported on parental

surveys, and the results of nationally normed and year-to-year equated standardized tests that

assessed the mathematics achievement of all students in Grade 4. We focused exclusively on this

grade because it was the highest one included in SEP’s initial year of implementation. We

merged these datasets, matching on student and school IDs. The resulting dataset contained

information on every student enrolled in Grade 4 in a Chilean public or private school, in each

year from 2005 through 2012.




                                                    9
         A typical Chilean school contributed three years of student test-score data before the

initiation of the SEP program (2005-2007), and five years of data thereafter (2008-2012).8 Thus,

our data are longitudinal at the school level, implying that testing instances (henceforth referred

to as “testing year”) are nested within schools. However, our data are not longitudinal at the

student level because we use only information on the test scores of students who were in Grade

4, in each school, in each year. Thus, students are nested within a school and within a testing

year, a nesting reflected explicitly in the error-covariance structure that we have specified in all

of our subsequent statistical models.9

Sample

         In constructing our analytic sample, we excluded from the dataset: (a) the twelve percent

of students for whom 4th-grade test scores were not available, (b) the less than five percent of

students who were enrolled in special schools for children with disabilities, (c) the less than one

percent of students enrolled in schools for which organizational type was not available, and (d)

the seven percent of children enrolled in high-fee private schools that did not participate in the

voucher system.

         In Table 1, we provide selected summary statistics on our sample for 2005, the baseline

year. We list the number and percentage of elementary schools of each organizational type that

enrolled 4th-grade students in that year (excluding elite private schools that did not participate in

  Two and one-half percent of students repeated 4th grade and therefore appear more than once in our analytic
sample. We included an indicator coded to identify these students as a covariate in all our statistical models. In
effect, we treat “grade repeaters” as separate students in the same school at different years. Moreover, 0.05 percent
of students have two test scores recorded in the same year at the same school. We eliminated from our analytic
sample all but one of the records for each of these students.

                                                              10
the voucher system). We distinguish among five school types. The first are public schools. We

have classified the remaining (private) schools that accepted government vouchers into four

groups, defined by their characteristics in 2007: (a) for-profit schools that did not charge fees, (b)

for-profit schools that did charge fees, (c) non-profit schools that did not charge fees, and (d)

non-profit schools that did charge fees. We list the number and percentage of 4th-grade students

enrolled in each type of Chilean elementary school, along with summary statistics on selected

characteristics of these students. More than three-fifths of the 6,871 elementary schools that

accepted educational vouchers in 2005 were public schools. Twenty-six percent of the schools

were for-profit private organizations, and slightly more than half of these charged fees in

addition to the value of the voucher. Eleven percent of the schools were not-for-profit private

organizations, and slightly more than half of these charged fees.

                                        <Insert Table 1 about here>

       Not surprisingly, in 2005, the distribution of 4th-grade students across school types is

similar in many respects to the distribution of the school types. Slightly more than half of

Chilean 4th-grade students attended public schools in 2005. Another 21 percent attended for-

profit private schools that charged fees, and 13 percent attended not-for-profit private schools

that charged fees. Approximately 12 percent of 4th-grade students attended private schools that

did not charge fees, with about half of these enrolled in for-profit private schools and the other

half in not-for-profit schools.

       Students enrolled in public schools or private schools that did not charge fees came from

families that were considerably less advantaged than students enrolled in private schools that

charged fees. On average, their parents had lower educational attainments and lower family

incomes, reflecting the significant sorting of students by socioeconomic status that Hsieh &


                                                     11
Urquiola (2006) noted. Given this sorting, it is not surprising that children enrolled in public

schools or no-fee private schools had lower average mathematics scores than did children

enrolled in fee-charging private schools.

       In Table 2, we provide selected descriptive statistics on our sample separately for schools

and students in rural and urban areas. The striking differences between the characteristics of

rural and urban students and the schools they attended led us to hypothesize that the impacts of

SEP might be different for rural students than for those living in cities. The reason is that, due to

low population density, rural families have many fewer schooling options than urban families do.

Consequently, we incorporated the urban/rural distinction explicitly in our statistical models.

                                        <Insert Table 2 about here>

       Notice that there were more public schools in rural areas (2,444) than in urban areas

(1,867) in 2005, even though there were five times as many 4th-grade students living in urban

areas (98,424) than the number living in rural areas (19,953). One factor contributing to this

pattern is that 82 percent of rural students attended public schools while only 50 percent of urban

students did so. Another is that the rural public schools had much lower enrollments (an average

of eight grade-4 students per school) than urban public schools (an average of 53 grade-4

students per school).

       Rural students were also distributed differently across private-school types than urban

students were. For instance, 38 percent of urban 4th-grade students attended fee-charging

private schools, while less than two percent of rural students did so. In fact, there were only

seven fee-charging for-profit private schools in rural areas in 2005 and the same number of fee-

charging not-for profit private schools. In contrast, private for-profit schools that did not charge

fees served a larger percentage of rural 4th-grade students (11) than urban 4th-grade students (6).

       Another important difference between rural and urban 4th-grade students is that rural

students lived in more economically disadvantaged families. On average, their parents had lower

educational attainments and less income. For these reasons, it is not surprising that rural 4th-

grade students scored lower, on average, on the national mathematics examination (228) than did

urban grade-4 students (247).

Measures

       To keep the presentation of our findings brief, we report and discuss only the results of

fitting models in which the outcome is either a student’s observed score on the national

mathematics test (MATH, RQ1) or the same score adjusted for the influence of selected family-

background characteristics (ADJ_MATH, RQ2). We focus on mathematics achievement, instead

of Spanish-language achievement, because U.S.-based studies have found that the mathematics

achievement of young children is a stronger predictor of later academic success (Duncan &

Magnuson, 2011) and of subsequent labor-market outcomes (Murnane, Willett, & Levy, 1995)

than their language achievement. However, in additional analyses in which we replicated our

analyses with language achievement as the outcome, our results were qualitatively similar,

although the average differences in achievement among students in different school types and

locations were somewhat smaller. Over the period from 2005-2012, scores on the national

standardized mathematics test for Chilean 4th-grade students enrolled in public schools or in

private voucher schools ranged from 74 to 395, with a mean of 249 and a standard deviation of

approximately 53 points.

       We included in all models (a) an integer variable representing the chronological year

(YEAR), and (b) a dichotomous variable indicating whether the SEP program was operating in

that year (SEP, coded 1 for years 2008 through 2012; 0 otherwise). With one exception that we


                                                    13
explain below, we centered predictor YEAR on 2008, the first year in which the SEP program

operated.

       Other predictors of student mathematics achievement include selected characteristics of

students and their families, and schools. Forty-nine percent of the students are female, and are

designated by the dichotomous predictor, FEMALE (0=male; 1=female). Among students living

in urban areas, the average achievement of male students (252) was approximately 4 points (0.08

S.D.) higher than that of female students during the pre-SEP years 2005-2007. Among students

living in rural areas, the gender gap had the same direction, but was smaller in magnitude, with

the average score of females (233) one point lower than that of males. Slightly less than four

percent of the students in the sample repeated Grade 4. They are differentiated by the

dichotomous indicator REPEATER (0= not repeated; 1=repeated).

        We also included in our statistical models selected family characteristics as predictors of

4th-grade students’ test scores. They included: (a) the educational attainments of the mother and

father, and (b) family income. We treated the lowest educational category (“Some Elementary

School”) as the omitted (reference) category for both mother’s and father’s educational

attainment. We then included, as predictors, dichotomous indicators to distinguish the four

higher levels of attainment of mothers and fathers: (a) Elementary School Graduate; (b) Some

High School; (c) High-School Diploma; and (d) At Least Some Post-Secondary Education, each

coded 1 to indicate the presence of the category concerned, 0 otherwise. Over the entire period

of observation, the median educational attainment of both fathers and mothers was a high-school

graduate.




                                                    14
         Parents were asked to report, via a survey, into which of a number of pre-designated

ranges their family income fell.10 Using the method described in Reardon (2011), we estimated

the percentile of the family-income distribution of Chilean 4th graders into which each family’s

income fell in that year, resulting in the continuous covariate INC. The reason that we chose to

control for family-income percentile, rather than family income is that the former provides a

common metric across the years of observation. In our analyses, we found that the relationship

between student mathematics achievement and family-income percentile was described

parsimoniously by a third-order polynomial specification. As our family-income and parental-

educational attainment predictors contained missing values, we used multiple imputation to deal

with the non-responses, (Rubin, 1987).11

         We also included as covariates in our analyses two sets of school characteristics. One

consists of a vector of dichotomous variables that describe the type of school, distinguishing the

four types of private voucher schools described above. In our statistical models, we treated

public school as the omitted (reference) category. The second was a dichotomous variable,

RURAL, that distinguished schools located in rural areas from those located in rural areas. In

2005, 56 percent of Chilean elementary schools (public and private) that accepted educational

vouchers were located in urban areas of the country (RURAL=0). In our initial statistical models,



10
   We created our continuous measure of family-income percentile by converting responses to a measure of family
income in the parent survey that required parents to respond in one of 13 ordinal categories in the years from 2005 to
2008, and 15 categories in the years 2008 to 2011. The categories do not provide detailed information on the low
end of the family income distribution, especially in the early years.
11
   In our dataset, between 16 percent and 33 percent of the values of mother’s education were missing, depending on
the year. Correspondingly, between 20 percent and 35 percent of the values of father’s education were missing,
again depending on year. Additionally, in most years, between 16 percent and 23 percent of the values of family
income were missing, with no discernable trend in the rate across years, and in 2007, 32 percent of the values of this
variable were missing. We used the method of multiple imputation to eliminate the missing values and mitigate bias,
fitting our hypothesized models in eight multiply imputed data sets and pooling parameter estimates across datasets
using Rubin’s rules.

                                                              15
we included interaction terms that permitted different parameter values for the impact on

achievement of student and family characteristics and school characteristics for rural and for

urban students. In our final models, we retained only those interactions with location that proved

statistically significant.

Data-Analyses

        Our primary analytical strategy was to fit a sequence of multi-level interrupted time-

series models built around the same core specification, in which either MATH or ADJ_MATH

(depending on the research question) was hypothesized to be a function of the main effects of

YEAR and SEP, and their interaction. Each model included other predictors, the choice of which

depended on the research question. As noted earlier, all our statistical models incorporated an

error-covariance structure for the random effects that reflected the complex hierarchical structure

of the data, with students nested in schools and schools contributing student test data for as many

as eight years. To simplify exposition, in the text, we present only the composite models

resulting from this specification rather than documenting specifically the full complexity of the

hypothesized error structure. We present the corresponding complete specification of the

hypothesized multi-level models in Appendix A. We fit all of the interrupted time-series models

using the MIXED routine in Version 14 of Stata.

        A strength of our modeling strategy is that it allowed us to use general linear hypothesis

testing to test subtle hypotheses about differences in trends in the distribution of student

achievement during the pre-SEP and post-SEP periods. For example, we were able to test

whether the variation in school performance trends after the passage of SEP differed from that

during the pre-SEP years.




                                                     16
        One limitation of our interrupted time-series models is that they do not provide a

convincing test of whether SEP caused the increase in average student test scores and the closing

of the income-based average test-score gap that we describe below. An alternative explanation is

that other influences on students and/or schools contemporaneous with the implementation of

SEP caused the changes in the test-score distribution. To eliminate this alternative explanation,

we would have needed data on a comparable group of students that experienced these “other

influences,” but were not subject to SEP implementation. We believe that no such legitimate

comparison group exists. However, with our design and data, we are able to examine whether

test scores rose more during the post-SEP years for students attending the types of schools most

influenced by SEP. We also present evidence on the likely consequences for student test scores

of other change in the lives of Chilean students and the schools they attended.

         RQ1: Trends in Student Achievement? To address our first research question, we

specified the following interrupted time-series model, for the kth 4th-grade student enrolled in the

ith school in the jth year:




     𝑀𝐴𝑇𝐻𝑖𝑗𝑘 = 𝛾00 + 𝛾10 (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008)

                    +𝛾20 𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗 + 𝛾30 [𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗 × (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008)]

                    +𝜷1′ 𝑰𝑵𝑪𝑖𝑗𝑘 + 𝜷′2 [𝑰𝑵𝑪𝑖𝑗𝑘 × (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008)]                   [1]

                          +𝜷′3 (𝑰𝑵𝑪𝑖𝑗𝑘 × 𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗 )
                                       + 𝜷′4 [(𝑰𝑵𝑪𝑖𝑗𝑘 × 𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗 )
                                                            ′
                                       × (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008)] + 𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑘




                                                    17
       ′
where 𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑘 represents a complex hypothesized error term that embodies the nested hierarchical

structure of the analytic sample. (See Appendix A for a full specification of the error-covariance

structure).

        The model includes time-varying predictors to describe the main effect of YEAR and

SEP, and their two-way interaction. This specification permits unique population average trends

in achievement over time in the pre- and post-SEP periods. Then, to permit these trajectories to

differ by family income, we have also included the main effect of vector 𝑰𝑵𝑪 (containing the

student’s family-income percentile, its square, and its cube). Our model also contains cross-

product terms representing the two-way interactions between INC and YEAR, and between INC

and SEP, plus the three-way interaction among all three predictors. This specification permits

the hypothesized relationship between student mathematics achievement and both time and

family income percentile to differ in the pre- and post-SEP periods.

        After fitting this hypothesized “full” model, we relied on judicious simultaneous

hypothesis testing to remove unneeded terms from the model. We then interpreted parameter

estimates from the final reduced model, and used them to reconstruct and display average trends

in mathematics achievement over time and by family-income percentile, in both the pre- and

post-SEP periods, for prototypical students.

        RQ2: Role of SEP?

        The mechanisms through which the implementation of SEP could alter the distribution of

student mathematics scores include facilitating the movement of students to schools with

superior instruction and/or academically stronger peer groups and by improving the instruction in

schools through a combination of increased financial resources and greater accountability for



                                                    18
student test scores. We used several strategies to assess the relative importance of these

mechanisms.

        First, we examined whether groups of schools defined by organizational type and

location that had the highest participation rate in SEP also had the greatest increase in students’

average mathematics scores during the post-SEP period. In addressing this question, we

considered it critical to control for the effects of selected important student and family

characteristics (student gender, whether a student had repeated 4th grade, family income, and

parental educational attainment). This is because it may have been easier for schools to improve

their average student achievement post-SEP by attracting more advantaged students than by

improving the quality of the education they provided. However, we recognized that an explicit

goal of SEP was to reduce achievement gaps based on socioeconomic status. If SEP succeeded,

the parameters associated with these student and family covariates would have smaller values in

the post-SEP than in the pre-SEP period. As explained in Appendix A, we adopted a two-step

procedure to adjust each student’s mathematics score for the influences of student and family

background influences, while attributing to SEP reductions in the influences of these variables on

student achievement. All subsequent analyses treated the adjusted mathematics score,

ADJ_MATH, as the outcome.

        We fit the following multilevel interrupted time-series model, for the kth 4th-grade

student enrolled in the ith school in the jth year:




                                                      19
       𝐴𝐷𝐽_𝑀𝐴𝑇𝐻𝑖𝑗𝑘 = 𝛾00 + 𝜸′𝒐 𝑾𝒊 + 𝛾10 (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008)
                       + 𝜸′𝟏 [𝑾𝒊 × (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008)] + 𝛾20 𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗
                                                                                                 [2]
                       + 𝜸′𝟐 [𝑾𝒊 × 𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗 ]     + 𝛾30 {𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗 × (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008)}
                       + 𝜸′𝟑 [𝑾𝒊 × 𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗 × (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008)] + 𝝐′′
                                                             𝒊𝒋𝒌

        ′′
 where 𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑘 is a composite multilevel time-dependent residual.

       In Model 2, we include the time-invariant predictor vector 𝑾 and its interactions with

time and SEP status in order to distinguish among schools based on their organizational type and

location. After fitting this “full” model, we again used judicious tests of simultaneous statistical

inference to prune unnecessary terms, leading to a more parsimonious final model.

       We supplement our first strategy for assessing the role of SEP and the importance of

specific mechanisms (the fitting of our hypothesized interrupted time-series models) with other

descriptive analyses. Second, we examined whether implementation of SEP altered the long-term

decline in the percentage of Chilean elementary school students enrolled in public schools and

the long-term increase in the percentage enrolled in for-profit private voucher schools. One

reason this might have occurred is that passage of SEP resulted in a dramatic increase in funding

for public schools, most of which served large percentages of children from low-income

families. On the other hand, the higher-valued vouchers that SEP provided to low-income

parents may have increased their access to private schools, and could have accelerated the trend

away from enrollment in public schools.

       Third, we used the method described by Oaxaca (1973) to decompose the increase

between 2006 (a pre-SEP year) and 2012 (the fifth year after passage of SEP) in the average

adjusted achievement of 4th-grade students in the bottom half of the family-income distribution




                                                     20
(henceforth, low-income students) into three components.12 The logic underlying this descriptive

decomposition is that it sheds light on the relative importance of improvement in performance of

schools of each type and changes in the distribution of students among school types in

accounting for the increase in the average adjusted achievement of low-income 4th-grade

students between 2006 and 2012.

        Fourth, we measured the extent to which the pattern of segregation of low-income 4th-

grade students into different schools from those attended by higher-income students was

different in 2012 than it was in 2006. Here, we used a method described by Clotfelter (2004) to

decompose the segregation of low-income students in each year into several parts, each the result

of a hypothetical experiment.

        In describing our results, we refer frequently to rates of school improvement. We use this

term to mean changes over time in the average adjusted mathematics achievement of 4th-grade

students attending particular schools. Our valid use of this term rests on two assumptions. The

first is that the background characteristics of individual students that we have included in our

statistical models control adequately for any direct effect of year-to-year changes in the student

body on the average achievement of grade-4 students in that school. The second is that

improvements in the mathematics scores of students in a particular school do not come at the




12
  Our preferred strategy in analyzing the mechanisms through which SEP altered the distribution of adjusted student
achievement was to compare the distribution of this outcome for students in 2007, the last pre-SEP year, and in
2012, the last post-SEP year for which we have data. However, in some cases, we wanted to compare results for
low-income students in a pre-SEP and post-SEP year. This required a common definition of low-income students.
In each year, parents were asked to report in which of a number of pre-specified ranges their family income fell.
The distribution of responses across bins in 2007 and 2012 made it impossible to define “low-income” in terms of a
common income percentile. In contrast, it was possible to define “low-income” using a quite comparable metric in
2006 and 2012.




                                                            21
cost of foregone improvements in other dimensions of students’ skills and knowledge. Finally,

we want to emphasize that schools, as we use the term, are complex organizations in which

adults with varying capabilities and incentives work together to enhance children’s skills and

knowledge. Unfortunately, we lack the data to shed light on the ways that implementation of

SEP altered the characteristics of school staffs, their capabilities and incentives, and the ways

that they interact with children.

Results

RQ1: Trends in Student Test Scores

        In Figure 1, we display the predicted average mathematics score of 4th-grade students by

family-income percentile at the end of the 2005 school year, two years before the passage of the

SEP legislation, and at the end of the 2012 school year, five school years after the passage of the

legislation. We derived the plotted values in the figure from the estimates of the parameters of

Equation [1], which are listed in Appendix B, Table B1.

                                             <Insert Figure 1 about here>

        Notice three patterns in Figure 1. First, the fitted curves sloping upward from left to right

show the strong role of family income in predicting the mathematics score for 4th-grade students

in Chile. For example, in 2005, the predicted score of students whose families were at the 85th

percentile of the income distribution (249) was 21 points (0.4 SD) higher than the predicted score

for students from families at the 15th percentile of the income distribution.13




13
  We did not report the conventional 90-10 income percentile gap because the income bins in the questionnaire that
parents completed did not distinguish among incomes at the top of the distribution.

                                                            22
       The second pattern, illustrated by the vertical distance between the fitted 2005 and the

2012 curves, is the increase between 2005 and 2012 in the predicted mathematics score for

students at every family income percentile. For example, the increase in the predicted

mathematics score for students at the 15th percentile of the family-income distribution was 16

points (approximately 0.32 SD).

       The third pattern is the decline between 2005 and 2012 in the size of income-based gaps

in mathematics test scores (p<0.01). This is the consequence of the larger increase in

mathematics achievement for students at the bottom of the family-income distribution than for

those at the top. For instance, the gap between the predicted mathematics achievement of

students from the 15th and 85th family-income percentiles declined from 21 points in 2005 to 13

points in 2012.

       In summary, between 2005 and 2012 the mathematics scores of Chilean 4th-grade

students increased substantially, and the size of the income-based test-score gap in mathematics

declined by at least one-third.


RQ2: Role of SEP

       Was the post-SEP rate of performance improvement greater for schools located in cities,

where the density of private schools was substantial, than for schools located in rural areas,

where schools typically faced relatively little competition for students? Did post-SEP

performance improve the most in the types of schools that had served primarily low-income

students during the pre-SEP years? We addressed these questions by fitting the multilevel model

specified in Equation 2. We present estimated parameters from this fitted model in Appendix B,




                                                    23
Table B2, along with corresponding standard errors, approximate p-values and goodness-of-fit

statistics. Figures 2, 3, and 4 are based on the parameters of this fitted model.

        School Location

        In Figure 2, we display fitted trends in average adjusted mathematics scores for

prototypical 4th-grade students who attended public schools in either rural areas (dashed line) or

urban areas (solid line). (Approximately 50 percent of grade-4 students living in urban areas and

82 percent of those living in rural areas attended public schools in 2005.) Note that the average

adjusted mathematics score for 4th-grade students who attended rural public schools lies below

that of similar students who attended urban public schools throughout the period of observation

from 2005 through 2012. One potential explanation for the consistent but modest difference in

average adjusted achievement is that it is difficult to attract skilled teachers to schools located in

rural areas.

                                        [Insert Figure 2 about Here]

        A second pattern illustrated in Figure 2 is that the average adjusted mathematics scores of

4th-grade students in both urban and rural public schools declined over the pre-SEP years, 2005-

2007, at a rate of about two points (0.04 SD) per year. As in any discontinuity design, the

extensions of these pre-SEP fitted lines to year 2008 provide predictions of what the average

adjusted mathematics scores would have been in 2008 for 4th-grade students enrolled in urban

and rural public schools had SEP not been introduced before the start of the 2008 school year.

        A further striking pattern shown in Figure 2 is that the average adjusted mathematics

scores of 4th-grade students enrolled in both urban and rural public schools rose markedly during

the five years following the passage of SEP. The first-year impacts are shown in Figure 2 by the



                                                      24
vertical distance on the plot separating the right endpoint of the pre-SEP adjusted-score

projection and the corresponding left end-point of the post-SEP adjusted-score trend-line. These

initial impacts, 3.1 and 1.7 points for students in the rural and urban schools respectively, are

small. This is not surprising as schools that chose to participate in SEP in 2008 had almost no

time to plan how to use the additional school funding that came along with the enrollment of

low-income students, and then to implement those plans effectively.

         During the four-year period from the end of 2008 to the end of 2012, the average adjusted

mathematics score of 4th-grade students enrolled in urban public schools increased at an annual

rate of 4.6 points annually (0.09 SD) and that of students enrolled in rural public schools

increased at a rate of 4.0 points annually (0.08 SD). Note that we specified the post-SEP

trajectories as linear in time in our statistical model (Equation 2). We found no evidence that the

respective rates of increase in students’ adjusted mathematics scores lessened over this period.14

         There are several potential explanations for the steady improvement in students’ adjusted

math scores during the first five years after the passage of the SEP legislation. First, schools may

have needed several years to learn how to use additional resources productively. Second, the

amount of additional funds schools received for serving low-income students increased over the

period of observation. Third, the percentage of the nation’s students qualifying for higher-valued

vouchers rose from approximately 40 percent in 2008 to more than 50 percent in 2012. Fourth, it

took the Chilean government several years to implement fully the accountability provisions that

schools participating in SEP must abide by. Finally, in 2011, the government passed legislation

that made all schools receiving government funding, even those that chose not to participate in

 We fit additional statistical models that included the quadratic effects of year in the post-SEP performance trends.
We found no evidence of a negative coefficient on any of the additional quadratic terms.

SEP, accountable for demonstrating improvement in student test scores. While we cannot assess

the relative importance of these factors in contributing to the improvement in student

achievement during the post-SEP period, together their influences were substantial. At the end

of the 2012 school year, five years after the passage of SEP, the average adjusted mathematics

score of students attending public schools, either in urban or rural areas, was more than one-third

of a standard deviation higher than that of their counterparts attending public schools five years

earlier.

           School Type

           In examining trends in school performance for schools with different organizational

forms, we focus on those located in urban areas. The reason is that there were almost no fee-

charging private schools in rural areas. Moreover, we could not reject the null hypothesis that the

average rates of performance improvement for the two types of private schools located in rural

areas were the same as that of rural public schools. In contrast, there was more variation in the

organizational forms of elementary schools and in their performance trajectories.

           We display in Figure 3 fitted trends in performance for the five types of urban schools

that accepted government vouchers. Performance declined during the pre-SEP years in four of

the five groups of schools (the exception being private no-fee, for-profit schools, in which

adjusted achievement in the baseline year was particularly low). Average adjusted mathematics

achievement increased during the post-SEP period for all five types of schools.

                                      [Insert Figure 3 about Here]

           A closer inspection of Figure 3 reveals more subtle patterns. First, focus on the pre-SEP

period. Average adjusted mathematics scores were highest for 4th-grade students who were



                                                       26
enrolled in not-for-profit private schools that charged fees. Next highest were the performance

profiles of students who attended either for-profit private schools that charged fees or not-for-

profit private schools that did not charge fees. Finally, students enrolled in either public schools

or for-profit schools that did not charge fees had the lowest performance profiles. Differences in

resource levels are a likely explanation for these differences in average adjusted scores. Private

schools that charged fees in addition to receiving the value of government-provided vouchers

had higher per-student revenues than did the public schools and the for-profit private schools that

did not charge fees. The not-for-profit private schools that did not charge fees may have

garnered additional revenue from charitable contributions.

       A second pattern illustrated in Figure 3 is that average performance estimates for the five

types of urban elementary schools were closer to each other in 2012, five years after the passage

of SEP, than they were in the pre-SEP years. This is a direct consequence of heterogeneity in the

average rates at which schools of different types improved their performances during the post-

SEP period. In particular, the average annual rates of performance improvement were greater in

schools that did not charge fees (4.6 points in public schools; 3.8 points in private no-fee not-for-

profit schools; 5.0 points in private no-fee for-profit schools) than in the two types of private

school that had charged fees in 2007 (1.6 points annually in fee-charging not-for-profit schools;

2.5 points annually in fee-charging for-profit schools) (p<0.01).

       One explanation for this pattern is that private schools that charged fees were less likely

to choose to participate in SEP than were schools that did not charge fees. As we illustrate in

Figure 4, almost all public schools chose to participate in SEP in 2008, and consequently

benefitted from its provisions. Among private voucher schools, more than two-thirds of those

that had not charged fees in 2007 joined SEP in 2008, and by 2012 approximately 90 percent of


                                                     27
these schools were participating. In contrast, only about 40 percent of private schools that had

charged fees in 2007 chose to participate in SEP in 2008, and by 2012, only about half had done

so. This pattern suggests that the combination of additional funding and greater accountability

brought on by the implementation of SEP was a key mechanism through which the SEP program

improved 4th-grade student outcomes. This pattern is consistent with recent evidence from the

USA showing that the combination of increased funding and accountability resulted in improved

student test scores (Jackson, Johnson, & Persico, 2016).

                                       [Insert Figure 4 about Here]

       The striking patterns in pre-SEP and post-SEP performance trends displayed in Figures 2

and 3 raise questions about patterns of variability in performance trends among schools. For

instance, one might ask: Did heterogeneity in performance trends among schools of the same

type differ between the pre-SEP and post-SEP periods? We can manipulate the estimated

random-effects parameters (variances and covariances) displayed at the bottom of Appendix B,

Table B2 algebraically to address such questions. For instance, the estimated between-school

variance of school-specific rates of improvement in average adjusted mathematics scores is

10.35 in the post-SEP period, within school type. This is 50 percent larger than the

corresponding between-school variance of 7.15 in the pre-SEP period. Thus, not only did

average trends in adjusted mathematics performance differ markedly between the pre- and post-

SEP periods, there was also greater between-school variation in school-specific performance

trends in the post-SEP period than pre-SEP, within each school type.

       Correspondingly, we can manipulate the random-effects estimates in Appendix B, Table

B2 to reveal interesting patterns in the between-school correlations between the school-specific

pre- and post-SEP rates of improvement in performance and their performance in 2005, the


                                                   28
baseline year. For instance, the estimated correlation of the pre-SEP school-specific rates of

performance improvement and the performance level in 2005 is positive (0.55), within school-

type. This means that gaps in performance between the best- and worst-performing schools of

each type widened during the pre-SEP period.

       In contrast, the correlation between the post-SEP rate of improvement in school-specific

performance and the performance level in 2005 is negative (-0.35). This indicates that gaps in

performance between the best- and worst-performing schools of each type narrowed during the

first five years after the passage of SEP.

       Several factors probably contributed to the larger variance in school-specific rates of

performance improvement in the post-SEP period than in the pre-SEP period, within school-type.

First, since schools differed in the percentage of low-income students they served, the amount of

extra funding they received as a result of joining SEP also differed. Second, some schools may

have been much more effective in using their extra funds to improve student performance and to

respond to accountability pressures than were other schools.

       One plausible explanation for the negative covariance in the post-SEP period between

school-specific rates of performance change and performance level in the baseline year is the

influence of the accountability system to which schools participating in SEP became subject.

This system targeted schools in which student test scores were especially low, and therefore

these schools faced the greatest pressure to improve their students’ performance. Later in the

paper we consider whether the test scores gains reflect increases in students’ skills and

knowledge.

       Trends in School-Enrollment Rates



                                                    29
        As illustrated in Figure 2, the average adjusted mathematics achievement of 4th-grade

students attending public schools in either urban or rural areas increased rapidly during the post-

SEP period. One might predict that this substantial improvement in performance would have

slowed the long-term migration of students away from public schools and toward private

schools. However, this did not occur, as we illustrate in the two panels of Figure 5. In the left

panel of the figure, we display trends in the number of 4th-grade students enrolled in each of the

five types of schools that accepted vouchers. Notice that, between 2005 and 2012, the

enrollment of 4th-grade students in public schools declined steadily. Conversely, enrollment in

the private schools that accepted vouchers either remained quite stable or increased, depending

on the type of private school. The rescaling used in the right-hand panel of the figure makes

these patterns easier to see. Here, we display the number of 4th-grade students attending each of

the five different types of schools as a percentage of the number of students enrolled in each

school type in 2005, the base year. Notice the dramatic increases in the number of students

enrolled in private voucher schools that charge fees.

                                       [Insert Figure 5 about here]

        One reason the improvement in the performance of public schools did not slow the

migration of students from these schools may have been parents’ responses to the school

academic rankings that the Chilean government has published each year since 1995. These

rankings are based on student test scores, unadjusted for the influences of student and family

background characteristics. Since public schools in urban areas serve students from lower-

income families, on average, than do private schools, the rankings of public schools remained

low during the post-SEP period despite the substantial increases in the mathematics achievement

of their students.

        Decomposing Adjusted-Achievement Gains for Low-Income Students

        The enrollment patterns displayed in Figure 5 raise the question of whether the shift of

students away from public schools and into different types of private school accounted for a

substantial part of the increase over the post-SEP period in the adjusted mathematics scores of

Chilean 4th-grade students. Given that a goal of SEP was to reduce income-based gaps in

achievement, we are especially interested in the factors contributing to the increase in the

average adjusted mathematics achievement of low-income students. We used a method

proposed by Oaxaca (1973) to decompose the increase in the average adjusted mathematics score

of low-income students between 2006 and 2012 into three parts.15 The first is a weighted average

of the increases in the average adjusted achievement of students enrolled in each of the five types

of schools. The second is a weighted average of the changes in average achievement stemming

from differences between 2006 and 2012 in the distribution of students among the five types of

schools. The third is a weighted average of interaction terms consisting of the products of

changes in the average adjusted achievement and changes in the distribution of students. In our

case, this third part was very small.

        We found that more than 90 percent of the improvement in the average adjusted

mathematics score of grade-4 low-income students between 2006 and 2012 stemmed from

increases in the average achievement within each sector. These increases ranged from 12 points

for private voucher schools that charged fees to 27 points for private no-fee for-profit schools.

Changes in the distribution of low-income students across school types between 2006 and 2012

were substantial. They included a 12-point decline in the percentage enrolled in public schools



15
  We chose 2006 as the “initial” year for our Oaxaca decomposition rather than 2007, the last pre-SEP year,
because it was not possible to adopt a common definition of “low-income student” for the years 2007 and 2012.

                                                           31
and a seven-point increase in the percentage enrolled in private for-profit schools that charged

fees. However, the changes in the distribution of students across sectors accounted for only

seven to nine percent of the increase in the average adjusted mathematics score of low-income

students between 2006 and 2012.16

         Changes in the School Segregation of Low-Income Students

         One mechanism through which SEP could have reduced income-based gaps in student

achievement is by increasing low-income students’ access to schools with higher-income,

academically strong peer groups. To examine the extent to which this took place, we adapted an

approach described by Charles Clotfelter (2004) to compare patterns of school segregation by

income for 4th-grade students in 2006 and in 2012. Our measure of segregation is the difference

between the overall proportion of low-income 4th-grade students in the country (nk) and the

proportion enrolled in the average higher-income 4th-grade student’s school (E). In 2006, nk =

0.56 and E= 0.39, so the value of the segregation measure is 0.17. In 2012, nk = 0.59 and E =

0.42, so the value of the segregation measure for that year is also 0.17. Thus, by this measure,

there was no change between 2006 and 2012 in the extent to which low-income 4th-grade

students were segregated into different schools from those attended by 4th-grade students from

higher-income families.17

         What did differ between the two years is the relative importance of the two factors that

contribute to school segregation nationally: school segregation among 4th-grade low-income



16
   In conducting an Oaxaca decomposition, it is necessary to decide which year to treat as the base year that is used
in calculating the weights. The 7 percent figure comes from treating 2006 as the base year. The 9 percent figure
comes from treating 2012 as the base year.
17
  Clotfelter’s index of segregation, S= (nk – E)/nk, is slightly different from ours. We did not adopt Clotfelter’s
measure because the limitations of our measure of family income prevent us from determining precisely how the
value of nk differed between 2006 and 2012.

                                                              32
students living in the same commune, and segregation stemming from low-income 4th-grade

students living in different communes from their higher income peers. We discovered this pattern

by decomposing our measure of desegregation in each year into six constituent components

through a set of successive steps, each representing a hypothetical redistribution of students. The

results of this set of hypothetical exercises are displayed in Figure 6. In the figure, the light gray

bars illustrate the percentage of school segregation by income that would be eliminated if low-

income students were equally distributed among schools in a particular group in 2006. The dark

gray bars provide the same information for 2012.

                                        [Insert Figure 6 about here]

       In the first step, all 4th-grade students enrolled in public schools in the same commune are

redistributed so that each public school in the commune has the same share of 4th-grade low-

income students. As illustrated by the top set of bars in Figure 7, this would reduce school

segregation by income in 2006 by 20 percent, but only by 7 percent in 2012. This means that, on

average, public schools in each commune were less socioeconomically segregated in 2012 than

they were in 2006.

       In the second step, all 4th-grade students in each commune that were enrolled in private

voucher schools that had not charged fees in 2007 are redistributed such that each of these schools

has the same percentage of 4th-grade low-income students. As illustrated by the second set of bars

in Figure 6, this hypothetical step would reduce segregation by 6 percent in 2006 and by 3 percent

in 2012. This means that no-fee private schools within each commune were less segregated by

income in 2012 than in 2006.

       In the next step, all 4th-grade students in each commune who were enrolled in private

voucher schools that had charged fees in 2007 are redistributed to equalize the percentage of 4th-

                                                     33
grade low-income students in each of these schools within each commune. As illustrated by the

third set of bars in Figure 6, this step would reduce segregation by 25 percent in 2012, but only by

18 percent in 2006.

       In the next step, 4th-grade students in each commune who were enrolled either in public

schools or in private voucher schools that had not charged fees are redistributed so the percentage

of 4th-grade low-income students in each is equal. The net impact of this step on the amount of

segregation is very small (1 percent in 2006 and 2 percent in 2012). The explanation is that public

schools and private no-fee voucher schools served approximately the same percentage of 4th-grade

low-income students in the two years.

       Contrast this with the results of the next step, in which 4th-grade low-income students in

each commune who attended public schools or any type of private voucher school are redistributed.

As illustrated in Figure 6, the impact of this hypothetical redistribution on the extent of segregation

is large (31 percent in 2006 and 27 percent in 2012). The explanation is that private fee-charging

voucher schools served a much lower percentage of low-income 4th-grade students than did either

public schools or no-fee private voucher schools. Consequently, equalizing the percentage of low-

income 4th-grade students among all of these schools within each commune would reduce

segregation markedly.

       In the final step, 4th-grade students attending any public school or private voucher school

in the country are redistributed to equalize the percentage of low-income 4th-grade students in

each school. As illustrated by the bottom set of bars in Figure 6, this would reduce segregation by

a larger amount in 2012 (36 percent) than in 2006 (24 percent). The explanation for this pattern is

that residential segregation by income was greater in 2012 than in 2006. This reduced the potential




                                                      34
for children from low-income families to attend the same schools as children from higher-income

families.

        In summary, the extent of school segregation by income among Chilean 4th-grade students

was about the same in 2012, five years after the introduction of SEP, as it was in 2006. However,

the pattern of segregation was quite different. In 2012, much more of the school segregation

stemmed from residential segregation than was the case six years earlier. A corollary is that, in

2012, there was less school segregation by income among 4th-grade children living in the same

small geographical area than was the case in 2006. One aspect of the change was that public

schools in each commune were more socio-economically integrated in 2012 than they were in

2006. This occurred during a period in which the percentage of higher-income 4th-grade students

attending public schools declined from 29 to 24. The explanation is that the higher-income 4th-

grade students that were enrolled in public schools in each commune were more evenly distributed

among the public schools in that commune in 2012 than in 2006.

       Two notable patterns concern the distribution of 4th-grade students enrolled in private

schools that had charged fees in 2006. The first is that the percentage of 4th-grade students in

these schools who came from low-income families was higher in 2012 (41 percent) than in 2006

(33 percent).   The second is that fee-charging private voucher schools were more socio-

economically segregated in 2012 than they were in 2006. Some set low fees and attracted low-

income students who brought with them higher-valued vouchers. Others charged higher fees and

specialized in serving higher-income students.


Threats to Validity


Events Concurrent with SEP


                                                  35
           Given the discontinuity design of our research, one critical threat to the validity of

attributing the increase in student mathematics scores to the implementation of the SEP program

are concurrent changes in the circumstances of the students and the schools they attended.

Indeed, there were events that affected a great many Chilean families in the years shortly after

the introduction of the SEP program. One was a sharp economic decline that occurred in 2009,

following the onset of the world-wide Great Recession. A second was a series of earthquakes,

including an especially devastating one that occurred in February 2010. The limited available

evidence indicates that these events had negative effects on student achievement.18

Consequently, it is unlikely that these events contributed to the improvement in student test

scores during the five years after the passage of SEP.

           A second threat to causal inference comes from other educational reforms that were

implemented around the same time as the SEP program. For example, legislation passed in 1996

increased the length of the school day, eliminating the potential to use the same school building

to educate one group of students in the morning and another in the afternoon (Bellei, 2009).

While adopted well before the passage of SEP, the consequent need to build additional schools

meant that the period of implementation of this new legislation was long in many areas. The

additional funds provided by SEP may have enabled schools to make better use of the longer

school day.19 Using our data, it is not possible to isolate the impact of SEP implementation from

those of other educational reforms. So the most defensible conclusion is that educational




18
  Ananat, Gassman-Pines, & Gibson-Davis (2011) show that economic downturns had negative impacts on the
academic achievement of elementary-school children in North Carolina. Gomez & Yoshikawa (forthcoming) find
that exposure to the 2010 earthquake had a negative impact on the cognitive skills of young children in Chile.

reforms in Chile, of which SEP was one critical part, produced substantial increases in student

test scores and declines in income-based test-score gaps.

Did the cognitive skills of low-income students really improve?

       In a recent paper entitled “Illusory Gains from Chile’s Targeted School Voucher

Experiment,” Feigenberg, Rifkin, and Yan (2017) raise doubts about the extent to which SEP

closed the gap between the cognitive skills of low- and high-SES students. Based on the results

of analyses of data very similar to those we use, the authors reach three conclusions:

       a. The gap between the average test scores of low- and high-SES students closed much

           less after 2008 than other studies have reported when estimated within a model that

           accounts for the influences of family income and parental educational attainments;

       b. SEP is not responsible for increases in the relative test scores of low-SES students;

       c. Increases in the relative test scores of low-SES students do not reflect real

           improvements in cognitive skills.

We do not disagree with the evidence these authors present. However, we do disagree with the

interpretation of some of the evidence and with the conclusions they reach. We consider each

conclusion in turn.

       Smaller test score gap. Feigenberg, Rivkin, and Yan (2017) fit difference-in differences

models to examine whether the gap between the mathematics and reading scores of low-SES

students and higher-SES students was smaller in the years after the passage of SEP than in

previous years. Similar to the results of other studies, they conclude that the size of the test-

score gap declined by about 0.2 standard deviations after SEP was introduced. However, these

authors go on to show (p. 13) that the test score gap closes by a much smaller amount when


                                                     37
estimated within the context of a model that includes as covariates the family income and

parental educational attainments of individual students. This is not surprising since these

additional variables are indicators of the parental resources that contribute to the development of

children’s skills. In effect, including these family background covariates in the model controls

for many of the factors that contribute to the relatively low test scores of low-SES students.

Moreover, an implicit assumption underlying the difference-in-difference models that

Feigenberg, Rivkin, and Yan estimate is that SEP did not influence the test scores of high-SES

students. It is unlikely that this assumption is valid since schools could use SEP funds to

improve the education of all students. Indeed, as illustrated in Figure 1 of our paper, the average

mathematics score of students at every family income percentile was higher in 2012 than in

2005.

        SEP not responsible for test-score gains. Feigenberg, Rivkin, and Yan (2017) present

several pieces of evidence in support of their conclusion that SEP was not responsible for

increases in the relative test scores of low-SES students after 2007. First, they show that the

additional funds SEP provided to participating schools had only a modest effect on measured

inputs. They report that teachers hired with SEP funds tended to be quite inexperienced, on

average, and a slightly lower percentage had a college degree than the teachers who had taught

low-SES students prior to SEP. Average class size fell by less than one student per grade in

schools participating in SEP.

        We do not see these findings as evidence that schools used SEP funds imprudently.

Indeed, a theme of a substantial literature is that reducing class size beyond the primary grades

and paying for experience beyond teachers’ first few years in the classroom are not effective

strategies for increasing student achievement ( Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain, 2005; Hanushek and


                                                    38
Rivkin, 2010). In contrast, strategies consistent with the evidence on changes in inputs that

Feigenberg, Rivkin, and Yan present have closed SES-based test-score gaps in other settings.

These strategies focus on how resources are used rather than on which inputs are purchased

(Banerjee et al., 2007; Fryer, 2014).

       Feigenberg, Rivkin, and Yan (2017) also point out that the test score gap did not decline

more in the years after 2007 for low-SES students enrolled in schools that participated in SEP

than for low-SES students enrolled in non-participating schools. This evidence is consistent with

SEP making a difference. Schools chose whether to participate in SEP. Those that were thriving

prior to the passage of SEP may have declined participation in order to avoid the obligations that

were part of the accountability provisions of SEP. Some low-SES parents were able to enroll

their child in an elementary school that was thriving without SEP. However, many schools were

not thriving prior to the passage of SEP and many low-SES parents were not able to enroll their

child in a high-quality elementary school. It is these schools and parents that may have benefited

from SEP.

       Test-score gains did not mean stronger cognitive skills. Feigenberg, Rivkin, and Yan

(2017) present two types of evidence in support of their conclusion that the gains from SEP were

“illusory.” First, they show that the increases in the relative scores of low-SES students on low-

stakes tests taken in 8th grade were only half as large as the increases in the relative scores on the

quite high-stakes grade-4 tests. Second, they show that in the first few years after the

introduction of SEP, the rate of missing scores on the national grade-4 tests increased, especially

among low-SES students likely to be low-scoring. This increased the average scores of those

low-SES students that did take the tests. This evidence does support the authors’ argument that

some Chilean elementary schools responded to accountability pressure by taking actions that did


                                                     39
not maximize the long-term learning of students. However, we do not see this as justifying the

conclusion that SEP had no meaningful impact on the quality of education provided to low-

income students.

        Our interpretation of the evidence in our paper as well as that in the Feigenberg, Rivkin,

and Yan (2017) paper is informed by the literature on school improvement and especially by a

recent paper by Cristian Bellei and his colleagues (2015). This paper reports the results of 12

case studies of Chilean elementary schools that had improved their performance on the national

reading and mathematics tests between 2002 and 2010. Bellei and his colleagues argue that the

schools that they studied followed a continuum of four paths to improved SIMCE scores, from

“restricted improvement” to “institutionalized educational effectiveness.” Schools following the

first path were initially very low-performing and had very little capacity to provide high-quality

instruction. They responded to accountability pressures by focusing intently on improving

grade-4 SIMCE reading and mathematics scores. Their actions included some of the practices

Feigenberg, Rivkin, and Yan describe. Elacqua (2016) also examined responses of low-

performing Chilean elementary schools to accountability pressure and reported similar

responses. Instead of investing in improving the quality of instruction, these schools hired tutors

to work with low-achieving students and assigned their most qualified teachers to the fourth

grade, the grade level where students take the national reading and mathematics tests used in the

SEP accountability system.20




20
   Daniel Koretz (2008) has pointed out that unproductive response of some schools to test-based accountability is
inevitable. Cohen and his colleagues (2014) have shown that strategic behavior that does not benefit students is
especially prevalent among schools with very limited capacity to provide coherent, consistent high-quality
instruction.



                                                             40
        At the other end of the continuum, schools that had institutionalized improvement

invested in developing the teaching skills of its teachers, in making instruction more consistent

across grade levels, and in developing a shared sense of responsibility for the learning of all

students. This process took many years of work and strong leadership. It is much more likely that

increases in SIMCE scores in these schools reflected increases in children’s cognitive skills than

is the case in the first group of schools.

        We see SEP as a complex policy initiative aimed at fostering the development of schools

that would provide high-quality education to all students, including those from low-income

families. The voucher system it replaced had relied on competition among schools to improve

educational quality. SEP explicitly acknowledged that this was not sufficient. The law included

provisions to support school improvement and hold schools accountable for improving. Schools

responded to SEP in a variety of ways, not all of which were constructive. This led the

legislature to revise the educational reform legislation several times. For example, as of 2015, no

schools that accept vouchers, even those not participating in SEP, may charge tuition to students

from low-income families.

        We view the responses to SEP as encouraging, especially the increases in SIMCE scores

for children from all family income percentiles, and the decline in income-based test score gaps.

However, the great variation in school improvement rates in the years after SEP that we

document is troubling, as is evidence that Feigenberg, Rivkin, and Yan (2017) present. Refining

Chile’s policies for supporting schools with very different capacities and for holding them

accountable in a manner that elicits constructive responses is an ongoing challenge.

Concluding comments




                                                    41
       We have argued that the combination of support and accountability that SEP provided to

participating schools is the primary mechanism through which the law resulted in increased test

scores, especially for low-SES students. In principle, it would have been possible for the Chilean

government to introduce these provisions without a system of differentiated school vouchers.

This may lead some readers to ask if the choice provisions of the SEP legislation were important.

We cannot answer this question definitively because we have no evidence from Chile on the

responses of schools and families to a system of support and accountability without choice.

However, we have presented some evidence that the choice provisions of SEP did play a

constructive role. This comes from the decomposition of the differences between 2006 and 2012

in the test score distribution of low-SES students. We found that about 10 percent of the increase

in the average scores of low-SES students stemmed statistically from changes in the composition

of students across school types, and 90 percent stemmed from increases in the scores of students

enrolled in schools of each type.

       We close by returning to the ideas of two early proponents of vouchers. Milton Friedman

(1962) envisioned that the use of vouchers would improve education and increase efficiency by

stimulating the supply of private schools and empowering parents to find schools that were good

matches for their children. Writing prior to the 1966 publication of Equality of Educational

Opportunity (better known as the Coleman Report, Coleman et al., 1966), which provided the

first nation-wide evidence on inequality of educational outcomes and school segregation by race

and class, Friedman did not emphasize these concerns. Writing after the Coleman Report had

received significant attention, Christopher Jencks (1970) was concerned centrally with these

topics and they influenced the design of the regulated compensatory voucher system that he




                                                   42
proposed. Chile’s experience with a universal voucher system in the years before and after SEP

shows that the design of regulations and incentives matter greatly.

               Detailed Specifications of the Multilevel Models, By Research Question


        RQ1: Trends in Student Achievement Over Time

        To address our first research question (RQ1), we specified students’ raw mathematics

scores as a function of: (a) the passage of time (YEAR), (b) the onset of the SEP policy

implementation (SEP), and (c) family-income percentile (INC), in a multilevel statistical model.

For the kth fourth-grade student enrolled in the ith school in the jth year, the multilevel (Level-

1/Level-2) specification of our full model for addressing RQ1 is:


  Level-1/Student-Year:

    𝑀𝐴𝑇𝐻𝑖𝑗𝑘 = 𝜋0𝑖 + 𝜋1𝑖 (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008)

                 +𝜋2𝑖 𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗 + 𝜋3𝑖 [𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗 × (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008)]

                  +𝜷1′ 𝑰𝑵𝑪𝑖𝑗𝑘 + 𝜷′2 [𝑰𝑵𝑪𝑖𝑗𝑘 × (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008)]

                   +𝜷′3 (𝑰𝑵𝑪𝑖𝑗𝑘 × 𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗 )
                                 + 𝜷′4 [(𝑰𝑵𝑪𝑖𝑗𝑘 × 𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗 ) × (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008)]
                                                                                                A[A1]
                           +{𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑘 + 𝛿𝑖𝑗 }

        where 𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑘 ~ 𝑁(0, 𝜎𝜖2 ) and 𝛿𝑖𝑗 ~ 𝑁(0, 𝜎𝛿2 )

   Level-2/School:

    𝜋0𝑖 = 𝛾00 + 𝜁0𝑖

    𝜋1𝑖 = 𝛾10 + 𝜁1𝑖

    𝜋2𝑖 = 𝛾20 + 𝜁2𝑖

                                                       1
   𝜋3𝑖 = 𝛾30 + 𝜁3𝑖

              𝜁0𝑖
              𝜁
       where [ 1𝑖 ] ~𝑀𝑉𝑁4 (𝟎, 𝜮𝜁 )
              𝜁2𝑖
              𝜁3𝑖

       Notice that, at Level-1 -- the Student/Year level, in the fixed part of the model, we have

included terms to represent the main effect of time-varying predictors YEAR and SEP, and their

two-way interaction. This part of the model specification accounts for the standard features of

our discontinuity design and permits the estimation of unique population average trends in

achievement over time in the pre- and post-SEP periods, by school. Then, to allow these

trajectories to differ by family income, we have also included the main effect of predictor vector

𝑰𝑵𝑪 (containing the student’s family-income percentile, its square, and its cube). The model also

contains cross-products representing the two-way interactions between family-income percentile

and time, and between family-income percentile and SEP, plus the three-way interaction among

all three predictors. These latter components of the specification permit the hypothesized

relationship between student mathematics achievement and both time and family income to

differ in the pre- and post-SEP periods. To reduce both model complexity and computing burden

(which was extreme), we have fixed -- across schools -- the effects of the predictors that

represented family-income percentile. Finally, in addressing RQ1, we have included no

predictors at the school level, but have simply permitted the corresponding Level-1 parameters to

differ around their model-specified population averages (𝛾00, 𝛾10, 𝛾30, 𝛾40), with the

corresponding hypothesized population variances.

       In the multilevel model in [A1], we have accounted for the complex levels of nesting

present in our data-design by including selected random effects at each level. At Level-1, we



                                                    2
include two random effects. First, we have hypothesized that -- in the population – residuals 𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑘

are distributed independently and identically normal with mean zero and variance 𝜎𝜖2 . Second,

because students are nested within schools and a single testing instance (that is, year), we have

included the random effect of school and year, 𝛿𝑖𝑗 , again assumed to be distributed

independently and identically normal, but with variance 𝜎𝛿2 . At the school level, because each

school contributes multiple years of testing data, we have hypothesized that the school-level

achievement trajectories possess a random intercept and a random slope across schools, denoted

by 𝜋0𝑖 and 𝜋1𝑖 in the pre-SEP period, along with increments to both, denoted by 𝜋2𝑖 and 𝜋3𝑖

respectively in the post-SEP period. Finally, we have assumed that these latter four school-level

random effects are distributed multivariate normal with mean vector zero and unconstrained

covariance matrix 𝜮𝜁 .

               Of course, one need not rely solely on a multilevel specification. All such models

can be collapsed algebraically into a corresponding composite model, which has the appearance

of a standard linear statistical (regression) model, but incorporates a complex error term to

account for the nested and time-varying nature of the data design. For RQ1, for instance,

substituting from Level-2 of the specification into Level-1, this composite model becomes:

   𝑀𝐴𝑇𝐻𝑖𝑗𝑘 = 𝛾00 + 𝛾10 (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008)

                 +𝛾20 𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗 + 𝛾30 [𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗 × (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008)]

                                                                                                [[A2]
                 +𝜷1′ 𝑰𝑵𝑪𝑖𝑗𝑘 + 𝜷′2 [𝑰𝑵𝑪𝑖𝑗𝑘 × (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008)]

                  +𝜷′3 (𝑰𝑵𝑪𝑖𝑗𝑘 × 𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗 )
                               + 𝜷′4 [(𝑰𝑵𝑪𝑖𝑗𝑘 × 𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗 ) × (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008)]




                                                     3
                      +{(𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑘 + 𝛿𝑖𝑗 ) + (𝜁0𝑖 + 𝜁1𝑖 (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008) + 𝜁2𝑖 𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗
                                     + 𝜁3𝑖 [𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗 × (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008)])}

       Or, more simply:

   𝑀𝐴𝑇𝐻𝑖𝑗𝑘 = 𝛾00 + 𝛾10 (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008)

                 +𝛾20 𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗 + 𝛾30 [𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗 × (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008)]

                 +𝜷1′ 𝑰𝑵𝑪𝑖𝑗𝑘 + 𝜷′2 [𝑰𝑵𝑪𝑖𝑗𝑘 × (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008)]                                  [[A3]

                    +𝜷′3 (𝑰𝑵𝑪𝑖𝑗𝑘 × 𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗 )
                                   + 𝜷′4 [(𝑰𝑵𝑪𝑖𝑗𝑘 × 𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗 ) × (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008)]
                                      ′
                                   + 𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑘

              ′
       Where 𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑘 is a composite multilevel time-dependent residual, given by:


         ′
                                 𝜁0𝑖 + 𝜁1𝑖 (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008) + 𝜁2𝑖 𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗
        𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑘 = {(𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑘 + 𝛿𝑖𝑗 ) + (                                    )}                       [[A4]
                                    +𝜁3𝑖 [𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗 × (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008)]

       With constituent random effects distributed as assumed in [A1]. Inspecting [A4]

confirms that – while our specification describes the complex nested structure of our data – it

permits the hypothesized level-2 error-covariance structure (representing the population

variances and covariances among trends in student achievement over time) to be heteroscedastic

across the pre- and post-SEP periods. It is the composite multilevel model in [A3] that is listed

in the text as the principal model whose fitting permits us to address RQ1.

       RQ2: The Impact of SEP on Student Achievement Trends

       In addressing RQ2, we sought to discern differences in the impact of the implementation

of the SEP policy on student mathematics achievement among different types of schools, as

distinguished by their location and organizational type. In doing so, we regarded it critical to

control for the effects of selected important student and family characteristics (student gender,

                                                     4
whether a student had repeated fourth grade, family income, and parental educational

attainment). This is because it may have been easier for schools to improve their average student

achievement post-SEP by attracting more advantaged students than by improving the intrinsic

quality of the education they provided. However, we also wanted to recognize that an explicit

goal of SEP implementation itself was to reduce achievement gaps based on socioeconomic

status. If SEP succeeded, we anticipated that parameters associated with these same selected

student and family covariates in our statistical models would have smaller values in the post-SEP

period than in the pre-SEP. In order to control for student and family background influences, but

also attribute to SEP reductions in the influences of these variables on student achievement, we

constrained the parameters on the selected covariates to those values they had during the three-

year period prior to SEP implementation.

       Unfortunately, we could not impose the required constraints directly during the fitting of

subsequent statistical models due to limitations in our model-fitting software and the size of our

dataset -- limitations that were exacerbated by the multilevel nature of our data and our

concurrent implementation of the methods of multiple imputation. So, in advance of any

analyses to address RQ2, we chose to adjust the values of our mathematics outcome by

partialling the effects of the selected covariates from it. We did this using a two-step procedure.

First, using only data on fourth-grade students during the pre-SEP years (2005-2007), we fitted a

statistical model to predict student mathematics score as a function of the selected student and

family background covariates, and estimated their associated slope parameters. The estimated

parameters of this model are listed below in Appendix A, Table A1. Then, using these estimated

parameter values, we partialled the effect of the selected covariates from the original MATH

outcome and constructed a measure of adjusted student mathematics achievement, ADJ_MATH,



                                                     5
for every student, in both the pre-SEP and post-SEP periods. All subsequent analyses to address

RQ2 treated ADJ_MATH – rather than MATH -- as the outcome.

        To address RQ2, we amended our multilevel specification in [A1], for the kth fourth-grade

student enrolled in the ith school in the jth year, as follows:

     Level-1/Student-Year:

       𝐴𝐷𝐽_𝑀𝐴𝑇𝐻𝑖𝑗𝑘 = 𝜋0𝑖 + 𝜋1𝑖 (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008) + 𝜋2𝑖 𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗
                       + 𝜋3𝑖 {𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗 × (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008)} + {𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑘 + 𝛿𝑖𝑗 }

                  where 𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑘 ~ 𝑁(0, 𝜎𝜖2 ) and 𝛿𝑖𝑗 ~ 𝑁(0, 𝜎𝛿2 )

             Level-2/School:                                                                [[A5]

       𝜋0𝑖 = 𝛾00 + 𝜸′𝒐 𝑾𝒊 + 𝜁0𝑖

               𝜋1𝑖 = 𝛾10 + 𝜸′𝟏 𝑾𝒊 + 𝜁1𝑖

       𝜋2𝑖 = 𝛾20 + 𝜸′𝟐 𝑾𝒊 + 𝜁2𝑖

       𝜋3𝑖 = 𝛾30 + 𝜸′𝟑 𝑾𝒊 + 𝜁3𝑖

                      𝜁0𝑖
                      𝜁
               where [ 1𝑖 ] ~𝑀𝑉𝑁4 (𝟎, 𝜮𝐴𝑑𝑗𝜁 )
                      𝜁2𝑖
                      𝜁3𝑖

        Notice that, at Level-1 (Student/Year) of our multilevel model in [A5], we have again

included time-varying predictors to capture the main effect of both YEAR and SEP, and their

two-way interaction. This part of the model specification accounts for the standard features of

our discontinuity design. As before, this specification permits unique population average trends

in achievement over time in the pre- and post-SEP periods, by school. Notice, though, that we

have eliminated the direct effects of family-income percentile in the model because this predictor

has already been partialled from the student mathematics achievement score during the outcome

adjustment process described above. In our Level-2 school-level model, we have now added the


                                                        6
time-invariant predictor vector 𝑾, to distinguish among schools based on their organizational

form and location. It is the effects of these latter predictors that address our second research

question. In the multilevel model, we have again accounted for the complex levels of nesting

present in our data-design by including selected random effects at each level, similar to those

hypothesized under RQ1, in [A1] above.

       Again, the specified multilevel model can be collapsed into a corresponding composite

model, with a complex error term that accounts for the nested and time-varying nature of the data

design. For RQ2, substituting from Level-2 of the specification into Level-1, this composite

model is:

      𝐴𝐷𝐽_𝑀𝐴𝑇𝐻𝑖𝑗𝑘 = 𝛾00 + 𝜸′𝒐 𝑾𝒊 + 𝛾10(𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008)
                      + 𝜸′𝟏 [𝑾𝒊 × (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008)] + 𝛾20 𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗
                      + 𝜸′𝟐 [𝑾𝒊 × 𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗 ] + 𝛾30 {𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗 × (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008)}
                      + 𝜸′𝟑 [𝑾𝒊 × 𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗 × (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008)]                                      [[A6]

                    +{(𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑘 + 𝛿𝑖𝑗 )
                                + (𝜁0𝑖 + 𝜁1𝑖 (𝑌𝐸𝐴𝑅𝑗 − 2008) + 𝜁2𝑖 𝑆𝐸𝑃𝑗

confirms that – while our specification accounts for the complex nested structure of our data – it

permits the hypothesized level-2 error-covariance structure (representing the population

variances and covariances among trends in student achievement over time) to be heteroscedastic

across the pre- and post-SEP periods. It is composite multilevel model [A7] that is listed in the

body of the text as the principal model whose fitting permits us to address RQ2.

Appendix A Table A1. Estimates, standard errors and approximate p-values from a fitted multilevel model
summarizing the relationship between fourth-grade student mathematics scores, in Chile, and: (a) year
(re-parameterized as dichotomous predictors, representing 2005 thru 2007, with 2005 omitted), (b) a cubic
polynomial function of family-income percentile, (c) parental educational attainment (re-parameterized as a
vector of dichotomous predictors, uniquely for both mother and father, with lowest category omitted, in
each case), (d) school location, and (e) student gender and repeater status. All estimates were obtained
using the method of multiple-imputation to account for the presence of missing data (m=8).

Appendix B Table B2: Estimates, standard errors and approximate p-values from a fitted multilevel

model summarizing the relationship between fourth-grade student adjusted-mathematics scores, in Chile,

and: (a) YEAR (centered on 2008), (b) implementation of SEP and its interaction with centered YEAR, (c)

school location, and (d) school organizational type. All estimates were obtained using the method of

multiple-imputation to account for the presence of missing data (m=8).
