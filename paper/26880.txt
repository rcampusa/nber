                                          ABSTRACT

This paper forecasts the life-cycle treatment effects on health of a high-quality early childhood
program. Our predictions combine microsimulation using non-experimental data with
experimental data from a midlife long-term follow-up. The follow-up incorporated a full
epidemiological exam. The program mainly benefits males and significantly reduces the
prevalence of heart disease, stroke, cancer, and mortality across the life-cycle. For men, we
estimate an average reduction of 3.8 disability-adjusted years (DALYs). The reduction in DALYs
is relatively small for women. The gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) is almost enough
to offset all of the costs associated with program implementation for males and half of program
costs for women.

1       Introduction

A substantial body of evidence documents that high-quality early childhood education boosts
the skills of disadvantaged children.1 Much of this research focuses on early childhood
interventions with short-term followups. The few studies that analyze long-term outcomes
primarily focus on labor market and criminal outcomes.2 This paper examines the life-
cycle health outcomes of an influential pair of essentially identical early childhood programs
conducted in North Carolina that targeted disadvantaged children: the Carolina Abecedarian
Project (ABC) and the Carolina Approach to Responsive Education (CARE), henceforth
ABC/CARE. The programs were implemented using randomized trials. They begin early in
participants’ lives (at 8 weeks), and engage participants until age 5.3

Figure 1 summarizes the experimental treatment effects of ABC on the prevalence of risk
factors for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases as measured by an epidemiological survey
conducted when participants were in their mid-30s. There are pronounced differences in
health treatment effects by gender. This paper projects estimated treatment effects at that
age over the full life cycle using an adaptation of the Future Adult Model (FAM). Goldman
et al. (2016) documents FAM. We examine the risk-reducing properties of high-quality early
childhood education on six chronic conditions: cancer, lung disease, diabetes, heart disease,

       Both programs were launched in the 1970s. Their original goal was to boost cognition and promote
schooling and attachment to society. Programs inspired by ABC/CARE have been (and are currently being)
launched around the world. Sparling (2010) and Ramey et al. (2014) list numerous programs based on
the ABC/CARE approach. The programs are: Infant Health and Development Program (IHDP) in eight
different cities in the U.S. (Spiker et al., 1997); Early Head Start and Head Start. (Schneider and McDonald,
2007); John’s Hopkins Cerebral Palsy Study in the U.S. (Sparling, 2010); Classroom Literacy Interventions
and Outcomes (CLIO) study. (Sparling, 2010); Massachusetts Family Child Care Study (Collins et al.,
2010); Healthy Child Manitoba Evaluation (Healthy Child Manitoba, 2015); Abecedarian Approach within
an Innovative Implementation Framework (Jensen and Nielsen, 2016); and Building a Bridge into Preschool
in Remote Northern Territory Communities in Australia (Scull et al., 2015). Current Educare programs in
the U.S. are also based on ABC/CARE (Educare, 2014; Yazejian and Bryant, 2012). ABC had a second
treatment stage from ages 5 to 8. Treatment was randomized using a second, independent randomization
protocol. We do not analyze the second stage in this paper. The second stage had very weak effects on
participants (see Campbell et al., 2013).

hypertension, and stroke. The program generates substantial lifetime benefits as measured by
disability-adjusted life years, quality-adjusted life years, and mortality. Garcı́a et al. (2020)
use these estimates as one input into a cost-benefit analysis of the ABC/CARE program
that also considers earnings, education, crime, and other outcomes. This paper examines
the lifetime health benefits in much more detail than that paper and does not conduct a
cost-benefit analysis.

ABC/CARE eligibles. We combine the FAM subsample with the ABC/CARE experimental

sample and use the methodology of Garcı́a et al. (2020) to project lifetime health benefits.

We find substantial life-cycle effects on cancer, heart disease, stroke, and mortality for both
males and females. Across the life-cycle, treatment group females are less likely to have
a stroke than their treatment group counterparts. By age 70, treatment group males are
half as likely to have a stroke than control group counterparts. Similar results hold for
heart disease, lung disease, and cancer. By age 50, a significant difference between the
likelihood of dying due to any of these diseases emerges between treatment and control
group participants, both male and female. For males after age 60, this difference grows
substantially. At age 70, control group males are almost four times as likely to die as their
treatment group counterparts. Results for women are less stark. For males, we calculate a
statistically significant average reduction of 3.8 disability-adjusted years, while for females the
gain is small and imprecise. For males, the increase in quality-adjusted life years more than
offsets all program costs (i.e., if the only benefit of the program had been the improvement
in QALYs, the program would have almost paid for itself). For females, the increase in
quality-adjusted life years offsets nearly half of the program costs.

The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the ABC/CARE program and the data
collected on its participants. Section 3 discusses our adaption of the FAM model to forecast
life-cycle chronic diseases for ABC/CARE participants. Section 4 reports and discusses our
findings. Section 5 concludes.

     Garcı́a et al. (2020), show that, under the null hypothesis of input exogeneity, it is possible to formulate
additional tests for this methodology. It is also possible to test for input exogeneity. Unfortunately, we can
only perform those tests for outcomes for which there are two observation periods during adulthood, which
is not the case of health. Garcı́a et al. (2020) test for and do not reject exogeneity using labor income as an
outcome. Given the prior tests, we assume that, conditioning on regressors, inputs are exogenous.

2       ABC/CARE Program and Data Description

ABC/CARE is a randomized early childhood intervention with longitudinal follow-up data
from birth until adulthood. Data on cognitive skills, socio-emotional skills, family environ-
ment, and self-reported health of control and treatment group children were collected an-
nually during the duration of the program and then periodically until participants reached
their mid-30s. ABC/CARE is a widely emulated early childhood program. Despite larger
sample sizes and multi-site designs in other randomized programs, few have compiled longi-
tudinal data on health outcomes until adulthood (Elango et al., 2016). Long-term outcomes
are especially important for health since many chronic conditions manifest later in life after
years of sustained behavior.

The goal of the Carolina Abecedarian Project (ABC) and Carolina Approach to Responsive
Education (CARE), ABC/CARE, was to prepare children for school socially, cognitively,
and academically by promoting language and cognitive development through center-based
care. There was no focus on adult health, yet we find substantial health impacts. The
interactive curriculum provided an educational environment with small student-staff ratios
and small-group learning. The program also provided nutritious meals and medical checkups
for participants.

ABC and CARE recruited four and two cohorts, respectively, of disadvantaged children born
in Chapel Hill, North Carolina between 1972 and 1980. Potential participants were referred
to researchers by local social service agencies and hospitals at the beginning of the mother’s
last trimester of pregnancy. Eligibility was based on a High Risk Index5 developed by the
Frank Porter Graham Center (FPG) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
    5
      The index weighted the following variables: maternal and paternal education, family income, father’s
presence at home, lack of maternal relatives in the area, siblings behind appropriate grade in school, family
on welfare, father in unstable job, low maternal IQ, low siblings’ IQ, social agency indicates that the family
is disadvantaged, one or more family members has sought a form of professional help in the last three years,
and any other special circumstance detected by program staff.


                                                      5
Eligible mothers were 20 years old on average, 74% of fathers were absent, and 94% of the
sample was African-American.

The final ABC sample consisted of 114 subjects. 58 were in the treatment group. 56 were in
the control group. CARE consisted of 65 families, with 25 in a family education treatment
group, 23 in the control group, and 17 in a center-based childcare treatment group. Six and
five subjects withdrew from the ABC and CARE samples, respectively.

Children were randomized into treatment and control groups using child pairs matched based
on family background. All subjects received diapers and formula for the first six months,
and treatment group subjects received additional daily health screenings. From the ages of
0 to 5, treatment group subjects received cognitive and social stimulation for eight hours a
day in center-based care.6 Even though CARE subjects also received home visits from the
ages of 0 to 5, this component was shown to have very weak estimated effects using a second
treatment arm that received home visits only (Campbell et al., 2013). Previous analyses
justify merging the treatment groups of ABC and the main treatment arm of CARE.7

Follow-up data collection of ABC/CARE subjects occurred at ages 12, 15, 21, and 30.
Various education, employment, health, crime, and family structure measures were collected
through both administrative and self-reported channels. Additionally, data from a full-
medical sweep of participants in their mid-30s is also available. Our analysis leverages this
data. We exclude five outlier subjects with mid-30s BMI greater than 50 in the final analysis,

   6
       ABC/CARE also included school-age intervention from the ages of 5 to 8 focused on reading and math,
which was found to have no effect (Campbell et al., 2013).
     7
       We acknowledge that dropping one of the treatment arms is a possible concern, as pointed out by
Muralidharan et al. (2019), although people were randomly assigned to treatment arms. We are faced with a
trade-off. We could analyze the ABC sample only as previous studies have done and not recognize that CARE
was a continuation of the ABC/CARE program or we could include CARE. When including CARE, however,
it is not sensible to include the treatment arm that only received home visits. Home visits were a very minor
element of the program and comparisons to the control group would be imprecise given all of the estimation
steps in our procedure and the small-sample size of the home-visits treatment arm. A fully-interacted model
would be imprecisely estimated in our complex setting. Not analyzing the school-stage randomization is not
a concern. School-stage treatment was assigned through a completely new randomization so critiques like
those in Muralidharan et al. (2019) do not apply.


                                                     6
leaving a final sample of 83 individuals. Outliers that are this extreme are problematic
because they generate imprecise predicted treatment effects because of our small sample size
used to initialize the forecasts.8




3       Forecasting Chronic Diseases for ABC/CARE

We first formally state the Future Adult Model (FAM), the model that we use for predicting
life-cycle treatment effects. We then apply it.



3.1     Notation and Model Development


Let M denote a set of possible health states, some of which can be absorbing. Let A :=
[0, . . . , Ā] index ages, where Ā is the last age for which we construct forecasts. We define
ha,m,m0 as the probability of transitioning from state m to state m0 at age a ∈ A, where
m, m0 ∈ M. We drop individual subscripts to avoid notational clutter.

We denote a transition from m to m0 at age a by Da,m,m0 = 1. If this transition does not
occur, Da,m,m0 = 0. We let D̃a,m be the indicator of occupancy of state m at age a. D̃a,m
is a generic entry in the the vector of age-a state occupancy indicators denoted by D̃a . D̃0
denotes the vector of initial state-occupancy conditions.

The probability of occupying state m ∈ M at age a ∈ A is assumed to be generated by an
index threshold-crossing model:

                                        
        Ia,m   = 1 D̃0 ≥ 0 Ωm + 1 D̃a−1 ≥ 0 Λm + Wa βm + Bαm + τa,m + εa,m ,                              (1)

    8
     Note that we only drop them in the forecast exercises. Individuals with BMI over fifty are still included
in Figure 1. Despite the inclusion of five relatively unhealthy individuals, as measured by their BMI, in the
treatment group (four females and one male; two in the ABC sample and three in the CARE sample), the
mid-30s treatment effects on health outcomes are economically and statistically significant.


                                                      7
                                
where D̃a,m = 1 (Ia,m ≥ 0), 1 D̃0 is a vector of indicators of mutually exclusive initial
                                                       
conditions with associated coefficients Ωm , 1 D̃a−1 ≥ 0 is a vector of mutually exclusive
previous-period outcomes associated coefficients Λm . Both D̃0 and D̃a−1 can be affected by
treatment. Wa denotes contemporaneous variables that can be affected by treatment with
associated coefficients βm . B is the vector of eligibility conditions with associated coefficients
αm . τa,m is age.9 εa,m is a serially uncorrelated shock which is assumed to be uncorrelated
with all of the right-hand side observables. In practice, when analyzing discrete outcomes,
we assume that it is a unit normal random variable.

Instead of modeling initial conditions, we directly condition on them in Equation (1). The
assumption of uncorrelatedess of εa,m across ages, health states, and subjects together with
normality allows us to conduct separate estimation of the coefficients characterizing Equa-
tion (1) for each m ∈ M using maximum likelihood. We estimate [Ωm , Λm , βm , αm , τa,m ]
for each m ∈ M.

The probability of occupying various discrete states is generated in FAM using Equation (1).
When simulating the model to forecast the health outcomes for the ABC/CARE subjects, we
use their observed age-30 conditions as initial conditions D̃0 . Most of these initial conditions
relate to health, but we also include initial conditions related to economic status.

This model easily accommodates absorbing states. Thus, m ∈ M is an absorbing state
if D̃a,m = 1 implies that D̃a0 ,m = 1 ∀a0 ∈ A with a0 ≥ a. Once an individual reaches
an absorbing stage, their model in Equation (1) is no longer used to generate transitions.
Death is clearly an absorbing state.

Ordered and unordered outcomes are also easily accommodated using standard methods in
discrete choice. An example of the former is the level of psychological distress (e.g., low,
medium, high). An example of the latter is labor force status (e.g., labor force status is
   9
     In our empirical analysis, we approximate the coefficients on τa,m using splines with knots at ages 35,
45, 55, 65, and 75.


                                                     8
categorized as out of labor force, unemployed, working part time, or working full time). We
also model continuous outcomes so that Ia,m is observed and the variables in D̃a are replaced
by observed counterparts. An example of a continuous outcome is body-mass index (BMI).
We consider other inputs that are related to health but are not health outcomes per se.
These include labor force participation, relationship status, and childbearing models. They
are estimated within FAM to account for the socioeconomic disadvantage of participants. We
take the labor income forecast of Garcı́a et al. (2020) as an input for the heath predictions.

Tables 1 to 3 list the variables determining each of the states and health and economic
outcomes that we analyze. For each of the outcomes we list: (1) the outcome itself; (2)
the variable type—e.g., absorbing state, binary outcome, continuous outcome; (3) initial
health state occupancies and other outcomes— D̃0 in Equation (1); (4) lagged health-state
occupancies—D̃a−1 in Equation (1); (5) and (6) other health and economic outcomes used to
determine the outcome of interest—Wa in Equation (1); and (7) background variables—B
in Equation (1).

FAM belongs to one of the two general classes of forecasting models employed in health
economics: state-based models and potential impact fractions models.10 In particular, FAM
operationalizes state-dependency through a first-order Markov stochastic structure as in
Briggs et al. (2006). More complete models allow for complete history dependency like
time elapsed after first diagnosis. However, this history is scarce and difficult to include in
scenarios like ours, which is a general problem in the literature (Richardson et al., 2011).
Goldman et al. (2016) justify the modeling choices by appealing to research and the advice
of clinicians and other medical professionals. They also document that the FAM performs
well in fitting full population means of the forecasted outcomes. The first-order Markov
stochastic nature of the model is a main assumption and we test it below.

     Note: This table provides details on the empirical specification of Equation (1) for the different outcomes that we consider. Functional status
     describes the ability of an individual to perform normal activities to meet basic needs, fulfill usual roles in a job, and maintain normal health.
3.2    Simulating the Model


We estimate the parameters of the models in Equation (1) on a sample eligible for ABC/CARE.
With these estimates, we predict a future health trajectory for each ABC/CARE subject by
initializing it with the individual initial conditions. To match the biennial structure of the
Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) data used to estimate the models, the simulation
for predicting proceeds in two-year increments.11

Among the ABC/CARE subjects simulated in FAM, the years of completion of the age-30
interview range from 2003 to 2009. FAM’s two-year time step only allows the simulation of
even or odd years. For this reason, we run the simulation twice—once for the ABC/CARE
subjects entering in odd years and again for the ABC/CARE subjects entering in even years.

The simulation model uses assumptions regarding the normal retirement age, future im-
provements in mortality, and real medical cost growth as inputs. The normal retirement age
is assumed to be 67 for all ABC/CARE subjects.

The FAM mortality model represents mortality rates in 2009. The estimated mortality
probabilities are reduced in simulated future years to represent improvements in mortality
from sources such as medical innovation that are not included in the model. There are
different adjustment factors for populations under and over the age of 65. The mortality
reduction factors are taken from the intermediate cost mortality projections in the 2013
Social Security Trustee’s Report.




  11
    The end of each two-year step is designed to occur on July 1st to allow for easier matching with
population forecasts from the Social Security Administration (SSA).

3.3       Data Sources for Estimation and Simulation


FAM uses data from ABC/CARE surveys to set the initial conditions of the simulation
model. The state-occupancy model parameters are estimated using the 1997 to 2013 waves of
the PSID. We use the PSID because it is the longitudinal sample with the longest surveyed life
cycle measures. It has extensive information concerning demographics, economic outcomes,
health care access, health outcomes, and health behaviors (such as smoking history, alcohol
consumption, and exercise habits). We restrict the PSID to heads of households age 25
and older because these subjects respond to the most comprehensive questions. The FAM
forecasts of BMI are based on self-reported height and weight.12 In ABC/CARE, BMI is
measured as part of the mid-30s medical examination. Additionally, BMI is self-reported in
the PSID at age 30, while it is measured during the mid-30s for the ABC/CARE sample.
We supplement the PSID with the the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES), which has longitudinal measures and self reports of BMI, to predict BMI at
age 30 for the ABC/CARE individuals. Since the PSID does not follow individuals in
nursing homes or other long-term care facilities, we supplement the PSID with the HRS
when estimating mortality models. For the HRS, we use all cohorts in the dataset created
by RAND, version O. The NHANES includes both self-reported height and weight as well
as epidemiological measures of BMI, which is why it is employed for interpolating physical
measures from self-reported measures.




  12
       That is how it is reported in the PSID.

outcomes of ABC/CARE subjects. We restrict the PSID to heads of households aged 25 and older because
these subjects respond to the largest set of questions.

       Census data on Hispanics in North Carolina was not available for 1970 and 1980, but Hispanic migration into this state is more recent than in other
     regions, and as late as 1990, only 2% of the North Carolina poor were Hispanic (Johnson, 2003).
      Note: This table summarizes the models estimated in order to impute necessary outcomes in the FAM Model. ADLs include walking, dressing, eat-
     ing, bathing or showering, getting in and out of bed or a chair, and using the toilet, including getting to the toilet. IADLS include preparing meals;
     shopping for toiletries and medicine; managing money; using the phone; doing heavy housework; and doing light housework or housecleaning.
3.4     Specification Tests for the First-order Markov Assumption


The FAM model assumes that a vector first-order Markov process governs transitions with a
variable state space depending on the analyzed outcome. In Equation (1), only D̃a−1 and the
initial state value enter the model. For heart disease, hypertension, and stroke, we compare
the fit of Equation (1) with the following second-order model:




                                                          
               Ia,m = 1 D̃0 ≥ 0 Ωm + 1 D̃a−1 ≥ 0 Λm + D̃a−2 ≥ 0 Λ̃m

                     + Wa βm + Bαm + τa,m + εa,m .                                                     (2)



We use a likelihood ratio test to test the null hypothesis H0 : Λ̃m = 0 in Equation (2). Ta-
ble 6 show the results from these tests conducted on the samples used to make the forecasts
reported in this paper. For the health states analyzed, we do not reject the null hypoth-
esis. We do not perform these tests for lung disease, cancer, and diabetes because sample
limitations do not give us D̃a−2 for these diseases.

3.5       Inference


We study the life-cycle trajectories after age 30 for six chronic diseases and associated treat-
ment effects. This produces hundreds of age-wise treatment effects across diseases. Sum-
marizing these effects in an interpretable way is challenging. Following Garcı́a et al. (2018)
we construct combining functions that, within disease categories, count the proportion of
treatment effects that have the same sign. We generate standard errors for these counts.

Formally, consider a block of outcomes J` , ` ∈ {1, . . . , L}, with cardinality C` and associated
treatment effects ∆1 , . . . , ∆C` . For the case of diabetes, a block is a set of indicators of
prevalence of diabetes between ages 30 and 40, 30 and 50, 30 and 60, and 30 and 70. For
each of these blocks, we observe the prevalence of diabetes for each age. We construct similar
blocks with the rest of the chronic diseases.

Treatment effects, ∆j , can be either beneficial or detrimental. The interpretation placed on
the sign of the combining function is evident from the context. The count of positive-valued
treatment effects within block J` is


                                                  C
                                                  X̀
                                           D` =         1(∆j > 0).                                      (3)
                                                  j=1



We use the proportion of outcomes with ∆` > 0 as our combining function: D` /C` . Under
the null hypothesis of no treatment effect for the block of outcomes indexed by J` , and
assuming the validity of asymptotic approximations, the mean of D` /C` is centered at 21 .13
We compute the fraction D` /C` and the corresponding bootstrapped empirical distribution
to obtain a p-value. The bootstrap procedure accounts for dependence in unobservables
across outcomes (within blocks) in a general way.

       Campbell et al. (2014) establish the validity of asymptotic approximations for the ABC sample.

4    Empirical Results

We plot the probabilities of incidence of mortality and disease by 5-year bins from age 30
to 75 over the life-cycle for cancer, lung disease, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and
stroke. Disease incidence is defined as a diagnosis or death in order to account for disease-
free survival. We perform inference—at ages 40, 50, 60, and 70—on combining functions for
the various chronic diseases. The combining functions are the proportion of years starting
at age 30 which exhibit a positive treatment effect for each chronic disease. For example,
at age 40, the combining function for lung disease is the proportion of years with a positive
treatment effect on this chronic disease between ages 30 and 40. We calculate one-sided
p-values using 1,000 bootstrap samples of the FAM under the null hypothesis that D` /C`
is equal to 50%. If one were to plot the trajectories for all 1,000 bootstrap samples, the
p-value is the percentage of simulations where the majority of the control group trajectory
is above that of the treatment group. This choice of inference emphasizes the persistence
of treatment effects over the life-cycle as opposed to treatment effect magnitudes at a single
age. It detects a consistent life cycle pattern of beneficial outcomes. Life-cycle trajectories
are plotted by 5-year bins while inference is performed using blocks of annual data. This
can lead to slight discrepancies between the actual D` /C` and expected D` /C` based on the
smoothed plot. We also display bootstrapped standard errors for the 5-year bins.

The combining functions are statistically significant at standard levels for heart disease,
stroke, cancer, and mortality over most of the lifecycle for both genders. Females also
have statistically significant combining functions for diabetes up to age 50. For males,
diabetes is the only disease with adversely significant combining functions throughout the
life-cycle. An explanation for this is that prevalence of familial history suggests higher
genetic predisposition for diabetes for the male treatment group. This is the only family
history variable for which there is a difference between the treatment and control groups.


                                              19
Once we condition on family diabetes history, the adverse effect disappears. Treatment
improves the epidemiological assessments in Figure 1 that we use as the starting point for
our forecasts. Thus, the only reason the adverse effect of treatment on diabetes arises in the
longitudinal profiles is the initial difference in diabetes which continues through most of the
life cycle in the simulation.14 We discuss this further below. The program has a positive effect
on nondiabetic cardiovascular conditions that are mediated by the health improvements at
mid-30s, as shown by the epidemiological assessments in Figure 1.

We now describe the life-cycle trajectory for each chronic condition. There are statistically
significant empirical combining functions for males up to age 70 and over the entire life-
cycle for females in Figure 2. Female control and treatment incidence rates converge at
age 35, after which treatment group incidence rates remain slightly lower than those of the
control group. Near-zero p-values at all ages indicate a similar trend across all bootstraps.
Treatment-group males exhibit a lower incidence rate than control-group males until age 58.
There is a second crossover just after age 65, and both groups converge at age 75. Since age
is one of the biggest risk factors for cancer, it is unsurprising that the combining function
becomes insignificant at the end of the life-cycle.

There are no statistically significant combining functions for lung disease. See Figure 3.
However, life-cycle patterns differ noticeably by gender. Female treatment and control tra-
jectories closely mirror one another. After age 35, incidence rates for treatment-group males
are lower than those of control-group males by 15% to 20% throughout the life-cycle. Despite
the statistically insignificant combining functions for males, the trajectories in Figure 3 show
that the profiles for both the treatment and control groups are precisely estimated. A main
input (but not the sole input) that enters into our forecast of this chronic disease is smoking
behavior. In the control group, 89% of participants report they smoked during the last year

  14
     Health experts state diabetes and other heart conditions such as heart disease, stroke, and hypertension
share common risk factors. However, few genetic risk factors that co-modulate both conditions have been
identified thus far (Sousa et al., 2011).

Note: The figures plot the proportion of treatment and control subjects who either have the disease or die
over the life-cycle by 5-year bins. The individual-level 5-year bin takes the value 1 if an individual contracts
the disease or dies in any year during the 5-year window, and 0 otherwise. The profile in the figure plots the
treatment and control averages of the individual-level bins. We display the fraction of years from age 30 to
ages 40, 50, 60, and 70 with a positive treatment effect as well as standard errors. One-sided p-values are
calculated with a null hypothesis of 50% using 1000 bootstraps of the microsimulation, which we also use to
calculate standard errors. Combining functions are highly significant across the life-cycle for both genders.


                                                                                              21
during the mid-30s interview. In the treatment group, the analogous figure is 72%. The
treatment-control difference is statistically significant at the 10% level (see Figure 1).

Significantly more treatment-group males have a maternal history of diabetes.15 Scott et al.
(2007) and Zeggini et al. (2008) identify a heritability component to diabetes in addition to
environmental and behavioral factors.16 This suggests that males assigned to the treatment
group have a higher genetic predisposition to diabetes. Therefore, our estimation of the
life-cycle trajectories of diabetes accounts for familiar diabetes history, by conditioning on
mother, father, and siblings diabetes history.

There are statistically significant combining functions for females up to age 50 and perverse
and significant combining functions for males over the lifecycle in Figure 4. Treatment-group
females have lower incidence of diabetes from age 30 to 45, after which the female treatment
trajectory remains marginally higher than those of the control. Combining functions that are
statistically significant at ages 40 and 50 are insignificant at ages 60 and 70. Thus, there are
consistent early life-cycle treatment effects for females bootstrap samples. Beneficial effects
eventually emerge for males because the program improves several other health conditions,
despite the diabetes predisposition in the treatment group.

The combining functions for heart disease are highly significant up to age 60 for females and
over the entire life-cycle for males (Figure 5). Treatment-group females have consistently
lower incidence rates until age 50, after which their incidence rates are slightly higher than
that of control. Combining functions are statistically significant until age 60. Treatment-
group males have lower incidence rates than the control group over the life-cycle, and by a
wider margin than females. Though male incidence rates converge at age 65, treatment group

  15
       This can occur by chance even in a randomized control trial. 26% and 15% of treatment and control
males have a maternal history of diabetes, respectively. There is also one treatment male with a history of
paternal diabetes and one treatment male with a diabetic sibling.
    16
       Treatment subjects also have a high proportion of PMP-based diabetes by their midlife survey—17% of
treatment males and no control males. Sabatier et al. (2002) find that patients with type 1 diabetes, which
is genetically inherited, have elevated levels of PMP compared to type 2 diabetics.

Note: The figures plot the proportion of treatment and control subjects who either have the disease or die
over the life-cycle by 5-year bins. The individual-level 5-year bin takes the value 1 if an individual contracts
the disease or dies in any year during the 5-year window, and 0 otherwise. The profile in the figure plots the
treatment and control averages of the individual-level bins. We display the fraction of years from age 30 to
ages 40, 50, 60, and 70 with a positive treatment effect as well as standard errors. One-sided p-values are
calculated with a null hypothesis of 50% using 1000 bootstraps of the microsimulation, which we also use
to calculate standard errors. There are highly significant combining functions up to age 50 for females. The
initial conditions for forecasting account for familiar diabetes history, by conditioning on mother, father, and
siblings diabetes history

rates plateau at 50% while control group rates continue to increase. Combining functions
equal 100% for all ages and have high significance, indicating consistent trajectories across
bootstraps.

There are no statistically significant treatment effects for hypertension. The entire sample
is diagnosed by age 65 in Figure 6, which is likely a predisposition of the individuals in
the sample to contract this disease which the treatment fails to prevent. Treatment-group
females have slightly higher incidence rates until age 50, after which control-group females
have much higher incidence rates until age 65. There are perversely significant combining
functions at ages 40 and 50. They become insignificant after age 60. There is a similar
trend for males: treatment-group males have marginally higher incidence rates until age 40,
after which control-group males have much higher incidence rates before convergence at age
65. There is an adversely significant combining function at age 40, but the estimates are
statistically insignificant for the remainder of the life-cycle. Therefore, the difference in the
incidence of hypertension is insignificant in the long-run. This can be attributed to the fact
that almost the entire sample contracted hypertension by age 65. This is unsurprising given
that African-Americans have the highest rates of hypertension globally, with estimated rates
of 45.0% and 46.3% for adult African-American males and females, respectively, in 2011 to
2014 (Benjamin et al., 2017).

The combining functions for stroke are significant over the entire lifecycle for both genders
in Figure 7. Treatment-group females have slightly lower incidence rates than control-group
females throughout the entire life-cycle, in both the main simulation and all bootstrap sim-
ulations. All combining functions are at the 100% level and p-values are zero. Similarly,
treatment-group males have consistently lower incidence rates than the control group. There
are no cases of male stroke until age 40, after which treatment-group males have much lower
incidence rates until age 65. However, age 50 and 60 combining functions have large p-values,
implying larger mid-life variation in male stroke projection. The male treatment group rate

plateaus at 30% by age 65, while that of the male control group increases past 50%. The age-
70 combining function becomes significant. There are highly significant combining functions
for mortality across the entire life-cycle for both genders (see Figure 8).

There are no deaths until age 50 and 45 for females and males, respectively. The female
treatment group has a slightly lower mortality rate than the control group over the remainder
of the life-cycle. On the other hand, male mortality rates diverge over time between treatment
and control. Control males are nearly four times more likely to die than treatment males
by age 75. All combining functions are at the 100% level and have high levels of statistical
significance, indicating similar mortality trajectories across bootstrap simulations. Mortality
is an informative indicator of the aggregate effect on all of the health conditions. The
prevalence of each chronic disease increases the risk of mortality. The strength and precision
of the treatment-control difference across the life cycle, as well as the gender difference in
the treatment effects, summarize the results in this section.

We summarize the impact of ABC/CARE on life-cycle health using quality-adjusted life
years (QALYs). A QALY reweights a year of life to adjust it for disease burden. We assign
a value of $150,000 (2014 USD) to each year of life. A QALY of $150,000 denotes the
value of a year of life in the absence of disease (perfect health). The value of a QALY for
an individual in a given year is smaller than $150,000 when there is disease: worse health
conditions imply a lower quality of life. A QALY is zero at death. Table 7 presents the net
present value of treatment gains in QALYs based on predicted life-cycle health trajectories.
The program cost per child is $92,570 (2014 USD). Health benefits alone for treatment-
group males, which total $106,218 (2014 USD), exceed the cost of the entire program and
generate positive returns. By this measure alone, female health gains pay for nearly half of
the program cost.

Note: The figures plot the proportion of treatment and control subjects who either have the disease or die
over the life-cycle by 5-year bins. The individual-level 5-year bin takes the value 1 if an individual contracts
the disease or dies in any year during the 5-year window, and 0 otherwise. The profile in the figure plots the
treatment and control averages of the individual-level bins. We display the fraction of years from age 30 to
ages 40, 50, 60, and 70 with a positive treatment effect as well as standard errors. One-sided p-values are
calculated with a null hypothesis of 50% using 1000 bootstraps of the microsimulation, which we also use to
calculate standard errors. Combining functions are highly significant throughout the life-cycle for females,
and at the beginning and end of the life-cycle for males.

Note: This table presents two summaries of the life-cycle health impacts of ABC/CARE. The net present
value of the average gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the average gain in years lost due to
disease burden, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). For reference, the per-child average total cost of the
program is $92,570 (2014 USD).



An alternative measure that does not depend on arbitrary monetary values for life is disability-
adjusted life years (DALYs). QALYs are weighted monetary values, adjusted for disease
burden. DALYs are weighted years of life, adjusted for disease burden The fraction of the
year lost is summed across the life cycle to calculate the number of years lost due to disease
burden. A QALY is zero at death. A DALY is one at death. We calculate the average
gain in DALYs using a horizon of one hundred years of life. For men, almost four years of
life is lost due to disease burden. For females, the decrease in lifespan is more moderate.
Table 7 is consistent with our life-cycle predictions. We find a persistent life-cycle treatment
effect for the majority of chronic conditions in both genders. The magnitude of treatment
effects is larger for males in multiple disease outcomes across the life-cycle and, therefore,
the life-cycle gains in QALYs and DALYs are consistent with this finding.




5     Conclusion

A well-established literature documents that high-quality early education programs benefit
children in terms of test scores, schooling, crime, and adult earnings, especially those who
are disadvantaged (Cunha et al., 2006; Currie and Almond, 2011; Elango et al., 2016). This
evidence relies primarily on short-term gains on test scores or on adult outcomes such as
crime or labor income. This paper breaks new ground by looking at the lifetime post-
program benefits on health. There are substantial lifetime effects on many components of

                                                     31
health: cancer, heart disease, stroke, and mortality. Treatment effects are larger for males
consistent with previous findings in the literature (Elango et al., 2016).

The estimated treatment effects reported here are surprisingly large, especially because the
program did not target participant health, although it did subsidize visits to the doctors (but
not medications) for participants for the first year of the program. Besides providing early
health care, the program boosted cognitive and social skills which are known contributors to
lifetime health (see Borghans et al., 2008; Campbell et al., 2014). Elsewhere (Garcı́a et al.,
2020) we use these estimates as part of a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of the full range
of outcomes studied in the ABC experiment.
